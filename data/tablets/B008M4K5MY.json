{"Reviews": [{"Title": "THE Tablet for Students, but Great for All", "Author": "B. Price", "ReviewID": "R64CIHTVR0QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review updated 2/5/2013.  I ordered this tablet immediately when Amazon posted it with 1-day shipping and as of 7/20/2013 I haven't had any issues as a few users seem to have reported.  Don't get discouraged if you get a lemon; just return it for another - Amazon has free returns/replacements in such cases. * Hand Written Notes - S Notes - Exports to PDF and also JPG.  It has templates for various types of productivity.  My favorites are the ruled paper, the meeting template (date, time, attendees, meeting notes) and the recipe template (I can imagine this being very useful for the kitchen, propped up in a case). - Papyrus Beta - This free application is very nice and similar to S Note but has normal paper templates such as College Ruled, Wide Ruled, Narrow Ruled, Blank and 4 different Graph Paper types. - ezPDF - Costs $3 and is what you'll probably want to make annotations on lecture slides and whatnot. - MOST applications allow you to rest your palm on the tablet while writing, others are not as well written.  This all depends on the author of a specific app. - SOME applications have nice erasers.  Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.  This all depends on the author of a specific application. * Hand Writing Instead of Typing - The default keyboard has an option that lets you hand write in any input field instead of typing.  Long-press the settings (gear) button on the keyboard to select the T button which enables hand writing.  Please see the User Images of this product for a good example of this. * Multitasking (updated 2/5/2013) - Within the past week I've noticed a number of apps I use get multi-screen support so it's much less limited and a gimmick, now.  I can easily be taking notes on one half of the screen while browsing or chatting or whatever on the other half.  With more apps supporting the feature now it's a much larger factor in whether or not to buy. * GPS - Fast and accurate.  I am currently on the first floor of a two-story apartment building about ten feet away from the outer wall (sliding glass door) and Google Maps had my position within 40 meters almost instantly after turning on the GPS receiver.  Within 35ish seconds it had my position accurate to 10 meters. * S Pen - Comfortable to hold (I'm a 5'10\" tall guy and have normal sized hands).  There's an odd button on the side which adds extra functionality with certain gestures.  I have no idea how it works because I'm pretty sure the S Pen isn't powered in any way, but it's more than just a stylus. * Screen - Very sensitive.  I've been taking notes for half of my classes on my tablet and it works well.  I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life. * Battery - While leaving it on all the time, wifi off when not using it, I manage to only charge my Note 10.1 once a week.  Standard usage includes notes during seven hours of lecture each week and using it periodically throughout the day or in the evening. - To really stretch your battery life you'll need to disable some apps.  I disabled Google+ and some of the default/Samsung apps that come with the device in Settings->Application Manager.  As of 2/5/2013 I'm still getting ~7 days out of one charge with moderate usage. * Build Quality - Standard Samsung quality.  The case has a lot of plastic and the back gives a little if you push on it but it definitely feels solid.  Now that it's in a case the build quality doesn't matter any more. * Speed - Very smooth.  I updated about 10 apps at the same time in the market, an operation which would nearly cripple my Galaxy S until it was done, and I couldn't tell any difference in the smoothness of the Note 10.1.  While I was exploring I ended up having 15-20 applications open at the same time but again I couldn't tell any difference. - Coming from a Galaxy S phone and hardly ever using a tablet before, I'm amazed by how fast this thing boots/restarts. * Wifi - No complaints.  It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues. * Sound - Good, loud and scared my cat when I started something on Google Play.  She looked around like she does when our surround sound is on because she doesn't understand what was making such a noise.  I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon). * Rooting Friendly - Check out the forum for this tablet on xda developers for info.  This device already has developers that say they'll work on it and I'm sure more will sign up because the Note 10.1 stands out among the crowd. * Universal Remote / IR Blaster - Works well enough.  I'm going to sell my Logitech Harmony One universal remote because the Peel application works but could be nicer.  With my Harmony One I could set up custom activities like Listen to Radio on my Onkyo receiver but the Peel application only has standard actions like Watch Bluray.  I can still set it to play the radio but it's buried in the menus. - Great cable TV interface.  We don't watch/have cable, but if you tell it what service you have it'll tell you what is currently playing, what will be playing and provides customized content based on the preferences you specify.  It works with DVRs so I imagine you can manage all of that from the Peel application as well. * Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.  Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs. * The Wife - Now that I've set it up the way I like it she won't put it down.  You may not want your not-so-techie spouse to love it, but at least my wife won't be complaining that I spent $550 on it and then another nearly $100 on accessories =) * SwitchMe App - When set up properly, if your tablet is rooted, this free application will give your Android device multiple profiles.  Normally an Android device can only have one primary Google account to use with Google specific applications and whatnot, but this allows you to have separate profiles with separate accounts and separate applications.Note:  If you're going to use the SwitchMe app, DO NOT clone one profile to create another.  Just set up a completely new profile.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really like it", "Author": "Alex Alexzander", "ReviewID": "R1S7WZM8L3L8Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon. I ended up going to my local BestBuy to pick it up. The reviews online were mostly okay except for The Verge which said it was sluggish and basically was down beat on it.I decided to buy it and if I didn't like it I would be returning it. I picked it up around 5:30PM on the 16th of August which is the release date. The first thing I did was get rid of all the widgets that are on the home screens. I suspect those might slow it down. I kept only one widget which is the clock / weather widget. I then downloaded all my favorite apps and began to arrange and configure it the way I wanted it.It comes with Polaris Office, which is better than QuickOffice if you plan to create and edit word docs, Polaris is easier. To view documents and complex excel sheets I find QuickOffice often does the better job. I ed up keep both installed just in case.I installed 14 games on it. All of which perform very well. There are my favorites, like FieldRunners, and newer ones like Final Fantasy, Ski Safari, Nova 3, Osmos HD, Amazing Alex and Zynga poker that I also really like. This quad core eats through anything with ease.Got the latest Google Maps, which is so fantastic on this. You can save a Map so it's available without a data connection. Perfect for these WiFi devices. I'm a fan of the new Google Play movies, music, books and Magazines too. But if you prefer Amazon or Nook, those are available as always. It comes with the B&N; Nook Reader by default.There are Galaxy Note 10.1 specific apps like Adobe's PS Touch. I've been using Photoshop since 1996 so I am going to carefully review the built in lessons for PS Touch, a mobile version of Photoshop and see how far I can take that. If you are a subscriber to Adobe's Cloud services you're supposed to be able to edit a PSD with PS Touch, save it to the cloud, and then continue to edit it with Photoshop the desktop app.There is also S Note. S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen. This was a primary reason for me to be interested in this particular tablet. The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it. I didn't try to have it translated into actual text like type written text. I just left it as my handwriting. Really like it.Now this new Note 10.1 also has a new Muli-tasking feature. I should say that it doesn't multitask any app combo you want. Just a few apps blessed by Samsung which are: The base browser, not Chrome, their video player, Polaris Office, the picture gallery and their email app, not the GMail email app. Their email app can be used with POP, IMAP and Microsoft's Exchange via the built in Active Sync. So I tend to use that email client for work email and I use GMail as my personal email client.Now, according to The Verge, multitasking was horrible. Not so fast Verge. I don't know what you guys are doing but I multitask'd just about every way you can on this and it works surprising well. I wrote notes while playing video. I played video while scrolling up and down on a web page. I copied text from an email to S Note, which both apps loaded in the side by side both on the screen simultaneously method. I had no trouble at all.I bought Autodesk's Sketchpad Pro and can draw with that just fine. I also bought Adobe Ideas, but haven't yet played with that at all. Samsung also has their own kind of store and I am going to see if they have more S Pen specific apps. Really like the S Pen a lot. It's exactly like a typical Wacom Stylus. It's sharp, not that horrible eraser head large stylus you get stuck with if you want to use a stylus on the iPad. Although the iPad has Paper by 53, which I wish I had on here.I'm really just getting started. I'll have to update this review over the weekend. Only played with this new tab for about 4 to 6 hours now.Check out Google's Currents for news, and Pocket for saving articles for future reading. Both are great on this tablet. I think all the bases are covered with this tablet. Movies, games, magazines, office and productivity, art creation and editing. It does everything. And since it is Android, you have a real file system which makes email a breeze. Love this thing so far.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Samsung time now", "Author": "Jini Jazz", "ReviewID": "R20VE2KIIS83RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time Apple guy who currently owns 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 27 inch iMac, iPad3, & iPhone 4S. I stay with Apple products mainly because Mac does the best for what I do. However, I never have been 100% satisfied with iPhone & iPad due to their unnecessary restrictions and limitations. I just couldn't find alternatives - I love Android in terms of features and potential, but the execution(overall user experience) has been lagging.I guess that the time has come. Galaxy Note 10.1 made big step forward and turned the potential into reality. Just after 48 hours learning and playing around, I am convinced this is the device I want to use everyday. It is the first tablet that actually helps my productivity, no more frustration with restricted toy. So iPad goes to my mom now.I won't relist pros and cons, since all reviewers already listed them. But I just want to correct a few misconceptions that some biased online reviewers manufactured.1. Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it. Either they got the defect or it is downright lie. It feels solid and much better material for everyday use. Aluminum on my iPad may \"look\" better, but not practical without cover or case. I always had to use cover for my iPad to prevent scratches. But if you have to use case to cover, what's the point? It covers \"beautiful\" aluminum anyway. I don't even use cover/case for Galaxy Note and it feels just right in many hours use. Again, this two tone design(mine is white-silver) looks beautiful, very comfortable for many hours. This tablet is designed to work, not just look.2. Screen - screen resolution is one of the reasons I was hesitant to try Galaxy Note. All I can say is just go try it yourself. This screen is beautiful! Yes you heard this from the owner who use Retina Macbbok Pro and 27 iMac everyday. Do not fall into john doe's resolution comparison, just go check it yourself! Sure 1920 would be nice, but I'd take  Galaxy's 1280 with S-Pen any day.3. Some say it's expensive. Do you know how much it cost to buy wacom device with this size and feature alone?Most importantly, this tablet is so fast and responsive and delivers many things in my wish list \"today\". No more compromising and stuck with iPad. S-Pen, true multitasking (yes limited as of now, but it's already very powerful and useful), and microSD support (I feel like a prisoner who just escaped from Alcatraz!).  I suggest you to check this device yourself and never fall into some online reviews.Don't get me wrong. I still love Apple products and I will stay with Mac unless I see something better for my life and work. I just wanted to share my experience with Galaxy Note 10.1 because there are so many false reviews from Apple or Android fan boys and girls.*** I strongly recommend you to watch all SAMSUNGmobile's YouTube videos to utilize Galaxy to its full potential. You will see why I think no other tablets can even compete with Galaxy Note. ***One more thing...I know my next phone will be Samsung Galaxy Note II.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "In MY opinion, not worth the price over the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 Tablet", "Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R2O1SZ3MIKIGXW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!(added 12/7/2012) Pursuant to a few comments, I AGAIN tried an Asus TF700 and compared it SIDE BY SIDE with my Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet.  With the better processor, higher memory capacity and increased resolution, I GENUINELY hoped that the ASUS TF700 was worth the difference in price.  I was hoping that the first one I tried was an outlier.  SADLY, it was NOT.  For some unknown reason, the Asus TF700 is NOT compatible with Scrabble, a major reason for my tablet use (to keep in frequent touch with my daughter).  That, however, is minor and will probably be addressed in the future.  Again, side by side, the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet reported a STRONG wi-fi signal, the Asus TF700 reported only a GOOD signal.  While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.  I opened several apps, one at a time, simultaneously on BOTH tablets and examined them under exactly the same lighting and circumstances.  I WAS better able to read very fine print on the Asus (probably 4 point type, white against a dark background), otherwise, for all other apps, I saw NO significant difference between the two.  My opinion remains unchanged, SAVE your money and buy the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet unless you will use the stylus and autofocus rear camera of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE.  I believe that Asus must work out a lot of bugs in their infinity before it is worthwhile!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Note 10.1 Compendium", "Author": "Leonaitis", "ReviewID": "R2IQ2G580J1RI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brief intro:Here goes nothing. I took a while to publish this review because I wanted to try and experiment with my Note and to address all the pros and cons of the device that others have posted about. It would have been unfair if I had posted a glowing 5 star review after only owning it for one day. Likewise, it would not have been beneficial to anyone if I had just blasted the device without spending any time using it. I went ahead and tried to learn as much as I could about the Note once I got it. I tried every app, every function, every setting and accessory I could get my hands on. I tried to make notes of what others have said that they did not like about it. I wanted to see for myself if the problems they pointed out applied to me. I won't go into details about specs, or compare my Note to other devices. Sufficed to say, more than enough other people have posted such reviews. All I can say is that I have tried other tablets such as the iPad and even the Nexus 10 and I do not regret my purchase of my Note 10.1.Before you read any further, you should be aware of the learning curves of tablets in general and the Note 10.1 in particular.Learning Curves:Beginner - If you have never used a tablet device you will have a learning curve. You will need to learn how to maximize and minimize apps. You will need how to install apps and visit the app store. You will also have to realize that just because an app is bad, that does not mean the Note itself is at fault. Not every app maker takes the time to customize their products for every device and you need to be aware going in to this purchase that many apps are not maximized to work and be viewed perfectly on a tablet device. If you can handle the beginner learning curve, and teach yourself how to view Netflix and listen to music and play Angry Birds and you feel like your brain will explode from all the new things you had to learn, then you probably don't need a Note. If you don't want to do anything else beside these basic functions I would suggest you save some money and buy a Kindle Fire or a less expensive device. They will be more than powerful enough for what you need them to do. Don't get a Note and then complain it is over priced simply because you do not use it to its full potential.Advanced - If you learned all the basics about the Note, or have mastered these type of devices and are hungry for more, then get a Note. Keep in mind you will then have to spend more of your own precious free time to learn all the extra things this device can do. It will not magically do everything for you. Just because you get a Note does not mean you will magically be able to edit pictures in Photoshop or master handwriting tools and use the stylus by simply turning the device on. There is a steep learning curve and the manuals/tutorials included from Samsung are terribly bare. You will be left to your own to discover resources that help you take full advantage of your new device. Luckily for you, you can find tons of these resources out on the web!Here are a few of the pros and cons folks have posted about and what I found out.Pros (and some small concerns):-Auto rotate for most programs , Netflix, Internet, Facebook. Most apps will auto rotate for you. Great for when you want to view some websites or larger files in portrait mode. I noticed that some of the older apps do not auto rotate. Since I started using this a few have updated themselves and fixed the problem, but it varies by the app maker. I also noticed that a few of the newer apps that should rotate, did not. I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera. I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time. For the most part this only caused one minor annoyance since I have been using the Note. Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device. I can't then go ahead and place the device on my lap because I will pinch the charging cable. So I just have to make sure not to charge the device while I am using a few camera specific apps. Not really a big bother though.- Store maps for offline use! Great app feature, specially since you don't have to find WiFi signal or use your phone's hotspot to update the map on long trips.- Streams from my home media server and allows me to access all my movies and music from anywhere in the house. Even the backyard.- WiFi works fine. I have no problems logging into both 2.4 and 5 networks. Even at the slower speed I am able to stream videos from my media server and apps such as Netflix with no lag whatsoever. I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.- Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice. Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great. I know folks always want the greatest and latest but the cameras are more than ample enough for everyday use. The stock app is ok but I prefer to use one I got from the app store. More about this later.- TV remote works great. I am able to control not only my home TV and cable but also my folks TV and their satellite service from my tablet. Needless to say it took them a few visits until they realized I was the one messing with their channels and they were indeed not going crazy!- HDMI output works great but no subtitles! The HDMI out adapter is a bit confusing. You actually have to plug your wall charger into it then then to the TV and once that is done it works great! I am able to save some of my movie files on my Note for offline viewing on long trips and can then output the movie to an HDMI input on any TV. Works great. There is one drawback though and this seems to be universal across most tablet makers. If you are viewing a website and decide to export it to the TV for better viewing, the Note will not export any subtitles. You can see them just fine on the Note, but not on the TV. I have asked Samsung about this but not have had a definite reply yet. It should not matter if you don't use subtitles though.- Overall performace is great. I can open multiple apps, multi task items and even have a pop up video playing at the same time and have no performance issues. I did test out one of these Notes at an electronics retailer that had the old Android OS and it was not as fast as the one I got. The latest upgrade really helped performance. I have no complaints in this department.Cons:-Not all programs can be multitasked. Samsung is bringing out new software patch for phones that will allow multi task on all apps for their newer phones, maybe it will trickle down to the Note. However, I like the real estate on my Note. I am not sure how many items I would like opened at once.-If charging while using an app that doesn't auto rotate, charging cable sticks out the bottom. Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use. Most are free, some are not.- S Note exports to jpg and PDF file formats. However, the handwriting takes time to learn. I was having a rough time of it at first but then messed around with the stylus settings and sensitivity and can whip out notes of all kinds with no troubles. I also adore the S Note feature that ignores your hand if it accidentally touches the tablet surface when using the S pen. Otherwise, I would have smudges on every document I have writen so far. There is a small learning curve for this app. Do not despair.- PS Touch is awesome! Takes a larger than normal learning curve though. I found 2 great channels on Youtube where the users teach you various functions of this app step by step. It is great to sit in front of the TV and watch someone use the features of this app in real life while you practice on your Note and master them. If you use Photoshop on your PC then you will be glad to know the menus and options for this app are very similar to the PC versions so you are already ahead of the game. It is not a full blown version but pretty good nonetheless.- Dropbox is great for multiple devices. I have my phone, computers and Note linked to the same account. I like being able to take pictures on my phone and then being able to pull them up and edit them on my tablet. Once done I can toss them back and have access to them from any of my devices or PC's. Also great for moving files back and forth without having to plug my Note into my PC.- Amazon has two apps. One for their store and one for their apps. The regular Amazon app tracks your Amazon purchases and tracks packages, pretty neat if you use Amazon a lot. However,the Amazon App store offers free apps everyday. I have snagged several apps from this site for free and saved a few bucks from having to get them off the Google Play store. It uses your Amazon credentials so I like the fact that you don't have to enter additional financial info in order to pay for items from the Google Play Store. Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store. I have this app and log into it every day to see what goodies they are giving away. I don't like the fact it is not part of the main Amazon app but it is still great for getting free stuff!- Kindle book reader. Great for reading books, I love the settings and while I would not get a Note just for reading books, it is a great addition for an item I was already getting regardless.- Netflix works flawless. Also, if you have Netflix on an external device such as PS3, you can bring that up and log into Netflix on your Note and you can acutally use it as a remote and control your Netflix through your Note. Handy little trick that was added to android devices recently.- Pocket Cloud is used for VPN connections. I am not sure if most folks would use the VPN feature on the Note but I use it to connect to my work on the weekends sometimes. I then fire up Pocket Cloud and bam! I am logged into my workstation back at my work desk and can access and run everything just as if I was sitting at my desk.- SuperGNES. Yea, what can I say. A free SNES player that allows me to download free ROMS and play some Zelda to unwind once in a while. Purely for nostalgia purposes though.- Skype I use mainly to call overseas and to have my mom do video chatting with her grandkids up in Ohio. They love it and it works great. Even better since it is free.- Video Player that comes with it by default is pretty nice. Plays multiple video formats and is able to pick up my home media servers and stream from them.- Youtube is a great tool to use. I love to have it up and running and be able to control it from my couch. Yes, like the Netflix app, android users can log into youtube from your device and control playback as well as manage lists and favorites and other preferences. I love it because when you have to search for items it is way easier to type into the Note than trying to navigate through the bulky and not very user friendly text input of my media devices.- ezPDF Reader is better than just about every other PDF app I tested. Amazon has given this one away for free before on their APP store so keep an eye out. It lets you add notes and tons of other features to your PDF files. Works with the S Pen.- Camera Zoom FX is a step up from the built in camera app included with your Note. It has some handy camera features and filters that are not included natively on your Note and too much of a pain to apply to your pictures once they have been taken. This app does it while taking the shots. Great time saver.Notes: Some observations I have made.- Some apps dont work as well as the full website, it is best to just go to the full website instead. This is for android apps in general, not just on the Note.  However, some sites force you into a 'mobile view'. They look pretty horrible and are pretty useless. Make sure you force your Note browser into 'desktop view' and you will be able to view the full site and use all features on it just fine.- Battery charge. I used it regularly to access web, Skype, few apps and some note writing using the S pen as well as messing around with some videos and pictures. I could go about 3 days or so before I realized I needed to charge the unit. Overall not too bad for what I was making it do. I went ahead and tested it over a few weekends of heavy use to see how it handled the load. I opened videos, web, several apps I did not need and multi tasked to my hearts content. Using this heavy load I was able to run the battery down in about 8 hours. Your charges may vary, but I was overdoing it to test it for myself. As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging. So yes, you can fully charge it while using it. Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer. You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note. You will need a direct connection to a wall outlet.Accessories:- Screen protector and a tablet leather case are a must. You need to keep this baby safe. I tried many cases and screen protectors before I settled on mine. HDMI out works nice. Just make sure you plug it in properly. Car adapter can come in handy. However, I had a bit of misfortune on the first one I purchased. Aside from that it works well.  The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet. Get a larger one for charging and use the small one for Note to PC transfers.*** Special Note***SD cards! I was at the Samsung site yesterday and someone asked the maximum size of the SD cards that can be used with the Note 10.1. The Samsung rep answered \"32GB\". This is wrong. I am running a 64GB card and it works great. I have more than one and have the extra ones filled with movies for long boring trips. Since the latest Android update these cards are automatically found by your Note 10.1. Prior to this update you had to go through a painful process of formatting 32Gb and 64GB cards to get them to properly show up. I think that is why Samsung kept folks from trying out the 64GB cards. They work fine! Make sure you get the right ones though and be careful with the hassle free packaging ones offered by Amazon. Buy the retails ones instead.I have written reviews on the types of accessories I ended up purchasing. I did much research on all of them. One thing I suggest you do is to be careful about your vendor. I had no problems with any of my accessories except one. The rest work great and are Samsung brand items. If you are worried about getting some of the accessories here, go to the Samsung site and register your product. After a few days they will send you a complimentary loyalty coupon that gives you 50% any and every accessory for your Note. (At least they did for me) It is a one time deal though. This makes the prices much more compatible with Amazon and takes the worry out of getting the right item that will work. I have only had one small problem with an Amazon item and I have been shopping from this site for many years. I find Amazon to be very dependable. Please read the reviews (good and bad) on every item in order to make an informed decision.Response to other reviews:Here are some notes I added to address the concerns others had when they reviewed their Notes.-KIES - I am not sure what to make of this. Folks complain about this sayging it doesn't work, while others say it works fine. I use it on my S III, a few PC's and my Note and have no issues. I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed. I have no issues.-Saumsung is slow to push updates. I have heard this complaint many times. I would have to say I agree with this comment. Samsung is one of the slowest companies when it comes to pushing updates. They could easily just push out the latest Android builds after a few tweaks but noooooooo, not Samsung. They take forever to push these out. However, once they do push them out they add so many extra features than just the stock Android builds! My last phone update took a bit to get here but it improved battery life immensely and added a few tweaks that made the phone even better. The last update for the Note improved performance all around, as well as battery life and many added new features for free. Also improved SD card compatibility. I can hardly wait for their next update which has even more features in store! Oh wait, I can wait, because I have no other choice. They are are slow...- It is hard to bring up apps from background? Tap the app button and the list comes up much like task manager. You can then bring up any previously opened app. It is located right next to the home button. What is so hard about that? Want to turn off apps? Open the App widget and tap away at what you want to turn off. I run my Note with tons of items running all over the place nad it doesn't affect battery life much. I am not sure why some folks are bothered by this but in my extensive testing I didnt find any unused open apps affected my battery life or charge times.- S Note has a small space to write in. You can't fit that much on a page? Some have said this, but it  scrolls down fine for me. I am able to use all the functions. It did take me a while to practice and get used to how it works though. It works fine for me now that I practiced. However, I had no idea what I was doing the first time. It is a learning curve and I think folks expect it to work like other programs they have tried before?- Folks have said their passwords are saved in the browser. Once I changed the settings it never saved them for me. So I was unable to replicate this issue.- The learning curve can be steep for some items. Hard to find tutorials or guides. I have to agree with this comment. Manuals and guides are virtually non-existent for the Note and the built in apps. However, with a little bit of searching you can find them online. The best so far have been the dozens of you tube channels on every app that I have looked for. It takes some effort to get started though. They will not be hand delivered to you.-Flash upgrade! Many folks complain about the lack of Flash on your Note. This was a decision made by Adobe. They are getting away from all Flash development for mobile devices. Flash was too buggy and caused performance issues so Adobe just decided to stop supporting it and move on to HTML5. It pains me to see how many people post and blast Samsung for this. It was not a Samsung decision. With that said, if you go to the Adobe site and look up the archived Adobe files section, you will be able to download and install Flash 4.x for your Note that works just fine with every website I have been to so far.I love my Note. I would not get one for my mom. It is more than she needs. I would get her a Kindle. It doesn't mean I don't love her.:)Make sure you do your research!If you have any questions about anything leave a comment and I will try to answer if I can.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My 8th Tablet and My Favorite by Far", "Author": "Carol A. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3N98LP74WTNLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after 2 months:UPDATE after 4 months:Samsung is releasing whole new software suite, see comments for link,10 minute video of all the new stuff.I have mostly positive things to say. I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all. Only with the poorest of feeds will the display show up as fuzzy. The speaker stereo separation is fantastic. I didn't really notice until I played an audio book and heard how noticeable the separation actually was. I added while docked, each of my 5 different portable speakers to the back of the dock and the tablet speakers sounded better.Cons: I noticed that when using the Chrome browser, that with too many tabs open, like over 12, the cut and paste quite working and the browser froze. This forced a total reset. I finally exchanged the tablet. Same problem again. So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then. So not the tablet per say, but it and chrome just don't play nice when used so heavily. With the included tablet browser, after too many open tabs, a warning notice comes up and instructs to close a tab before opening another. That's it. Love Love Love this tablet, a lot to learn but worth the price of admission imho.I have been addicted to tablets for a couple of years now. I have stayed away from Apple products for personal reasons. So Android at this time is the best bet for me. I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time. The ones that might, cost over $1200 or more. I spend at least 6 hours a day on a tablet. I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet. I still have 4 Androids.I started with a $149 K-Mart tablet and went all the way to the $600 Asus Infinity TF700T.Asus TF700T, I know the Asus TF700 is a great tablet. I bought the only one on Amazon that was defective.No choice but to return. I just have bad luck sometimes. But it turned out OK in the end. I was able to wait for this one.I have a Galaxy Note i717 5.3\" cell phone and I love it, they call it the \"phablet \"but really it is too small for a tablet and more a supersized phone. But I love the display and the S Pen. So after watching MobileTechReviews, You Tube, of Lisa showing all the features of this tablet and her doing a smack down, with this tablet and the Asus TF700 Infinity, I made the decision to buy this one.I am very happy I did.***Full Samsung video review, live links are not permitted in reviews. So to see them, click on add comments below.The first one shows the videos.Pros: 1) It shares speed honors for all Android tablet with the Asus TF700 they are too close to call. Each winning battles back and forth for sheer power and speed.2)It has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time. Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen. No other tablet can do that.3)It has a very strong WiFi modem, it pulls in signal my other tablets don't.Nice Nice Nice.4)It is one of the few tablets that pulls Wifi from both the 2.4 and the 5 bands. Exceptional.5) The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input. I think because of the S Pen's needs for sensitive touch of over 1,000 ranges. I mean this touchscreen is the best I have ever used or touched.It tracks you finger movement extremely tightly.No noticeably lag, it is like the item you are moving is stuck to your finger. Most if not all Android tablets have some lag. So good job Samsung on that.6) It has picture in picture video. You can run a movie on any screen and your can move the movie box around any where on your display surface. You can re-size it if it gets in the way. The display has settings like a TV or monitor, you adjust the color and tone.7) It has a feature called Smart Stay, which is basicly a little eye that watches your eye. If you fall asleep watching a video, it shuts off. In the morning it has your place saved in the video where it shut off at. Nice feature for me.8) It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB. Ipad and Nexus 7 don't support any on board.9) It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10) It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.11) The software is unique to this tablet only, meaning you can do things on this tablet no other tablet can do. There are some others, older, that have some features similar but not close to this guy.12) It will convert your printing or hand writing into text. It plots and solves equations.13) It will convert your hand drawn circles and squares to proper ones, making your look good. It just has too many features to list with the S Pen.14) It comes with PhotoShop software and the only limit is your imagination.15) It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16) It comes in White and it is lite and attractive and with 2GBs of Ram and a 1.4 Samsung Quad Core, it is one of the fastest tablets on the market and only $499..Compare to the Excite 7.7 and it is easy to see the value.17) It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters. Not expensive at all.18) It has a real GPS. Works without WiFi. Blue Tooth and so much more...19) It has too many Pros to list, really, I only scratched the surface. Oh, it is also an IR remote control for you home TV system, even controls cable or Direct TV, it learns your favorite shows and suggests them to you. Too much, for sure...love it...Oh, and if you have other Samsung products, like a Galaxy S 3, it talks to them as well with All Share...neat...it also has a very deluxe battery monitor system that has 4 sections with lots of graphs and setting and over heat warnings to get extra months of battery life.I later watched a Samsung 10 minute and he showed multi-tasking up to 5 functions at once. Email and Polaris on the 2 split screens,then adding picture in picture video on top of those two adding the calculator and another pop up screen, over the 4 programs already opens. 5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.VersusCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings. So no, it doesn't have Retina, but it does just fine without it. Since not many apps support those hi resolution displays anyway. It could not be priced at $499 if it had all it has, plus the over the top display. This one is just fine, and I am fussy. Speaking of fussy, since I do go back and forth with multiple tablets, the two things that keep this tablet from being 100% perfect for me are simple. The blacks are fine but could be deeper. The whites are fine but could be whiter. While using this tablet I don't notice this. When I switch back to another of my tablets, I am reminded of this fact.However,once I pick up this tablet, I forget all about it and just enjoy it for all it's features.2) This is not an iPad, so it takes some effort to get the most out of it, so expect a learning curve for the S Pen, but it can be used as a basic Android tablet if you want to GROW into it. If you are a person with no computer skills, it may be a bit much for you. Then again, you can just use what you understand. Emails, videos, Facebook, Web Browsing, and you can have a lot of fun playing with the pen3) Double edge sword, the good it will fully charge on a 5v source like a USB port or 5v power block, the bad is it takes up to 5 hours to charge. So best to charge at night. In contrast my Asus charges in 2 hour 15 minutes but on 5v and turned off, it will only charge 50% all night because it's wall charger is 12-15v.4) The biggest CON is it took so long to get here.....Signed Happy New Owner...Cheers", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Initial Impressions", "Author": "DaveC2000 \"davec2000\"", "ReviewID": "R1MMH3VSUXV7N9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been. I really don't see a ton of value in the S-Pen YET, but hopefully this feature will evolve and become a key strength.General touch responsiveness - GOOD - scrolling home screens is much more responsive than the Galaxy Tab 2, very close to the responsiveness of the Transformer Prime.Web Surfing - VERY GOOD - Page loads are very fast, much faster than the Galaxy Tab 2, very similar to ipad2 speeds. Scrolling is fast.Screen - FAIRLY GOOD - Same screen as Galaxy Tab 2. Similar to ipad 2. Not as nice as the new higher resolution tablets.I/O Performance - GREAT - RL Benchmark of 21 seconds... blows the doors off of ASUS & Nexus 7.The Pen - UNDECIDED - For taking notes with OCR the S Note app does not seem like it will be able to keep up with a keyboard and Evernote. The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time. Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.Gaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great. HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.Compass - Worked great. Seems very accurate.WiFi - Seems to have strong reception and fast throughput throughout the house.GPS - Strong reception, quickly got accuracy to 20 feet indoors.Sound Quality - VERY GOOD - The front speakers are really nice for a tablet. You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises. Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet not because of S-pen nor multitask (compared to transformer infinity)", "Author": "HoushaSen", "ReviewID": "RKIOCBP4HWGMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "============= Updates ================9/15/2012Final Decision - I ended up choosing Infinity.  Please see updated conclusion section. Also updated Battery section to Tie because I finally got transformer dock and had to change my mind of what I said before.9/3/2012Week 2 update1. S-pen - So I still don't use this feature, but just for fun I tried.  Quickly, this is the closest to paper as it can get.  See the updated section of \"handwriting\".2. Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3. Future Potential - During IFA Berlin, Samsung announced the Jellybean update on the Galaxy Note 10.1 is coming \"very soon (changed from this year).\" & showed many cool features of upcoming Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device features, which most likely be included in the Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  See Future potential section for detail.8/24/2012After one full week of use, here is quick update.1. Stability - The stability of this system is amazing.  I had only a single crush of stock browser, which at this point could even be my error of clicking pushing button by accident.  Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.  So this is actually the most stable tablet/system I have ever used.2. Lack of HD Screen - After 1 week of use, I had hoped that I would forget about my experience with HD Screen on Transformer Infinity.  Unfortunately this isn't the case. Whenever I browse and open a web page, I simply have to zoom in to be able really read things, which again wasn't the case with HD screen.  So yes. it is really noticeable.At this point, I can say basically Galaxy Note 10.1 is pretty much superior to transformer infinity in every aspect except HD screen.  However, the screen is one of the major point so the choice still remains to be a bit hard.  But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.============= Vs. Upcoming Windows 8 Tablets ============I was actually hoping with IFA, at least one of windows 8 tablet announced be my dream system i.e. customizability & flexibility of android, solid 8+ hours battery life, portability, stability, speed and full HD screen.In short, no system met this criteria.  The major systems are ASUS Vivo series and Samsung ativ series.  Among these, only Samsung Ativ Smart Pro is the only one has full HD screen that Galaxy Note 10.1 lacks. However, this system like other full Windows 8 edition tablets are much heavier, battery life is mere 5 hours DVD play time, and price is over $1100.Other tablets that are portable, and has good battery life are usually Windows RT versions.  Given how stable Android OS on Galaxy Note 10.1, stability is no longer comparison point.  Just like iOS vs. Android, it becomes applications.  Windows RT edition only runs Metro specific applications.  Though they will certainly grow, it will likely to take sometime.  Given the rapid change in the technology, if you decide to buy a system with a hope that the application will come, you may end up not enjoying your system as by the time applications flourish on the metro market, there may be better spec systems with cheaper price.  Furthermore, it appears no Windows RT based system have stylus support.So in conclusion, though windows 8 tablet are not inferior by any means, there is no upcoming windows 8 tablet at this point can say \"absolutely better\" than the Galaxy Note 10.1 or even Transformer Infinity.  Both tablet have still their own places and target audiences.============= Original Review Below =====================Quick background of myself, I had recently purchased transformer infinity as upgrade from my ipad 2, and Samsung galaxy 10.1 4G.  It was a great tablet of its own, but had couple major negatives for the purpose of my use.  So I had to seek for alternative.  Given my relative unhappiness with Galaxy 10.1 original and 4G, I was a bit skeptical about Galaxy Note 10.1 but decided to give a chance.  The result after 3 days of use is \"amazing.\"  This should be the flagship/standard of Android tablet.In the review of Transformer infinity, I have discussed about iOS ecosystem vs. Android ecosystem.  In here, I am actually going to focus on comparing to the transformer infinity, which is by many major review sites rated as the best android tablet.  And I see several people are considering this vs. the infinity.WARNING: Do not trust some reviews you read on the websites.  I just do not experience/see the issues what some reviewers are saying.============  Summary ===============Compared to transformer infinityStrength+Stability+Speed+Audio/SpeakerWeakness-No HD screen-Samsung's very slow software update-UITie*Battery Life*Build Quality*Overall hardware spec*Future potentialNote: I did not mention S-pen nor multitasking here because I personally don't use S-pen, and multitasking is good but you can do pretty much the same with applications on the market on any android device.Conclusion:Do you want android tablet?Are you ok with not having HD display?Can you afford the price?If yes to all three, then this is the tablet to get.===========  Detail Review ================1. StabilityThis is in fact the biggest selling point of this tablet.  I was always under the impression that by choosing Android ecosystem over the iOS, one thing we have to give up is the stability.  So when I initially got the infinity, I had a hope but the hope of stability quickly went away.  Browser crushed/froze every hour or so.  Other applications also froze and crushed.  In android world, I guess it's called application not responding (ANR) error.  I don't think infinity had any more of ANR than the my old Galaxy 10.1 but definitely did not seem less.To my surprise, Galaxy Note 10.1 is actually extremely stable.  In fact, I have used so far approximately 20-30 hours and have not encountered a single ANR nor crush.  Having stable Android system is just an amazing.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.12. ScreenIf you have never used HD display tablet such as New Ipad, transformer Infinity or ACER Iconia A700, you would probably not notice.  But after using them for awhile, the sharpness of text produced by these high definition screen are certainly noticeable.  With infinity, i can load a page and without zooming in, I can basically read entire page because resolution is so good.  But with Galaxy Note, everything look somewhat blurry so I have to zoom in to really read.This is a huge disadvantage of Galaxy Note. And perhaps, the reason why every other aspect on Galaxy Note is better than Infinity because it does not have to drive HD.  If you need HD screen android tablet, you have to go with transformer infinity.  Even there is not much HD specific applications right now, you will notice the difference on every day use.Winner: Transformer Infinity3. SpeedAfter doing some custom tweek on my infinity, browsing on infinity became much faster (at least so it seemed).  When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.  I tested this by simply going to the same site at same time for couple pages.  But after couple hours of use, infinity browser always seemed to slow down or crush.  This does not depend on which browser I used stock, chrome, opera, firefox beta, dolphin beta etc.  The benchmark sort of show this.  Sunspider benchmark of infinity was decently fast so browser should be fast, which again it was when working.  But Galaxy Note 10.1's sunspider result is simply in another dimension.  It's even faster than new iPad.  Since stock is so well on the Galaxy Note, I have not really tried much else on galaxy note.Another example is I use Mantano Reader for my ebook reading. With infinity, I could not open couple files.  One was 50MB, the other was 400MB.  It simply took forever and gave me ANR.  If lucky and got it working after awhile, it only showed couple pages and then crush.  I sent email to Mantano asking for fix as I could not believe with such high spec on the Infinity can be an issue.  In fact, some files larger than 50MB opened fine on the Mantano.  Furthermore, other PDF applications such as Repligo, Adobe Reader opened these files fine as well.  So I had good reasons to blame on application itself.  But the same file opens instantaneously on Galaxy Note  and obviously no crush or ANR.So despite infinity being fast system on its own, I have to give this one also to Galaxy Note.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.14. Audio/SpeakerSpeaker on the infinity was simply a weakness.  So any system can win over this.  I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.  With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.  This was different from any other tablet I owned.  Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.  It is what I expected.With infinity I had issue on listening to video file that was on the microsd using headset.  Every minute or two, I hear small but definitely noticeable \"beep beep.\" This was fixed by copying files locally to the device. But this sort of defeats the purpose of microsd...  This issue is not there with Galaxy Note.  So I can keep video files on microsd.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.15. Software UpdateNo one can beat ASUS.  Their reputation on the software update is the best of all android tablet maker.  In fact, they have already released jelly bean on one of transformer line.  So it probably won't be too long for infinity either.  This will for surely be true for OS after jellybean as well.  In addition, Nexus 7 is made by ASUS and has very similar specification to transformer prime, so future proof in terms of software update on infinity is the best on the market.In comparison, Samsung is one of the worst in terms of software update.  One main reason is that they make their own touch wiz customization.  The original samsung galaxy 10.1 just recently got ice cream sandwich.  Samsung announced that Galaxy Note will be getting Jellybean by end of the year, so we will get it but I don't count on the time.  As far as the OS after Jellybean, who knows we may get it but that would be even further down the road and it may even become irrelevant at the point.Winner: Transformer InfinityHowever, there is a catch on this.  If the actual software is working perfectly, do we really need/care newer OS?  I was looking forward to Jellybean when I had infinity because I thought it would make the system faster, and possibly more stable.  However, Galaxy Note is already extremely fast, and perfect stability.  So I am not sure if I am much to look forward to in Jellybean.6. User InterfaceTransformer Infinity uses near stock interface.  Their widgets are very clean.  I loved their transparent weather, and date widget.  Touch Wiz on the other hand, I don't think as pretty.  Samsung Weather widget just don't fit well. This may be personal preference though.Winner: Transformer Infinity7. Build QualityThe actual external appearance of the tablet goes to infinity.  The metallic Zen design is really great.  It does look like expensive tablet.  On the other hand, Samsung has plastic and I even had my port plastic broken one time on my Galaxy 10.1 4G. Clearly, it is not common place for accidental damage as it is simply so hard to break the piece by intention.  But Samsung totally refused to fix it and asked for $100 to fix this even though I only had the tablet for 5 months.  So I am skeptical for the durability of plastic tablet.However, quality assurance seems better on Samsung. I had to try two Infinity.  Both had light bleed, one had loose screen i.e. I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).  According to XDA forum, this was very prevalent issue and pretty much most people had one or other.  Galaxy Note I have none of these, and seemed like forum is also pointing to the same direction with very minimal complain on these matters.Winner: Tie8. Battery LifeThis is one feature I could not tolerate initially with infinity.  It lasted 5 hours if I use browser.  If I play game, it lasted only 3 hours.  Watching video or reading ebook without any browsing is the only way to get close to 9.5 hours documented on the specification.  But in reality, I always surf net, so generally I could never get more than 6 hours from 100% full charge.  Galaxy Note's battery life is amazing.  Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.  Second time 9 hours of screen time including 2 hours of gaming, 3 hours of constant almost pure browsing, 2+ hours of local video, and rest are ebook reading, I still have 30% battery left.  This will undoubtedly gives me 10+ hours of browsing time.  In fact, I am guessing this can even give 12+ hours easily unless I play game.  Even with gaming probably 8-9 hours.Some review claims battery hours on this much shorter, or even compatible to infinity.  My guess on this is they only either compared video play not included browsing but even then the number won't much.  So most likely explanation is they used 3G version of Galaxy Note 10.1.In any event, battery life on Galaxy Note is simply amazing.  When comparing tablet to tablet, without a question Galaxy Note is better.  However, this becomes a bit more complicated with Infinity's selling feature which is extra battery containing docking station.  I did not realize the power of docking station until I actually purchased one.  But if I do not want to carry around extra-weight, I can simply think the docking station as a battery charger.  I can do something like use as tablet at work, then connect to dock when get a chance/want to use as laptop/watch video.  Even while I use the tablet recharges from the dock's battery.  As I drive back, the tablet continues recharge from the dock.  So by the time I go back home, I am ready to use the tablet for night time reading.  All I need is recharge the dock and essentially I can completely eliminate the time to wait for tablet getting charged though with Galaxy Note's extra long battery life, this may not be frequent issue.Winner: Tie9. Overall Hardware SpecificationThis is technical aspect.  No matter what the specification is, in the end user experience is everything; however, hardware spec can definitely affect the experience.  Generally speaking two are similar with one better on one regard but other on the other.CPU: Tie - Atuntu scores are basically the same.GPU: Samsung Galaxy Note - Galaxy Note has the best GPU in any of Android tablet on the market right now.  Still not up to the level of the new Ipad.  Given it has to push less pixels compared to infinity, stronger GPU further makes difference.  Having said this, I don't think there is any application on android market currently that pushes to their graphical limit.  So not sure if extra GPU power make much difference.I/O: Samsung Galaxy Note - Supposedly I/O issue has been discussed on transformer series before infinity.  But infinity still has it. It had improved with the latest firmware, but not solved.  There is speculation that this is indeed hardware level of issue i.e. can go only so much.  The speculation is coming from XDA developer who tested running things off of highspeed SD card gave much boost in the function when compared to local storage i.e. Flash storage is the conundrum.  This is reflected on the benchmark.  The infinity had RL benchmark score of 80-90's with the latest firmware (originally like 120's).  Galaxy Note has 20's. This actually does affect daily use as you save file, access file all requires reading and writing from flash drive.  Obviously, infinity is not 4 times slower than Galaxy Note but this may be reason why my PDF file opened fine on Mantano with Galaxy Note but not on Infinity.Memory: Samsung Galaxy Note - 2GB.  Since most tablet still has 1GB memory, we won't likely to see anything that require 2GB memory for awhile.  So it is only helpful when opening multiple applications i.e. you may be able to cache more application than before but otherwise, I am not sure if this helps much.Screen: Transformer Infinity - See above.In any event, both hardwares are the best in the market right now.  If these two system cannot handle any more update, application etc. then pretty much nothing else on the market can handle them any more either.  So as far as hardware goes, both are relatively future proof.10. Future PotentialASUS, the maker of Infinity, makes Nexus 7 and again it has similar spec as the infinity's ancestor transformer prime.  So it should have good support from Google as well as future application makers. Furthermore, recently ASUS became of the playstation partner.  So you will likely to see playstation games on it.Galaxy Note 10.1 on the other hand is made by Samsung, who makes one of the most popular smartphone Samsung Galaxy Series.  Since Galaxy Note and SIII etc. uses Exynos CPU design and the number of unit sold are so high, android software developers will/should continue support them and hence, also supporting Galaxy Note 10.1.Update (9/3):  Samsung just recently announced it is bringing Jellybean to Galaxy Note 10.1 \"very soon.\"  No solid time here, but compared to \"this year\", this sounds much more imminent.  Only the time will tell, but it would be interesting how quickly Samsung can make the update to change its reputation here.More interestingly, Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device was just recently officially announced by Samsung.  This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.  So new features coming to the Galaxy Note 2 is highly likely to be added to Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  If you are interested in seeing what these features are, search for [GALAXY Note II] First Hands-on Video by Samsung on Youtube.  These features appear very unique (at least to me).Winner: Tie11. HandwritingFor those of you who thinks S-pen is just another stylus, it is not.  You can never write as small on iPad, or Infinity because simply technology is different.  So those who wants to have closest to the real pen and paper experience, you need inductive pen device like Galaxy Note.Updated 9/3/2012Coming from the background of looking into tablet PC when still relatively new (back windows XP era), one thing I can say to test whether stylus/pen on screen truly work or not is write as small as you can and see if the tablet can recognize your writing.  The conventional touch screen tablet like iPad, most of android tablet including transformer infinity, you will quickly notice the smallest you can write is not so small.  You have some applications to convert your bigger drawn handwriting into smaller text, but it certainly is not same experience as you were to write on the paper.Since I had time with this tablet, I had a chance to try this.  Well, the smallest the tablet recognizes is the smallest I can write.  So in this sense, Samsung did phenomenal job.  Perhaps, this may be the reason why they could not include full HD screen.Winner: Galaxy Note==============  Other less important features =================Other things that I personally don't think much important are followings:1. Split ScreenThere are many applications on the Google Play that already allows you to watch video, browse web, take note etc. while opening other window.  So it is nice to include as a free feature and emphasize such feature exist, but Galaxy Note's built in applications are limited to certain applications.  For instance, I cannot use built in browser to watch flash movie while I read ebook.  However, if I buy overskreen I can do that.  And overskreen is supported on transformer infinity as well.  So I don't think split screen should be decision maker for anyone.2. Keyboard dockThis is mainly the feature of transformer series.  But samsung does make keyboard dock.  Galaxy Note 10.1 version is not out yet, but it is in process.  The difference is that Galaxy Note one (probably) won't have extra battery.  But I don't think it needs that as by tablet alone it can last so long and probably even longer than Infinity with dock.  Form factor goes to the transformer as it attaches and closes like laptop.  My personal opinion about this is, it doesn't really make difference.  If I need keyboard I can still carry it.  The total weight is the same. So another factor, I don't think should be decision maker.=============== Conclusion ==================Update 9/15/2012Galaxy Note 10.1 is phenomenal device with its stability, speed, and extra function of S-pen.Galaxy Note and Transformer Infinity are definitely two of the best Android tablet on the market at this time.  Though all the major reviews only giving credit to Infinity, if you use Galaxy Note 10.1 you will know its power, speed and stability, which are even better than that of Infinity.  However, I have ended up choosing transformer infinity.  Because even when Galaxy Note is superior in pretty much every other aspect to Infinity except the screen, the full HD screen turned out to be such an major feature that infinity has(=note lacks).  I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.  Basically, every second that I look at screen for these tasks I noticed the difference in screen resolution.  Though not to the level of the Note, with tweaks I got my infinity browsing speed faster, and system more stable. After these tweaks, these difference are only wastes several minutes a day of my time in the end i.e. accumulation of 10 seconds difference in loading flash heavy site, system force close/ANR 2-3 times more than Galaxy Note add up extra time of waiting for page to load and relaunching applications.It is not easy decision to make. You just need to weight what is important to you.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Student's Dream Tablet", "Author": "syngeek \"pixel385\"", "ReviewID": "R1UBWS805U1INN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my very first tablet and I love it so much!!I visited this tablet at my local electronics shop many times, read reviews, looked at available software, and even the reviews for the software prior to deciding to buy my Note. I've had it for about a month now and I thought I should share my experience so far for anyone else who's doing their homework before buying.I am a grad student. I've been carrying a laptop and tons of papers around for some time now. I had notebooks for random notes from meetings, TODO lists, and ideas. Notes from my classes, handouts, papers which I printed just so I could mark them up. Oh, can't forget the assortment of pens and pencils for that marking up. I also had all of my meetings and schedule info set up in my phone's calendar so I could have something beep at me with a reminder no matter what... with my schedule, forgetting things is very easy.The Samsung Note changed everything.I was initially excited about this product because of the Wacom stylus. I used to do professional graphic art and I loved my Wacom digitizer tablet. Anything less than that level of quality just won't cut it once you've experienced their tablets. I was tempted to try an iPad when I saw another student was able to take notes with that marker thing, but I'm so glad I waited and looked at the Note. Wacom really dominates and the quality just can't be beat.The pre-installed apps are pretty good, though I can see ways to make them better. I love S Note and use it for all of my note taking needs. The way it integrates with the calendar/todo list app is particularly nice. I can take meeting notes where I'm given some task to do, then click to \"Create Event\" which will let me attach the note to a new event on my calendar or todo list, complete with reminders, groups, prioritization, etc.. S Note with Calendar is so useful, it alone nearly made the purchase worthwhile.Another great feature of S Note (though the interface could seriously be improved) is the ability to recognize handwritten math functions, then look them up on Wolfram Alpha. I'm a CS student and I find that pretty useful and cool. The only trick to it is that it wants to open the browser in split screen mode. If you already have the browser in split screen mode, it doesn't work. Just close the split screen, then try it and it's fine. Like I said, interface could seriously be improved.I also needed a good app for marking up all those PDFs. I wanted to stop printing papers just to mark them up, discuss them, and set them aside, hoping I'd remember when needed. My solution was ezPDF which takes a PDF, makes a copy for annotating, then lets me draw all over it. I hear there are others that might be better, but so far this has been wonderful. My printer is loving the break. (I literally have reams of printed papers I've read or written...it was crazy!)There's also a nice deal Samsung has with Dropbox. I hadn't used this service prior to getting the tablet, but if you do a few trivial things like add another computer and watch a tutorial, the free Dropbox account is increased in size from 2 to 48 gigs. I added my laptop and desktop, then merged every paper I had plus class notes and more into the service so my resources are all pretty seamless between machines. Granted, you could use a cloud service like Dropbox with any device, so it's not really a selling point... still very nice though. I'm glad it was there in my face so I'd go try it. :) The interface with Google Drive is also really tight so you can easily sync apps like S Note with your Google Drive account. I was very concerned about how things would be backed up when I got the tablet - loss of data is a very scary prospect when getting away from paper.I feel like I've had a definite quality of life improvement with this device, but I'm still just scratching the surface of what it's capable of.Oh, I suppose I should address screen resolution, battery life, and all that.The battery lasts for a really really long time. I'm not sure just how many hours. I suspect I could use it for maybe two days without charging, assuming I don't watch any TV shows on it or anything. I went on a Dr. Who marathon a couple of weekends ago and it ran low after several episodes, starting from less than full charge. Even when it says it's critically low, it keeps going for quite awhile.The screen resolution is ok. It is not as high as the iPad's, but then, as I understand it, that sacrifice was necessary to support the Wacom tech in this form factor (low power processor, etc)- a worthy sacrifice. In any case, I can't say I've complained about the visible size of pixels in at least a decade so I'm not all that upset about it. I guess if I bought it just to consume media, I'd be upset, but for me, this is a tool first, toy second.So, to wrap it up:Pros:- Great for class notes! (Also, no more smudging if you're left handed like me!)- Mark up PDF presentations if your prof puts them up for download- Create and mark up PDF slides while teaching or tutoring, then give them to your students afterwards.- Like a brain extension when it comes to organizing.- Save paper and toner!- Stylus tech by Wacom - you just have to try it if you haven't before. It's really sweet, I swear.- Fun for doodling, if you like that.- You're free from Apple's walled garden, if you care about such things.- Speakers are on the front. Nice when you want to curl up in your blankets and watch some TV. (Audio isn't terrible either, given the form factor)Cons:- Screen resolution not amazing, but really not terrible either- S apps could use some UI improvements. Loads of potential, just not quite to the point of being stellar apps yet. I'm optimistic for them still and use them anyways.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just awesome", "Author": "H. Yoon", "ReviewID": "RAGKE4ZO3IVTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a graduate student in engineering and I was looking for a tablet that can be an alternative for papers. And I was debating between ipad and galaxy note 10.1 and I decided to go for the Note. I am really happy that I chose this tablet.First of all, the S note app is amazing. It is very responsive and accurate. And it's really fun as well! When I am bored, I just take the Note and write random things. Somebody below complained about the auto handwriting conversion to text. But I think it is almost impossible to convert the handwriting to text in a blink although I think it's still fast enough. And I could figure out the most of the problems that he had..And because I'm studying in engineering, I need to draw a lot of graphs , shapes, and formulas. And the auto shape match feature is the best part. I can draw anything very fast and it just makes them in the exact way that i want.Unfortunately, S-note is not pdf file friendly. Even though you can import pdf files into S-note, there are not many useful feataures for S-note. But of course you can download any pdf annotation app from the market. I found this app, EZpdf, and they optimized the app for galaxy note so that when the stylus pen is near the screen, your palm is not recognized like S-note so the annotation is perfect. Also, you can organize your files and you can search the meaning of words that you select in either dictionary or wikipedia right away.So trust me. If you are a student, I don't think there is any other tablet that can satisfy you than this one. I know that ipad has many good note apps but what is the point of using them if there is no palm rejection feature?Other than taking notes, the performance is also blazing fast. I always complained that even screen scrolling is not smooth for androids compared to ipad but I think Samsung optimized this tablet very well. Even when you are doing the multiscreen, there is no lag at all (except that it takes 0.5 seconds to move to another screen). With the 2gb rams, you can open unlimited number of tabs in your web browser.About the resolution.. If you are not going to read the Bible which is full of very tiny letters, i don't think you will have any problem to read articles or papers. And this resolution doesn't make any difference for vidoes since 1080x720 is a standard resolution for tablet. Correct me if i'm wrong.For watching videos or netflix, I really like that they put a dual speakers in front of the screen. It's very loud and clear. In my opinion, it's a huge difference from other tablets in terms of watching movies or listening to musics.I am not an art person but I take pictures a lot. And the phothoshop touch that comes with this is amazing. There are a lot of tutorials inside and it's easy to learn. With the s-pen, it is very fun to edit pictures. It is another thing that I like the most.The only downside is that you need enough time to get used to the software. Since there are a lot of features, you have to play around with it for a while. For me, it took about 2 hours to be friendly with the interface. But it's like when you are new to android and have to spend some times to get used to the interface.Summary. If you are a student who needs to take notes and annotate pdf or slides, you SHOULD get the Note 10.1. With this, I am not going to bring any backpack and notes.

After approx. one month, a section of the screen would not respond to touch. Everything else worked great. I contacted tech support on Feb 6th and they sent me a shipping label to send it in for repair. They sent a ground shipping label so it got there on Feb15th. They repaired it and sent it back 2nd day delivery on Feb18. The repair ticket said that they replaced the screen. I received it Feb 20th. When I turned it on, I discovered that they deleted all my data and it was still doing the same thing.I called them back the same day and asked for a replacement since they didn't fix it. They refused to replace the tablet and wanted it sent back for repair again. I went through the same process again. I sent it off Feb 21st, they received it Feb 26th and sent it out to me on March 7th. The repair ticket said they replaced the screen. So I was prepared for what I would find...and yes, it still wasn't fixed.I called them back the next day. March 8th. They were so nice on the phone and apologetic. They told me they would send me a new one. The girl that helped me clearly did not know what she was doing because she would tell me one thing, put me on hold, come back and apologize then tell me something else. She told me that my tablet would be replaced with a new one. Then she said I could provide a credit card payment and a new tablet would be sent right away. She put me on hold, came back and told me I couldn't do the credit card and that I would have to send my tablet in and once it was received I would be sent a new one. Next she told me she would send me a shipping label. She kept trying to send the label but it would not show up in my email. She put me on hold and then came back and told me that my replacement had to be approved. She said I would receive a label in 2 to 3 business days.I finally received my shipping label after contacting the CEO via their website. I received the shipping label March 19th. They received the tablet March 27th. I just got a email today April 2nd that they don't have my 32GB model in stock so they can either send me a 16GB model or give me my money back.I will gladly take my money back and get something else so I won't have to go through their tech support again. Now I am just wondering how long it will take to get my money back!UPDATE! the refund takes 15 to 20 working days to be sent out.

I can only speak to what its like after the update, which is what anyone reading this would dealing with anyway.-The only other tablet I have owned was the original Kindle Fire.  (However, I am by no means a novice with technology, and I am very aware of the more popular products and their function.)With that out of the way, The Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 is everything I was looking for and more.  I had originally just been looking for a cheap way to have my notes taken digitally, as I am a graduate student and cannot tell you how much time I havespent writing, rewriting, and losing notebooks.  Nothing in the \"cheap\" price range came close to what I really wanted from it (a simple tablet like thing I could write on, I wasn't even looking for any other features or a tablet per say.)I saw the Note 10.1 and it seemed to be too good to be true.  The videos showed it doing everything I wanted.  So, I dove into the \"professional\" reviewers.  As many here can attest (and have), those reviews were often less than glowing.  The screen wasn't good enough for the price, the build was flimsy, the multi tasking was flawed and lacking, and so on.  All these reviews painted a picture of a first generation attempt that needed serious improvement.  So, I kept looking around, hoping to find something else, with better reviews, to fit my needs.  In the course of that search I came across all the forums and customer reviews of the Note 10.1.  The users themselves LOVE the note.  You'll hear the same thing everywhere you look at customer reviews, forget the \"professionals\" this device is amazing, it is what you are looking for, and you won't regret it for a moment.The exterior build itself is perhaps the most valid criticism.  There is some give around the back edges and it doesn't feel like a piece of metal you could use as a hammer.  If that's what you're looking for, then I'd suggest just that, you clearly don't want a tablet, you want a hammer.  I keep mine in a flip case, for protection and the stand, while it's in there all those previously mentioned (and VERY minor) details about the build disappear.  It's not flimsy, it's just not an actual rock.Battery life has been terrific for me.  I use this thing almost non stop every single day.  I will say, I don't watch a ton of video on it, but I do keep on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, autosync, gps, etc.  I've had almost no need to take any steps to conserve the battery, because it lasts far longer than I've ever needed it to.  The only thing I did do was turn off auto screen brightness and put it at the level I liked, when auto was on, it kept changing the brightness when I didn't want to.  I'd suggest you do the same.The screen.  It's well documented that the Note 10.1's screen is \"not as good as\" the other products in the same price range.  That's fair, it isn't \"as good.\"  That also begs the question, how good do you need it to be?  I don't look at my screen and notice any problems.  It's 10 inches.  Larger screens would suffer more from the specs, smaller screens it's almost irrelevant.  Again, how good does your screen need to be?  Are you just buying a tablet as something to watch movies on and you're extremely finicky about it?  Then go elsewhere, this isn't for you.  Here's a better point about the screen, what other tablets in the price range use the Wacom technology, the pressure sensitivity, etc?  How much do people pay for just a Wacom pad?Which brings me to the Spen.  The pressure sensitivity.  The ability to hand write on whatever you're working with.  As I student, I have filled up volumes of notes.  I've spent countless hours rewriting work because it needed to be cleaned up for others.  I've filled up notebooks, then the next semester, they are gone and I'm starting over.  I cannot tell you how much time I've spent trying to find notes on some a particular item buried in with everything else.  The Note 10.1 has put an end to that.  My notes are in a file right from the start.  I upload them to dropbox and can get them anywhere I am.  I can email them.  I can reorganize them with the touch of a button.  It's been a life saver, a time saver, and a stress saver.You can even use the S pen to cut and paste parts of the screen to another program.  It's as easy as holding the s pen button and\"circling\" a border around what you want.  I personally use it to grab items like graphs or HW questions from my pdf textbooks and drop them into my notes.The Samsung apps that use the s Pen are all pretty good.  S note is nice, but it has some baffling flaws that almost make it seem like they made it, and then just didn't listen to any user feedback.  Lots of little things that I want to do when note taking (cut and paste (not screen shot), locked zoom, blank template, etc) you simply cannot do in S notes.  so THANK GOD FOR LECTURE NOTES.  Lecture notes is an app, that if you get the Note 10.1, it should be mandatory for you to download.  It's what S notes should be.  Without it, I'd still love my Note, but there would be those minor frustrations.  Lecture Notes does everything you could want and more.  It makes the Note 10.1 indispensable for a student.  I don't know what I'd do without it, and I cringe at the thought of going back to the way it used to be.I bought the 16gb version.  Apps can only be installed to the built in sd card.  For me, 16gb's there is more than enough.  I have a 32 gb card in the slot where I keep my textbooks, etc.  I don't know how people can use up the systems 16gb with apps.  What the hell are you people installing???Multitasking, (again, since the update) is great.  I keep open a notebook, and a textbook or powerpoint slides (which you can write directly on, as with pdf's etc) and just click through one while jotting down notes.  You can do it with the video player, youtube, etc as well.  Can you do it with every app?  No, but I do feel that the apps you can do it with cover such a broad range themselves that there really isn't much of anything missing.  And hey, if you want to use one program full screen, switching back and forth between a few things is extremely easy as well.  Even taking a partial screen shot with the pen, it makes it very easy to choose right then and there where you want to take that screen grab in other programs.I think I've covered everything I intended to, and then some.  Most tablets out there are effectively for passive media consumption.  Sure, you can take pictures, etc, but mostly you're just watching videos, looking at slides, and having access to what has previously been done.  With the Note 10.1 you can actually get things done.  To me, this is what a tablet should be.  It is small, portable, and makes me more productive, not less.If that's what you're looking for, then this is what you want.  If you want a device that will allow you to get more done, and keep it all more organized, then here it is.  If you want to just stream videos and take pictures of food, you should go elsewhere, this isn't for you and you wouldn't even know what to do with it.I don't know when the next generation of this will come along, so I don't know when there will be a new and improved iteration of this, but don't put it off because you want them to work out bugs.  This is a well made machine that will be a productivity aid.

Nothing. If anything, I thought they were in general a silly idea if you already owned a smartphone, even more so since Windows OS laptops can be had for similiar prices, and do infinitely more if portability is the point of it. I don't travel much, so I don't need a laptop. My phone is enough for the rare times I do so I can check my email. I already have 2 desktops, so all my in home computing needs are met.So might wonder why I got a Galaxy Note 10.1 last week. O.oHere's how it happened.WARNING! Incoming sleep inducing story!1. First thing I noted was the S-Pen. I hadn't seen a stylus used with tablets before, so it caught my attention just briefly enough to look at it. (like a worm on a hook.)2. After being lured into watching a video about it, I noted the drawing and writing abilities of the Note 10.1. Haven't drawn in years, but that could be fun. Started seeing this as a device to do everything I do on my phone with a bigger screen and let my phone do what it does best... Be a phone. (I'm now interested in the worm. Enough to add it to my amazon wishlist to think about it.)3. Started reading reviews and learned about the hardware. Ugh. Lacking Tegra 3, doesn't have any real dock. Reviewers raving about some Asus Transformer thing. (lure moving away, losing interest...)4. The more I thought about it though... Was Tegra 3 really THAT important? I looked at a list of Tegra 3 games. Not important. Keyboard dock... Wait, I already decided if I wanted a laptop, I'd get a laptop. The lure was the S-Pen. Being able to reach over in the morning, grab the tablet and read the news, email, etc. A senseless luxury item no doubt.5. Went to Best Buy to see them personally. Played around with a Tab 2 and the Transformer. Didn't see the Note 10.1 at first. Was mostly decided on the Note, and then I saw one on the other end of the store. Took me maybe a minute before I knew I was getting a Note 10.1. (nevermind the hook, somebody threw a grenade into the water!)What sold me?The s-pen, the way it felt in my hands vs the other tablets. Picture quality is all I could ask for, and would be great to watching Netflix or something in bed. I'm already familiar with Samsung products having had an Epic 4G phone for almost 2 years, and recently just upgraded to a Galaxy SIII... So things like TouchWiz, rooting, and overall expectations are well known to me. No *NEW* brand surprises.To each their own though for whatever reasons somebody wants a tablet. I think the Note 10.1 is great though, and in the few days I have owned it, I have used it a lot. I have to admit it's nice to have an android device where I'm not worried about the battery level all the time as I have with my phone(s)================I've had it for a week now, and I find it hard to put down. The S Pen is a charm to use. I find myself just doodling on it because I can, or using it to browse through RSS feeds like a digital news paper. Point and tap, no finger prints! I also love the fact I can write by hand with this. I rarely write by hand anymore, but now I do it for the fun of it.It handles gaming very well. Hardcare tablet gamers will probably want to look to a tegra enabled tablet, but there are not a lot of tegra games so I see little point in helping nvidia cause division in the market. and make no mistake... The S Pen is useful with games!The battery seems to last a long time as I can squeeze 2~3 days of use out of it before needing to recharge and that is with moderate use throughout the day. Don't get me wrong though, I could probably burn through the battery if I used it all day.On screen typing btw is good. Samsung's keyboard works well here unless the tiny useless touchscreen keyboards on a phone (including my Galaxy S3). In both landscape and portrait it is easy to use and and accurate.Overall, I am amazed at just how much I am enjoying my Note 10.1.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1", "Author": "Nak", "ReviewID": "RUPENZF9ZX6V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Note 10.1 16GB, and I would return it in a heartbeat if it wasn't well worth the asking price. The thing is, it is. Even without the pen, it's hands down the best Android tablet out today. The screen isn't as high a resolution as some, that is true. However, the vast majority of people will never notice that; all they will notice is the beautiful, crisp and clear screen. If you have great eyes, are under 40, and like holding the tablet right up to your face to see the difference, sure you will see the smallest fonts are slightly pixelated. Other than that, this tablet just plain works. Simple, but true. Everything just plain works. No force closes, no hang ups, no problems with video or PDF rendering. Everything is quick and smooth.

Performance wise, it's the fastest tablet available today, yes benchmarks and real world performance beats all comers, including the new Ipad.It is true that many reviews are negative, not from real world users though. Trot on over to XDA-Developers and read user reviews. You know, the site where they REALLY know mobile devices. The acknowledged experts in the field. Everyone LOVES this device. Absolutely rave reviews from real world users. Why the E-zines don't like this device I don't know. Perhaps Samsung is not spending enough marketing dollars? If you understand the industry, you'll understand that if you don't pay enough in advertising, you don't get good reviews.After a few days of owning the note, the things I really like about it are:  The touch screen. Very accurate and responsive input. It just plain works.  The screen. It's crisp, bright, clear and color accurate.  The speakers. Wow. Best speakers of any tablet or laptop I've ever had. Easily usable and pleasurable for watching movies and listening to music in hotel rooms. (I travel a lot.) Given a choice between watching a movie on my wife's Ipad3 or my Note, the Note 10.1 wins hand down due to the superior speakers and screen size.  The performance. Every app I use works smoothly, correctly and quickly. Everything just works.  The battery life. Almost 10 hours of netflix viewing or reading ebooks on a single charge.  Video. Every file I throw at it plays perfectly. Motion is smooth and clear.  The Pen. Really great to have. Initially, I thought I had no use for it. I was wrong. Photoshop touch is just great with the pen. Note taking is like pen and paper without the mess. Really a game changer. There is a learning curve though. You have to learn how to make best use of the pen and adjust the settings to your preferences before you start liking it. Don't expect to be wowed the first time you use it. Also, don't assume you can get a stylus and use it with other tablets to the same effect. The Note 10.1 has a built in Wacom digitizer in the screen. That's what makes it so accurate and responsive.  Bulid Quality. After the OTA update (22 August), the only issue I have with the Note 10.1--currently--is do I exchange it for the 32GB version.After a week with this device I will say it is the best mobile device I have ever owned, hands down.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ultimate Work Tablet", "Author": "T.

And with Quill, I have everything I need to take notes and organize all of my projects.  The Wacom S-Pen works beautifully.  Extremely accurate and fits nicely in my hand.  And having a place it put it on the tablet is very convenient.  Lots of professional reviews knocked this tablet, but I could not disagree with them more.  I love it.I'm glad Samsung didn't do a high resolution screen.  The end result would have been a heavier less responsive tablet because of all the extra pixels to push.  Despite what the reviewers say it is fast.  It is very responsive.  The benchmarks clearly show this tablet is a beast.  I do use 3rd party apps to replace parts of interface just like I do with my phone and any Android device I have ever owned.  I use Apex Launcher instead of the stock Touchwiz launcher.  I also use Swiftkey instead of the stock keyboard.As far as build quaility is concerned, the back does have flex.  I don't know why it matters.  But some people are going nuts over this.  If you are going to leave this tablet naked, maybe then worry about the flex of the case.  The sides seems very sturdy to me though.  But I always buy a case.  My very first tablet that I bought cost me $250 to repair it because I dropped it without a case and the LCD screen cracked. With a case, none of the flex matters.  At all.  I also think the grey looks way sharper than the white version.  And it's awesome having front facing speakers.  I wish all tablets were this way.  The screen is very bright.  I compared it outside on a sunny day with the Transformer Prime with IPS+ mode on (my co-worker owns one) and both of them were readable.  Neither one of us could say one was better than the other.  The colors also look beautiful.  My lock screen is a picture of Mami from Madoka Magica.  And the shades of yellow on her outfit and hair look stunning everytime I turn on the screen.  Samsung did a great job with the screen even if it isn't full HD.  The camera is so so.  It's good enough I can use it to take a picture and mark it up with the pen.  But I will always use my phone camera before my tablet camera for general picture taking.Again, this is the tablet you want to buy if you want to take hand written notes at work and diagram stuff.  If you want something now, this is honestly your only choice.  If you can wait until Windows 8 tablets drop at the end of October, you will have a whole bunch of different choices.  But not all W8 (or Windows RT) tablets will feature a Wacom stylus so make sure before buying anything.  If you just want to screw around with a tablet on the couch, you have plenty of choices at lots of different price options.

Veeneman", "ReviewID": "R2RMTM7TQAVTTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I love this tablet. But my needs are somewhat unique. If you want a tablet simply to consume media--browse the web, watch movies, show photographs, play games, and so on, you should probably consider either an iPad, Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, or Google's Nexus 7 tablet. Other than the iPad, they are much less expensive than this tablet, and all do a good jod displaying media and games.I use my Galaxy Note 10.1 in three modes. First, I do use it as a media display device, and it does a great job at that. Web browsing, movies, games, and photos are all clear and stutter-free. The unit is quite responsive, with no sluggishness at all. I am very pleased with it in that regard.The second mode I use the tablet in is reading mode. I don't use it for e-books; my Kindle does a better job of that. I use it for technical articles and books, many of which are in PDF format. The s-pen is ideal for highlighting, underlining, and generally annotating the PDFs that I work with. I have wanted this capability for years, and I would have paid $500 for that alone.Finally, I use the Galaxy Note 10.1 as a peripheral device for my desktop computer. I have avoided buying a graphics tablet for years, because I couldn't get comfortable with drawing on a gray tablet and watching what I was doing on my computer screen. With the Galaxy Note 10.1, I can load a photo or other art work onto the tablet, work on it there, and send it back over to the computer with a single click. The tablet acts as a wireless graphics tablet for the computer, with the added benefit that I can see the progress of my work on the tablet itself. I am utterly amazed at how well it works.A really fun feature is the built-in IR blaster, which lets the tablet act as a remote control for a home entertainment system. Even though the software bundled with the system is in its early stages, it works flawlwssly, and it shows a lot of promise of really sophisticated media control coming down the line.Obviously, these capabilities won't appeal to everyone. If you can't think of an immediate good use for the s-pen, you might want to think twice before buying this tablet. There are other very good tablets out there. But personally, I think the Galaxy Note 10.1 points the way to the future of both PCs and tablets, where we all use multiple devices, working together, to accomplish what we want to do.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Made me sell my 3rd Gen iPad...", "Author": "Eddster", "ReviewID": "R3EL2LAYOLF8E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love, love LOVE this tablet!  It is blazing fast and buttery smooth (even with Samsung's Touch Wiz UI).  This baby features THE BEST multi-tasking that I've experienced on any tablet.  The screen is bright and beautiful.  Video absolutely pops on this.  I do have to admit that written text is sharper on my iPad's retina display screen, but this was by NO MEANS a deal breaker for me because this Note tab is so feature packed that it more than makes up for it and written text basically looks like it did again on my iPad 2, which is nothing to sneeze at.  The S-Pen is freakin awesome! Now I can do Draw Something some justice! LOL  But seriously, I love being able to create and send personalized notes and edit PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents.  I have barely been able to put this thing down since I got it.  The included Photoshop Touch application is really cool and you can do some really awesome things to pics.Also, the fact that I have Adobe Flash on this thing and can experience the entire web from this tablet is a MAJOR plus for me.  That was by far one of the most frustrating things about using my (old) iPad.  Well that and the closed nature of the iOS environment.  I love that I can play around and customize this Note tab to my liking.  The snappy 1.4 GHz Quad Core processor and 2 GB of RAM results in ZERO lag when using this tablet.  Everything is so incredibly fluid as I swtich between apps, widgets, and the web.  And web pages load in a snap!  It is REALLY REALLY nice.  This thing has already meant death to my 3rd Gen iPad and at this point I can already tell that I will now hardly ever use my PC.Oh and the fact that you can also use this as a universal remote is freakin sweet.  It took me all of 5 minutes to set up all of my devices (TV, Cable Box, A/V Surround System, etc) with Samsung's Peel app. That app gives you a very easy to follow set-up wizard and instantly turned this thing into an entertainment hub!I just can't say enough about this tablet.  I am so glad that it finally came out.  And as amazing as this thing is already, Sammy says we should get Jelly Bean very shortly! So an already great tablet will become even better! If you are considering taking the plunge with this thing, go ahead and do it!  I think you'll be happy.  It seems like the possibilities are almost endless with this device.

I love techy gadgets, but I find I can't know how they'll work for me until I've had them a while, and some turn out to be an infatuation that fades as I find that I don't use the gadget as much as I'd thought I would. But I've had my GN 10.1 almost four months now, and I'm as much in love as ever and using it every day.The biggest draw for me was the S-pen.  I've been waiting for a tablet that I can write on like a pad of paper, and the GN has turned out to work very well that way for me (unlike other electronic devices I've tried over the years).  After a few weeks, I bought a larger (Samsung) stylus because I use the handwriting function constantly, and I wanted something that felt more like holding a regular pen.  The included stylus is just fine, though (once you find it--it's so well-designed, tucked into a corner, that it took me a while).  I've been very impressed with the handwriting recognition.  I imagine it will get better in future versions, but for now, this is more than good enough for me.  Before I bought the GN, while I was trying to determine how good the handwriting recognition would be, I found a good YouTube video that persuaded me to use the complete recognition option rather than the stroke recognition, and I *much* prefer complete recognition.  I sometimes do use the keyboard instead, and the prediction is pretty good.  I eventually bought a third-party app, 7notes with mazec, which I like even better for handwriting on the tablet and having the output be text in a word-processing app, a diary app, fields on web pages, etc.Besides the Samsung S Note app, the GN comes with an office suite that takes advantage of the S-pen and the ability to have more than one app open on the screen at the same time (which I was excited about when I was reading reviews before buying, but it turns out that I seldom use the split-screen feature), but there are other office suites, free and pay, in the App Store, and I found one I prefer for working on Word documents.  And there are plenty of other note-taking apps that use the S-pen, and lots of them are free.  It's worth trying them out and keeping the one(s) you like.  Not as many other apps yet that use the S-pen as I hoped for.  But it's still a small market--the Samsung Note tablets and Note smartphone.  I hope there will be more in time.I found the layout and controls of the GN 10.1 mostly intuitive, and by playing around with it, I figured most stuff out for myself.  The user manual is pretty lame (which is also true of the iPad).  But there's plenty of information on line, and as I do more with the tablet, I learn more about the functions.  I like the layout of the power button and volume control rocker more than the iPad's.  Sound through the speakers is good enough--I wouldn't expect better from a tablet.For those who complain about lack of Flash, there *IS* a way to install it.  It's free, it's safe, and it works fine.  Do a Web search or look through the comments on these reviews.  I also installed an extension for the Firefox browser for Android that fools websites into thinking that it's a non-mobile version of Firefox, and between the two of them, I haven't found sites where Flash doesn't work.Some reviewers have been unimpressed with the cameras.  I haven't really used the front-facing one (got to start Skyping one of these days, I just haven't got around to it).  I have used the rear-facing one, and I like the results a lot.  Maybe I'm just easily pleased, but I haven't seen what the results look like for an iPad, so I don't have a basis to find the Samsung's camera wanting.  I'm plenty satisfied with it, in any case, and I use it much more than I expected to.  Similarly, I've never seen the retina displays of the latest Apple products, so I'm not comparing the GN screen to that, and I don't find it the least bit disappointing.  For me, it would probably be worth the tradeoff anyway, just to be able to write on the screen with the S-pen.Google's app store has had almost all the apps I would like and plenty of choice.  A couple that are available for the iPad but not Android that I miss are the NPR app that includes their music streaming (there's an NPR app for Android, but it doesn't have First Listen, concerts, etc.) and iPeng for controlling my Squeezebox music player.  But there's a fairly good alternative for iPeng, and I'm still hoping for a better NPR app to be developed for Android.Besides the ability to handwrite on the screen, the other big selling point for me is that the Samsung tablets aren't boxed in the way Apple products are.  It's easy for me to network the tablet with my desktop and laptop computers, move things around among them, stream video and music from my desktop via an app, set up the storage on the Samsung the way I want it, and add, move, and delete things without having to go through something like iTunes.  I'm also looking forward to using a micro memory card to take a bunch of movies, books, and music when I travel, but I haven't come close to filling up the internal storage so far.The only thing about the GN 10.1 that I have any complaints about is the battery life.  It's probably reasonable for the size, power, and weight of the tablet.  It's just that I use the tablet so much that I could wish for a longer time before I have to recharge it.  That probably says more about my heavy use of the tablet than about the battery life.Oh, and the charging cable is ridiculously short.  I bought a second, somewhat longer one, which also serves a backup in case I forget the original someplace or lose it, but I'm planning to get an even longer one soon, for convenience.  I'm also planning to get an HDTV adapter so I can try streaming video from the GN to my TV via an HDMI cable.Okay, one more minor beef: It comes with some apps that I don't use and don't want but can't uninstall.  I can at least hide their icons, but I would prefer to get rid of them altogether without rooting the tablet (I would rather not root it and haven't yet--because it's more configurable than the iPad, I haven't felt the need).All in all, the Galaxy Note 10.1 has been a delight, and I'm finding new uses for it all the time.  It's so much more portable than my laptop, so I take it with me almost everywhere.  I write on it, read books on it, check the weather on it, keep up with the news on it, shop at Amazon on it, do a lot of other Web stuff on it, check my e-mail on it, play games on it, watch videos on it, listen to Internet radio stations on it, control my Squeezebox with it, keep a calendar on it, take pictures with it, keep a journal on it, sign PDF documents on it for work, print from it, use it as a portable scanner, keep lists on it, plan my writing projects on it, and one of these days I'm going to use some of the fitness and meditation apps I installed but never seem to find the time to use.  Ditto the sketching and drawing apps.  I'm not artistic, but it could be fun to play around with those.

I love Apple products, but became worried after the patent verdict that Apple might take over the technology world; a monopoly would not be good for consumers. That's how I got started with Androids.When I was buying this tablet, I was ready to be disappointed. However, I liked the idea of a tablet with a pen so decided to give it a try. After 10 days, I am more than satisfied. The S-pen works nicely. Things move fast and smooth, without a single crash. I like the photoshop that came default, the mini apps, long battery life, and the continuous typing keyboard.There were a few times I was glad that I had the Note with me. For example, when I browse a website and want to jot down something quickly, I can just open an S-memo mini app and write it down there. With iPad, I would have to look for a separate notepad and a pen. Or when I want to upload a picture to a website, the Photoshop is really nice. The S-pen makes Photoshop easier and more powerful.Of course, there are things the new iPad does better than Note 10.1. However, I think there are trade offs in these areas and Samsung made right decisions. First, Galaxy Note 10.1 has a lower resolution screen. It does not bother me at all when I just use Galaxy Note, but when I compare it with the new iPad side by side, there is a noticeable difference. However, if Galaxy Note had the high resolution, it could lead to other problems. It would not be as fast and battery would not last so long. I prefer speed and long battery over a high resolution screen. Second, Note 10.1 has a plastic body. It is true that Note 10.1 does not look as classy as iPads. However, its benefit is that the tablet becomes substantially lighter than iPad. This helps a lot when I read ebooks. Again, I prefer light weight over a metal body. Overall, I think Samsung made right decisions in these trade offs.If you have been an iPad user for long time, I suggest you give the Note a couple of days before you make your  decision. On the first day, I was a bit disappointed because it did not work in the way I was used to. But once I get used it, I came to like Android better than iOS. I think iOS does a great job simplifying its operations; even my three year old daughter can use it.

I've tried a couple different tablets, acer a500/asus transformer and the capacative stylus just doesn't cut it. Heard about this at the beg. of the year and decided I'd get it, after a long delay which was to better the tablet, it came in yesterday. Though I know Windows Surface is supposed to be the end of Oct. and may be a game changer I've quite enjoyed my experience with android on mobile phones. Also, the app market being established and ease of sharing everything I have between devices is seamless.I will update this review in a couple weeks, this is just an initial glance.If you're familiar with a Honeycomb or ICS tablet then the Galaxy Note 10.1 should feel very familiar. Nothing new or exciting to write home about, TouchWiz adds a couple different bells and whistles (literally, the notification chime is a whistle which I actually like) but most of which I will not use. I'm used to stock android, Galaxy Nexus, so the extra fodder that TouchWiz provides doesn't do much for me. The 1st thing I did was delete all the pre-loaded widgets. I noticed that before I did this there was a slight delay scrolling, afterwards it seems fairly fluid. I currently only have my minimalist calendar and beautiful weathers widget loaded. I still feel that if it were vanilla ICS or Jelly Bean (eventually???) it would be lightning fast. But even still it is the most responsive android (and possibly apple) device that I've used to date.The build quality was a little better than I expected, yes its typical Samsung plastic but it feels decently and has a good weight to it. I really like the greyish color as opposed to black and though the back panel is plastic it has a brushed metal look. The screen is bright and clear, despite everyones complaints about screen resolution, and is at least readable in direct sunlight - though not ideal. The bezel is near about the perfect size for a \"writing\" tablet if held in either portrait or landscape and the speakers give it a distinct look along with being very functional since they are forward facing. The screen is a fingerprint magnet like any other touch device, so I'll be looking at a non invasive screen protector eventually. Overal I give the build quality a 7.5 out of 10. Oh, and for those of you that care - after pulling teeth chatting with Samsung online they finally said the screen is indeed Corning Gorilla Glass, but I couldn't find anything legit online to back that statement up.I've mainly been using the S Pen and am quite impressed. I think I'll finally have a writing solution instead of pen and paper. Nothing feels like ink to paper but this is pretty darned close. And being able to write small words, like I would on a pad, is great even though its hard to read my chicken scratch! But then again my penmanship is poor an paper....not much of a difference. The S Pen is the main selling point for this tablet and I think Samsung has a winner here. I give the S Pen a 9 out of 10I think things can only improve and have a feeling we'll see an update in a couple weeks; with the hopes of Jelly Bean by the end of the year - Samsung hasn't been good at keeping update promises though. I really think that if people can get away from \"screen resolution\" this is the tablet to buy regardless if you want the S Pen. Though TouchWiz isn't as intrusive as I've seen in the past I'd still like to root this device and have stock ICS or Jelly Bean - it would no doubt blaze past Apple and anything else Android currently on the market.I know this review was a little scattered and not detailed but I wanted to give a quick glimpse of what I thought, if you have any specific questions ask below and I'll check in periodically and answer them to the best of my knowledge.UPDATE: 2/20/2013OK - I've owned this tablet for about 6 months now, its time to give this review an update. I'll try to be as short and sweet as I can, but if anyone has any questions about something I left out please comment below or message me and I'll answer to the best of my ability.I've changed my review from a 4 star to a 5 star review, and until a tablet comes on the market that I feel is better than the Note 10.1 at around the same price point it will remain a 5 star review, especially now with the 4.1.2 update.This device is completely solid and functional. It is not like the vast majority of tablets that now flood the market and feel like an overgrown smartphone. The software is well implemented, multi-tasking is great, and the multi-view capability bring it very close to the feel of using a PC. I use it daily in the workplace and also at home, in which I now rarely even use my personal PC. The build quality is solid, I've dropped it several times and there isn't a scratch on it. (Though I do have a screen protector on it AND its in a cheap poetic case) But after using it this long and the abuse I give it daily, sometimes just throwing it in the passenger seat of my truck - I think the people who say the tablet is \"cheap\" feeling b/c of the plastic build do so unwarranted. If it were cheaply built I think mine would have already broken, the body or the internals.It doesn't really matter if you are an Android fanboy or an iSheep, the fact remains that this is the best sub $500 tablet out there to date. It has a true filing system, is fast, has true multi-tasking, great screen, great battery life, great software and a solid build. Throw in the S Pen capabilities to those that use it and it is light-years ahead of the competition.

I bought an iPad on the first day it was on the market and then an iPad 2 not much longer afterwards.  I initially bought it with the intention of using it for note taking at work (assuming the capacitive stylus would do the trick), but soon realized it just couldn't do the trick.  I still loved my iPad and took it everywhere - being small, instant boot time, etc - made it the perfect way to consume media.When I saw the Galaxy Note come out, I was curious, but didn't think much of it.  I didn't want to get into the habit of getting a new tablet every year, so I thought I'd wait it out.Then, over the holidays I was in a Best Buy and decided to check it out - and was amazed how well the stylus worked.  So, I went ahead and bought one.Fast forward to now.  At the start of the new year, I took all of the paper out of my laptop bag and replaced it with my Galaxy Note (I keep a small pad for emergencies).  I just realized today, I have yet to use that small pad and use my Note for just about everything.  I'll take meeting notes on it, brainstorm, mock up slides (I need to work in ppt a lot).

It came with JellyBean (4.1.2).The resolution, 1280x800, seems small as newer tablets have 1920x1200, 2560x1400, or whatever, BUT there is more to life than resolution - can the graphics processor handle the resolution? Can it multitask while dealing with large screens?  Articles online do tell how the Note is so much more fluid at multitasking compared to competitors with higher resolution screens, because the resolution isn't taxing the processor.  One article, which rated this model lowly, showed specs and benchmarks that cremated equally-priced competition and found no pragmatic reason for the low score.  Especially as their own benchmarks showed it being quite competent.As for screen color quality, I've no complaints at all.  One online video comparing this to another Android-enabled brand for the same price with higher resolution showed the Samsung Note having better color and wider contrast gamut (more shades of gray).  To me, it's not the resolution but color accuracy.  Only one other tablet brand I know of does better, but I run Android.Another screen issue is with games that are made for smaller resolutions - if they look jaggy on 1280x800, I do NOT want to see them on 1920x1200 or higher because they will look far worse.  All the games I played were lightning-fast.Never mind space consideration - higher resolution imagery takes more space.  32GB could get eaten quickly, to say nothing on bandwidth (if I chose a model with 3G/4G/whatever as opposed to wi-fi).  1280x800 is the sweet spot for tablets; and I am not looking so close at it that I can see individual pixels - and if I did, it would be to see if any pixels were stuck (constant color or white) or dead (constant black).2GB of internal RAM is nice.  It takes a LOT to get an Android to get up to 1GB of RAM usage, but with 2GB one can have more programs open, with none of them being closed automatically in the background.  I'll never use all 2GB at once, but it's nice to have.My smartphone (Android) is zippy but this Note SCREAMS with power. From disk access to app loading, this is amazingly fast.  SSD technology is one reason why a processor whose benchmarks reveal something comparable to decade-old x86 processors makes things seem faster.Photoshop Touch is a useful app, and runs surprisingly well on a snapshot I'd taken with the camera (ditto on my smartphone), but I still prefer the full-blown app.Love the S-Pen.Adding my account to the Android store was easy, and I have 2-step authentication.Oh, when looking for a screen protector, look for one where people say the S-Pen is not diminished with use.  I bought a high-end brand but returned it because people said it made the S-Pen worthless.  Amazon and distributors it hosts sell high-end protectors, which I will be posting on after getting them...If anything, I do not like:Live wallpaper has to be gotten to by clicking on the installed live wallpaper app.  I didn't (yet) find a wallpaper setting that segues into live wallpaper choices, but that's probably due to battery considerations.  Still, a 7000mAh battery ensures this thing will last for hours with ease...The outer case is plastic and feels weak rather than sturdy - a rubber case is highly recommended.--------Summary:--------Definitely a highly-recommended device.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "S-Pen makes this tablet a class of its own. This tablet competes mainly with Windows 8 tablets", "Author": "kievite", "ReviewID": "R3FSUXY84N5FMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Even the most devout fan of Android would have to concede that it has failed to repeat its smartphone success in the tablet arena. But in the second half of 2012 Google tried to change that. They updated Android to more competitive version 4.x and released their own tablet, Nexus. Which in 7\" version competes in price with Amazon Kindle and wipes price-wise iPad mini.But the most prominent tablet released during this attack on iPad dominance and preemptive strike before the release of tablets with Windows 8, was actually Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 which was released in August 2012 with Android 4.0. Along with S-pen, the device has amazing quality of internal speakers and generally as a media consumption device it competes with iPad head-to-head. Apple felt the pain and promptly sued Samsung. Google maps are fantastic on this device :-). As for standard Android applications, B&N; Nook Reader is available out of the box. Amazon Kindle needs to be installed. Adobe Acrobat also needs to be installed.This tablet is more capable then iPad due to presence of Wacom active digitizer and S-pen. With S-pen, you can write notes as if you have a pen and a paper. That's an amazing feeling. Due to S-pen and Wacom active digitizer this tablet essentially wiped out as competitors all Android tablets without Wacom digitizer (including Google Nexus) and has main competition only among newer and more expensive Intel-based Windows 8 tablets such as Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T. Difference in price with Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T is approximately $150.I am using it as an expensive and super capable personal organizer and so far I am a satisfied customer. You can use it all day and recharge at night.In other words, tablets with S-pen and Wacom digitizer are a new class of tablets, with new, important areas of use. But Intel-based Windows 8 tablets has the same advantages and more capable OS, so you need to decide what you want. If you use the tablet mainly as an organizer and media consumption device its OK. It you plan to double it as netbook or laptop, then Windows 8 tablets are preferable. So if you feel that you might need Bluetooth keyboard, it might be better to get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T, otherwise this tablet is adequate and cheaper. Battery life is approximately the same.Another advantage of this tablet is that you can rely on the huge amount of Linux-style Android applications such as SSH server and rsync (simplifies backups of your data), hacker keyboard, VNC etc. With SSH and VNC your laptop becomes external input device for the tablet.Provided default ecosystem is definitely closed Apple-style and you need to apply efforts to break the straitjacket you are put in. That why I put one star down. For example, you can download MP3 files from your desktop to the tablet via USB link using charging cable, and you can download them directly to the Samsung player Music directory. But this sucker does not list them. Still you can play them if you use file browser and click on the file. In this case there is a popup that proposes two players and you can choose any of them.In summary, the main attractions of the tablet is S-pen which makes it possible to use it as a personal organizer as well as access to Linux applications ported to Android. Power users who know Linux well can benefit from this tablet by using proven and well known Linux applications ported to the Android platform. Those power users, who don't know Linux might be better served by Windows 8 Pro tablets with Intel CPUs. For example, if you plan to work with Office documents on the tablet get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T -- a better tablet for power users who need keyboard with the tablet.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "Karl Fields", "ReviewID": "R2S1FUUHV6GJRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I debated between the iPad and Note 10.1. I\u2019ve had an iPhone for three or four years, and my initial inclination was to stick with the familiar, but I ultimately decided on the Samsung and couldn\u2019t be happier with my purchase. This is my first Android product and I must admit there was a learning curve as I was getting it all set up the way I wanted, but that\u2019s all behind me now.One of the things I love is the flexibility of configuring screens with the various widgets that are available; it gives me so much more control over how the tablets looks and even works. I\u2019m also big on the memory card slot. I haven\u2019t used the S-pen a lot, but in the little experimentation I\u2019ve done, it works as advertised, and it\u2019s high time someone developed a stylus with a fine point rather than those stupid, rubber-nosed things that are like writing with a clown\u2019s nose.One of the magazine reviews I read criticized the Note for its plastic case, but I\u2019m finding I rather like it. It\u2019s very light for a large tablet, so I don\u2019t mind holding it for long stretches while reading or watching a movie. It also feels very secure in my hands. With the iPad, I felt as though I had to be extra cautious for fear of it slipping out my hands.On the minus side are the location of the headphone jack and the Google Play store (formerly Android Market). The jack sits along the top of the tablet (if you\u2019re holding it in landscape mode). This is mostly a problem when watching videos, as I have to consciously move the headphone cord off to one side and hold it there so it\u2019s not dangling across the screen. Putting on the jack on the side or bottom would have made more sense. Also, I\u2019d heard of the shortcomings regarding the Play store, but figured certainly I\u2019d have access to the apps I most wanted. By and large, this is true, but there are some apps I have on my phone that I\u2019d like to have on my tablet, however they aren\u2019t available for Android.

My goal ultimately for any tablet I bought was to have it replace about 90% of my laptop needs.This tablet does that and so much more!!  I made sure to do a ton of research before purchasing. Some of the things I do on a daily basis on my laptop (which is over 3 years old and needs a cooling pad to not overheat, ugh!) is email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu, HBOGo, Amazon Videos, listen to music, photo editing, blogging on Wordpress, Office stuff, managing my websites via GoDaddy, Facebook...and that's pretty much it. Nothing too heavy, but the video stuff and photo editing are deal breakers for me.Out of the box I updated it & installed a Flash APK. I right away tested watching a video from Amazon Instant Video; did a jig when it worked perfectly!I love the display. All the video apps I installed worked really well with Hulu Plus being an exception, it was kinda jumpy, but I don't watch it all that much unless I miss one of my shows on cable.I practiced using all the different keyboard options, and the one I really like by far is the split screen option to use with your thumbs when holding the tablet horizontal. My second favorite option is the handwriting one, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Right now I am typing this using a Logitech bluetooth keyboard I bought, because I knew it would be a pain to type long emails or documents with a digital keyboard.I still haven't had time to test the PS Touch, but all I really need to be able to do is layer pictures, which isn't really taxing or anything.I did buy an adapter so I could use my USB drive, and it works perfectly! It recognizes all my pictures, videos, documents, PDFs, etc. I back everything up on my USB so it was really important to me that the My Files system worked well, and it does!I installed the Firefox browser and it works very fast and I really like the tab system. I can do work on the internet just like on my old laptop.I see myself being very happy with this tablet, and I also see it boosting my productivity. I need to explore the drawing apps and notetaking apps more, but I take a lot of notes throughout the day so I am sure I will find a method I like. So far I have installed Papyrus Beta, Quill, and LayerPaint. In 'testing' modes I enjoyed Papyrus the best. Another goal of mine was to increase how much I do artistically, and I want to explore watercolor techniques on here. The S Pen is awesome and I think with the right app I will be able to do so much more than with the ole' pen & paper!I've been playing with this thing for hours and I haven't had time to install any games, but I saw test videos online of people playing games and it seems fast with great graphics.If you have any questions let me know! I know I had plenty before deciding to purchase!EDITI played around with PS Touch and it worked great for layering pictures. I also went more in depth with LayerPaint & I loooved the watercolor effect, great app for any artist.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Digitizer is great, screen is fairly good. Writing sample attached", "Author": "Ibrahim Awwal", "ReviewID": "R35EPZ7CKAUWUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to do a full review, because there's plenty of those out there. However, what I wanted to see before I bought mine was a writing sample with a full page of writing so I could gauge how much text I can fit on a page. Unfortunately you can't really write as small as you could on paper, which is analog, but I was pretty satisfied with handwriting performance on my Galaxy Note 10.1. No lag to speak of, although the images were drawn a split second after I had moved on, but it didn't lose any information like my old Windows 7 tablet used to do when it lagged. The text is written using the Papyrus (Beta) app with the default settings. I was writing fairly fast so excuse the sloppy handwriting, but I think you'll agree that it's quite legible (and if it's not legible for you, I imagine that you could definitely write at a similar pace and understand your own handwriting). I was trying to show that you can write fast and still have good results, and I think I did. One thing that you should realize is that with an active digitizer like the one in the Note, you don't have to worry about keeping your hand off the screen as you write.Handwriting sample: (remove the space to open link) minus. com/lFGDz8vQlZUv3I also own a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and I have to say that in terms of looks, this is a definite step back, but I guess it's because they don't want to make something that looks like an iPad. No one (who knows of the existence of Android tablets) will confuse this for an iPad, that's for sure. The grey plastic bezel is pretty ugly, too bad they apparently can't use black or something. Wish they had spent some time on the exterior like they did with the Galaxy S3, which at the least looks unique. This tablet is slightly heavier than the original 10.1 but it's barely noticeable. It's got microSD and an IR blaster over the original but to be honest neither of these makes the device particularly worth upgrading for on its own.The screen's quality is passable. It's as good as you're going to get for a 10.1\" 1280x800 screen (unless Samsung decides to make AMOLED in that size) but we all want 1920x1200. Still, I wouldn't knock it for that. While it's slightly unpleasant that you can definitely make out pixels on the screen if you look not that closely, it's not a dealbreaker. You aren't going to fit more information onto a screen of this size by increasing the resolution.Bottom line is that if you want to do any handwriting/drawing on your tablet, this is *the* tablet to buy. There was a previous Lenovo Thinkpad tablet with an active digitizer, but that one was a first gen Android tablet and not nearly as good as this. If you ever try to use a capacitive stylus (eg. with the iPad or other Android tablets) you'll quickly realize that they're just unusable, if only for the simple fact that you can't rest your hand on the device, and they're never going to be anywhere near as accurate.Lastly I would like to point out that while Samsung has an S Pen SDK, Android 4.0 introduced pen input support natively to the OS so hopefully as these tablets get more common we'll have more and more stylus enabled apps that work across all devices.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing tablet that got a bad rap from tech reviewers.", "Author": "J. Rhyner", "ReviewID": "R382RL8EAL0NTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes it's plastic and the screen could be higher resolution....however.  I have seen the ipad 3 and the pixels actually look smaller on the note 10.1.  Also the nice thing about plastic is it doesn't dent or indent when it's dropped and usually leaves at most a scratch.Now for the pluses.  The addition of the pen is AMAZING.  It's actually a much more precise touch sensing that is so much easier to type on and browse because you actually hit the spot you are aiming for.  My typing errors have gone down to nil.  Snap a picture and then draw on it or capture any picture from the internet and use that.  Today I drew a transparent pumpkin over my sons head and made him a pumpkin head, the possibilities are endless.  The app ps touch which is used for drawing is essentially a comic book animators tablet, although about \u00bc the size at 10.1 inches.  I have read where someone was using it in class to write notes.  Make a mistake and press the back button and remove the pen stroke.  Love it.The only lag in this tablet I have noticed is using the app folder organizer because it has to load the fifty some icons I put into one banner folder slowing the main screen.  Not a large enough concern to upset me, you can always use the standard icons and folders and I'm sure this would be a problem with any current tablet.Battery life is great but the charge time could be a little less I have read 5 hours.So if you want a tablet with some added functionality and fun I would definitely consider this my first choice.Update: The speakers in this tablet have good sound the quality is in question now that my left speaker has gone out even though I never go over 3/4 volume.  This will be my third bad experience with Samsung products.  I have a big screen that has a rattle in the left speaker, a galaxy s2 that had circuitry battery drain problems and now this.  Now Samsung expects me to completely wipe my tablet and send it in for repairs and wait who knows how many weeks.

It's pretty close.", "Author": "Haidozo", "ReviewID": "R1FCH8DAA36T5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started looking for an Asus TF700 replacement because although it's an excellent tablet with a great screen, it has two deal-breaker problems--a flickering screen, caused by the permanently on dynamic contrast feature, and poor battery life. The Asus recommended \"Wipe Data\" didn't fix the problems and a TF700 I looked at in a local store also had a flickering screen.Although I really wanted to stay with a high-resolution screen, the available choices (Asus, Acer, Apple) all had shortcomings. The iPad3 had a great screen and long battery life but its permanent tether to iTunes and Apple's locked-down ecosystem placed it dead last on my list of any tablet. The Acer A700 had a great \"feel\" while holding it and a huge battery, but it has a reputation as a hand warmer.There are several tablets with 1280x800 screens and quad-core cpus but the Samsung Note 10.1 stood out for (a) its high price, (b) cpu benchmarks, (c) 2 Gb of memory, (d) better-than-average screen, (e) S Pen, (f) seemingly faultless operation, and (g) \"pro\" reviewers that didn't like it and users that loved it. Those seemed like reasons enough to buy one.Physical CharacteristicsMany don't like the look of the Note and dislike the plastic back even more. I think it looks fine. It's not flimsy, the tablet is solidly made, and the plastic back is probably impervious to dings and dents, unlike aluminum. Generally, I prefer plastic to aluminum for things that can be dropped. If you use water bottles made of both materials, you'll know what I mean. The Note is comfortable to hold with rounded edges but the plastic back could use a rubberized coating for more \"grip.\" Quality control is excellent and it comes with a charger, cable, and extra S pen nibs.ScreenThe 1280x800 screen is bright and sharp and although it isn't comparable to the TF700 screen, it's easy to read, fonts are sharp and clear, and colors are good. The screen doesn't collect fingerprints (is it coated?) and there's no flicker. Auto-brightness is on by default with brightness at 50%. The auto-brightness works well and after a week of use, I haven't even bothered to disable it. At 5% battery life, the screen dimmed considerably and video became too dark to watch although the browser could still be seen--sort of. Consider 5% the cut-off point for using the tablet.Stylus/Pen/FingersThe S pen works well for drawing/writing but a capacitive stylus (small tip) works better for me with everything else. Fingers work well too and no problems were experienced. The S pen doesn't have the heft or feel of a real pen, but after a minute or two using it, its odd size and shape were all but forgotten.Battery LifeWith the default settings--50% auto brightness, GPS and Wifi on, bluetooth off, and power savings mode off, I achieved an amazing 13:56 (hrs:mins) of battery life over three sessions before the Note powered itself off. The screen \"on\" time was 13:31. I did shut the Note off between sessions but at no time was it charged. My normal use includes reading, browsing, arcade games, music, and video, but no cpu/graphic intensive games. Still, I find a fourteen hour battery life hard to believe but I assure you it's real and I used it for every one of those 13.5 hours.ChargingThe Samsung charger is rated 5 volts @2A and the Note can also be charged from a PC USB port using the supplied cable. It charged from my PowerGen Dual Port 2.1A 10W Travel/Wall charger as well. Other 5V 2A chargers may also work. Time to fully recharge a totally drained battery is about 4.5 hours with the tablet turned off.NetworkThe Note worked at 2.4GHz and 5GHz (slightly faster at 5GHz) but at my usual chair, the 2.4GHz connection was good (4 bars) while the 5GHz connection varied from poor to poorer. The signal has to go through a few walls but the results are consistent with other wifi devices I've used here and the Note is no better or worse at 5GHz. Local network operations were free of any glitches and although I didn't measure any file transfer times, they seemed speedy enough. DLNA worked fine but I used Skifta and not the Samsung app.BluetoothAn Apple Mighty Mouse paired easily using Bluetooth and worked about as expected on the Note with its touchy...uh...highly sensitive tiny trackball. The Note also paired easily with a Mac but that's as far as I went since it isn't a configuration I'd use.SoftwareThe usual array of Google and other software is installed but Kindle is not. There's no backup app and that's a serious omission for business users or anyone else who needs to back up apps+data. Unless the tablet is rooted, backing things up could be a big problem depending on where the data resides. The TF700 has a terrific and easy-to-use backup app and Samsung should take \"note\" of that.The Note comes with a couple of book apps, and even if you add Kindle, you'll still be out of luck trying to read books or magazines on an SD card that you plug in, so plan on adding a reader that can find files on an SD card.The Samsung MP3 player works as well as any others and unless you need cover flow, it will be more than adequate. The video player works very well with local video files but I had some trouble with networked files and added another video player as an alternate.The Smart Remote app works at a basic level, has limited capability, and is far less easy to use than a dedicated or universal remote. If you're adding a media player and it isn't a Roku or AppleTV, you're out of luck. All devices have very limited functions in the app and if you like to hold your tablet in portrait mode, this app only works in landscape mode.Although there's no printer app, the Note can print to networked Samsung printers with the stock browser, Polaris Office, S Note, and Gallery--perhaps other apps as well. I turned on my printer (which is hard-wired, not wifi), hit print from the browser, and the pages came out. No configuration necessary....or possible, which is also poor from a user perspective.User ExperienceThe Note works smoothly without stutters, hangs, or glitches. Multiple apps don't seem to slow anything down and there aren't any moments (the TF700 had a few) where you wonder if something is going on behind the scenes that's holding things up. Some claim that the high-resolution screens cause the traffic jams on other tablets but the iPad3 doesn't seem to have that problem.The Note screen is equal to or better than most 1280x800 tablet screens and I have no complaints about it. I will complain that Samsung didn't use a higher resolution screen though. If Samsung had tacked on a high-def screen, they might have had the proverbial iPad killer and, arguably, lay claim to the \"best\" Android tablet on the market. I'm sure that in three months they'll be out with the Note HD model.Still, when comparing the Note to the TF700, the high-resolution screen on the TF700 lost its luster for me when it could only flicker for 6-7 hours at a time on battery. I spent a lot of time watching battery life, turning wifi off and on, and running with a dim screen in low power mode, just to make it last a bit longer. The Note, on the other hand freed me from that and it seems to have power to spare, even if it's not the most glamorous tablet on the market. Make no bones about it, the Note hardware is fast, bug-free, and it works.About those \"pro\" reviews....I wish they would have told readers what tablets they use--the models that meet their exacting requirements--so I could (perhaps) have bought one of those. Users got it right though. The Note is an excellent tablet with its only \"fault\" (in my opinion) being the lack of a higher resolution screen.

Not surprisingly I'm very happy with it - it has met and exceeded my expectations. In my particular case my netbook had a battery problem and getting a new one represented a decent fraction of the cost of something else. That and I only had one application that still used XP and I found a way around that on another PC.  Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.  So I had some experience with Android, although in the Fire's case it was pretty well wrapped up in the name of \"ease of use\".I'm not an Apple user - no particular reason other than I've been that way over 30 years. When looking for alternatives I can't say I even seriously considered an iPad.  I did look at the new retina display and, honestly, my eyes (older) can't make a case for the differential between the new iPad and the Note 10.1 on that issue. The device seems physically pretty solid to me so I can't see an issue here either. As I have with all portable electronics, I got a case (with a Bluetooth keyboard included - not high speed but it works) and put on a screen protector (just like on my smartphone). To me that's common sense; you have to judge your own risk level and the protections aren't that expensive relative to the device itself.Why Samsung? I've had good luck with their products (TV's, range, etc.) and to be honest, I resent Apple's claims to have \"invented\" things like rounded corners - more the shame of the idiots who granted them patents.But why the Note 10.1?  I had a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on order but having seen the limits (reasonable I think given the media focus) placed on Android app's in that environment, I was interested in something more open.  I like to use a stylus and the Note appeared to be built around it.  So with the need to replace a laptop and a desire for something with less confining an application set, the Note 10.1 seemed to be the place to go. (I think my existing Kindle Fire will still be good for quite a while, particularly when traveling.)Rather than talk about pro's and con's, I'd rather talk about my experience getting to know the Note 10.1.  First, I'd recommend that you get the Samsung SPSN app which gives you access to a set of videos, some of which focus on the Note 10.1.  Like most devices these days, everything is either \"intuitive\" or buried somewhere on-line if you can find it.  My intuition needs a boost now and then.View the available videos and you'll realize that the S Pen is pretty powerful and potentially useful.  You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it. (As an aside, the S Note application appears to have different capabilities depending on how you invoke it.)  I'd also recommend you try a drawing/art application; in my case I'd simply say the most common wasn't my choice for the best.  With the right app you can do some really neat things fairly easily.  I have yet to make it through the PS Touch tutorials (they've \"intuitive\" sort of - but I've found going to see their videos helps as well).  I think this will be a useful app as well.  As for S Note, I can't say it recognized my writing yet.There are some issues. If I want to print, I need a compatible Samsung printer (I have an HP).  But then again my HP isn't color and maybe I'll go for one for the art as well as photo's in general - Samsung printers get high ratings for color.What's next?  Well first, my wife seems interested - the last time she got interested I received my first Kindle and she took it over in a few weeks.  She tells me she can see better on the Note than on the PC (she had a detached retina a few years ago).  So I may end up with two of these one of these days.I really don't see, in my future, any more laptop/ultrabooks based on what this device can do.  For someone who bought his first PC in 1980 that says something.  I'll have a desktop for the high end stuff, like video editing, but I think the world has changed.  The Note 10.1 may not be everything, but it's enough to be a game changer, for me at least.  If you're thinking about a tablet, I suggest you give this device a careful look.  Check around for comparison videos, they may help you as well.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best", "Author": "S.

I purchased the galaxy Tab 2 exactly a month ago, but ended up returning it and waited for the Note. Wasn't that a smart move. The Tab just did not have it together. The screen was not very sensitive (compared to iPad and Asus brands), it was laggy, crashed several times, and the camera was laughable at best with no auto focus. PDF annotation was simply horrible. iPad and Asus tablets did a much better job annotating PDFs with the same capacitive pen than Tab.Galaxy Note on the other hand is a solid tablet. The screen is very responsive. The S-Pen is just perfect; although, I still haven't figured out how to use the back eraser. I was afraid that resting my hand on the screen while taking notes would produce artifacts, but it did not. One thing that I hadn't tried with the Tab was the Peel Remote feature. I had a lot of fun controlling my TV and DVR with this app. It's a very interactive and fun way to watch TV. You won't go back to the DVR remote if you give this app a try. I don't know if other tablets have the remote feature, but if they don't, this feature alone is worth getting the galaxy for.The back camera is 5MP, has a flash, and can auto focus. The Adobe Photoshop touch comes with some nice filters and many of the tools found in the actual software (Gradient, Fill & Stroke, Wrap, Camera Fill, Round corners, B&W;, Color Replacement, Curves, Shadows/Highlights, Noise Reduction, etc). The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations. You can write down anything from simple algebra to differential equations and it will solve it by Wolfarm Mathematica in a side window! Pretty amazing. Oh yes, and the side window...is great.Overall, I'm happy with this tablet. If you are deciding between this or the Tab or any other lower priced tablet, you should seriously consider the Note. It's indeed worth the extra $100.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good device....needs a few improvements", "Author": "damien", "ReviewID": "R86O6DAMNQWQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I got my Note 10.1 a few days ago a I`ve been playing with it, both for work and recreation.  First off, from a hardware perspective, I would have given it 4.5 stars.  For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?  This is NOT a TV and was never intended to be.  We`ve gone from black and white to 12\" color TVs all the way to easily available 60\" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10\" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42\" is for.  As a mobile device, the screen is quite adequate and brings the cost down. I actually see absolutely no problem with the graphics from the few videos I have watched.  Besides which, Samsung MAKES the Retina display, so their not including a similar display on their tab is sending a message.  It`s not needed.Storage-wise, all hail Samsung for the micro-SD slot....one would have thought that this would be a given for any tab, but...Camera-wise, it`s alright. Again, the device is not meant to be a camera...that`s what my Nikon and Sony are for.  For snapping random shots and posting online, it`s excellent.  Also the only tab with a flash!  Video chatting works great as well. So still 4.5 stars at this point.  My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.  I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.  This device is meant to be used mainly landscape, which means, either in hand or propped up on a case.  For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.  It`s fine if you have a dock, but nobody walks around with their dock...defeats the mobility of the unit.  There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.  So 4.5 stars on hardware  Love the S pen by the way.  Can`t wait for more apps to use its functionality as well as that of the quad core processor.Where the device lost some points with me is from a software perspective, which is from both a Samsung perspective and a Google perspective.  First off, I agree with some of the other reviewers when it comes to the UI....less is really more....don`t need all the widgets, they just slow me down.  A standard android interface would have been fine.  Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device. It locks up and the formatting is ridiculous.  I`ve had to download Firefox for Android. MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.  NO JAVA SUPPORT????  So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.  Also, no Flash for Android???? Google needs to get it`s act together on this one, and either do the development or get the other developers to do it.  All webpages should be functional on mobile devices. So down to 4 stars...not Samsung`s fault entirely, but I`m looking at the whole experience here.Finally, I bought this tab as a mobile alternative to my laptop for light processing, i.e. working on documents, some light graphic editing etc.  The tools available range from ok to really good, but Office replacements are limited in their functionality.  Hopefully as tabs get into the realm of faster, better processors and more storage space, developers will get some better MS-Office analogues going.In conclusion, excellent tab with a need for some improvement.  Can`t wait to see the next iteration...PS.  I forgot....it`s gorgeous!  As for the reported squeaky body, I haven`t felt that yet...besides, mine is in a case, so it wouldn`t matter...", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Functional and pretty", "Author": "Christina M. \"-C\"", "ReviewID": "RNY3C9VLXDGJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my tablet for about a week now and in that time have taken it on a very long road trip where I still needed to be able to take an exam for my grad school.  I am a grad student, pre-medical, and have my own business as a private tutor and this tablet is the answer to my needs.  My students love how easy it is for me to share concepts with them by drawing with the S pen.  At first I didn't love the browser, but after downloading a fully functional Google chrome app my speed was 10 times better and it works great.  The stylus is very handy and it's great that putting your hand down on the tablet does not interfere with your writing.  I've been using the formula to text option on the S note app where I write out the algebra 2 formulas I need to show them and they are instantly and accurately translated to text.Small things that have made the difference for me: when I try to click on something in a web browser it will enlarge the section I was clicking if there were multiple links, allowing me to select the correct one.

I am working on multiple projects, and having multiple notebooks or using loose paper (for archiving) is a big hassle. The S-Pen works fantastic! The supplied software works great, except one thing: the PDFs produced by S Note are not vector based, i.e., when you zoom they get pixelated. If you care about having vector based PDF output, you can get \"Papyrus\" and/or \"Quill\" from the Android market. Both work awesome for note taking!The battery holds up very well, I was using it pretty much constantly between 9am and 4PM and it was only down to 50%. It is very fast and smooth. The only that bothers me a little, is the custom charging cable that needs its own power supply (no computer charge).Edit: it turns out that the note does charge on any USB charger despite the red x that might appear. Keep in mind that this is a very slow charge and if you are doing something intensive on the tablet it  may not charge at all. At least is better than nothing.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bit of a Mixed Bag", "Author": "James Buchanan", "ReviewID": "R11ZGOF9GXI6AG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my Note 10.1 about three weeks ago (not from Amazon), and this is what I have found.I was attracted to the Note 10.1 because of the split screen option, which allows two or more programs to be run, used, and viewed simultaneously, and because of the active pen.  I envisioned having a pdf textbook open in Polaris Office on half of the screen while taking notes/ solving math/physics problems in the S-note program on the other half of the screen, all while lying on my back on the couch with the tablet propped on my chest.  Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.  So I went on line and discovered that the pen's sensitivity can be adjusted by popping off the pen's button and adjusting the potentiometer which is located underneath the button.  However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.  Through trial and error, I was able to get the setting to where I wanted it.Next, I discovered that writing with the pen is very different, and considerably more difficult, than writing with a pen on paper.  The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.  Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.  Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.  Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.  It's only a fraction of a second, but it's enough to mess up the normal feed-back mechanism in your brain that allows you to control your writing.  Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.  However, while using it for a few days, I was able to adjust my writing style to accommodate the pen's quirks, and I can now write with it at an acceptable level of ease and legibility.  It's not as easy or as neat as writing with a pen on paper, and small, intricate math symbols can be difficult to form, but overall it works.The tablet is advertised as being appropriate for graphic artists.  I'm not artistic, but I can't imagine being able to exert the sort of control that is required to draw with this thing.  I would also mention that the pen doesn't produce different line weights in response to pressure in the s-note program.  This function only seems to work in the sketching program.  It is supposed to be capable of producing somewhere in the vicinity of a thousand different line weights, but when experimenting with the sketch program, I could only produce a few different discernible line weights.  In the s-note program, you can select a single permanent line weight from a sliding menu of different line weights.The S-note program:There are limited templates offered for the note taking program.  The two I use are the yellow lined paper and the graph paper.  There is no blank, white, template offered. Note that the hand-writing-to-text and hand-writing-to-formula utilities aren't offered in the graph paper template for some unknown reason.  In the yellow lined paper template, they don't work very well.  I found that I have to write very carefully and legibly (which is difficult with the s-pen) for the hand-writing-to-text function to work, and once the text has been inserted into the note, it is difficult to edit.  The hand-writing-to-formula function is pretty much worthless.  While it is capable of converting some very advanced symbols, such as those used in general relativity, you have to be so very meticulously careful in forming the symbols for it to convert properly that it just isn't worth the effort.  Also, there is no way to edit the formulas once they have been converted and inserted into the note.  The Wolfram-alpha formula solving function, which works with the Wolfram website via the wifi connection to solve formulas you enter, works ok for simple formulas, for which it will solve the equation and produce a graph, but for any thing that is slightly complicated, like a second order differential equation, it just grinds away endlessly without producing a result.Multi-window:The ability of the Note 10.1 to run multiple apps simultaneously and display them side-by-side on the screen in their own windows is the high light of the device in my opinion.  It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.  Or, you can detach them and move them around, adjust their size, and have a third app running in another window in the background as well.  Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.  Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.  All the ones I use can be tiled - Polaris office, s-note, the internet browser, the video player, and email.  Polaris office, however, is not ideal for pdf viewing since it will not allow you to annotate pdfs, you can't book mark pages, and it doesn't seem to remember your place in a document consistently.  I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC. Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.  When you reopen the app, it will come back up in the window on the same place on the screen, but the document you had open previously (in the case of Polaris) will have to be reopened.Screen:This is, of course, a standard 1280x800 resolution screen.  I haven't seen one of the high resolution screens that similarly priced competitors have, like the Asus transformer infinity, so I can't compare them.  However, I will say that I have no problem reading small text on internet pages or on pdf files. Occasionally, I have to zoom in on a mathematical symbol to be able to read it clearly.  And text does appear slightly blurry around the edges.  I am guessing, from reading comparative reviews of the ASus transformer infinity, that these things would not occur on a high resolution screen.  Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.  It is bright and colors are vibrant.  Pictures look well defined and clear.  Videos, on the other hand, are a different matter.  Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.  But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).  Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.  Not good.  When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.  With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.  With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.  Forget about viewing pictures or movies in broad daylight - the screen is not nearly bright enough.Processor speed:It takes just a few seconds to start an app and load a file, even when running multiple programs.  Saving a file also takes just a few seconds.  Scrolling thru pages of a pdf file is quick and continuous, though there is a slight jerkiness.  Not enough to slow you down, just enough to be visually noticeable.  Boot up and shut down takes about 30 seconds, but there is really no need to do this - you can simply shut the unit down in the sleep mode, in which case it instantly turns off and on.  In the sleep mode, it uses practically no power at all.  If it had 75% of battery remaining when you put it in sleep mode in the evening, it will still have 75% remaining when you turn it on in the morning.  The unit will crash only once in a while - about once a week for regular usage.Wifi:The wifi has longer range than my laptop.  Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.  Weather.com home page takes about 5 seconds to load, Amazon.com home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.  Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie \"Immortals\" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours. Not bad.3) Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours. Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.  The screen set at 30% brightness as in entry 3) above was comfortably readable in a poorly lit room.Recharge time - for a completely depleted battery (which registers as 5% left), it took 4-1/2 hours to recharge to 100%.Build Quality:As other reviewers have noted, the note 10.1 does have a bit of a cheap feel to it.  The plastic back does flex a little under your hands, and there is a creaking noise when you push down on the edges of the screen, or apply a slight twisting motion to the tablet.  Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.  However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.  I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.  Also, you have to cover up the speakers with tape when you are spraying down the screen with glass cleaning fluid to keep from getting the fluid in the speakers.Price:Too high.  I payed $550 for mine.  It has since dropped to $500.  That's still $100 higher than the Asus transformer infinity.Final Verdict:Despite my criticisms, I find that I use my note 10.1 quite a bit, including the s-pen, and I'm not unhappy with it.  And, of course, if you need a tablet with an interactive pen and multi-windows capability, it's the only game in town.  I'ld say that if I had to do it again, I would have waited a few more months to see if the price came down.  If it came down to $400 or less, I'ld buy it.  For $500,probably not.  If you don't have a need for the pen or windows, you might be better off with the Asus transformer infinity, which has a high resolution screen, super bright screen, aluminum housing, and costs $100 less.  If you do need a tablet with the pen and windows, and are willing to put up with the pen's deficiencies, you might like the note 10.1, but I'ld wait for the price to come down.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I honestly have nothing bad to say about this", "Author": "Tina Vuotto", "ReviewID": "R36J375T47V6GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine 5 months ago, and I was waiting to review it once I used it for a while to give a good review, but after 5 months I still have no cons.Battery life - even if you use it a lot, it lasts longer than my current phone. I have used it at school all day and still been able to play on it at home without charging. If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge. (I have nothing on Push settings or the brightness us too high though). I typically charge every night and by the end of the day still have at least 10% and I use it a lot.Durability - I have not dropped it on the ground but I bring it everywhere with me in my bookbag where books and pencil bags knock into it and nothing has happened. Only scratch is the one it was shipped with (it was a refurbished model I bought and the scratch was only noticeable to me because I scoured it, when I asked everyone else no one found it until I pointed it out) I do have a cheap case on it too.Usefulness - I could go on for HOURS talking about how useful it is. The S note can record sound and record writing as you are taking notes. PERFECT for any college student or business person in a meeting. You can scroll through the sound clips after you save to find exactly what you are looking for. The multi-screen thing is BRILLANT! I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much. I used the multi screen for up to 4 things and it still ran fast. I opened everything I could open to test it and it still ran fast (that ran obviously a little slower than usually but still everything was so fast it surprised me I expected it to crash). I think it was like 20 things open with my Chrome having at least 15 tabs inside and it was still functional. Photoshop App that comes with it, totally rocks. You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it. There is a mode that detects your eyes so when you watch a movie, it won't just turn off on you. This also helped while reading textbooks and taking notes because sometimes if you have it to auto turn off too soon it would have turned off by that but it notices your eyes with the front camera.I can't even go into detail about everything, but it is the best tablet on the market if you need it for art or school. Hands down. I saved up so long and I am so happy with it. Everything was taken into account on this tablet, so many small details that you just discover and think wow. The first 3 weeks I learned something more useful every day. There is a auto block feature so your emails won't come through when your sleeping. You can change the standard font. When you are asked in a app how do you want to view this picture (for example it happens differently too) you can click on the gallery and when the app leaves the page it is like the powerpoint slide shows it skews the bottom and scrolls off the page, so fricking cute! So the Jellybean and Note together work so well. Everyone in my family has Ipads, and every single person is jealous of this. I love it. I am always recommending it to everyone. If you have doubt go to a store and try it in stores (that is what I did) and you can see how you like it.Also there is an aftermarket pen that is useful and more comfortable than the small stylus if you have bigger hands that still has pressure sensitivity.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great productivity tool for students", "Author": "Robert A.

Then I left it on top of the car and drove off. Needless to say they are not designed for that. It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work. Insurance bought me another. That purchase was the 7.0 plus.. Now that tab is my carry around one and I still love it and use it everyday. Then the 10.1 Note came out and not only did I buy this I also bought my wife the tab 2 10.1. She uses hers every day too. I am a photographer and use Photoshop  a lot. When I played with this tab in the store and found Photoshop Touch on it along with a quad core and 2 gig of ram, I had to have it. Can you tell I like Samsung? I've tried everything else and they all fell short of what I expected. I love the Touch Wiz that others complain about because it offers what I need. I've tried the other apps that are similar to the Touch Wiz but they fall way short. Launchers to replace it don't hold a candle to it. From icons being too small to spacing between them too far apart. Touch Wiz works well and on this tab, its perfect. My wife just bought the S3 phone and when she walks into the house with pictures she took of the grand kids, the automatically go to my Note. To browse or to edit in Photoshop Touch. Taking notes for me right now is just a gimmick but when I get it figured out I can see where it will come in handy. Its great being able to see what's on my other devices and use them as I need from one tablet. Music on any tab to my stereo system is awesome and is quite an issue to talk about when people see me using my tab to run it. And when I use the Peel remote that controls my TV, DVD, and sound system they are floored. Is this for everyone? Nope. But I've used the others and this  brand has my vote. People that have the iPad after seeing what I can do with my Samsung devices have sold theirs to get a Sammy. They are thankful that they've seen through the apple seeds. I would recommend these tabs to anyone. But the Note 10.1 is the king of the hill for tabs under 500 bucks. Sammy's are on the high side compared to the sub 200 dollar tab but then you are not measuring donuts to donuts either. I hope you find this review helpful.

Not only it is stereo, it is facing you, and it has plenty of volume to enjoy.The thing that bothered me the most about the iPad2's speaker was that, not only is it mono, it is located on the back.It bothered me to the point of searching and backing some \"Kickstarter\" project, so that I could redirect the sound from back to front.I was that desperate..S-PEN:S-Pen and PS Touch experience has been just amazing.It is not perfect, but it made it possible where it was impossible before.I could actual do semi-serious photoshopping with it.The S-Pen is pin-point accurate and the PS touch provided good set of tools, complete with good tutorials to acquaint myself.I hope one day, that I can work with RAW image files on this combo.MINI APPS:Some people think there aren't enough mini apps available. True, but I like to think in reverse.Having them and not having them make a quite the difference in my opinion.They are very handy, because they are popup apps that hovers over other app and can be moved around.It is nice to clip things and take notes on them, without needing to hop and switch from one app to the other.The whole process flows very well and naturally.PERFORMANCE (GAME):I think you will find plenty of youtube videos, demonstrating how well it can run some of the most heavy (CPU)hitting titles.My gaming experience has been the same. This tablet will chew up those games like it was designed to be a gaming machine, and it can be and it is.As of 8/30/2012, this tablet is the only tablet that I know that sports 2GB of memory.Along with 1.4Ghz quad core Exynos processor, it packs some serious performance.PERFORMANCE (MULTITASK):This is where that 2GB of memory shines.If the internal storage space and micro SD card are the filing cabinets, the system memory is the desk.Bigger the memory, bigger the surface area of the desk, where you can open more documents and lay them down, side by side.Since it has such a spacious(2GB) desk, it does not need to close already open documents to make room for new document to open.Every time your device closes the document or app just to reopen them again later from scratch, it occupies that much more processor time and eats that much more battery power processing it.Along with split-screen capability and pop up mini apps, multitasking on this tablet is A+.BATTERY LIFE:I do not always play games, or watch videos, but I do fair amount of them, and I am comfortable to say that I get 10+ hours, which is healthy amount. Charging time is around 3 hours if I let it go down to about 20%~30%.BUILT QUALITY:It could be better. So does the iPad in difference aspects.However, it will get the job done of protecting it.Just don't drop it, hard.Then again, it is a fair game for other tablets too.If you drop them hard, most of them will break just the same.REMINDER:I have couple of reminders.1st one is about the hidden goodies in Galaxy Note 10.1.There are many small details and features that you probably do not know about.While they are not a game changer, they certainly make the tablet experience that much richer.Some of the things you want to look into are.. Display Screen modes (Dynamic, Standard & Movie), Motion features (Tilt to zoom, Pan to move icon & Pan to browse images), two fingers pinch in sweep over your on screen keyboard to change mode (Qwerty keyboard, Floating & Split), in Floating keyboard mode, if you touch the keyboard with two fingers for about 2 secs, you can relocate the keyboard to any area on the screen. There are many other hidden goodies, so google for tips and tricks.2nd one is about Jelly Bean update.Samsung is preparing for the Jelly Bean update.When that happens, you will get the latest Android OS, BUT you will lose the Adobe Flash Player.Adobe Dev. no longer supports Adobe Flash player for mobile version, so if you value your flash capability.. then ***DO NOT*** upgrade it to JB.Remain on ICS until HTML5 becomes majority. That is what I am going to do. ICS is just perfectly fine as it is for me.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Purchased Just for Drawing/ Sketching", "Author": "kevin", "ReviewID": "R1G1JVHV3921CO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.  I am posting it since I hope it will help others with my particular focus.  The only reason I purchased this tablet was to be able to use it to digitally draw and paint.  If you think about it, spending 550 dollars on something that is really nothing more than a digital sketchbook is nuts considering a regular paper sketchbook works just as well.  However, I do not need to carry markers, paint or other crap with me to draw and I can use this in the dark sitting outside by a fire or whatever.  Originally, I was going to plunk down 1300 dollars for the Samsung Series 7 slate which is absolutely awesome (there is NOTHING better for the digital artist currently)but I just could not justify the cost.On to the review.  Since I was focused strictly on digital drawing and painting, the stylus use and sensitivity were important.  I currently own a Cintiq 21UX and a Wacum Intuos 4 wireless tablet and I love the Cintiq with how sensitive it is and how it responds with digital painting.  I held off buying any slates up to this point since other artist told me that I would be disappointed in the sensitivity and ability for detail using an apple or other droid devise with a capacitive stylus.  Of course, I know some nice stuff has been created using these tablets, even with fingers, but I was not at all interested in that effort.I received the tablet and and immediately purchased and downloaded Sketchbook Pro, one of my favorite apps.  I checked all of the settings to make sure the pen was set up and then I started to draw.  I would love to say it was love at first site but I was a bit disappointed.  The stylus does respond pretty good and the painting experience is good but it seems to falter a bit with detail or smaller lines.  It will skip sometimes and you have to go back and redo the stroke or brush mark.  Sketchbook pro does work well on this tablet and the program has a lot of nice features but this review is not about Sketchbook.Other things I noticed is that it does not have an eraser ( I knew this when I bought it)which could be pretty handy but it is not necessary.  I do like how the stylus fits into a dedicated hole on the slate.  The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.  I have read about the plastic back and although it does not really bother me, I do find myself handling this thing cautiously.  I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.  Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel \"cheap\".  The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.  As for a programs, I do not have much to say there since my focus is really on using this as a drawing tool.  However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.  I will try setting it up again since I think this would be a pretty cool feature. The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.  I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.  It does seem to take a bit of time to charge fully.Is the tablet worth the money?  I don't know...I guess so but I am rarely excited about spending 500 dollars or more on anything really.  I think 375 or 400 dollars for this sort of tablet would be justifiable but what do I know.  I do think if you are considering any slate at all, I would look at this one seriously since it can do everything an Apple or other Droid can do PLUS it has the stylus for note taking and drawing.  I gave it 4 stars because I can draw pretty well with it.  I would give it 5 stars if the stylus worked a bit better with light touches on smaller brush sizes.  I do think this trend of using a stylus will hit it big with artists and students so I am sure something better may come along for the same price in a year or two.  As I mentioned previously, if you want that better slate now, look at the Samsung Series 7 Slate.  Truly an amazing tool if you are okay spending that kind of money.  If you want some of that experience but on a smaller budget, then this is probably the way to go.  I will used this slate I have for awhile and then try to update this review.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "As a student, I don't get whats so great", "Author": "Bryan Williams", "ReviewID": "R165ZDW4R7A6F0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After using a note 10.1 for 10 days now for college, I personally don't get it. The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once. If you have a browser open and are downloading something, and have sNotes next to it, when you tap over to sNotes, the browser stops downloading. Why you may ask? Because in reality you just closed your browser, you just don't know it. Then, for the classes I'm taking the apps that do offer the multi-tasking are useless. I need to use the apps for my particular set of classes: Wolfram alpha, real calculator, greys anatomy for example(bioengineering/premed), as well as browsers like firefox, or chrome. Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack. It's gonna be a while before they do I suspect.The mini apps at the bottom are also useless in quality and content to me and they are one more thing that gets pressed and opens when I hand my tablet to someone else. If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would. I hate it. Its almost as bad as taking notes and having your ability to write all of a sudden stop because you've activated either the notifications window or the mini apps by accident.Personally, the customization of minute things in the OS are just not interesting to me and I've noticed that many of the settings that my HTC phone offers are just missing all together. However, androids always felt almost done, but not quite done to me any way. However, samsung then come along and really don't help the cause at all.Can any one tell me why I need multiple clocks or weather widgets all telling me the same thing over and over in multiple screens? Apparently, android developers see the need to offer me the ability to tinker with my OS settings multiple times a day. I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.I believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones. Why put soft buttons where we hold the tablet or rest our palms?I've tried implementing the stylus pen into my math and science class note taking, but really, it just costs me time. if I need to grab a graph of some sort that I've drawn to move in my notes, forget it, it's only grabbing pieces of the drawing at a time. Every time you lift the pen, the tablet considers it a new drawing, instead of letting you choose an area of lines and deciding that everything in such area is your drawing in its entirety. I don't understand why it allows me to type right over the top of annotations I've made, and the write to text is just (for me) unreliable. The terminology is just not in the data base and my corrections would not stick.The hardware sounded great on paper, and for the most part I've had no issues with lag or connections. In walking around in Bestbuy I see more responsive tablets. In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung. I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs. 18 credit hours this semester and this tablets cost me so much in wasted time I feel like billing samsung. I pull out the ultrabook and blaze through note taking, look up things like graphs and insert them into my notes infinitely better. I save and annotate pdf's just fine and all my school books are through kno.com. Personally, I just think tablets are for light stuff. I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tablet that serves many functions PLUS the S-pen", "Author": "Imaginary Fox \"Kitsune\"", "ReviewID": "R2GA6ZEOUZH32J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My background is I'm on my desktop PC running WinXP and had a old low-end laptop which I no longer have, but had enjoyed the portability with. I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC. I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company. This made me favor the Android system, because it was more open.I did a LOT of research on tablets to see what fit my needs best, and I know there are even others that are more like a laptop, with a detachable keyboard, like the Transformer series. This one was as much as I wanted to spend, most of the others that were attractive were also higher-priced (for good reason). Ones like the Surface Pro, while really cool, were out of my price range. The other one I was more seriously looking at was the Nexus 10, but I wanted the better pen experience over the better resolution.One thing I want to make clear about the S-pen is this is the ONLY tablet that currently uses Wacom technology, which is the best for artistic work. Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets. No other tablet has ACTUAL pressure sensitivity and a normal style of pen.However, the unfortunate drawback of it being an Android tablet is that iPad actually has a couple superb art apps that are not available for Android, which I find ironic :( But that doesn't mean we don't get good apps. The tablet comes with Adobe Touch, but frankly I don't think its the best one, even though its the most expensive on the app store normally. Adobe has sadly pretty much pulled out of the Android market altogether save for this app, and I wouldn't be surprised if it never sees a real update of new features. I feel a lot of bitterness towards Adobe for this. I was going to pick up Ideas even though I knew it was really limited, but it got pulled from the market before I got my tablet. The main reasons I don't recommend Touch are severe limitations in file saving and opening. Other apps can give you .psd support, layers, and S-pen support without as much hassle. Adobe only lets you save files on their Cloud.The most recommended art apps are Sketchbook Pro and Layer Paint which I think weren't more than $3 each. They both seem solid and highly-reviewed but I havn't used them enough to offer a real opinion yet. There are of course a bunch of others, I grabbed ZenBrush to try it out since it was free. I was looking for something that supported layers and I could export to continue to work with in Photoshop CS on my desktop and those two seem to fit the bill.Now that I've got that out of the way, I have to say I love this tablet. I feel like every day it blows my mind how cool it is :D It has replaced everything I can do on my desktop PC save for extensive programs like full Photoshop or large games like Guild Wars 2. Web browsing, art files, documents, light games, music, videos, it does it all. This tablet is great on its own for regular functions, but having the S-pen makes it amazing.I'm looking forward to the Jelly Bean update, because I think this tablet will keep getting better. (The reason Jelly Bean takes longer for this than a Nexus is Samsung does tweaking for support of the S-pen and some other modifications, but it should be hitting really soon.)I honestly hope Samsung keeps this line of tablets going in the future, and while I am happy with how this tablet is, I see some ways they could continue to improve. I look forward to a Note 2 when the time comes, though I don't think it will be soon. I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.So, here's a rundown of some features:I love that it had a micro SD expansion slot. The main thing I didn't like about the Nexus was the lack of memory expansion. This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card. I plugged the tablet into the computer and was able to move my files onto the tablet card as easy as moving them to a flash drive. It just can take a while for a large volume of files. I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it. I already had some extra space unlocked, but getting the huge chunk of free space for 2 years is awesome. This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are. I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos). I trashed most of the default layout pretty quickly. Some of the side bars from Samsung aren't that useful, but I just tweak or ignore them and they don't get in my way.So far I've had no problems with the tablet's performance- no crashing or hanging or anything. It runs smoothly and quickly.It finds and connects to wifi easily. Most settings are very quick to access and modify. It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life. It generally lasts 2 days of pretty heavy use- I've never run out so far. I generally charge it every other day, though other electronics (like my phone) I charge every night.The resolution may not be top of the line, but it looks great to me. I enjoy watching video files (which is supports a god range of) as well as apps like Netflix and Crunchy Roll.Polaris Office comes included and can handle Microsoft documents, so I was able to open whatever I needed! It also supports Adobe Reader for .pdfs.The speakers are good, but I also love that it has a headphone port. I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it. The music stays on in the background if you're doing something else with the tablet.I figured out most stuff with the tablet quickly just by poking around, although Samsung for the most part tells you very little other than a brief feature overview booklet. But hey that's what Google is for. I generally just looked up any questions I had. I'd say only folks who aren't comfortable on computers may have some trouble diving in. I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good. You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet). It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading. It just takes the tablet a second to orient in any direction.I've seen some people complain that the side-by-side feature for running a few select programs is kind of lackluster, and they have a valid point, but I didn't really mind. I read how the feature worked, but it wasn't something I really planning on using much. If this is a reason you're buying this tablet, keep in mind its limited to a handful of programs, and it does take a moment when switching for that program to activate. Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive. It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great. If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got. Its about equally as good as a normal cell phone for just taking a quick pic you want to post to Twitter. It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion. It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something. It gets the job done, its just not going to make amazing vacation photos.I believe you can get a Samsung or bluetooth keyboard for this separately, so you can get more of a laptop feel. I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen. I'd say you probably only need a keyboard attachment if you plan on typing a LOT, for instance writing a book or something and don't want to use the pen.One thing that's been a concern with tablets is the lack of support for Flash. With the number of websites and such that use Flash, I thought it'd be a problem, but so far I havn't even noticed. Most extensive Flash or video sites (like Youtube) have an app to use instead.I'm currently waiting on a case to come- I'd like to keep it in my purse/bag, and while it seems solidly built, I don't want to worry about it rubbing against other things like my keys and getting scratched. I had a hard time deciding on a case, hopefully I picked a good one. I like that some of the cases offer folding options to function as a stand for your tablet, so I think a case is a good addition if you can find one you like. Be aware some do not have a slot cut for the pen!My nitpicks about the tablet would be that its a little heavy to hold freehand over a period of time to read, watch video, or whatnot, but I don't have a problem resting it on my legs or something else. It doesn't get hot like a laptop at all.I also don't feel like the charger fits in the bottom well- it doesn't really click in, you just kinda wiggle and push it in and out. Over time I'm afraid it may have a tendency to get loose.Would I recommend this tablet for everyone? Not universally. You are paying extra for the Wacom screen technology and also sacrificing some resolution, so if you're not in love with the S-pen, then I'd look at other tablets. I don't think this tablet is for your average person who mostly wants some media and internet consumption- there are better tablets if the pen doesn't matter to you.For a purchase like this, I recommend you do what I did- find a local store that has one on display to try. I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy. I also went to several office stores to try out other tablets. Poke around in S-note, see how you like the feel of the pen (though be aware it may have been abused and not work as well as it should.)Should you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory? I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one. I popped it in the small port not long after I got the tablet going for the first time and it recognized it no problem. 16+64= 80GB which is likely far more than I'll ever need. The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie. You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it). After getting any app that sounded interesting and filling up a chunk of my card with a large part of my music collection and videos, I'm at 9.3GB free on the system, and 30.2GB on my card, so I don't feel like I'm in any danger of running out of either.I've had it a couple weeks at this point so not really had time to test out all the details extensively, so I'll update this review later on.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth it", "Author": "Miriam", "ReviewID": "REBPK101QYWG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this model because for just $50 more, it doubled the storage from 16gb to 32gb (yes, white is pretty, but it doesn't come in 32gb).Pros:* Multitasking.

No more switching from browser to gallery, or gallery to email, etc etc.* Processor is snappy. Quadcore 1.4 GHz is great.

This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.  Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.  Re-inserting the pen re-enables the finger touch functionality.Shutting down the tablet and leaving the pen out, then re-testing pen function after turning it on still has no pen function.Great, THE PEN IS NOW USELESS.I know my way around the Android OS having used my Samsung Vibrant(rooted to ICS) phone for the past two years, and also have used an Archos and an Acer Honeycomb tablet both upgraded to ICS.  With that said, none of the settings in the options are able to bring the pen functionality back.I'm now wondering if it's a magnet issue within the pen.  But I'll need to decide if I want to return this thing for a replacement or deal with Samsung Customer Service which I know will not be fun.*EDIT 8/29/12:  Just adding more after a little more testing.I turned on the tablet today, to try again to see if it would resolve itself.  Same problem still.  But now, I notice that after the tablet enters sleep and waking it up with the power button, the touch panel is dead without even pulling the pen out to cause the dilemma.So I force restart now, and go into options to do a factory reset.  For those that don't know what this does, is that it'll reset the tablet to the condition as if it were coming out new in the box.  I just wanted to try this as a last ditch effort, but still dead touch panel problems.I'm convinced to send it back to Amazon now.  I'm fairly disappointed, because for the past week, I was quite happy with it.  I've also ordered a few accessories from here on Amazon which haven't even arrived yet.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tablet for serious users", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2BIPP103SYLVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review using the handwriting recognition tool. I like the fact that this tablet can convert My chicken scratch into text as quickly as I can write it down. I've had this tablet for 2 months so I've had plenty of time to explore it inside out.I've read other reviews that complained about the screen resolution. I'm a graphic artist and it is perfect for me. I've played with the updated 2014 version and while the display is brighter, and the interface is almost identical to the Note 3 (which I also own), this version is still a solid tablet, especially with the new lower price tag. So if you want to save a couple hundred dollars I would not count this tablet out.The S pen is VERY Useful to me. It feels comfortable in my hand and is very responsive. I prefer its position at the bottom of the tablet to the upper right corner where the 2014 version has placed it. The s pen interface for this tablet is like the one Used in the Note 2. So if you own or have owned that phone, it will be very familiar to you.The multi screen feature is ok, but I do prefer the 2014's updates which allows more programs. I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag. You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it. I love that you can fully customize this device and truly make it your own.This tablet is geared toward people who want to do more with their device than browse the internet and Stream movies. while I would not call this a Computer replacement, it has made my job easier with Polaris Office and PhotoShop preinstalled. It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player. I have several movies in .avi format and have found an app that plays them perfectly and with the big screen and front facing Speakers with great Sound, it's just a great experience.Bottom line, I give this a glowing review. I have a Samsung Laptop, Note 3, and now the note 10.1. Iexen have a Samsung refrigerator. I'm not a brand loyalist, they just happen to make devices that cater to my needs and are reliable.One thing I do hate to read about in these Reviews is when they compare this tablet to the iPad.

This review details my experience since I could find zero reviews or help (including going to the Samsung store) to find out.  1.  Samsung gives you Kies which lets you transfer all your music to the tablet easily.  Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.  Kies is great and works just as well with photos.  2. Videos were impossible.  The way digital copies transfer to play in ITunes makes it hard to watch on your tablet.  You would need to download and/or pay to convert your files to a readable format.  Luckily, we also have a pc with a windows os so we were able to re download digital copies (from blu-rays) and download an app on the tablet to be able to play videos. So, if you have windows, it will be easy to transfer your videos to the tablet.  The ones that expired I have not converted yet and do not plan on it as I do not need that many movies on the tablet but it was annoying.  In the end, I love this tablet especially as more apps have become available.

Video files are easy to copy from my computer to the tablet with the provided USB cable.

I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos. The tablet comes with 50 apps but I haven\u2019t experimented with more than a few of them so far.

This is my first tablet, and as such I did much research to figure out which one would suit my needs and wants the best.Let me start off by saying that the only real worry I had about the tablet was the screen resolution.  I had watched and read many reviews and comparisons and the main concern that always came up was the resolution was not that great.  I have to say that even though it is only 1200x800, it's still VERY beautiful to me.  You will notice a difference if you've used a new iPad or one of the higher end new Android tablets, I'm sure... but the screen isn't as bad as many make it out to be.  It's very overstated.  The other thing that concerned me, not really Samsung's fault, was the fact that Android tablets have few apps that are specifically designed for them.  This is still bothersome as apps like Facebook, twitter, and games all have a smartphone feel.  It's something to consider, but for me it wasn't a deal breaker.I purchased the white version of the tablet, and it looks beautiful.  The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.  This was genius by Samsung, and I bet future tablet makers will follow this trend.  Unless Samsung patents the idea, and says no... which would be quite awesome!  Anyway, I digress.  Beyond the speakers, the tablet is light and plastic.  The feel is nice, but I bought a case due to using it for school.The actual software is now updated to Jellybean, which is great.  The tablet is fast as heck.  I run games, movies, internet browsing, and s-notes all without any issues.  It's lightning quick.  The keyboard is wonderful.  Even better though, and a major reason I decided on this tablet, is the S-pen.  This is what separates this tablet from every other.  The S-pen combined with pressure sensitivity and palm rejection is a dream come true.  I will be using this tablet as my notebook when I return to class.  The idea of being able to take notes and access my textbooks all at the same time was something too wonderful to pass up.As a first time tablet buyer, I'm thrilled with this tablet.

I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.  They are all set up on our wireless network.  From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.  There are more ways of adding widgets and customization than the Ipad.  There is also a multi view option that allows you to access web applications while taking notes, tracking wireless signals, email, or anything you could do on a PC that has dual video cards.  It also opens Word, Power Point, or Excel documents with an app that comes standard.  These can be placed in the Dropbox app that the device asks you to sign up for when you first start the device.  I can also set up a VPN or even have it connect to my archive server, sync, and create a backup.  From a non-technical stand point, it is very user friendly and can keep you connected with any social media.  It also has IR that can turn your tablet into a remote for your TV.  This is more than just a remote, it gives you an app that shows you what is on, on each channel your provider has.  You tap the show and your TV changes to it.  My Samsung phone has many apps and what not on it.  When I set up the tablet to my email that I use on my phone it brought all my data over to the tablet.  You can even use the pen that comes with the tablet to take notes or play games.  There is also an Allshare app that lets you transfer media from tablet to TV, to Phone, or PC.

Some reviews I read (or watched) complained that the fact that the back is plastic made the Note 10.1 feel cheap to them. Maybe I'm not as discerning, but I'm thrilled with the build quality of the Note 10.1. It's very thin, very light, but also very solid feeling. It doesn't look or feel at all \"cheap\" to me.Other reviewers (users and \"experts\") also talked about the screen and the fact that it's only HD (720p) not Full HD (1080p). Regardless, the screen of the Note 10.1 is gorgeous to my eyes with excellent viewing angles, vivid colors, and fantastic contrast. You'll only notice the 720p resolution when reading books or text--and then only if you look closely. It's still totally satisfactory and not at all annoying to me. One thing about the 720p: the lower resolution is probably at least in part intentional because it requires less power to push the reduced number of pixels, and therefore the device can run more smoothly for longer than it would if it had the higher resolution screen.In any case, the Note 10.1 runs very fluidly with gorgeous graphic transitions between screen, loading everything with aplomb and speed. This is one very fast machine. On that note, make sure that you delete the built-in Samsung widgets which are installed on most of the screens initially. Doing so dramatically speeds up the interface, and you won't miss Samsung's *other* products (i.e., everything but S Note).My personal concern was as a student I worried about the stylus functionality. I worried that perhaps hand writing would lag too much--i.e., show up on the screen after I'd already finished drawing a character of a word. I haven't been able to find many videos showing how well the handwriting works. And no the videos on youtube showing the handwriting recognition don't help me because I don't every use handwriting recognition. I just want a tablet that keeps up with my handwriting and renders it well on the virtual page. The Note 10.1 does so. It captures my handwriting in exactly the way I want it captured--it looks, in other words, similar to how it looks on paper. It's chicken-scratch on a paper page, and it's still chicken-scratch on the virtual page in the Note 10.1, but that's what I want. And yes, it totally keeps up with my rapid writing and drawing. In every way the note taking experience on this machine is totally satisfactory. I'm also looking forward to reading and annotating pdfs on this device. The screen dimensions are optimal for viewing, reading, and writing--and doing all three on the go.Seriously. If you're on the fence as I was, get off! This *is* the device you want. It can do everything the iPad can do, and more. Not only can you consume all the media and play all the games that you can on the iPad, on this device you can also create media (i.e., take notes, annotate documents, etc.). While the Microsoft Surface isn't out yet, as I hear it the Surface RT (the entry-level model) fails to offer palm-rejection. This is a major oversight as you pretty much need solid palm rejection to support using a tablet for notetaking and writing. The Note 10.1 is excellent in this category as well. I was able to rest my palm on it and scrawl away without issue. Awesome.Samsung really hit it out of the park on this one. I highly recommend the Note 10.1.[UPDATE 12/1/12]I've been using the Note 10.1 for over a month now and have more to add to my initial review. I still really like the Note 10.1 but as the newness wears off, so does some of the infatuation. It is still the best device in its class (tablet with a stylus for a relatively affordable price), but it's not perfect. The back of the case wears a little quicker than I'd like and the inking experience, while good, could be just a tad bit better. I hear the inking experience is supposed to be improved by the upcoming Jelly Bean update which I hear will arrive in the next month. We'll see. I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe. The inking is certainly good enough to be effective for notetaking in class or meetings or using as an infinite notepad on your desk at work. It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it \"flows\" onto the screen as you write. The device will be just the slightest millisecond behind your movements...not really enough to matter, but just enough to notice it. Also, I'm not certain if it's the app I'm using (LectureNotes--very good) or the device, but occasionally the accuracy of the pen can be quirky. A letter I've just written might have a random artifact jutting from it. Not a big deal and easily remedied by the eraser tool and rewriting the character, but a slight annoyance. I do suspect that that specific behavior is probably a LectureNotes idiosyncrasy though perhaps caused by my attempts to write as I'm lowering my hand to the screen or lifting it, triggering both inking and palm-rejection behavior at the same time with the occasional artifact resulting. Again, these are small niggles. I'm still glad I bought the device as it is the best tablet with a stylus within several hundred dollars or the price-point.The back of the device is plastic and it picks up fingerprints like nobodies business. You'll get used to wiping your device down every day just to keep it from looking all ghetto from all the fingerprint smudges. Also the back wears (scratches) easier than I'd like from resting on flat surfaces. Simply putting it on my desk at work, and tables and counters at home, has caused certain raised spots (I'm guessing) where the electronics press up against the plastic back to wear: loose the new plastic shine, and have lots of tiny scratches. They're not SUPER apparent (especially when covered by fingerprints), but when you wipe the device down you'll see them in the glare of overhead lights. It's just a small annoyance that I feel could have been easily rectified had Samsung selected an equally lightweight but better wearing material for the back: like maybe some soft-rubberish coated plastic? I do like that the plastic probably helps a lot in keeping the device at its lightweight--which is partly what makes it so imminently useful and usable. It just needs to be more durable.In any case, after a month of using the Note 10.1 I am still glad I bought it. And I should say that once you remove the widgets that come on the main screens of the device it really flies. I'm thrilled with its performance, but I hope it's sturdier than it seems like it *might* be. Keep in mind for my review of the Note 10.1 that I (and my wife, who somehow wears devices down a bit more rapidly than I do) use the Note 10.1 very heavily at work, school, and home--so my/our satisfaction is as power users of the device.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ultimate tablet for professionals and artists", "Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "RPE2CO9GX1QRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally, a professional level tablet that I've been waiting for.

I honestly prefer reading books on a 7 inch tablet because they are lighter but when looking at pdf documents this tablet is much better. I decided to put a case on the tablet and it the weight went up quite a bit thought :(As far as using the S-Pen and S-Note i can't really complain much. The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with. S-Note works pretty well for the most part. The shape match and formula match features are fantastic although they could use a little more refinement. As an engineer student i like the formula match feature a lot since i often have to write down a lot of long formulas. There are times when the program seems to get confused with some of the Greek letters used on the formulas and it can get a bit annoying at times. Like i said, it needs refinement.The battery life is one of the first things i look at when buying a portable electronic device. Very pleased so far with its performance. Easily gets me through the day even after taking notes through out the day. I use the brightness at about a quarter and it is enough for me. Don't expect the battery to last the entire day if you have the brightness all the way up while playing HD movies all day. It is just not realistic. If you are indoor web browsing, taking notes, checking e-mail and watching a few videos it should last the entire days with no problems.The tablet takes at least 4 hours to charge fully which is a bummer. The cable that comes with the tablet is pathetically short. I don't get why all of the manufacturers insist on giving us this 1 foot long cables to charge the electronics. I guess they don't want to spend a extra 10 cents on a another couple feet of wire. I ended buying a longer cable from Amazon.I have no problems with the display at all. It is more than adequate for reading and watching movies. The display on the Ipad 3 is better and you can certainly notice the difference when you look at them side buy side. But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet. I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed. The camera is very, very mediocre. My Samsung Galaxy S3 came out 6 months before and takes much better pictures.The speaker's sound quality and the sd card slot for extra storage are big plus.with this i want to wrap up my review.

I bought it mainly for use in my university classes and for drawing. I haven't used it much for drawing yet, but it has been excellent for my university classes. The S-Pen works very well and is quite accurate.The only word of warning with this is that you should AVOID any tablet cases that have magnets in them. The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen. If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen. The floating pen position indicator will move in a direction that is away from the magnet. This means that if within one centimeter of a magnet the digital pen tip will deviate from the real pen tip by 1-3 millimeters, which makes writing quite difficult. For some reason, a lot of the cases that are indicated as being for this tablet have magnets in them. Whoever designed these cases obviously had very little knowledge of how the S-Pen works because these magnets really mess with the pen accuracy on the screen if they get too close. Although, it's important to note that this isn't permanent, it only happens when a magnet is currently near the screen.Other than that frustration (that took about a week to figure out), this tablet has worked excellently. In regard to the tablet's other functions, they also work very well (probably better than most tablets because of the larger processor and large amount of RAM). The multi-tasking works pretty well, and it can be quite useful at times such as when your in class writing notes and your professor recommends a website for some useful information. I often use it when doing homework on my tablet. Where I'll be reading my homework (a word document or PDF), and then doing it in an app like S-Note. In regard to the other aspects of the tablet, it's pretty much the same as most other android tablets that you'll find except that this tablet might run a little faster than the average tablet. The main advantage of this tablet over other tablets is the S-Pen. If your buying this tablet, it should be for the S-Pen. If you don't care for the S-Pen, the you should buy a different tablet because you could get more for you money if your willing to give up the S-Pen functionality. I think this tablet is well worth the price, but it's because I'm making great use of the pen, and this tablet is exactly what I was looking for.I'll probably update this review as to whether or not this tablet is good for drawing once I get a chance to really draw something with it.Update (Drawing):I recently tested out this tablet's drawing capabilities, and I would say that it's pretty good. It's not nearly as good as my laptop and Intuos 5 drawing pad, but honestly, the main limitation seems to be the software available. I'm using Sketchbook Pro for tablets, and it works quite well. It's pretty smooth, and it's interface has been optimized rather well for tablets. I didn't experience any slow downs while using it, so the Galaxy Note 10.1 handled the program quite well. In all honesty, the main difference between doing digital art on my Galaxy note 10.1 and my laptop with Wacom drawing pad was the lack of features available in the Sketchbook Pro app. The research I've done seems to indicate that Sketchbook Pro is one of the best apps out there for drawing on android tablets, and while it's quite good, it simply can't compete with the range of features available on a computer based program such as GIMP. It felt like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 could have handled more, but it seems that the program wasn't really built with this in mind since it's missing features that could have been easily included. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, it still works quite well because these limitations can't change the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has decent pen accuracy, which allows you to work with a decent amount of comfort when drawing. It's a little trickier to do some of the fancier things, but the basics are there, and you can do quite a bit with the basics. I did a little bit of concept art with it, and I was pretty happy with the results. It's not high detail art, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is definitely viable for rough concept art work. The only gripe with the hardware that I'll mention is that there are a few spots on the screen where the pen location detection is off by 1 or 1.5 mm they are mostly near the edges of the screen. Sounds small, but it can be annoying when drawing a small detail, but it's not a big deal since you can simply move the canvas with a quick two-fingered swipe. There's not much else to say about this tablet. Overall, it's pretty decent for drawing, but the apps are a bit limited. Hopefully, the available apps gain more features in the future as people realize the potential of android pen tablets like this.If you want to see what I was able to do with it then you can check it out at my DeviantArt account, which can be found by simply googling my name.

As soon as I exited the video,  it automatically sent back into portrate.The S-Pen does take getting used to, if you haven't used a stylus on a tablet before,  it works great.  S-Note's idea pad is very useful,  allowing you to add images,  video,  as well as audio into the notes.The battery life is great,  I was using it one day, then put it to sleep (one click on the post button), and did open it till the next day, and it was still in the same battery level as before, and yes the wifi was on.The S Calender automatically sync with my Google account as soon as I logged into the tablet.The dual screen experiance works fine.For the keyboard it has the Swype feature,  which I find easier then typing,  it can be turned on our off.The E mail app that comes with it allows you to add different emails from different providers, ie gmail, go daddy, ect. And has a \"combined view\" , that shows you all the emails from all those inboxes. Even the gMail app works great on the tablet.This tablet is very slim too, light, and powerful.It's perfect if your a creative person,  especially some kind of artist or musician,  a note taker, or a student.I would absolutely recommend this over the iPad without a second thought.Enjoy", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 10 inch Tablet!", "Author": "KaTzPJamas", "ReviewID": "R1FKXRPNZXWEVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is kind of biased because I am anti Apple products however Android can be a terrible experience if you don't have the right specs in the tablet itself. I'm a spec stickler when it comes to the internal components of computers and stuff but I think this has all the right specs with its quad core processor and 2gb ram. I actually bought this tablet for $350 from the warehouse deals and received it a couple days later (Amazon Prime). The tablet, was in near perfect condition in the original box with everything its suppose to come with. All the peelable plastic was still on and the screen was blemish/scratch free. I managed to find a teeny tiny scratch in the corner of the gray plastic. Otherwise, near perfect condition as I said.Here are the great things about this tablet.-Samsung released android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) for this tablet which equals better performance and a few extra things here and there.-16gb storage space is sufficient. I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb. Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something. I just stream everything media related via Hulu+, Netflix, Youtube, or Spotify/Pandora. So I don't care much for the space.-The quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly. The tablet runs as smooth as butter. No Hiccups.-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.-Samsung has their overlay over the stock android interface. Personally I like it a bit better.-Samsung has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet. The good news is they aren't complete junk. I find them useful because I'm a student.-very responsive. The touch screen is great.-the tablet has an IR blaster so I can control my own TVs and other things with the tablet.-Smart Stay. Samsung has an option called Smart Stay. Normally with a smart phone or tablet you will be looking at something on the screen. Occasionally you have to keep touching it for the screen to remain on without defaulting to off. With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you. It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it. If you are looking at the screen the device will remain on and you don't have to do those occasional touches to reassure your tablet that you are still using it and make sure it doesn't automatically turn off.-on screen keyboard is customizable. Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on. The keyboard can be changed in 3 different ways. It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side. It works well if you are holding it widescreen so you can type with just your thumbs and still maintain a good hold on the tablet.Something to note is that this tablet can do certain apps side by side on the screen. I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful. However, I do use it for taking notes on the note app. The S pen inserts right into the tablet and blends in seamlessly. You'd never know its there unless you're looking for it. Again, the S pen is a personal opinion. I like having it as an option but I don't use it 95% of the time. Vanity is vanity I will say.-The screen resolution. A lot of phones and tablets nowadays are making a big deal bout ppi (pixels per inch). I will say things like Apples retina display or the amoled screen that samsung is using now on newer phones/tablets and the crazy resolution displays on the nexus tablets will kick this tablet's butt. The 1280x800 resolution looks good but if you are comparing detailed photos or something with those things I mentioned; It will seem lame. Words and pictures can look pixel-ee at times.-Another thing to note about the screen. When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything. I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over. Same in your app drawer. I haven't found an option that can turn that off or whatever but I should let you know that. If it matters you can fit 56 app icons on one home screen. I'm a widget fan so I dont have the Ipad look of pure apps on a screen.-The speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left. This tablet was certainly meant to be used in widescreen which I'm okay with.Overall this is a great tablet. It looks good when I don't have it in the case and I looks good with my cool case too. The side front facing speakers get loud. Honestly I cannot think of a feature that this tablet doesn't have. Besides maybe a super cool high resolution screen there's really nothing other tablets can do that this one cannot. If anything this tablet has more features and more potential. If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen. If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet I would say this is a great one to buy. If not, I would probably point you in the direction of the new 8 inch note tablet that Samsung is releasing or the Nexus 10.

There are lots of answers but it is an important question to ask.  Across the board tablets do not fulfill all the aspects of computing that a laptop or desktop computer might, and for those aspects that they do fulfill, the tend to do so with some caveats.  For me it was the desire for an eReader with some mobile computing capabilities.Next, there are a metric ton of options.  I will not directly compare this tablet to an iPad because the pros and cons for each platform are dizzying.  Apple does a great job of innovating and packaging hardware and software.  They make a fine product that is very usable.  Android is more open and though that comes with its own pain, it is what I like though.  Still there are so many choices that your head can spin.  Size is one factor and a Seven inch tablet proved too small for me to see some diagrams.  Manufacturer is another factor and again, you can find many pros and cons for each.  Samsung alone has several tablet offerings and you may find another fine Samsung tablet that more closely fits your budget if you like Samsung.  I chose this manufacturer in part because of my Samsung phone.  Just trying to find a decent tablet can be taxing with all the options and issues.  If it fits your budget, this is a real nice tablet and it offers some capabilities that others don't.Pros:1.  Build quality is top notch.  It has the look and feel of a top of the line tablet--and at this price it should.  It favorably compares to the iPad in this category.2.  Thin.  That may not sound like much of a pro, but other 10 inch tablets felt harder to hold for very long partly due to their thickness.  Again, it compares favorably to the iPad in this category.3.  Battery life.  Android has lots to learn about managing its battery, but this tablet will run for several days of moderate use on a single charge.  Moderate use would not include near constant video watching and gaming, but reading, web surfing and some rather light gaming.4.  sPen and Photoshop Touch.  As a trained Photoshop user (I know, odd description), I find having a stylus for artwork very useful.  But the sPen's use in other areas may not be what the hype leads you to believe.  With a bit of practice you might just not be able to live without it though.5.  Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.  I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.  Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.  But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.  Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.  Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.  You need a case to keep it safe and increase the potential of holding on to it, and the case options are rather poor.  There is at least one tri-fold case I like so far.2.  Build materials collect finger prints as a hobby.  This bugs me a bit and I carry a micro-fiber cloth for the screen wherever I go, but without a case, the back gets as much or more cloth time.3.  Magnets can disturb the sPen and turn on the tablet.  This can limit case choice as well since many of them use magnets.  The one I like does but they are well placed and don't get in the way.  Yet another one I thought would be good had magnets in places where the tablet would turn-on once you closed the flap.In my view, the multitasking is more hype than capability.  Its nice to have, but entirely too limited and it is a bit of a hack.  If the underlying operating system is not designed with the ability to do a thing then you can be assured you will not be completely happy with a hack like this.  Still, it has some uses.I've already said the sPen capability is partly hype, and I may be being a bit unkind toward it.  If you are expecting to use it to take notes, be prepared to be disappointed.  Unless your handwriting is stellar--and since mine is not, I'm guessing here--you will not find its use in this regard very easy.  With a bit of practice though you might learn to love it.  Samsung's sPen enabled applications look nice enough and offer some nice capabilities like text, formula, and shape recognition.Other reviews have complained about the lack of ports, but you can buy an adapter to give you those ports.  I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.

It connects to any Wi-Fi network almost immediately and the GPS works even inside closed buildings. The screen does reflect a lot of the surrounding environment, so it is better to use in closed places, the reflection of the sun and the clouds may affect the visibility of the screen when used outdoors. The stylus is amazingly accurate, but easy to lose, so watch out. I live in Costa Rica and some services are not included with the tablet, such as a video apps or Kno Textbooks, but who needs those?

I'm a somewhat savvy computer user but am relatively new to the smartphone world and this is my first tablet, so keep that in mind.Out of the box there were very few instructions so I stumbled my way along and finally downloaded the online manual.  The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast. Pretty easy to customize home screens once I had instructions.I was really glad I purchased screen savers, a carrying case, and a 32 Gig MicroSD chip along with the tablet.  I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.  The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles. Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).  After two years that will cost you...current price for 50 Gig is $10/month.  Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.  If you switch to SugarSync you could get 5 Gig for free. Dropbox also recently had a data breach, so that may be a consideration. I haven't decided yet whether to activate Dropbox or switch to SugarSync.I've had a few issues and was surprised to find Samsung Customer Support not very helpful.  The Accuweather widget was displaying the wrong time and I couldn't figure out why. Samsung didn't know either and could only suggest I reset the tablet and go back to factory specs, which I refused to do (didn't want to lose the apps I'd downloaded).  With some googling I discovered that I'd neglected to set the GMT time field. The main tablet clock display was correct; only the weather app was wrong.  Turns out that once I set the GMT to Eastern Std Time, the weather app sync'ed just fine. Glad I didn't reset.I also want to be able to charge my tablet from my car, and called Samsung to find out what the watt, volt and amp requirments would be for an inverter to charge the tablet. After being on hold for a few minutes I was told that only the design team has that information and they won't release it because they are protecting against someone reverse-engineering their design.  Sigh... I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.

It was heavy and starting to show it age, but in general, it was a great device.  I spilled juice on my Xoom, which killed it, and so looked for a new device.  The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.  There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.- Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.  It does switch between applications quickly, and when running two applications in split screen, seems to handle them both well.- Connects easily to my PC- Relatively stable.  I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.  (But, see my note below)Not so good:- I can feel the body flex when I hold it and I am not confident it would survive a serious fall (I once dropped my Xoom on concrete and it survived).  Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.- The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.  When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.- I have encountered a number of minor Interface problems, none of them are fatal, but they are annoying.  For example, it will mute itself and it is very hard to unmute, or the settings menu on the taskbar won't open, etc.  These are hard to track down as bugs, but a Google search shows I am not the only one to see these problems.- The amount of bloatware on the device is terrible.  And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.

I played it at best buy for a while and I was drooling. I gave a few days for myself before put a purchase order. Why? It is pricey, isn't it? I did not want to regret for my decision.I take my Note with me to meetings. I jot down all the discussions during meetings, highlight with digital markers for certain things, add signatures, save my writings as pdf files, and send them to people. I just hate using laptop during meetings - the clicking sound from keyboard just distracts everyone and sometimes it can be quite annoying. Physical papers, nice but archiving it is just pain in the butt. Finally, I am using a digital paper!Also, some apps allow me to take advantage of s-pen's pressure sensitive input. I occasionally sketch things, s-pen is quite responsive and its behavior is predictable although not perfect. Most of the issues arise from apps not the Note/s-pen.My major gripe is lack of specially designed apps. There are just a few of them, mostly included with the Note. Adobe, are you guys working for illustrator for android? Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside. But I feel it is quite bright, usually I put 30-40 % of maximum brightness.What was the reason to use 30 pin adapter instead of using microUSB? Anyone please explain me the real benefits of using proprietary interface? I am not an electronic engineer so please tell me, is it necessary to do that? I have about dozen microUSB cables in my house and my office, I could just use any of these as I do for my phone. There are only 2 small electronics using proprietary interface in my possession - Cowon J3 and Note 10.1. It is seriously not cool!Well, in my defense I simply could not ignore the quality of sound from J3 and decided to buy it. No regrets, but I hate it whenever I have to find the specific cable. Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad. But I am hoping the battery has long life.These are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage. I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux. I do not care for mac and i things, do not agree with the rotten fruit company's policy (I am also fluent in mac os 7, 8, 9, and OSX). Just let you know about my background.Bottom line: the ability of Note to let me write with s-pen and being android are great. Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool. Last thing, it is not the Note's fault. Adobe/Google what in the name of Gxx did you guys stop supporting flash in the browser? You guys don't even have backup yet. Can you bring that back?

In calc III and physics III, with SNote I can photograph the whiteboards directly into my notes. I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes. It's crazy good at handling this kind of note taking, but I have to say the formula match can get hairy if you're doing advanced maths. It works, but it is particular. I'm still awed by this tablet's power when I'm multitasking. It's become my cookbook, browser, and music in the kitchen many times.I recommend purchasing Samsung Electronics Book Cover for Galaxy Note 10.1-Inch, White  (EFC-1G2NWECXAR) (most protection at thinnest profile), the pen-length stylus with eraser (eraser!!!!) Original Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & Galaxy Note Genuine Wacom Touch Pen 8pi Stylus (ET-S200EBEG) - Black, and the Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard  bluetooth keyboard to accompany your note 10.1. In class, I prop up the note with the wedge's cover, and with the keyboard I can normally catch most of what the professor says as he says it.I'd give this thing six stars if I could. A seriously overlooked android tablet that regularly outperforms my friends window's 8 machine.It feels like it's from the future six months after I bought it.I bought this tablet for the quad core 1.4 processor and GPU, and the specs altogether, but it was the S Note application together with S Pen that inclined me to the write this glowing review.  Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.  I expected a half-assed branded app, put out to brag about as a feature.  What Samsung has delivered here is instead something that can rival LaTex in final product: Neat, orderly notes.  Never mind the smooth, accurate, and responsive pen input, this tablet comes loaded with a pretty accurate function input tool, a shapes tool, and a writing-to-type input feature in it's productivity tools.  Hand write and equation as the professor spews his dirty intellectual filth on his white board, and I jot it down, poorly, and Samsung picks up the slack by turning into a neat formula. I hit \"insert\", size the object down a la MS word, and move it with a drag gesture to place it where I wish.  The take away here is this: If you're a student, don't buy and iPad, buy one of these.  If you're a writer or an engineer or anyone who actually wants neat documents made on the fly WITH YOUR HAND, pick one of these up.  The iPad just can't compete for productivity.  And if you're on the Microsoft side of things with your tablet preference, good news: Samsung owns the stylus tech, the algorithms, and the app, so expect to see a Win RT S Note released on their Win 8 surface products.  That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86! I have to mention that this machine is pretty powerful... I drag and drop a calculator around while note taking, and sometimes I drag a movie over my notes too :P", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Built to Last", "Author": "Kraston W.

It's a better value than iPad2 with more features and functionality. Of special note is the ability to add external storage using MicroSD.I'm a novice to Android, being a Microsoft and Apple user until I bought the Note 10.1, so I can't address this issue. I'll address unit's features that are appealing to me.1. The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2. Handwriting recognition is restricted to S Note and other Samsung apps. In order to use handwriting recognition in editing a Word document using other apps, say, TextMaker, I have to download another handwriting recognition app such as 7notes with Mazec, which has its own issues.3. The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day. However, the glossy display reflects badly. Applying a matt screen protector affects the S-pen's functionality somewhat, making it less sensitive and creating a drag. It'd be great have a glass anti-glare display finish that does not affect the S-pen's functionality.4. Battery drain seems faster than iPad. I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot. I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5. Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6. Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive. I found I had to switch it off more frequently than I had to with the iPad.7. S Note is the highlight of the unit and the reason I bought the tablet. It's very good and enables tracking pen strokes in a video mode and voice narration. They are *not* automatically synchronized--you have to do it yourself when you play back pen strokes and the narration. Nonetheless, it impressed the audience.8. The many S Note templates are a bit gimmicky. After trying a few, I found myself just starting new notes on a normal sheet.9. The S Note has a feature that gives you straight lines and geometrical shapes. Very useful in making simply drawings.Over all, I'm pleased with the unit and would recommend others to take a closer look before paying double for a Surface Pro or an iPad2, both of which I had used and returned, but I'm keeping this baby.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "New computing companion", "Author": "Steve Hehl", "ReviewID": "RGPKC8X1USPJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've played around with Apple products, both the iPhone & the iPad, and have found more freedom & capbility to do the my routine tasks and more with the Note 10.1.

The display is beautiful. Colors look great and appear to be displayed accurately. A lot of reviews knocked the resolution, but it looks pretty sweet to me. Performance is spectacular!

However, once you settle in, this device has some really powerful features, like multi-screen multitasking, that make it stand out really well.I really wish that the S-pen app itself had more customizability in controls and default views; it may yet have that, some of these functions are slightly well hidden, hence the learning curve.

I use it for Lab Meetings and note-taking for college level biology work.The Battery is no slouch, but it does clock in at about 8 hours, which is -just- short of what I'd like it to be.  It's more than adequate, but I used to use an original iPad, and those last two hours (of 10 hours iPad battery life) are a beast to give up. :)I'm already experiencing the joys of Android with things like Tasker, and while I miss the more polished, easy-to-find and easy-to-use nature of the Apple App store, so far the Android Market, Google Play, is doing very well- but as stated previously, with a learning curve.  When I first set out to play games on this machine, I was disappointed in the decline in quality over iPad games- there are tablet optimized apps out there that are every bit as beautiful ans excellent as iPad games, just no easy way to find them (there are even lemons in the 'tablet' section of the google play store.  I went out and got an app called Tablified Market- it isn't perfect either, but it's a start, and sorts out some apps that use characteristic shortcuts in phone apps to make them into tablet compatible apps.)  In the end, the best bet is to find a way to try the apps and figure out whether they're as optimized as they seem- but I'm a average level tech geek, I enjoy trying to bend a device to my will, and was annoyed by the low level to which I could do this with a spouse-shared iPad.So, I'm giving a five star review while airing mostly gripes with the device.  Yep!  I love it, I find it excellent, fun, useful, and usable, but I'm giving the kind of review I like to read- one that addresses not the excellent points that already drew me to the device, but rather the difficult aspects that make me uncertain.  It is my opinion that my 'uncertainties' have been answered excellently so far in this device, although now, if anyone from Samsung ends up reading this: Please, Please make the S-pen app more customizable!  Single finger panning (or at least less zoom sensitivity when panning!), default page-width view in landscape mode, and an 'infinite paper' mode would all be very welcome additions that I'm currently using other apps to achieve- but of course, I HAVE to use S-pen for the multitasking mode sometimes, and I really, really want the S-pen app to have all the necessary features to be my one-and-only note taking app on this device.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing device.

Call me a skinflint, but I can't spend a substantial amount of money on a device that has no practical value. The only tablet I've kept is the Nexus 7, and that's only because it was fully open (unlike the Fire HD) and cheap enough to justify keeping as a toy. After reading the user reviews of the Note 10.1, I bought it because I was convinced that I had found the Holy Grail: the first affordable tablet that aided productivity instead of procrastination.Sorry, nope. The Note is a competent tablet - if it cost a bit less, I would call it a very good one - but it's not the game-changer I was hoping for.Reports of the Note 10.1's ugliness and cheap build quality have been greatly exaggerated. It is far from sleek, and it does feel somewhat flimsy compared to the (much cheaper) Nexus and Kindle Fire lines, but it is not the fragile piece of space junk that many of the professional reviewers have made it out to be. The screen has decent contrast and - much to my surprise - I did not find that it was significantly less clear than the Nexus 7 or even the borderline-Retina Kindle Fire 8.9.As for the basic OS, it's Android, with which I'm already very familiar. I had expected to hate this new version of TouchWiz, Samsung's all-encompassing overlay for Android 4.1, but I was pleasantly surprised;  it's only slightly inferior to stock 4.2 on the Nexus 7, and it is far superior to the crippling \"storefront\" that strangles all practicality out of the Kindle Fire.When I first used the Note's bundled software suite, I was thrilled. The included S Note app initially seems to be a godsend; the Note lives up to its name as a flawless digital notepad. As I tried the more advanced features, the cracks in the facade began to show: handwriting-to-text translations regularly choked on both my cursive and print, and the \"formula match\" math feature inserted random variables and decimals into everything I wrote.Disappointed, I tried to find substitutes for the included apps. I read reviews singing the praises of Papyrus, Lecture Notes, and Write, and tried all of these. In each case, pen support was stellar, but many of their more advanced features were unintuitive. When I was attempting to use the device to take notes in my lectures, I was consistently distracted from my writing rather than feeling that the process was being empowered or enhanced.This is my biggest problem with the Note: nothing \"just works.\" It has brilliant and innovative features that are all usable with minor effort, but that's the issue;  even if it's only for a second, your mind wanders away from your work and onto the tablet. Even after I was past the Note's learning curve, I found that my work was far more easily accomplished with a notebook - spiral-bound or keyboard-equipped.  The Galaxy Note 10.1 has huge potential as a tool for college students or businessmen, but I can't give it points for potential when the reality is much more bleak.As I said earlier, the Note 10.1 is a good tablet - but how good? The pen feels like a beta feature: it's exciting, but not yet fully-formed enough to justify the premium price. Taking the pen out of the equation, the Nexus 10 does virtually everything else better and costs less; why pay more for an inferior product? Heck, if you're willing to deal with a smaller screen or Amazon's overbearing marketing, even the Nexus 7 and Fire HD are just as good for most consumption tasks. If the Note were considerably cheaper, I'd consider giving it four stars without hesitation, but as it stands, I can only give it three.FULL DISCLOSURE: My Note was a minor lemon that had some Wi-Fi issues.

Yay.I am a current owner of a Samsung Galaxy SII, and I loved the freedom that Samsung proliferates in their technology and build. I like it so much that i knew immediately when i began searching for a tablet it would be from Samsung. They make some great stuff. I didn't buy the tablet for gaming or even for school since i am currently disabled and have problems learning as well as physically going and coming from school etc. I bought it for legal matters in the hopes that a larger screen would make what i was displaying on it more accurate and applicable, but it seems that it will get more use from entertaining me from heart rendering boredom as i take a long trip to somewhere i don't particularly want to go. but anyways...now for my opinion on the product...:)If you are deciding between getting the IPAD or the Samsung note, let me help you out with your decision. GET the Samsung note. Why? you won't miss the IPAD, sure it has a better spec screen but trust me you won't miss it. The Samsung screen is bright and as beautiful as the dickens, trust me. It has this very soft and beautiful luminescence that makes you think \"now there's momma's baby\" when you turn it on. it is not annoyingly strikingly bright (sorry apple). Also i am not biased against apple since i have an IPOD Touch, but come' on apple your stuff is way too expensive to be so consumer limiting. Instead of calling their company apple they should have called it \"Yes, Dad.\" But yes... Buy the 16gb 10.1 note and just buy a 64gb SDHC card and save some money, I even wonder if this will take a 128gb SDHC card (it would be so awesome). knowing Samsung I'm sure it would.Gorilla Glass! Don't leave home without it! I had to walk around with the Note unprotected in my purse (yeah i know i know) where there were house keys and pencils and pennies jiggling free inside for a couple of days and every time i pulled the note out it barely had any dust on it never mind scratches, so i don't advise anyone to buy any screen protection (this coming from a girl who wrapped her computer in glade wrap for fear of cosmetic damages) so that says Alot. Also people say that it messes with the functioning of the stylus, you'll want some smooth swiping for the great applications and games. a screen protector is not needed. but i would and do have a Decal Sticker covering every other exposed part on the note and it now has a little store bought case as well. and yes Samsung built the note with a plastic case but it doesn't look like or feel particularly like plastic, but i like the plastic. it won't dent when it drops to the floor and it also probably wouldn't break either (not because of the plastic but because of Samsung's solid build).  Speaking of the Stylus, Super Super Awesome! has a cute little cubby hole, slide out and slide in. the stylus also does not feel awkward in my hands. great for some games but old habits die hard and since i don't use this for writing or reading or anything i'm often using my hands..also because my numb little fingers makes it hard to hold a grip on the stylus.  The camera is nice but i doubt people will be using this for the camera, Samsung was just being thoughtful, since most everyone has phones with souped up cameras. When I'm trying to take a picture i go for my Samsung SII instead of my Note. also the note is sorta large to say that you want to take a cute little pic with it. what else...  The apps are really nice, again the screen picture quality is really nice so don't worry about the intergalactic level graphics that apple boasts about for the IPAD. you don't need those level of graphics for something so small, it would just be ridiculous and overkill. great bang for your buck. also i must congratulate amazon on getting the product to ME (ME ME ME and nobody else) safely and timely because i have been disappointed over the years. also i advise you to take out warranty, if warranty is there, take it because this can very easily be a laptop replacement and running around the house with it under your arm will be...in short...a mistake.- typed over the expanse of 100 hours of speech to text software (kidding...but not really)- never really wrote a product review but this product desires some accolades...also i don't feel so scared to be home now :)Product Owned: HP Dv6 Touchscreen Laptop (custom made), Psp go (somewhere in the house...wait..no...i think it broke), Ps3 (collecting dust bought it in college tried to get another one for my undeserving brother but never got it.

Additionally, having a camera makes it easy to snap a picture and use an app to figure dimensions of the item which helps in re-creating a piece of furniture or cabinet work that I find while wondering about stores or antique shops.This tablet is blazing fast too.

This is my first tablet and I did a lot of research before buying here at Amazon. I would have purchased at Costco since it was the same price but Amazon was tax free..so sorry Costco. Anyway, I researched the iPad, the Galaxy 10 and MS Surface Pro. The Pro I felt was too expensive for a first generation product. Small things were overlooked such as providing a slot for the stylus; a big deal if it's lost.

I wanted a sleek good looking device that can do everything the iPad can for less money and I have this in the Galaxy 10.1.

Having a proprietary charger for each new product release is stupid and I wasn't buying an Apple charger that's not compatible with my existing iPhone.There were maybe 2-3 minor apps that are not available for this table but again those apps (washington post and CNN) are minor and I have a laptop.

Before my husband bought me this, I spent an insurmountable number of research time on deciding which tablet I wanted.  Ironically, I was looking for a few tablets in the $200 range, but when I took my husband into Walmart, and showed him this tablet and explained to him what it did, his budget went up, and I got really happy then because I had been eyeing this tablet since last year,( but had been respectful of my husband's budget).So being that the budget had increased, I started doing research on all tablets, but this one kept coming into mind.  I was constantly on Amazon checking reviews, comparisons, and prices.  I realized that no other tablet could do what I needed and wanted the way this one could, and with the price tag.  Besides the S pen capabilites, the expandable memory with a micro sd card, was a selling point.  I considered everything - the pros and cons and realized that there were more pros than cons.  I knew that this would benefit me as a student, writer and occasional gamer.I have had this for a little over two weeks and am so happy with this product.  It goes everywhere with me .

Packing a Exynos quadcore 1.4GHz processor and a Mali-400 graphics chipset, this tablet has horsepower to spare.

That would arguably go to the Nexus 10, also made by Samsung, which has a better DPI than even the iPad 4. Getting back to the topic on hand, this tablet screams productivity. The multitasking aspect coupled with the ability of the S Pen makes this a students' and business mans' dream. It has all the features that come standard with Android's with some special apps from Samsung. At launch, the Note had some problems with slow downs when running android ICS. After the Jellybean update, the Note better utilizes its hardware and software creating a very smooth experience. No inconsistent lag / twitchyness and more apps can be put onto the screen instead of just 2 by using cascade mode. I found myself opening 4 apps, filling every corner of the screen. One for note taking, another for emails, another for video, and 1 more for internet browsing and this time more apps are allowed for multitasking instead of just factory installed apps. The features this tablet has to offer is its strongest selling point. Until other tablets can multi-window / multitask like the Note can, I'd say this tablet will be a terrific buy for busy bodies.

You CAN use a 64gb card in it (I have the 32gb Galaxy Note 10.1), so I can store twice as many movies and music. I found that the Nexus 7 wasn't what I was hoping for when it came to surfing the net (it's nice for playing games on). The screen isn't big enough and it's hard to read magazines on it. The Note is just about perfect for this. The Nexus 7 is a little buggy too. You have to turn it off a lot to get it to work. Sometimes it shuts down on it's own too. I had no problems with the Note. I probably have about 100 hours of use on it so far. The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port. That's not too much of a big deal. I just hook it up to my computer and download the movies or music onto the memory card. I also downloaded about 2500 songs from my Google music account via wi-fi. It took about 4 hours, I guess.

I've had a variety of PDAs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets over the last decade+, but all have had the significant shortcoming of not having good and easy (or any) handwriting recognition integrated into the system. This replaces an Acer A200 Android tablet, which served me well even though it wasn't the fastest tablet; speed isn't important for me.The A200 was good at data consumption -- reading PDFs (the main reason for purchase), some light web browsing, reading email, a few apps, a few lightweight games to waste time, etc.; however, data creation was a slow and tedious process with the on-screen soft keyboard. Yes, I could have paired it with a USB or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but that increases the weight and bulk in my daily carry bag considerably.This tablet with its S-Pen changes everything, although it won't quite replace a notebook for my needs. As of this initial review, I've had the Note 10.1 for a little over a week and have had adequate time to get familiar with it and start experimenting with new ways to use a tablet.  The handwriting capability allows me to use this in meetings to take notes in my chicken scratch handwriting and automatically convert it very well into type; I can then email the notes to my work computer. This is also likely to replace paper notebooks that I take to meetings for note taking, and give me the capability to electronically search for years-old notes on my desktop. I can now easily and precisely add notes and simple drawings to PDF manuals and books that I'm reading and anyone can read the text later on.For relaxation, this is a great media player. It has the loudest and clearest sound of any portable device, to include laptops, that I've heard. The videos I've played run smoothly thanks to the fast quad-core processor and plenty of RAM.So far, battery life has been great, lasting 2-3 days at least between charges.I've only played a little with the dual-apps on screen as the current ones are rather limited in number. I'm looking forward to the extra apps that appear to be coming with Jelly Bean.CONS: No standard USB port. I wish the S-Pen were maybe an inch or so longer. I hate glossy screens.I'll post updates as I become more familiar with the Note and start using more of the custom apps unique to it.Update, 3 Jan 2013:===================After a month with the Note, I like it even more. My Pros and Cons above still stand. It has been very stable, it has not needed a reboot/force off due to lockup. I've used the handwriting input to take notes a few times in meetings. I do experience problems with certain letters and characters such as 'i', '.', ',', and a few others, but nothing too bad that can't be cleaned up right then or later on. I'm still getting 2-4 days of use between charges, depending on how much I use it per day. I haven't really used the current S Apps other than learning the basics, the Premium Suite may have more useful apps and features for me to re-investigate; I'd love to see the ability to multi-window well-written apps such as GMail, Facebook, Chrome, etc., which I feel would be a huge benefit for me.I've picked up a few accessories that are working well with the Note:Samsung EPL-1PL0BEGXAR USB Connection Kit - allows me to plug in a USB thumb drivePowerGen Dual USB 3.1A 15w Travel Wall Charger with Swivel plug for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, iPhone 5 4s 4 3 3Gs, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX KeyBoard, Samsung Galaxy Tab (USB Cable NOT included) - BLACK - a bit more portable for taking on trips, can use to simultaneously charge my cell phoneAduro Samsung Galaxy Tablet Extra Long USB Charge & Sync Data Cable (6.5 feet) USB to 30 Pin, Galaxy Tab 7-Inch, 8.9-Inch,10.1-Inch - use with charger above, like the extra lengthrooCASE Dual-Axis (Black) Leather Folio Case Cover with 23 Adjustable Portrait / Landscape Stand for Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 N8000 N8010 (NOT Compatible with Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) - good protection, allows positioning horizontally or vertically, large range of angles, it is pretty thick, the tablet in its inner sleeve can be removed and held without the full case for extra convenience", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Go Samsung", "Author": "joseph", "ReviewID": "R3I19ZYQW3X02R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple look out... for those who love using a typical key pad, this is not the one for you, nevertheless... its ready to be your career and professional best friend.  the apps that come standard with the tablet are ready to take your business and life to the next level...", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "THE TABLET I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR", "Author": "tom webb", "ReviewID": "R1KPVCV9RNHH4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHILE MANY TABLETS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE MADE ONE THAT WAS MORE THAN AN OVERPRICED TOY THAT I WOULD JUST SET ASIDE AND NEVER USE.

I consider this shortfall somewhat unbelievable, but I think it can be worked around with an add-on app.I'm a fan of the Android platform and my phones have been Android's for years so it's easy to pick this Pad up, load some apps and get going. Plenty of Cloud apps available to sync the Pad, phone and laptop, so the Pad easily takes the place of the laptop for short trips. The Pad isn't going to replace your laptop if you're an avid Excel/Word user. The included program for viewing/editing Excel/Word is very adequate for viewing, but big edits would be hassle. It's just not that easy to type or move around a spreadsheet (even with BT keyboard).Screen is good and movies look greats. Volume seems a little on the light side, though.

I had some note taking apps for my ipad with those stupid capacitive styluses and hated every second of it. I contemplated getting the note for a long time thinking that I would spend the $500 dollars and hate it and end up going back to the old tried and true paper. But I have to say I have not gone back to paper and have been extremely happy with the note. I do not use s notes thought. I bought an awesome app called LECTURE NOTES. It is around $3 and it gives you the ability to completely disable input from everything but the pen, which is my saving grace because my hand would always make marks randomly and stuff on the ipad. As what most people have said, the build is a little bendable. So i found a hard back case and that seemed to stiffen it up a little bit.I have also gotten quick office in an attempt to write papers on it and replace my computer. you could do it, but for having a quad-core processor, the keyboard doesn't respond very quickly and i have had lots of accuracy issues with it. I have downloaded some other keyboards and was even less impressed with them then the stock one.The multitasking is nice but I hardly use it, mostly because the apps I use do not support it. So it would be nice to see some developers incorporating this into some of the apps.tl;dr- I take lots of mathy notes and have had great success with the tablet and the lecture note app. Will not be using the tablet to write any papers longer than a page because the keyboard isn't great.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": ".

Also, this version has the taskbar pinned to the bottom of the tablet at all times. What does this mean for you? When you're using the tablet for what it's made and marketed for(taking notes), your hand will constantly open up new windows, back out of your current window, take screenshots,etc... All because someone at Samsung figured it'd be a smart idea to place a task bar where most people rest their hands when writing.3) While using ANY app whatsoever, the tablet will periodically go into sleep mode and you have to unlock it again to wake it. This isn't caused by inactivity and appears to be a bug.4) While my tablet connects to wifi just fine when using Samsungs built in Web browser, NO other app can get a network connection. Dropbox,Play Store,Maps,Kindle,etc...

I like the two speakers that are on the top of each side unlike other tablets where they are on the bottom. I like the keyboard that has numbers at the top of the screen like a real keyboard so you don't have to toggle between numbers and letters. Since I am used to working an Android phone functions are easy to find and work. I like the fact that you can swipe to other screens in one direction and they revolve around like a carousel so you don't have scroll back when you get to the end like some other devices. The screen is clear the resolution seems good to me. It is nice to be able to touch the lower right corner and get a control panel like screen where you can get to some basic settings and notifications.For me this device is great and I'm glad I got it.Update March 1I discovered there are three choices of keyboard layouts to choose from when doing a thumb-finger pinch over the keyboard. The main layout is the full keyboard with numbers on top like I mentioned above. The second one is a split keyboard so half of the keyboard is on the left side of the screen and the other half is on the right side (iPad does this). The split keyboard allows you to hold the tablet with both hands and type with your thumbs. The third option is a small floating keyboard which can be re-positioned anywhere on the screen. The third option came in handy when the main keyboard was covering up something I needed to see on the screen while keying in something so I was able to move the small keyboard to the top right and get it out of the way.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS TABLET", "Author": "C.Muntz", "ReviewID": "R1HIGWEAM5KGC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did alot of homework and research before purchasing this tablet.

The S-pen is so cool! It does so much. It even has pressure sensitivity. Allowing you endless ppossibilities for use. Great for artists or just normal folks like myself. Too neat.Connect my flash drives via otg attachment is a breeze. I even used it during a large lecture to play audio clips, show photos and play a video attached to the venues projector with my hdtv otg. Amazingly simple and convienent! The days of lugging my laptop along is in the past. :)Typing on it is a breeze. Thought initially I would purchase a keyboard, but the on screen keyboard is really comfortable to use. Im even using right now to type this review!If you are on the fence about the right tablet for you, this one is the way to go. It wont disappoint! Stopped at BestBuy for a 64gb micro memory card. When talking tablets with the salesman, he stated no other company has replicated the technology in this tablet. If you want an Android (or even if you have never tried Android), this is the best tablet out there. Hands down, the best!!!!Enjoy!!!UPDATE:It's been 6 months since purchasing my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and I still absolutely LOVE it! The are still little things that a learn about it regularly.  The voice commands work amazingly well, even allowing me hands free via the S Note.  It enables true sync between my mobile phone and tablet- Photos, documents and calendars just to name a few along with much much more.Even better, the battery life is fantastic.I no longer have to bring my laptop out for presentations. And even better,  I can develop them conveniently with Polaris Office. Even my slide presentations are a breeze to put together!Of course the fun stuff is available.  With a simple download, flash is useful regularly for movies and such.  And how neat having the remote control incorporated! Great sound and graphics.  I can even edit video.  Although the S pen is marketed towards students,  I use it regularly for sticky note reminders, art type projects and even to note things on my calender-again just to name a few.My friends with other brand tablets tease that I have become a tablet snob, lol. But,  they are jealous! Constantly commenting on how they should have bought one for themselves, it puts the IPAD to shame (along with all the other brands as well! )Thus far,  I haven't found anything that I can't do!If you want to thoroughly love your tablet,  this is the one for you!!!Thanks Samsung\u2661 \u2665 \u2661 \u2665 \u2661 \u2665 \u2661 \u2665 \u2661If you want a tablet that can truly do it all, the Galaxy Note is it!", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Display & Wonderful Little Workhorse", "Author": "ArielWatch345", "ReviewID": "R3SXZI1YETPJHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first turned this on, the display looked kind of dull so I started having buyer's remorse.

It is also not innovating as much now and not giving people what they want - bigger screens and meaningful upgrades.So I switched and got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it was on sale for $50 off and I got it in 1 day shipping thanks to Amazon.The unit is beautiful - light and the white is nice. It is actually too slick. So I bought a Poetic cover as well. There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card. I also upgraded the OS to 4.1.2 as of now (one thing to note is if you get an error - firmware was modified outside and so no updates will be possible, then you need to remove the SD card and retry and it will be fine. Bug in HW check coding).The screen resolution is lower and it sometimes shows but it is more than adequate. The unit came charged thankfully. With moderate use, I lost about 24% a day - one netflix movie, browsing, emails etc. about 3 hours used.On standby it seems to lose about 15% a day. So the battery life is more than adequate. We may need charging every 3 days or so.The unit is blazing fast. The quad core really shows here. Everything is super zippy. With 2GB memory, you can easily launch like 10 apps at a time and also it can truly multitask (only approved apps) so you can have more apps running at same time if you choose.The swype keyboard is brilliant as is the S-Voice. However, some output seems wrong. I asked \"how far is Canada from United States\" and it said \"1530 miles\" or something which is a head scratcher.The S-pen is just brilliant. Handwriting to sketching to jotting notes. Simply brilliant. You will need to buy more apps to fully leverage its power though. The samsung store/play store is good as well.The screen is crisp and clear but I can tell the iPad is sharper and crispier and seems more \"vibrant\" and HD sharp than this one.Overall, this seems like a much better buy than an iPad. However, if people would want an iPad, I would say it is still worth it for its better screen resolution and intuitiveness.

I'm really looking into the Note 8 that's suppose to be announced next week and I would give that a try.  I believe with Jellybean 4.1x that Android has probably stablized though I will continue to monitor the \"turning off\"  thing.  But what if the \"turning off\" thing still occurs after the return policy with Christmas gifts has expired?  I've seen this issue with the Asus.. and they addressed it with a software upgrade.  Things I wish for: Mini HDMI port, USB port.  What also makes a difference is a leather case for this device.  I actually can't wait  for the Note 8.  I hope this helps anyone making a decision.

Been waiting for a tablet to come out that has real artist/designer sensitive drawing capacity. This tablet does, but the drawing pen has so many variable to learn to use I recommend putting aside at least 7 - 10 hours to really learn all it does. You can get very good results with pen. For first 3 days I was disappointing with pen results until I learn to push as hard as I would with a mechanical pencil using a #2 HB lead. Harder than you think you should. After that I got the graduated scales of grey and ability to gain depth of pen stroke that I was hoping to get out of a touch sensitive pen vs the regular tablet interface. Overall, if I work it, I can get very good drawings out of tablet....near artist quality like pen and ink or pencil grey scale. You will not be producing large scale on art on this small tablet screen, but for the doodler/artist it's good enough.Have not used the Photoshop feature much, so will not comment on photo editing. As I stated above, I was most interested in tablet for drawing capacity.As to using the pen as part of the software to annotate photos to attach to email etc.., it's easy to use. Not as much software out yet that takes advantage of drawing capacity, but device comes with enough software to do anything you would want to do. Results are equivalent to a sharpie marker.I find that I would rather type notes than use pen. So for me the pen is not that big of a deal for normal everyday operations.Rest of tablet features are like any Android. Plays back movies better than most and speakers front facing are better than the side ones I had on my Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus or the back ones on my Ipad 2 (which the carrying case covers).Quality of screen resolution is really really nice.I don't know why some reviews talk about flimsy build. Seem very sturdy to me. More than most tablets. Battery life is great.I would buy again.UPDATE 11-7-2012...............GREAT ABILITY TO CORRECT DRAWINGS........ Three things about using tablet for sketching ...1> I use the split screen function of tablet and have photo on one side and draw on other side.Small space but OK as can enlarge specific sections.2> Drawing on glass is strange. No grab like paper does to pen or pencil. I miss that feel.3> With real paper and pen or ink, it's hard to erase and if you work sketch much the paper becomes torn or smudged. WITH TABLET THE ERASING IS SIMPLE AND COMPLETE. I MEAN REALLY COMPLETE. I have produced better finished sketches because of this feature. A lot better. I can go and clean up all the over drawn lines with the erase feature and it erases at the same fine detail that pen draws at. Completely adjustable.  Making the pen and ink drawings flawless. The \"undo\" feature is also great for cleaning up drawing.All I can say is that drawing on tablet is different. I would never have considered that the ease of erasing and correcting would be such a great feature.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "zeeadarling", "ReviewID": "R3VG0GDTST3VL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me: I'm a 22 year old female. I'm an artist and I work 2 jobs where I am on the go a lot.  The note is a big help because I have nice little piece of technology to store ideas & checklists and check important emails with. I have had this tablet for about 4 weeks now.I bought this tablet because I was looking for a digital graphics tablet that was portable.  Originally I was seeing only tablets that were specifically for drawing and worked in addition to a computer. I wanted something thin, portable and easy to use.Main things I like and use it for:-Drawing out ideas with the pen and saving them to different folders to organize-Writing To Do Lists and ideas in my own hand writing. I like having them all in one place and not having to carry around folders and sketch books that will eventually fray and have pages fall out.-Surfing the internet away from home.- Checking balances and paying bills.-It has a nice map & navigation feature but I don't think either can work without internet connection, which is a downfall because if you're on the road and don't have it then it's useless.-I like planning with my calendar that comes with it, but I may try to find a different calendar app that let's me write with the pen and put little pictures on it to spruce it up.-Taking webcam pics daily and using the back camera to take pictures of my home cooked meals or quick snaps of things I made.-Reading. It comes with Nook. But what I am disappointed about with that is that it doesn't have every book that I want to read! You would think they would have everything. Kindle has a lending library that I wish Nook had something similar so I could check that out.A note about surfing the internet- It has a mobile view that has the more simplistic layout of websites for faster surfing, but you can also switch to desktop view to see the page in full like on a regular computer which is a great feature!So far it has served its purpose with very few glitches.  Lately I have been experiencing a glitch where the internet won't close out when I hit the x. Hopefully that will go away, it's not that big of an issue.The biggest issue I realized with it, is that flash is not supported on it.  This means that if there are games you want to play on a website or anything that supports flash and even videos you try to watch (not through the youtube app), you will be unable to see it.  The Note does come with a youtube & Netflix app so you can watch anything through it.  I would like for this device to support the Direct tv for mobile devices so I can watch normal programs through it too. That would be perfect!I really hope that in the future there will be drawing apps specifically for this tablet.  I have drawn a few things now with it on Snote [which is really just for ideas and sketches] and I am adjusting to its features.  What I am really hoping for is maybe a Photoshop type of app that you can do different layers with your artwork and add on masks and filters etc.  The ideal app would have what I just mentioned plus an array of brushes and tools where you can adjust pressure/lightness, smudge, sharpen and lighten/darken tools, and the feature where only your pen reacts to it. Because it's an issue when you're trying to draw but it's also registering your hand at the same time and the page will try to scroll or zoom.So far this has worked really great for my needs and I hope that there will be some advances that I can benefit from in the future. I want this product to take artwork a little more seriously and be able to run apps that have in depth drawing features.The Note becomes really comfortable and easy to use once you have a case for it.

Apple does a heck of a good job but I am usually an alternative shopper.  I bought the Note after a lot of comparing and some experience with android, I chose android for the common reason of apple users complaint of no internal storage options in the ipad, speaker location (volune and non-stereo), and apples pricing structures.  The Android system is sufficient in their software for my needs and I do like the idea of an open application market.  Now for the Samsung note tablet, I did not want to buy a prodect that was inferior to the new ipad and the price comparisons are both a bit pricey however that is what the market is, the Note is in line for price when compared to other products of this power and features (I looked hard at this).  I have had the Note for three weeks, the installed software meet my needs (impressed with the pri-installed word processer) and added some free apps, the screens are nice and easy to  personalise and make me feel at home, I don't seem to notice the lower resolution (1200 x 800 I think?) other people comment on although you can tell a slight difference if you compare very close but the color and smoothness of the overall display seem to negate the difference.  I have the 32gb version and am glad I went that way although I don't know that the 16gb model would be much of a problem because the 32gb micro sd card I have installed works flawlessly.  \"Overall\" I see no down side with this unit (wifi only), its quick, I like the processor and 2gb on board processer setup which is probably why its so quick.  Battery life is what they say it is, the 10.1\" screen makes it bulky compared to a 7\" (I also have a 7\" kindle fire) but the extra bulk soon makes up for its size in ease of use along with easy on the eye.  I like having a 7\" and 10\" option but the premium experience is the 10\" Note.  The Note does not hang up or act wierd, the good sound and speaker position is the plus they say it is, the kindle fire HD has a bit better sound and volume but the Note is a reasonable second and a no contest in head to head features of the note.  I agree with the more common view that the kindle fire is very good a streaming media experience but its use stops there, if you want to do much more than that the Note has gobs of more potential.  I like my old Kindle Fire and Fire HD, what would I do if stuck with only one? Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Table is my recomendation and I havn't even explored the \"pen\" features.

I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing. Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such. I think this device is really hamstrung by requiring expensive, proprietary hardware in order to interact with another device.That much said, it's filled its purpose as a learning device for our 4-year-old pretty well, since the Android marketplace has a wealth of educational games.UPDATE: I've come to hate the proprietary plug that powers this tablet. Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in. The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet. I love having tablets and intend to pick up another Android tablet sometime this year. But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port. Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.

Out of those tablets I've used in the past, the iPad came close to being my main device to manage an infrastructure when I'm away but still wasn't a true \"multi-tasking\" device.And then I saw this device and heard and seen the capabilities and I can see myself connected to my email and having my browser up and running on the other end and managing my servers through the browser. Now I didn't get the Note 10.1 from Amazon but through my Vendor but thought I would share my experience anyways.One thing that was a flaw from the moment I opened and turned it on is that my screen had a pretty decent size of a cluster of dead pixels. So I'll be exchanging it immediately. I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.  So hopefully my Note is just a small flaw and a replacement isn't going to have the same problem, otherwise the device is very speedy and with 2GB of Ram, should be some sort of future proof.I would definitely consider and recommend this product to anyone who are multi-task.

If you are thinking of purchasing the Tab over the Note, it's a good option and less $$. However, even though I was mostly happy with the Tab 2, I decided to purchase the Note 10.1 this time around mainly for the quad-core processor. The s-pen is a neat feature but not a selling point and to date I haven't used it much more than to play around with it. I do a lot of photography with my DSLR camera and like to be able to store many pictures on my tablet. I do not use the tablet for picture taking. The quality is ok if all you plan on doing with your photos is posting on social media.I've read reviews where some say the resolution isn't as clear as other tablets. The Note 10.1 and the Tab 2 have the same resolution and it is very crisp and clear. I have no complaints. I almost bought the 2014 edition of the Note 10.1 solely for the fact that it claims to have a crisper resolution. However, I opted to save a few $$ and I have no complaints. I have to note, that I purchased this tablet without having seen it first and when I was comparing the 2014 version, I didn't see that either.

Im pleased with it for the most part but there are things that really irritate me about this tablet. Here they are:1. The microphone for the tablet is located at the bottom where the charging port is. Very annoying. When I skype with friends and family they tell me that my voice sounds \"muffled\". The only way they can hear me clearly is if I hold the tablet, which brings me to my next problem.2. I bought a little case for the tablet which props it up so I dont have to hold it. I really love the case but when the tablet sits up right the microphone is covered. When it lays flat no one can see me. When I turn it sideways so it is in portrait mode the person in which I am skyping cuts in half. I dont know if that is a tablet thing or a skype app thing but the tablet doesnt adjust to the change. When it is upside down (camera at the bottom, microphone at the top) it works but then whoever im skyping with is practically looking up my nose. I dont like it.3. The battery runs down even when Im not using it. When I had my ipad I could turn it off and leave it for a couple of days and the battery would barely go down. This tablet acts more like a computer (I have to shut it down every night or when I'm not using it)4. The tablet comes preloaded with roughly 1GB of apps I DONT WANT!! There is no way to delete them unless you \"root\" your tablet (I looked on YouTube for how to do it and it's a process. Not to mention the damage that could be caused if a mistake is made)5. I specifically wanted this tablet because I thought it would be very useful for school (I'm a junior in college). I really like taking notes my tablet but I'm irritated by the lack of printing options. There aren't any! When I tried to print my boarding pass it gave me an error saying \"Can only print using a Samsung Printer\". Seriously??? This tablet brand new costs almost as much as a new ipad and I'm restricted to only using a Samsung printer? I'm very unhappy about that.6. When watching a review about the tablet I saw that you can hand gesture and the keyboard splits in half. I can't get mine to do it. I have tried over and over. It just doesn't work for me.In the long run I like the tablet. I'm not a very picky person and I can look past these defects since it was a gift.

If you are looking for an android tablet but would not mind compromising on few things then go for it. As a device it is well worth the money. It is fast in processing, light in weight and excellent screen appearance. I would only list out few points here to help you in your buying decision.HDMI output - If you want to connect it to a TV / projector using HDMI port, please remember you would have to buy an expensive accessory. You can connect it through your home wireless network without much problem but it has few limitations depending on what you watch.OFFICE - Though it has a scaled down App for using \"word\" Excel\" PowerPoint\"  or PDF, it has limitations. Do not expect the same windows experience here ( After all it is android not windows).Browsing - If you did not know, android has lost flash support for your browsers on newer versions of their android OS. Which means, you can only watch Facebook videos or you tube videos ( or any such videos on other sites) only using their native apps but not directly on your web browser. So If you want to have a full experience of you tube ( app does not give you the same feel and look of a browser page, you might even miss few videos on app) you would not be able to do that on browser right out of the box. You would have to download flash from the archives and install it yourself. There is a step by step guide to do it, try Google for help. You can install flash on Firefox, stock android browser or bada browser but not on chrome.All in all; this tablet is not a replacement for your laptop or not even a high productivity tablet but If you need an entertainment device with a touch of productivity this would exceed your expectations.After using it for 3 months, I can say it has an unmatched battery backup If you know what you are doing. I have seen many of my friends complaining about battery backup problems on different device without realizing it is the user who is responsible for the low battery backup in most cases. Unlike apple ipad, android has the ability to run multiple apps. If you do not close the app you were using ( not hitting the return button) some apps would still be running consuming the battery. So use the task manager or another app to kill background apps.Hope that helps.

I almost bought the Nexus 10 to get the native Android experience, but I couldn't commit to a tablet that didn't have an expansion slot.  I manage and store all my media on an SD card so I'm not tethered to the cloud.  Storage expansion is a \"must-have\" feature.  I was concerned about the standard resolution of the Note screen, but the screen looks great.  Because the screen is a standard resolution, there are fewer pixels to push around (compared to the Nexus 10) which makes for a super smooth user experience.  It never lags, stutters or hangs and I'm using it with a live wallpaper.  The other consideration is the number of Android tablet apps.  While there are a lot good tablet apps, most aren't written to take advantage of a high resolution screen like the Nexus.  And the screen is bright.  I lowered it to 40% and it's still very bright for indoor use.The Note is used mostly for media consumption, casual games, email and surfing...and I'm doing all this while \"watching\" TV.  The Peel IR remote feature is excellent and well implemented.  Since I'm multitasking, changing the channels is easy using the tablet.  I can search the guide, find a program, select the icon and the cable box responds and brings me my program.  Audio sounds great...for a tablet.  Having the speakers facing front is brilliant, if not common sense.I've only experimented with the S-pen a little bit and it works fine, even converting my poor handwriting to editable text, although I don't know how much I'll use it.  The S-pen would be great for business people or if you're an artist, I'm neither.  I purchased a slim leather case that fits perfect and provides basic protection for the tablet.Check out the Note.

I actually had a good old Nokia N800 4.3\" tablet I took notes with a few years back, but it was a resistive screen and clearly not the right format. I also had a netbook with a wacom bamboo, and a PC convertible tablet (heavy). These worked well on drawing, but clearly not for taking notes in the tiny seats we get at university. I then jumped to an android tablet, the ASUS transformer. I really liked it, the joys of Android are not lost on me, but notes was out of the question, even with a capacitive stylus. So I got excited to get the Note 10.1 I have traded all of my notebooks for S Note, and drawing is great with Sketchbook Pro for Android.There are even a few cool tools in SNote like formula match (I have gotten the most wows out of my fellow students with this one, write a formula, get it recognized, then click search to have wolfram plot a graphic and calculate its value),  a shape detector that makes circles, squares and lines for graphics, and handwriting recognition, but I haven't really used that, I prefer my own handwriting, really. If you study anything that forces you not only to write but also to draw schematics, graphics and the like, this is a great tool to have everything in a digital copy :).I also pull it out to play some games with my friends in the cafeteria, Spit! and Reversi are some of the favorites for killing time and work well in 2-player mode.PROSSPen Rocks, if you want to take notes by hand or drawing, its really comfortable.

I also have an iPad and I have been testing many things on both devices. While note 10.1 is better on Google based apps. iPad has slightly superior edge on most of the similar apps (just slightly). But the final word here is the S Pen. If you want to get this tablet for anything except the pen, don't do it and go for other tablets with better resolution/price/etc. However, if you care about taking notes or/and sketching, note 10.1 is a must have. I can not express how much I like taking notes on my note 10.1 and if you want to compare note 10.1 to iPad from productivity point of view iPad is not even close imo. Just try to sketch something on 10.1 and you understand how good it feels. Now I don't need to carry anything except my 10.1 to any lecture that I go to. This will save me a lot of time later for finding the notes too.Cons:- The screen resolution could be better.- Jelly Bean is still not available on it (Samsung recently announced that it will be released on note 10.1 soon).Pros:- S Pen works just great.- Generally smooth and powerful.- Easy to hold and very light/thin.- Samsung S Pen apps (in particular double screen features) are very useful.Overall this is one of the best devices I have ever bought and I highly recommend it for anyone who has any task related to note taking or sketching.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Im obsessed", "Author": "Stacey Hovland", "ReviewID": "R32BXGIN59F5OT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 for a whole week now and I haven't found anything that I cant use it for.

There are so many apps that come with this tablet, too many to mention.  The battery lasts for the period stated, even with high usage. The tablet itself is sturdy, with great resolution.  The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.  For photos of people (smile shot) it does a great job.This has almost replaced my cell phone since I use apps for phone calls and messaging.

I began realizing my iPad was just not very flexible when it came to more than pixels per square inch or how many apps are in the store. It became a huge hassle navigating between 2 apps that I needed open at the same time. It was a pain trying to write with a stylus with a tip as large as my little finger. It took up valuable time having to sign in to the iTunes store every time I wanted a new app or wanted to look at app inventory.The Galaxy Note 10.1 does away with all of that. I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen. May not sound like much but wait until you try it, you will wonder how you ever did without it. The stylus for the Note is one of the main reasons for getting the Note (along with the multitasking). I am \"middle aged\" but in college and I take LOTS of notes. Trying to take notes with an iPad stylus was so frustrating that I gave up after several tries and money wasted on styluses with huge tips and writing that looked like it was done with a giant Sharpie that has a smushed tip. It was typical to get about 8 lines of text on a page before having to open a new blank page in my notebook.The Note's thin tip and adjustable text size really makes taking notes on a tablet truly useful. Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store. Also there is the Samsung App Store and Google Play to choose from when looking for safe and supported apps. I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters. I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note. The display is fabulous, clear, clean and crisp. Once you reach a certain amount of pixels it doesn't matter anymore. The human eye can only detect so much resolution before improvement stops. I don't know if the Note has a \"retina\" display and I don't care because I don't see how it could get any better. The Note is lightning quick. More so than my iPad in every way. Apps load quicker, apps open quicker, pages switch quicker and on and on.Bottom line is that the Galaxy Note, in my opinion, out does the iPad in just about every arena. The iPad now seems a little childish with it's \"one-thing-at-a-time\" limitations. I have always been irked by Apple's attitude towards the rest of the tech world. They use connectors no one else uses, they don't let the user make any adjustments to anything (especially storage, I hate that), iTunes is such a pain to use with its proprietary format and focus on the app store instead of the user.The Note has really made it useful to have a tablet. The interface and features are geared towards the user, not the company. I can do such much more with my tablet now and I don't get frustrated every day because of what my tablet can't do. The Note does everything and does it all well. I cannot see ever going backwards by getting another iPad.EDIT: It has been a couple of months and I still love the Note 10.1. HOWEVER, there is some sort of ongoing issue with Samsung's cables. My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB. Looking through the Internet I see I am not alone, a long way from it. Many, many users have reported the same issue. I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter. Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly. Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE. The cables are the problem. In fact one of my new cables came with the tablet plug 30 degrees tilted in its casing! Defective before it left the warehouse! Samsung is impossible to contact regarding these issues and when you find a way to contact them you may never get an answer, at least I didn't. So, Samsung's Customer Service leaves MUCH to be desired, BUT the Note is a fabulous device that I grow to like more each day. Be prepared to spend a few extra dollars on replacement cables (order extras when you order your Note) but the device is worth the added expense.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Delighted by this tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TUTD6YEY4OLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted a tablet since the first ipad came out, but couldn't justify the price.

I rarely use google for anything, much less use my pad for music, movies, books, magazines or the popular social media.  I resent not being able to delete them since the basic workings of the pad are built into these unwanted programs; this causes me to hate google all the more.  Their store is useful but that is all I use.  Were they to tie the store alone to the pad, and were I not be forced to endure their constant upgrades for programs I would rather delete, I would not dispise Google as much. Samsung makes a great pad with excellent support.  It is sad that they don't make a keyboard for it and that Google forces so many of its programs on us.

Being a university student I used to bring my Macbook to school for taking notes. It was heavy and clumsy.Bringing the Note along is so easy and it doesn't weight anything. In fact, I never leave home without it now.The primary use I had in mind for it was note-taking during lectures and classes. It offers a wide variety for doing so just with with the tools that is already installed on the tablet.

I check email, look at pinterest/facebook, and do some reading. I also listen to music quite a bit from amazon cloud and pandora.I probably would've been fine with a cheaper tablet, but my husband and I felt like if we were going to spend the money, we may as well make a good investment the first time. We did a lot of research and chose the galaxy note. I love it. The final selling point fornus was the sd card capability. I can put my kids movies on an sd card instead of having to take up space on the tab. Not a big deal for some, but I liked that.The camera is awesome too. Sound is great.

I'm fine with a plastic body so long as it feels sturdy, but this tablet doesn't. The leather case I bought with it gives me piece of mind about having it in my backpack. I wouldn't trust it without a case. I've had 2 samsung phones and a tablet of theirs, the quality was much higher.It's been great for school. I have to read a ton of pdfs and MS word docs. The general productivity is good. I noticed many apps don't interact well with windowed viewing. They open fine but when you resize them the content won't rescale. I would like if it remembered the resizing for each app.S-pen isn't as functional as I'd like. It is very precise for altering/highlighting document, and I'm sure if I did any graphics it would shine. I do prefer papyrus beta over snote, it's just a more realistic replacement for pen and paper. I do enjoy Snotes formula feature very much.Gaming  wise it's a beast. I've bought and played a few games that have high end tablet graphics and they play great. The only time there is lag is when high detail water is rendered in a game like wild blood.The form factor is top notch. Everything feels like it's where it should be.

It feels quite solid, similar to the one that I messed around with at Best Buy.  The S Pen is a bit smaller than expected, but I have tiny hands. So far so good.It runs smoother than my two year old smart phone, and is quicker than my Asus EP121. That is all I wanted. I do not think the pen actually has 1024 levels of pressure, having used Wacom tablets for 10 years, but it works well  despite this.My arm tends to bump the menu at the bottom when I am writing notes, but this is a minor annoyance. Also the tablet is only available right now in black at 32gb storage. Oh well. No accessories yet either, at least nothing official from  samsung.I would reccomend this. I think there may be a number of bad units floating around though based on some of the reviews. My experience so far has been great!  I will update this if that changes.EDIT: So after owning this for a couple months now, I'd like to update.1. On the cracking/squeaking: It appears that this comes from the hollow zone where the S-pen inserts. I can now hear creaking when I move the device around a bit or pick it up from this side, but it isn't anything I'm concerned about. It's more noticeable when the S-pen is out but I don't really think it is a problem.2. This thing is great for taking class notes! I love it for my coursework. The software it is shipped with is not so good for writing on PDFs (it's super annoying to import them into S-Note) so I ended up purchasing a 3rd party app that works pretty well. Also the fact that you can't change the default backgrounds easily in S-Note is annoying. But I find myself using S-Note more than the 3rd party app I purchased for notetaking (Quill).3. The screen resolution has not been a problem. Everything looks crisp and nice.4. Battery life is great. I can watch Netflix for around 5-6 hours before I need to plug in. I took it with me to the airport and was able to watch 3 2-hour movies on a single charge. Granted my screen was not on full brightness and I turned off all the extras (wifi, etc). In normal note-taking mode where I am using it for class etc I can get a full class day out of it (at least 8 hours), even with web browsing etc, and still have juice left over to do stuff when I get home without charging!

Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).

The handwriting recognition tech works remarkably well, but you have to be patient and careful in practice.Features and Customization:  Samsung's TouchWiz UX brings a ton of features and customization, including side-by-side windowing and a pop-out video player.Design: The tablet feels very comfortable in the hand with nice rounded edges.  I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.Specs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAMCons:Display: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.Construction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.Performance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.  The complexity of TouchWiz and the variety of features contribute to this problem and might be cured with future updates (Jelly Bean).Camera:  The camera records video in 720p instead of 1080p, and takes mediocre stills.  Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "SD card not properly used.", "Author": "Dr.Z", "ReviewID": "R3OSW2EA4QTOX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Warning...

Quite smooth processing, GPS is very nice. Multitasking is well-thought. But I don't think that the NOTE app that comes with the tablet is useful for people basically looking for advanced note taking features. My main dislike of its note-taking features is caused by the handwriting to text conversion (dis)abilities of the NOTE app.I am a PhD student in History and I take written notes from my readings and archival documents. So I was for a long time looking for a good device that can properly convert what is written into digital text in an organized manner. I watched various videos of Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet in use and it didn't seem bad to me in general. Yet I had some reservations with the general performance of the device so I waited with the hope that stylus technologies and software will improve and a better device will come out soon. When I first heard about Samsung Note 10.1 thought that this would be the one and got excited though it is more expensive than Lenovo. And purchased it immediately. But I am really disappointed with its note-taking capabilities (My wife disliked it more than I did). I am not a well versed person in technical issues and I don't have much information about tablets and note taking technology but I think I know what will be a satisfying device for my needs and for people who are looking for a convenient and user friendly note-taking tablet.So I think the software on Samsung Note 10.1 is really poor except for everyday simple note-taking tasks like preparing to-do lists or taking very quick, casual notes. It even makes your casual notes more casual when it converts them to digital text. Very annoying.I think that Lenovo does a better job in note-taking -especially in converting the handwriting to text- as far as I understand from the videos I watched about Lenovo and from my experience with Samsung Note 10.1.Samsung Note 10.1 recognizes your handwriting well and converts it to text rightly most of the times. (Indeed my wife also complained about the errors in conversion; my handwriting is better, so it performs enough overall with my handwriting). I don't find writing very uncomfortable but not very enjoyable too. You cannot get the feeling of writing on a paper and do get a sense of plasticity. This might be a common situation with note taking on tablets though.It is also a little bit sloppy in displaying what you write. There is sometimes a slight lag in instantly showing what you write. It occasionally cannot respond well to your writing and misses some parts of what you scribe, especially if it is small in size.I mostly get pleasure from writing with a pen on paper. I understand the limits of writing on a tablet and don't set my standards so high and don't expect a similar performance from writing on a tablet with writing on a paper. But I don't feel that writing takes place with ease on this tablet. My handwriting looks worse than it actually is and I cannot write smoothly and small enough. Writing small is important with this device because the converted text ends where your handwriting ends, so I was trying to write smaller to put as much words as possible in one line to get more organized final text. Though I didn't had the best experience when writing, I could bear it if the software had performed satisfactorily.But I think the main problem starts when the NOTE application converts what is written. It is not very easy to correct or delete what is written. First of all, the wait time before conversion when you ceased writing is not long enough - at least for me (I don't know if there is a setting to lag this time). So it gives you little thinking time while writing and puts you into discomfort since you cannot write when it is converting. Sometimes you try to continue writing after a short break for thinking and what you write cannot be displayed. This can be a problem if you are writing fast without looking at the screen; for example in the classroom.The worse thing is when NOTE app converts a second group of words after pausing writing, the first word of what you write anew joins \"without any space\" the last word of what is written before. You have to push the space button first on the top menu before you continue to write. This surely disrupts a continuous writing experience, especially considering its short waiting time before conversion. You cannot immediately start writing where you left as in natural writing.And you have to press \"enter\" to go to the next line when you go on to write after pausing, which nonetheless makes sense.But my main frustration is with its inadequacy of aligning the converted text. It actually creates a box of text when you start writing. If you want to write to somewhere else you have to create another box (paragraph) by pushing a specific button on the top menu. And I didn't like the way these boxes work. Managing them is quite cumbersome.When you are writing in a box, if you start writing in the next line it will convert your writings to the next line. This is good but the biggest issue here is when you arrive at the end of the line with your handwriting and go on to write without pause in the next line, the text will start in the next line although it has a lot of space till the end in digital format. So you won't get formated lines but irregularly short and long lines. It looks like what sometimes happens when you convert a PDF document to Word. And when you stop writing in the selected box the size of the box is determined by the size of the longest line, which means if you write a long set of text your box will extend as a long vertical box. It looks weird and irregular with other boxes with different width. I tried to write smaller so that the box would be wider but my handwriting wasn't small enough to put more words than the preset font of the digital text. And I couldn't find a way to set the font size (maybe there is, I am open to suggestions). I think Lenovo Thinkpad, actually MyScript Notes Mobile app, makes a better job in this respect, because it continues to add words to the digital text until the digital text arrives at the end of the line.So It is a pain to manage converted text in this tables. You have to go to the specific box you want to edit and have to arrange the lines by the left, right, enter, space or back space buttons. You cannot select a word or add one in between two words -which generally happens in the natural flow of writing- by pointing out the location with the pen but you have to scroll to that specific location by using the right and left buttons on the top. You cannot delete a word by selecting it either -or by crossing it out as in Lenovo thinkpad. These are some of the quite inconvenient and clumsy features of the software. There are a lot like these. In sum, you cannot correct mistakes occurred during writing or during conversion to text when you are taking fast notes, for example whilst listening to someone. You cannot immediately interfere in a previously written section of the text. It will also take a lot of time to adjust the lines if you want to do so after you finish writing. So it is weird that it is a lot faster to type with your keyboard on your computer than writing with your hand on this device.Good thing is if you pause and continue writing, you can write anywhere and it will convert the text where you left but you have to put a space before you start as I said.If you want to write to somewhere else you have to open a new box from the top menu. You can change the size of the boxes but the text does not adjust to the new size, so you cannot widen the text as you wish. You have to go to the beginning of each line and press back space button on the top to adjust lines.What is also ridiculous about Note app is that you cannot go back and convert a selected section of handwritten -unconverted- text you wrote on Notes. Adding such an option could save some time and partially compensate for mentioned shortcomings of the Notes app because writing on handwriting mode without instant conversion is more comfortable. This shortcoming finally made me realize that this thing is not intended for well-organized, professional note-taking purposes.In sum, formatting and editing are really bad in this application. It even looks amateurish. I don't know if this device brings a good standard for the current tablets and note-taking software  technology so far but I don't think that the software for note-taking and especially for text conversion in this device will satisfy a common group of users who have expectations other than simple entertainment and very simplistic note-taking tasks.To say the least, this device is far from being user friendly, functional and effective, considering that you spend a lot of time to put it into work and cannot get half the results you get from writing on a paper or even from typing. It doesn't seem that mentioned shortcomings are irremediable. The main issue that annoys me is that it looks like they didn't give much thought to improve program's functionality. The device does give you a clumsy and sketchy feel of use with note taking. With this device you cannot even get close to the ease of taking notes on a paper. I even doubted my ability to use the device after seeing many complimentary reviews which also caused me to purchase it in the first place. But if my experience with this device is correct, it is extremely ironic to name a device Samsung \"NOTE\" although one of the worst things it can do is providing a comfortable and effective note taking experience.Maybe I am expecting too much from this tablet with current technology. And maybe I could not make myself cognizant enough of its features. So I am open to any suggestions about using Note app more efficiently. Or I'd love to learn if the Note app is open to improvement in the short run or if there are other apps that can make better use of the potential of the tablet.I looked for other android applications for note taking and text conversion to give a last chance to this device but couldn't find a better one than MyScript Notes Mobile which I wasn't able download and install on this one.I am very disappointed with the incompetence of the software on this device for converting handwriting to text. I am still wondering if I missed a mark. I would give 2 stars if I only took the note-taking features of the device into consideration.So I will return it unless it surprises me soon for good.Nevertheless this tablet still might be a good choice for the ones who want to take note only in handwriting -without conversion- and the ones who looks mainly for drawing and photoshop features.I think it will be wise to wait for Microsoft Surface Pro, Lenovo Thinkpad 2 and especially for Ipad 4. There are news that Apple applied last year to take patent for a note-taking technology it developed. I am especially hopeful of coming iPad's competency of note-taking if it comes with it considering its retina display and its success in creating user-friendly and convenient apps. From the rumors I understand that they are trying to create a writing experience similar to one in note taking on paper. I am sure that all three will do a better job in this respect than Samsung Note 10.1.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2O1UMLTKMH0JH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I take my Samsung Galaxy Note EVERYWHERE!

I debated between an Ipad and the Note, and the features of the Note wowed me!  The Ipad seemed to me to be rather limited in its capabilities, simplistic, really.I did worry, however, about the comments I had read about the Note's screen resolution, that it didn't measure up to the Ipad's.  Well, I've got to say, that on a 10\" screen, I'm not sure how OBVIOUS a difference there is between the two.  Blow up the screen to a 13\" + size, and, then the difference would be clear.So, the s-pen is fabulous.  Feel it skim across the screen.  A delight!  Still haven't figured out the programs included, but I'm new to the tablet world, so the learning process is a positive challenge for me!I ordered a gel cover for the back of the Note.  From what I read, the glass is quite resistant to scratches.  Will see how the gel works when it arrives.Also, just read yesterday (Oct. 8, 2012), that Consumer Reports gave the Note 10.1 a RAVE review.  That's a comforting sign.So, with that comment, I'll say, do your homework about the Note 10.1.  Go to a store (Best Buy) and play with it.  Compare it to the Ipad.  Which one FEELS right for you?  And if you purchase the Note 10.1, make SURE that the two seals on the box are intact.  (My first purchase had been opened, repacked and sold as a new device!

The Galaxy Note 10.1 has the potential of being the best of both worlds. I can still write my notes with a pen and have them stored forevermore in the Note, unlike all those little slips of paper that tend to get misplaced.The S-Note app, however, is rather rudimentary and buggy. Today, while using the app to make some notes, my handwriting was converted to text but that text immediately disappeared from the page. Also, the app froze the screen a couple of times, requiring a restart of the tablet.As others have mentioned, text formatting options are very limited for text that has been converted from handwriting. If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text. You then have to tap the space button. Otherwise, the next word converted will be joined to the previous word. EXAMPLE: You write, \"This is a test of handwriting\" You pause and the handwriting is converted. You resume writing, \"accuracy\". What you get is: \"This is a test of handwritingaccuracy\" I HOPE the next version of the S-Note software will have an \"Auto Space After Last Word\" option. I have to say though that I am impressed with it's ability to interpret my rather poor penmanship.Another feature that I would like is the ability to convert handwriting after the fact rather than on the fly. For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once. And I would like to be able to select a portion of a handwritten page and convert just that portion to text.Samsung, are you listening?!?", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really like it", "Author": "rmay", "ReviewID": "R2XEV8KRNP5GG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very clear and capable.

So far it's been pretty reliable, I take my notes in class, upload it to Google Drive, and access the notes through any computer with internet access. The S-Pen is amazing, it not too hard to write with and my handwriting looks pretty much the same compared to my normal writing, although as expected it is a little worse. The battery life is pretty good, I am able to last a school day which is around 8 hours taking notes (I don't use the tablet the whole day). The apps are fine because it has Google Play, and I don't really play games on this so i wouldn't know if it lags. I will list some of my favorite pros and some of the things i do not like:Pros:- Can Open two apps at once. THIS is extremely useful for students who want to take notes and access the calculator or Internet, or even the everyday person who wants to multitask. I think the iPad doesn't do this so it is at a huge disadvantage.- Google Play Store-S-pen. I see other college students type their notes on the iPad, which to me looks time-consuming and it's harder to draw pictures or formulas or write something that would be difficult with a keyboard.-Lightweight. It's 10 inches but it is still easy to carry.-Ability to upload notes to Google Drive. I love this because Google is so convenient and I can access my notes and print it out through a school printer.Cons:-I wish I could write on pdf's or word documents. Maybe there is a way, but I didn't find out yet. SEE BELOW.-The screen froze on me once already. Hopefully it doesn't happen again but it's less than 4 months and it doesn't look good if that happens, especially when I need it during class.EDIT: I found that you can download PDF's and import them into S-Note, which is very useful because you can just write on the professor's PDF's, Word Docs or Powerpoints without making a seperate note. I really like that feature. Also another thing I did not mention is that when you write on the bottom of the screen, you are prone to touching the settings option by accident which happened to me numerous times. I'm not sure how to fix it but it get's annoying.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "loved it!", "Author": "mary grace camat", "ReviewID": "R3VDV5OY0ESQ50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy for its price!

I have a Galaxy S3, so I immediately decided a Samsung tablet would be what I purchased. I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.No home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.S-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.No swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2BBCF6XHBSOUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's get the cons out of the way b/c I'm sure that's #1 priorityCons1) Icon text and system text are not clear. Also small text looks like they suffer massive pixel shortage (which is not true).BUT texts are incredibly clear and legible when reading books or watching caption on video, or viewing normal/large/larger text on the website. If you compare those activities with one of those $500 tablets like Ipad Air, Note 2014 or Lumia 2025, they all look the same.2) Awkward positions for control buttons.For example, if you use a tablet case and lay your tablet horizontally, the volume, headphone input, and power buttons will be on the bottom. In other words, you can't use your headphone (unless u flip it the other way), adjust your volume, or turn off/on the screen unless you have to lift up your tablet.3) Proprietary charging/data sync cable. It is not the standard USB micro. It is the Samsung 30 pin or something cable.Pros1) Battery life is longer than the Note 8. I was able to watch movies for more than 4 hours straight.2) Not heavy at all considering it weighs 650 grams.3) Responsive and fast for an old processor. I did not notice any lag when switching between apps or playing game, movies.4) S-Pen is great (don't use the S-pen apps, they are ineffective and inefficient at best). You have to buy the 8 PI S pen to truly appreciate the accuracy of the pen though. The included S-pen is only 6 pi.5) No real buttons. You navigate the tablet using the on-screen buttons. This is incredibly helpful when using with the S-pen and everything else. It really helps you when you are holding the tablet too.Conclusion- I feel that this tablet has so much potential if it wasn't for Samsung failed on the S-pen app and the awkward positions of the volume, power, microphone input buttons. In addition, for some reason the text clarity of the system icon and small texts are garbled. This does not make a good impression on first time buyer especially when they they think a tablet is an Ipad.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quad Core punch !", "Author": "Allin2max", "ReviewID": "R35LF8F1DDSEEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung had already come out with a 2nd generation Note when I purchased this device, but the quad core processor clearly beats most of the other tablets including the newer Apple device.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy", "Author": "Stephen J.

The price is just right and I am not spending $2000 for a tablet that I cannot take with me. What sold me is the technology used for the S-pen which is provided by WACCOM who are leaders in the industry of tablets used for art. Other than the fact that it is a quad core and has a great operating system Android this tablet screams beyond the capability of the Ipad. Don't be fooled by people who say that the resolution of the display is under par with other devices. I have had no issues with watching video content to even notice any flaws. The front facing speakers is also an awesome feature and makes movie watching even more enjoyable.My biggest complaint is issues with connectivity with WIFI, from what I've read that this is an issue that Samsung has not yet resolved with any updates. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. From what I have read from forums is that when the tablet is connected to WIFI it will lose connectivity on and off which is really annoying when trying to watched streamed content (Youtube for an example). Forums state the only way to fix the issue is by replacing he tablet with a newer one. I don't see this as good option and hope the Samsung will have an update to fix the issue. Mind you my comment about video playback is different from streaming video content.As far as gaming on the tablet seems awkward even with the controls on screen. I am currently researching a way to connect an Xbox360 wireless controller to the tablet to make game play more comfortable and more enjoyable. DO NOT PURCHASE a cheep OTG adapter from Amazon due to you get what you pay for.

I will also admit that I was hesitant of the purchase.  I was never a laptop person as I was uncomfortable with it on my lap while I watch the kids.This was kind of a desperation purchase as I needed something I could take outside and room to room as the kids roamed.  I looked at the ipad, galaxy 2 and the note.  My eldest daughter has the galaxy phone and I was always impressed by its performance. And knowing how I multi task my destop to the limit, I decided tge extra cas for the quad vore processor the note 10.1 has was the most likely to satisify.Satisify is a huge understatement.  This is a fabulous machine that even 4 mos later I keep finding new uses for.The processor hums along great with multiple browsers and apps running.  Switching between front and rear cameras is great on video skype one you figure out how to do it and the voice recognition software built in is outstanding.  I would easily pay full price for another of these when the time comes.A few hints.  By nature one of the first things I did was install firefox browser.  Dont bother, ff mobike is nowhere near as good as the desktop.  Get Dolphin browser and chrome, each has a few features thst make them almidt mandatory.Dolphin - as many discover,  android discontinued flash support.  If you play browser games use this.  The dolphin browser will support legacy flash plug-in that let you play browser flash games and online apps like espn fantasy football draft software.Chrome - Chrome has a great feature that magnifies smaller links and buttons.

I got the 32GB Deep Grey one.  The battery life is really great on this.I'm assuming most people get this because of the pen, if you aren't I would advise you to get the galaxy tab 2 10.1 inch.  It's pretty much the same tablet from what I understand, just no pen, and a whole lot cheaper.Now for those of you who want it for the pen...There's some pretty good apps out there for drawing and taking notes.  I'll list some of my favorites I've found so far:*Autodesk Sketchbook Pro- (Paid) I just got this app and have been experimenting with drawing in it.  The canvas sizes are preset and each have a certain amount of layers for each one.  The smallest canvas (which is still pretty big) has 18 layers, which is more than I think I will ever need.  It comes with a variety of different brushes.  I'm still exploring the brushes and figuring out everything.  People have made very beautiful art with this app, and I hope that one day I can too.  I'm pretty sure it was $4.99, you can try out the free version first to see if you like it though.*LayerPaint - (Paid) This is a pretty good app.  You can pick the size of your canvas.  It has an option to \"smooth\" your lines which is nice. It has as many layers as it can handle.  I haven't tested it, but I'm sure that's a lot.*Write  - (Free) This is a great app for taking notes. It has different paper options, like lined, grid, and others.  It uses vectors so it is clear no matter how far you scroll in or out.  The back option is really neat because you can hold your pen down on it and then a wheel will pop up and you can rotate your pen around it to go forwards or back, which is really helpful when trying to erase a word or two.  It also has an insert option that lets you make room for a word and will actually push the words down the lines.  It's really neat and I'm not sure if I explained it that well.  You can export your notes to PDF.  You can change your pen color and size and it has highlighter options as well. The only down side is that you cannot import images to your notes.* I can add more apps if anybody likes, I just got tired of typing descriptions out, but if people want to read them I'll write them.If anybody has any questions feel free to ask and I will try my best to answer!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "meesuka", "ReviewID": "R6CQ62586X682", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my Favorite Tab so I'm going to be a little bias but i did buy it and its was new awesome cam with everything, and awesomely ship.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Samantha Belfer", "ReviewID": "RN3OP22J6170C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is easy to use.

They make it hard, for example, to be able to pull up the menu to enlarge your page.  The worst is the keyboard.  When typing the keyboard it is very annoying that the keyboard is far too big for the tablet because it's the entire length of the tablet.  Sure you can split the keyboard or make it smaller; but, when I made it smaller, I had a hard time getting it back to size.

The pen is enormously useful for annotating PDFs and image editing.  The included pen applications are very good, and there are some more pen applications in the market.There are some niggling problems.  In many apps, the pen is difficult to use because palm rejection doesn't work or doesn't work well; it would be great if one could disable touch altogether when using the pen.  The plastic case is a fingerprint magnet and feels cheap; you probably want to put it into a case.The Samsung accessory plug is a major nuisance.  You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.  The plug sticks out the bottom and interferes with cases and stands (you can turn the tablet upside down to avoid that, but then the cameras don't work properly).  You can't just hook up a micro-USB cable for charging, so if you didn't bring your Samsung charger, you're out of luck.  Trying to do multiple things at once (like, oh, viewing camera images on a TV) becomes an exercise in frustration.The HDMI output in particular is nearly useless: it requires an external power source, the HDMI output is in an odd format (a black bar at the bottom) and doesn't work with some HDMI displays at all.  This means the Galaxy Note 10.1 is not a solution for business or academic presentations, since you have to set it up with a rat's nest of cables and then still aren't guaranteed that it will even work.  This really bothers me, because it means I have to take the Galaxy tablet and then another device for giving a presentation; more often than not, I just leave the Galaxy tablet at home because of it.I'm also not particular fond of Samsung's modifications to the Android UI.  If they stuck with standard Android, they'd have a better product.  Unfortunately, Samsung spoils all their tablets with these little problems; they seem to try to imitate Apple and don't realize that many people buy Android tablets because they want standard, open UIs and connectors.  If I wanted to have a completely proprietary \"ecosystem\" and spend hundreds of dollars on accessories, I might as well get an iPad.In the end, if you need a tablet with a pen, this is the tablet to get because the pen is really good.  If you just want a 10\" Android tablet and don't really need the pen, this is still a good tablet, but frankly, you can get better tablets without Samsung's little annoyances from other vendors and pay a little less for the tablet, and a lot less for accessories.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first tablet experience", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWGM75SUJRN3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife.

The pen has a huge amount of sensitivity to it, allowing for some great lines, from light and sketchy to thick and bold without much effort. Of course, a lot of it depends on the actual program you use that utilizes what the Note is capable of.That being said, there's not a TON of options for programs. I really wish there was something that was comparable to Photoshop, but of course, given that this is not a PC tablet, I shouldn't expect it to be able to run something that powerful. But, I've manage to find 3-4 programs that work pretty well for painting and sketching, so I can't ask for much more.Everything else? It's a tablet.

I was hoping to replace my aging iPad 2. My iPad 2 was experiencing memory issues and couldn't handle running more than one app or browser tab at the same time. I figured the note 10 would be great since it has 2gb of ram, offers real multitasking and the multi apps feature. I had read about people experiencing clicking and creaking with their note 10. I tried 2 of them out and both had this issue. The first was really bad it creaked and clicked all over the place. The second one mostly creaked and clicked around the s pen area and then began doing it on the left bottom corner. I also experienced the wifi dropping on the second note I tried. Then I also found considerable backlight bleeding on the second note. Besides the the defect issues I experienced I found the note 10 a pleasure to use. The note 10 is the lightest and thinnest tablet on the market. I really loved the sound on it with its stereo front facing speakers. The screen was also great looking I didn't even notice that it wasn't 1080p or a retina display. I did find the note to be on the slow side at times I did experience lag. I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen. I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3. I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram. I didn't like the stock email app which is also on my s3. In order to view an email in HTML format you must first scroll to the bottom of the email then click on load more. I knew that the note had a 16:9 format and thought I would be ok with it, but I didn't like reading or viewing web pages in portrait mode as it was to narrow for me. I much prefer the 4:3 for reading. Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming. I also knew that android has much fewer tablet apps than apple and thought I would just get by without them and use the websites. In the end I missed a bunch of tablet apps I use a lot on my iPad 2. I really missed the flipboard, Facebook, twitter, imdb and pocket apps. The s pen is really cool especially for some one who draws or takes notes. I note much of a stylus person, but I do read that the stylus on the note is the best from any tablet. I also liked the idea of the multi apps feature. It's main downfall is you can't use it with any app you choose. Only selected Samsung apps work in multi app mode. Would be nice if you could use any browser you choose or YouTube or other apps. The peel universal remote was also really cool. It worked with all my devices (2 Samsung tvs, apple tv 2, Sony blu ray). I did experience some issues with the remote but for the most part it worked. One main draw back with the remote is that it wouldn't let control every function of a device. There was also a lack of customization with the controls.  I was also surprised to see there was no s voice on the note tablet. There was the google voice actions which had very limited functionality. Besides the quality control issues I may have actually replaced my iPad 2  completely with the note 10. When comparing this tablet with the Asus tf201 I tried early this year. Samsung has come a long way. This note 10 is much better than the asus tablets on the market now.  This tablet is also a huge improvement over previous Samsung tablets. I ended up buying the iPad 3. It doesn't have as many features as the note 10, but it's easy to use, it's reliable and it just works. I did spend a few hundred dollars more on the iPad 3 than the note 10 but I am happy. I get to use my favorite apps and a higher resolution screen. I may revisit the note 10 gets the jellybean update. I may end up waiting for the nexus 10 tablet to finally get what I want.

Using supplied Samung charger I plug in, go to bed, wake up and its at 26%? Battery icon shows it's charging. MANY people have this problem since update to JellyBean from ICS. As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it. No confidence at all, many wasted minutes assuming charge was in progress. I cant just plug in and continue using, very frustrating! Apparent need to clear out tasks, memory, etc --much more maitenance than ipad.Artistic Apps are way behind on android than ios! Across several apps functions like zoom cause temporay blackout on screen during active scaling.  Also noteable is fact that top shelf art apps such as Layer Paint, Infinate painter have crashed several times since purchase (lucky ive only been screwing around). Brush lag in realtime stroke rendering has been unacceptable in many cases on android apps -compared to ipad apps(Paper 52) where i have been impressed and i'm using hardware inferior Ipad 2!Final: I love the idea of this tablet and look forward with fingers crossed to better apps that utilize great hardware and superior S-pen!", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good Product ** highly Satisfied**", "Author": "Shaied Perez", "ReviewID": "R3MIGQU9EQ6LYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good tablet...as i am using it daily havnt seen any flaws so far...if u order this gadget plz also order a good screen protector for this cuz this screen tends to grab finger smudges...other thn tht its an awsm tablet.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Great but wish the white came in the 32GB!", "Author": "Darren Love", "ReviewID": "R32A9GMXUJ23GT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this note, the pen alone makes it better than any other unit on the market.

On paper and specification details it sounds like it should be great. It was actually just OK for me. The pen was cool but didn't really use it as much as I thought I would after the new wore off. The display is OK. It wasn't horrible and it wasn't fantastic. I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain. I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues. Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background. The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds. I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port. The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy. I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in. This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future. I do think Samsung has the right idea about the speakers in the front, genius really! And the sound quality and volume were excellent. At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors. I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple. I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary? Why? Maybe I got one with some manufacturing issues and maybe some of the issues are Ice Cream Sandwich issues that will be resolved with Jelly Bean when it lands for the Galaxy. So, while I returned my Galaxy Note 10.1, I can't say it isn't a great tablet for others. It just didn't suit my likes and desire for a \"Whole package\". Maybe I just bought before it was out long enough to shake out the bugs! I have had 2 other Android tablets in the past, the Acer Iconia A500 and the Asus Transformer TF101.

It is a fine device for an entertainment platform as far as I can tell, just not a serious business productivity tool.Primarily I had high hopes to use it to take detailed notes and jot down sketches for productivity reasons. Hence the interest in the S-Pen.Secondary to my use was to do research on the web and to pick up/send  e-mail. Particularly with work related photos and drawings...not family vacation pictures.Tertiary to my use was stuff like calendar and alarm clocks. I can already do that on my phone.With regards to my intended use of this device stuff like watching movies, playing games, playing music, tweeting or facebook, or GPS tracking of my location for marketing suggestions is useless to me and of less than zero interest.If my use parameters aren't aligned with yours you won't like my review. So be it. Save your time and energy and don't bother to \"flame\" me. If what I listed above sounds more or less like what you are hoping for, then this review is for you.The S-Pen is the heart of why I had high hopes for this device, so let me start there, and also with the included memo/pen app \"S Notes\"The S-pen is a big step in the direction I had hoped for, but it is still in the toy stage. When evaluating the amount of whiz-bang it is a lot of \"whiz,\" and not much \"bang.\" Dozens of colors; different special tips; you can set the width of the lines etc... All \"whiz.\" That is whiz a-la MS Paint from the  \"Win95\"  era with not quite as many options. Try to write or draw anything precise with it? No good.  No \"bang.\" It isn't precise enough and it doesn't do the job well enough. It's touted \"special functions\" either don't work or are balky. Writing/sketching with it is like trying to take a note on a cocktail napkin with a broken crayon. Even in its finest setting it just isn't precise enough to mimic a real pen (or pencil) and paper. In a space where I would be able to easily write 7 or 8 perfectly legible words in my long-practiced block-capital draftsman-style writing I have to settle for two or three words at best on this device, and those are crayon-like and hardly legible. Switching to the handwriting-to-text mode improves things, but is too slow to transmute your jottings into typed form so it is more distracting than helpful. Also as soon as it converts a couple of words you must move your input writing down a line so as to not overwrite the typed text, and guess what? The new typed text comes out on the lower line. That is to be expected I suppose, but this whole system needs some refinement. [EDIT: access to the handwriting-to-text as well as voice-to-text and a few other \"productivity\" special functions is not possible in all memo formats. You must use their pre-made templates in order to get these features. You can not add them to your own memo by any means I have been able to discover. Which means Samsung might as well have skipped including them in the software. What is the point of a feature you can't access it?] You can switch to the keyboard and type, but I find touch screen keyboards lacking in sufficient tactile feedback to make my input reliable. Typing out a note with my thumbs on a Blackberry gets much better results. there is a speach-to-text function which for me works pretty well except that it isn't always convenient to be talking to your device.  \"This presenter is selling a bunch of nonsense. His reference data is the \"University-Hospital Study\" which was refuted at least 5 years ago. Check your files for that and bring it to staff meeting when we review this proposal\" isn't the sort of thing you want to be blurting out in the middle of a sales presentation.Navigating the menus on the included S-Note memo-taking app is confusing to say the least. I am learning it slowly, but it is far from simple or intuitive. Many icons don't do what you might suspect they would. like touching the \"+\" icon doesn't add a new empty page to write on. It saves the old page. And a lot of functions that should be possible with one simple poke or click or swipe can't be accomplished without first pulling down and changing to the appropriate menu. An example is if you are zoomed in on the page so as to make the handwriting or skethches more precise when returned to normal size, you can't write a few words and then easily scroll to the next part of the zoomed-in page to continue sketching or writing. You have to pull down a menu, change to scroll mode, scroll over, change back to writing mode, dismiss the menu if it is in the way (which it always seems to be) and then continue to write. Doing this every three or four words is very distracting. As far as those menu's being in the way? Some of them are constantly covering parts of the memo page and so those parts of the page cannot ever be accessed to edit or read.It is impractical to do any sort of meaningful dimensioned sketch. It is impractical to try to create a memo more than about a dozen words total. If you were hoping to take detailed notes at a meeting, forget it. If you had hoped to send a working sketch to a draftsman or a shop...forget it. Anything much more detailed than \"Don't forget milk on the way home Friday\" is just too much to get onto one screen without scrolling antics, which are just annoying.The problem is partially the app software, but it is also partially the hardware and the OS. First the Android OS withthe Samsung UI is just plain odd. Not difficult, but just odd. Why do I find my files listed under apps? Why can't I easily shut unused apps off? Why can't I minimize stuff or bring background apps to the foreground easily?.... since they are still running in the background anyway.... unless you went to pains to shut them off...  Yes, you can do this stuff, but it is just odd how you have to go about doing it.  The hardware doesn't have the necessary pen resolution yet. The special features of the pen need to be extended and debugged so you can easily do stuff like scroll around the page without pulling down menus. Being able to pick a bunch of colors and pen types as if you were in MS-Paint might impress a 14 year old girl drawing puppies and coloring flowers but doesn't thrill me. I would have preferred a better, more precise interface. One feature missing that was previously there was the ability to turn the pen over and use the other end as an eraser. This is now gone. Too bad. It made such perfectly intuitve sense.To be fair to Samsung though. No one else seems to be doing any of this any better. So my money is on Samsung to eventually get it really right before anyone else does. They just haven't gotten it there yet. They need to focus on making it a tool, not a toy.The included web browser seems to work OK, not exceptionally well in any regard... but it doesn't make it easy to delete your history or clear your cache, and worst of all, it tries to keep your form data and your passwords in memory. If you have a phone or tablet it is inheirently subject to physical misplacement or loss since you have it with you as you go about your day. So passwords shouldn't be retained on these devices lest someone picks it up and finds their way to all of your sensitive or important data. Kids don't have a lot of overly sensitive data, but business people and adults do. Some people will disagree with that satement, and that is their perrogative, but I'd prefer to be able to set my browser so that it never saves this sort of stuff in the first place. Instead I have to jump through a couple of menu hoops to either get so it won't save the data, or to delete the data after the fact. Why can't I just set that in a preferences menu and have that setting retained?The unit came packed with a metric ton of bloatware to do stuff like download movies and videos, music, interact with social media, etc... etc. All stuff being more or less push-marketed at you by Samsung and Google and usually for a fee or at least to put your eyeballs onto their marketing..... Or to track your location and on-line habits. All this sort of stuff might be of great amusement and delight to a 14 year old kid or a gadget freak, but I find it useless and just in my way. It clogs up my RAM and slows down the device, and it just uses battery life..... and frankly I don't need Google or anyone else tracking my location, spying at my on-line habits, or pushing movie content at me. Unfortunately this sort of software seems to come packed on any and all devices you get these days. Normally I just delete or ignore it. But to delete and disable a lot of this stuff on this device requires \"rooting\" (similar to jailbreaking an iPhone) which I understand voids the warrantee. I'm going to try to live with it and work around it for a couple of more days, but I am already at the stage that I am figuring out how to root the thing and get this stuff out of my way. The device is useless anyway as a business tool unless I can somehow improve its productivity. If I brick it trying to make it useful that is not real a loss. It is already only slightly better than a brick as it is.There is scant little help in learning their UI. For the new user the only way to learn is poke and hope. A few on-line tutorials that really showed you their methods menus and tools would help. They claim to have these things but what they amount to are just ads and marketing gimmicks and they are not truly useful. The stuff they show you is the easy cool stuff. Lots of colors and photos and such. The stuff they don't show you is the useful mundane real stuff. Like how to move the cursor to a particular point in the text to edit a single character. Or how to start a new memo on  a new clean sheet with a new title. If better tutorials exist I can't find them. Therefore the learning curve for a new user results in several days of lost productivity. A serious consideration for any business. I happen to have a determined (some say stubborn) streak, but frankly if it was my employee taking up much time as I have learing this thing I'd take it away from him. Permanently. The device fails miserably as a productivity enhancer, but it is a really REALLY big distraction.This device is part of a new culture in computing and smart phones wherein no one turns off anything or erases any old data. Once again to me this reflects a kind of 14 year old's perspective of not realizing that failing to clean up after ones self, especially digitally, has consequences.... When I am done with an app I want to shut it off, not leave it running and taking up memory in the background. That takes a number of strokes to accomplish on this device. The philosophy of this OS is to leave everything you have previously opened up running and taking up memory. You can't shut an app off directly from its own screen. Instead you can go to the \"Home\" screen and navigate to another app from there, or use the back button. The OS is supposed to decide which apps to terminate when it determines that you need more memory. In the meantime they are gumming up your RAM and probably using up your battery..... and some no doubt are logging data about where you are and what you are doing. Also some have higher priority than others, so you don't decide what you want to leave running, Andriod does. And if Android wants to track you via GPS then that is what Android does. So instead you have to take control yourself by navigating to the task manager every time you want to shut stuff off and clean out your memory. Furthermore regarding notes and e-mail and memos; in business some of that stuff is sensitive and you wouldn't want it falling into the wrong hands. Stuff like cost estimates and profit and loss estimates and even HR stuff. Things no one needs to stumble upon once you are done with them. Try cleaning out that stuff on this device! Agian, it is possible, it just is not easy and straight forward. To be fair these complaints are just as applicable to iPad and iPhone too.... but I look forward to a day when device makers figure out that real adult people with real serious purposes would like serious digital tools for their serious workplace. A real memo and note taking sketch pad and an communicating and e-mailing machine, with decent security for your privacy. Not a crayon-pad coloring-book movie and music player.Call me old fashioned, but I date back to an era where the 64K of RAM on my Apple II+ was a precious resource; and when battery power was to be managed carefully; and when personal privacy was a responsibility taken seriously.

Sullivan \"Su\"", "ReviewID": "R2YML9UA3N1N0C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A shootout between the Galaxy Note and the iPad3 of course.  I REALLY wanted to love the Galaxy Note but, despite the clear advantage of having an intuitive OS, external storage and more horsepower under the hood, I found the Note to be sluggish and inconsistent especially when watching different video formats not yet abandoned by Android, i.e. non-flash, etc.  I benchmarked a new iPad3 alongside the Note and there really was no comparison in terms of speed, clarity and touch responsiveness which are my primary requirements when using a tablet..  For me, the amenities built into the Galaxy are short-lived when your video screen cannot be maximized or when repeated pausing causes the video to stop altogether.  I tried several browsers  that allowed User Agent changes including the ICS +, Chrome and Dolphin and the result was mostly the same and you lose the split-screen function when not using the stock browser.  The S-Pen?  Well, it's a neat feature but when you can't make handwritten notes on the calendar and instead have to type out your appointments, what's the use?  Note taking is a nice feature but it's not very intuitive as you must be in the note app to read everything...why no incorporation into saved pages or Polaris office?  On the upside (and there are several), I liked the form-factor and front, stereo speakers are a big plus although the sound is mostly upper-mids and highs.  The file system is great and I actually prefer an open-ended app environment that is not vetted to death like Apple has.  However, for me, all of that became irrelevant when the core functions proved unreliable.  No Apple fanboy here...I own Samsung products and really wanted this to work for me.  That said, of all the non-Apple tablets I test-drove, the Note 10.1 was clearly the winner of the contenders and I spent a fair amount of time researching and hoping the Galaxy Note would remedy the same issues I encountered with the original Tab 10.1.

They gave me weird ways to push  the on off button. Yes.. on and off button. By the time I realized I wasn't going to get help from Samsung, the date had passed where I could have returned it to Amazon.  now, the power problem has gotten so bad.. My tablet cuts on and off every 5 seconds. over and over until the battery died. Samsung thought on this, so sorry we have to wipe your tablet clean, go back to square one.... now bear in mind, I have  asked Samsung to send it back for over 2 months. I never received any package info for the table.. I've had asked twice for and instruction on  to how to return it to Samsung. i backed up my data and waited, but it never came, now i CAN'T BACK UP MY DATA.. since the table won't turn on for more than 5 seconds. now i  have to wipe all data from the tablet. all my work, I may be able to get the apps back but all the work I've put in will be gone.all t he set ups for over 30 apps will be lost, all my game, scores (this might seem petty) I bought this table because of the S pen, I am an artist and love the table for this one thing.. now i have lost all my art work..Before, I could have backed up my data and send it back to Samsung knowing my work was safe.. but they never sent me instruction to return the item. i fell like Samsung should take some responsibility for not helping me in the beginning, when I could have saved all my data. now my only recourse  to send this same tablet back and have it 'serviced.\" my only problem is,, I would not feel safe using the tablet for work every again, the soul purpose for the tablet.

Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle. It works but in my opinion, $500bucks wasted.New review:Received my refund and a brand new gorgeous grey tablet. Changed my review to reflect my new opinion. My bro has aniPad3 so wherever I mention it, I base it on my personal experience.1. I would have given this 5 stars if I got a perfect unit in the first place. Keep that in mind.2. The screen is excellent. The iPad3 is barely better. Side by side and careful scrutiny is the only way you would  know. Text is nice and crisp, HD movies look great. There has been much talk about ppi. These devices have more ppi  than most desktop monitors. So don't be bothered about IPS comparisons. The screen is fine.2.5. That said, Try the backlight bleed test from the Play Store and you will notice it does have noticeable bleeding.  Not as bad as the unit I returned, but still bleeding.3. The build quality is fine. No it doesn't feel \"cheap\" at all. I realize most Americans hate plastic. Metal is also  superior IMHO but there is nothing wrong with the plastic back. There is no creaking on this, nor was there any on  the unit I returned. Also some people said if you squeeze the back it would touch the board inside. Not true in my  experience. Bought the case from Poetic and well you can't tell what it's made of in a case...4. It is snappy. I will confess that it did slow down gradually with use. Faster once I got the last OTA update.5. The S-Pen is amazing. Handwriting recognition is >90% for me. My handwriting is fairly good though, so mileage may  vary. Bought the \"7Notes\" app and it is amazing. I also dabble in art (I'm no artist) and the S-Pen is great. I must  say, it does almost feel...comfortable, like the real thing.6. Skype is great but it is and always has been buggy for me. The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason. Skype crashes on any device I use at some point.7. The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo! I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a  good start.8. I dislike the proprietary dock. A standard port would have been appreciated for many reasons.9. The camera takes nice pictures. Screen shot function is also good.10. I dislike the screenshot shortcut on the menu bar. Since the last OTA, Power + VolUp also gives screenshot. I want  the option to remove that shortcut.11. Unit takes a long time to charge. Haven't timed it, but I guess maybe 3 hours.12. No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.13. I want Jelly Bean. I have been to xda forums and an UNofficial Jelly Bean update is available for the 3G version.  Dev is also quiet at the moment, they are also probably waiting on JB.With all that I have said here, this is my tablet of choice for a couple reasons:1. It is gorgeous2.

People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.

It seems that everytime a new tablet comes out like this, set at this price point, people ask \"is this the ipad killer\"? Well no, this one ISNT. Im not an apple fanboy, in fact, I dont own a single apple product, I do own a bunch of android devices though and I have to say from experience, this one isnt too hot. This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device. Its an android with a few modifications, such as the stylus input interface and the multi tasking ability. That is, you can have multiple apps running at the same time on screen but at this point, the number apps that are compatible is VERY limited.Second, the advert reads \"Exceptional Performance with Quad Core Processor\". Saying its \"Exceptional\" is a very strong statement. It performs at or near the same level as my Nexus 7. The ads also seems to boast note taking ability on ebooks, but I found that reading pdf still is still shaky as pages take a second or two to render.Third, the bad. As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy. The plastic is a joke. The tablet actually gives a little when hold it. The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual \"exceptional\" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back. That is how youre supposed to do it, it was hard plastic that didn't give or make noise when you held it.Unless you can get this in some kind of sale, for like $200, it is not worth it. I actually use my nexus 7 way more than this piece of garbage. If you want 10.1 tablet, wait for the Nexus 10. The nexus 7 is actually an exceptional device and at $200. it would nt surprise me if the N10 was around 300-350. Or get the amazon tablet. All of these awesome devices are coming out at actual competitive prices, who the heck can justify paying 550 for THIS?!", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap plastic", "Author": "ElliotR.R", "ReviewID": "R5BT95X7DXD0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a pretty descent tablet, I will say that. I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it. I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.The most significant is the quality of materials. Go online, and look at pictures or videos of the material up close and you will see that it looks soooo cheap. For a $500 tablet, this is inexcusable. The plastic actually bends and creaks when you press it down. I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works. But at $500, that is a slap in the face. I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution. It is horrible for this generation of tablets, specially from a flagship product from a company that manufactures the iPad screens. It not aweful screen but its not what you pay for at $500. trust me,DO NOT BUY THIS.*Extra info: I bought this device at a local ELECTRONICS store because I was on the fence about buying it. I wasnt satisfied after using it for a couple of days so I had to return it. Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine. But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res. If you bought and are saying those are somethings you can overlook or live with, more power to you. But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res? You cant tell me that the metal would have made it way heavier because I was upgrading from my asus transformer prime, which had an aluminum back and was super light. Also, if you never went a store, just saw the pictures online, you would think that it actually was made of some solid metal. The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be. Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap. And even if higher res screens are overrated, I dont see why a $500 device wouldnt have one.And all of this would be fine if it werent for the ridiculous price tag. My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better. I had a xoom first, then I upgraded to a transformer primer. But since I am a college student, I really wanted a stylus capable device. That is something this tablet does well, I will admit. My argument is that people shouldnt buy this because I believe that doing so would show Samsung they cant pull this kind of move. I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Different from what was ordered!", "Author": "Carlos G'omez", "ReviewID": "R3XAYL2NKJO4S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered \"SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 10.1 32GBs\", today friday 14-12-2012, I recived: \"SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 10.1 GT-P7510\" very different functions and applications that need... even the product has connection problems with samsung kies, which have been reported.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lame", "Author": "Allison Smith", "ReviewID": "R1KAYEHZQ814D8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All of these professional sounding, 5 star reviews are actually paid employees of Samsung trying to make the tablet ok better than it is.Android police, a website that specifically reviews android products, shined the light on what this product is really like.
