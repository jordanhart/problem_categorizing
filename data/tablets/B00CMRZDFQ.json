tablet under Amazon product description contain several errors, the main one being the number of cores in the processor of this tablet. I note the errors and corrections at the end of the review and I notified the seller.As a background for this review, I am a fairly heavy tablet user. We own three tablets: Nexus 7, Galaxy 7.7, and iPad Mini which we use for navigation, music streaming, game playing, reading, browsing, listening to internet radio and so forth. I received Pyle Astro Tablet from the manufacture for testing, evaluation and review. In my review I will compare my experiences with these tablets, especially the Android tablets, to Pyle Astro Tablet.Given the price difference between the tablets (the Pyle Astro Tablets is under $100 at the time I am writing this review) any comparison must start with a price. Pyle Astro Tablet is less than half of the cheapest tablet listed above. It is a real bargain. The question is what are the main practical differences between the Pyle Astro Tablet and the other three tablets I mentioned.\u2714 1. The display resolution (which is 800 x 480) and brightness. In practical terms it means that even though Pyle tablet has a larger physical screen it will fit less on the screen than a display with a higher resolution. Reduced brightness means it is harder to read in the bright sun. I found that the image on the screen looks washed out at more angles than my other tablets. However, if you hold the tablet at the right angle and not in the bright sun the screen is acceptable. This is the biggest difference, and given the price difference it is a reasonable compromise.I am attaching a collage of 2 photos, showing Pyle Astro tablet next to Galaxy 7.7 tablet (which has screen resolution 1280 x 800 pixels) so you can compare the display.\u2714 2. The processor of this tablet is not as powerful as the processors in my other tablets. It also comes with a relatively small amount memory (512MB). In practical terms it means it is a bit more sluggish than the tablets I compared it to. Doing the same operation on Pyle Astro Tablet and Galaxy 7.7 tablet (which runs the same version of the operating system) Pyle tablet took longer. To be specific, things take longer to display. For example, when I need to enter something the on-screen keyboard takes a bit longer to appear than with the other tablets. When I install something it takes a bit longer and so forth.\u2714 3. This tablet does not have a bluetooth capability. In my day-to-day usage of the tablets I use bluetooth quite a bit. I use bluetooth speaker when we use the tablet to navigate, for streaming music or audio books. I also use a bluetooth keyboard when I am doing a lot of typing on my tablet during travel. Whether missing bluetooth functionality is a deal breaker depends on whether you plan to use bluetooth devices.\u2714 4. The tablet is running Android 4.0.4 operating system. I tested many of the apps I use on my Galaxy 7.7 tablet and most of the worked with the exception of TuneIn Radio which gave me a message that it is not compatible with this device. Surprising! Pandora radio did work just fine. The error tells me that there is a potential that some apps will not work on this tablet even when they work with other tablets running Android 4.0.4.\u2714 5. I found the touch screen to be a little less responsive than my other tablets. Perhaps this could be explained by the slower processor rather than the screen itself. However, the responsiveness of the touch screen is something that you get used to and learn to use effectively relatively quickly.With the price tag of under $100 Pyle Astro tablet performed rather well for a budget tablet. Whether you are on a budget or want to get a tablet for youngster this tablet will do a serviceable job.================================================Technical specification errors as of 6/11/2013================================================I am an engineer so several mistakes in the technical spec jumped out at me and caused me to look for another version of the spec, which I found on the Pyle Audio web site. This second version of the spec appears to be accurate. I am including that version after noting the errors.1. Errors in the manufacture and processor description.Processor Brand: IntelProcessor: 1.2 GHz A-Series Quad-Core A8\u27a8 \u27a8 A8 is an ARM processor and Intel does not make ARM processors at the current time\u27a8 \u27a8 The processor in this tablet is unlikely to be a high end quad-core based on performance and price of this tablet.When I looked up the processor on the Pyle web site, the processor was descried as \"1.2GHz Cortex A8 Processor Chip\"not mentioning the number of cores, which typically implies one core.2. Hard Drive Rotational Speed 5400 RPM\u27a8 \u27a8 Tablets do not use hard drives that rotate, they use flash RAM3. Hard Drive 8 GB\u27a8 \u27a8 This device does not have a hard drive, it has is 8GB flash RAM storage capacityThe difference between hard drives and flash RAM is that hard drives are mechanical devices that rotate, flash RAM is solid state memory (no moving parts). This makes flash RAM shockproof, which makes it very useful for a mobile device which is being carried around.  If this tablet actually had a hard drive it would be bad news. But the spec from Pyle web site does not include a mention of the hard drive and refers to 8GB Storage Capacity instead.==========================================Here is the spec from the Pyle web

tablet.But wow.  The Astro can do so much more.  It is the same length, but slightly narrower, with a  similar size viewing area  (Astro: 7 \u00be\" x 4 3/8\"; Fire: 7 \u00bd\" x 4 \u00be\").  It has a micro SD slot (none in the Fire), and a front and rear-facing camera (only front-facing for the Fire).I can customize it so much more easily, starting with the desktop (reminds me of my Windows desktop) and the addition of some cool wallpaper.  The wallpapers included could be ordinary, or like the one I used, super-extraordinary.  It's 3-D: leaves falling on water with a reflection of the tree above.  The water ripples in response to our touch.  Amazing.Screen responsiveness is good.  Occasionally, it sticks or lags but not a problem enough to put a dent in my enjoyment.The rear camera casts a bit of a shadow from the case along the left side of the image.  Still, that's better than no rear camera (i.e., Kindle Fire).  The front camera suffers no obstructions.  Photos and videos come in clear.The first thing I did was load up all the apps I bought for my Kindle Fire from the Amazon App store.  Most of them work on this Android.  It's so nice that I don't have to buy them all over again.  I then went to Google Play to load up on more apps.  I like having two stores to choose from.All the apps work exactly as they should.  I don't have problems with the unit crashing.Of course, the Fire does score points in some areas.  Connecting to Wi-Fi on the Astro takes a little patience.  I solved that problem by setting the Astro to always be connected, even when sleeping.  That way, I don't have to wait for the Wi-Fi to turn on.The video is not as vibrant and is sometimes more pixilated than on the Fire.  Honestly, I only noticed the depth of color because I'm comparing them for a review.Sound is not as full and somewhat tinny on the Astro, but I don't use tablets for music.  It is plenty adequate for the browsing and games that I do.  With an earphone, the sound is much better.Battery life is very good.  I can play on it for hours at a time.  Considering Wi-Fi is always on, even when sleeping, I am impressed.  When compared to the Fire, I don't notice myself recharging any more often than usual.PROS:+ forward and rear-facing cameras+ micro SD slot+ Android OS, fully customizable+ comes with screen protector installed+ excellent value for the money (less than $100 as of this writing)+ screen is responsive, great performance (good for surfing, games, email, apps)+ smaller than the Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, but about the same viewing area+ good battery life+ Wi-Fi capableCONS:- sound is not full, a little tinny, much better with earphones- video not as rich as more expensive systems but I consider it more than good enough for most applications- couldn't test micro SD card (Astro said card was defective, but it works on PC)- micro SD card easily inserted wrong, easily falls out when inserted correctly.- rear-facing camera casts a shadow on the lens- lacks BluetoothYes, I own the Fire HD.  I love it.  Amazon is my friend.  If I wasn't such an Amazon devotee, I'd buy the Astro in a heartbeat.  It's an amazing value for the price, and in many ways, it beats the Fire.  I feel like a traitor saying that.I'd most definitely buy the Astro for my kids.  As a matter of fact, my kids use this and my original Kindle Fire to play Minecraft against (with?) each other.  The Astro doesn't come with parental controls installed, but there's an app for that.  I use Kapersky.  It's free.The kids say performance is exactly the same as the original Kindle Fire.  They are perfectly happy with the Astro.  I am, too.This product was provided for review by the Max Borges Agency.________________UPDATE 8/16/13: Per request, I installed CPU Info and got the following results (I really have no clue what most of it means):** ACPU freq: 1.2 GHz** Processor: ARMv7 Processor rev 2 (v71)** BoboMIPS: 1001.88** Features: swp half thumb fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3** CPU implementer: 0x41** CPU architecture: 7** CPU variant: 0x3** CPU part: 0xc08** CPU revision: 2** Hardware: sun5i** Revision: a13b________________________UPDATE 1/5/14:  I do not normally use a micro SD card, so the card falling out was not a problem for me.

I installed all my favorite apps on it that night. Unfortunately, I powered it down overnight, and when I turned it on, it told me that some of my critical apps didn't work, and the entire tablet crashed several times. Furious, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the apps, but to no avail.Finally, I got so frustrated, I performed a factory reset and only installed only a few apps, including the ones that didn't work before. After the factory reset, everything works like a charm. After a week of use, it has yet to malfunction on me, and the battery lasts for an incredible length of time.If you are initially frustrated by this tablet, try a factory reset. It completely solved my problems, you may have some similar luck.

I am relatively new to Android, and I might be wrong, but I think it is missing Bluetooth hardware. I am returning this to Amazon for a refund.  Very dissapointing as I paid for two day shipping only to find it was apparently misrepresented.Otherwise it seemed like a solid tablet and a good value for the money.

This doesn't sound bad for the price huh? Hmm 9 inch screen with resolution of 800 by 432 yeah weird but the viewing angles were fine on it thanks to the 160 dpi screen, now if only the tablet didn't overheat. Don't get ahead of me it's not only overheating but it freezes more often than any tablet I ever reviewed. I tried to watch Netflix think again, after about 10 minutes in to the movie the tablet seemed super hot and not a minute after that it froze up on me, I had to shut it down by holding the power button for like 5 seconds. I like the form of it, it's easily held with one hand but the fact of it is, It's a cheap tablet and by that you can assume that the build quality is horrible where you would be right because you can't even touch the back of that thing without creating smudges on the screen. It comes rooted it has No Bluetooth capabilities the cameras are both horrifyingly bad, I mean the worst I have seen. Skype was something else in a bad way, I could barely be made out or recognized the mic is bad.  Ok the reason I said where do I start is because everything on this darned thing was either bad or it barely worked. It can run games like angry birds but make sure that your kids wear something to avoid being burned. I will be fair and say that I may have been an unfortunate customer and received the lemon of the line but you find out for yourself.
