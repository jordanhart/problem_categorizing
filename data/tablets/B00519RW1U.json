{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A slightly better tablet than an iPad 2, but with a few drawbacks", "Author": "M. Patel", "ReviewID": "R8LRCF0N5RFSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I bought this for my wife as a birthday present during pre-release sales in NYC, I've since used it far more extensively than her so I've purchased a second Tab 10.1 from Amazon for myself.  As a background, I also have a good amount of experience using a Motorola Xoom (none with the other Android tablets though) and an iPad 2.  Anyway, here are my thoughts comparing the Tab 10.1 with the iPad 2.  I won't do a comparison with the Motorola Xoom (which, as of writing this review, is the Tab 10.1's major Android competitor) as the two products are really similar.  I'll leave the Xoom/Tab 10.1 decision to you.  Here are my thoughts:Operating System/Interface/Web Browsing - Slight edge to the Tab 10.1 running Android 3.1 (Honeycomb).  This may just be more of a personal preference as I don't like products (like the iPad 2) which are locked down.  I feel a company has no right to tell a consumer how he/she is allowed to use a product (as Apple does with theirs).  Anyway, Android 3.1 OS is blazing fast and going along with the Android Open Source Project's philosophy, the OS and by rote, the Tab 10.1, is ultimately configurable.  Out of the box, you can easily personalize an Android 3.1 tablet any way you want, and if you can't, there is free software out there to let you do it -- there is no hacking/jailbreaking required.  The Tab 10.1's interface is also a lot cleaner than the iPad 2's which can get downright cluttered the more apps you have installed.  I'll also note that there doesn't seem to be a discernible difference in the actual speed/performance (loading pages, etc) of the two products.  So, we're pretty even so far, but Tab 10.1 clearly gets the edge for one thing -- Flash.  Enough said.Battery life - Strong edge to iPad 2.  Both the Tab 10.1 and the iPad 2 are rated for 10 hours.  Keeping the screen at about 75% max brightness, I seem to get between about 7 to 8 hours on the Tab 10.1 and 9 to 10 hours on an iPad 2.  This may be a result of the screen brightness as I've noticed the Tab 10.1 has a slightly brighter screen at 100% than the iPad 2.  Regardless, the iPad 2 has better battery life.Resolution/Screen - Strong edge to the Tab 10.1's 1280\u00d7800 screen vs the iPad 2's 1024x768 one.  If you think this is negligible, you are very wrong.  This means the Galaxy Tab 10.1 screen has a 30% greater resolution than the iPad 2.  You'll notice this difference in every thing you do -- not just when watching movies and photos.  The increased resolution causes much less  eye strain especially when reading webpages.  Additionally, the Tab 10.1's widescreen aspect ratio seems to work a lot better for watching anything in HD.  It's a shame the iPad 2 uses the dying 4:3 aspect ratio as there is a lot of wasted real estate on the screen in the form of black bars when watching anything in widescreen.  With the Tab 10.1, the screen is entirely filled with video.Cameras - Strong edge to the Tab 10.1.  The Tab 10.1 blows the iPad 2 out of the water here and it's not even close.  The Tab has a front-facing 2.0 megapixel (vs iPad 2's 0.3 megapixel) camera and rear-facing 3.0 megapixel (vs iPad 2's 0.7 megapixel) camera.  Sure, you're never going to replace your P&S;/SLR/video camera with a tablet, but it is nice to have a camera on there that can take a decent picture/video when you're in a pinch.Portability - Even.  The Tab 10.1 is a negligible 0.03 lbs lighter and 0.2mm thinner than the iPad 2.Cachet - Strong edge to the iPad 2.  Apple has a monopoly on this, it seems.  Apple is just the trendier product.  Odds are nobody will look at a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and think \"Wow, that looks really nice.  I need to get me one of those.\"  I'm not saying the Tab 10.1 is ugly, but the brushed metal finish on the iPad does feel and look a bit nicer.Price - Even.  I'm really surprised Samsung didn't undercut the iPad 2 prices, even by $50.Is this the iPad 2 killer as has been reported here and there in the media?  Honestly, no, but that's more because most Apple consumers purchasing iPad 2s are brand loyal -- not necessarily looking to buy the best product.  I really wish I could rate the Tab 10.1 with 4.5 stars.  For reference, if I were to write a review of an iPad 2, I would give it a 4 stars.  Giving the Tab 10.1 5 stars seems a bit too generous as I feel the lack of an SD slot and slight plasticky feel are noticeable drawbacks, as is the price (which isn't lower than an iPad 2 with the same amount of memory).  And giving the Tab 10.1 4 stars seems a disservice as I feel that it is ultimately an outstanding tablet and, in my opinion, definitely has an edge over the iPad 2.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "A real business tool", "Author": "William Greenrose \"narcnh\"", "ReviewID": "RTNJ371X166RE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had my GT10.1 for a couple of days, and so far it has met or exceeded my expectations in just about every area.  I think I have finally found my laptop replacement.Look and Feel:  Very solid, no creaks or flex.  Grey plastic back really does look like brushed metal, feels good and does not feel cheap at all.  Dang, it's REALLY thin and light.Performance: Fast.  I have run pretty much all my apps on it and have run videos from YouTube without a hiccup.  Very responsive, very smooth.  The touch screen in not as sensitive as the one on my HTC Incredible 2 Droid phone , but it is still very sensitive (the one on my phone is almost too sensitive, if that's possible).Apps:  Here's the cool part.  Because my phone was already an Android device and I had a Google account, when I set up the GT10.1 it immediately and automatically synced, downloaded and installed almost all of the apps that are on my phone.  There were just a couple that did not download, probably because they are not compatible with Honeycomb (phone runs Froyo).  THAT was slick and saved me a lot of time and energy hunting for apps.  The ones that did not download, like the anti-virus and stock market apps, I easily found substitutes for in the Android Market.  Most games downloaded and seem to work without a hitch.Availability of Apps:  I have found PLENTY of apps in the Market that work on the GT10.1 - free, too.  I even have one (androidVNC) that syncs to my desktop computer, so I can control it remotely.  I had a similar program on my laptop and found it to be a lifesaver at times, when on the road.  Can edit MS Office docs - Word, Excel, PowerPoint - although all the features of the main programs are not there.  Also am using Google Docs, which has its own pluses and minuses.  Am debating whether or not to buy DocumentsToGo Full Version to gain more editability.  So far, I can get by with just viewing and tweaking.  In general I prefer not to do heavy document creation and editing on the road, even with a laptop, so we shall see.  K-9 is an excellent email client and provides more functionality than the basic one that comes with the device.Memory:  I bought the 32gig version, just to have plenty of memory down the road.  So far, I have only used a small fraction of it.  Honeycomb has a nice, small footprint, unlike some other OSs.  The entire inventory of office files I could ever need on the road will fit on a 32gig flash drive with over 10 gig to spare, so I am not worried about running out of memory.  Connectivity, you ask?  See below.Connectivity:  Much lamenting has been done about the lack of ports for the GT10.1.  Well, so far, I have not missed them.  It's very easy to move data via WiFi.  BUT, I know I will need access for things, like the above-mentioned flash drive.  And, while most anywhere I go to give presentations these days they ask for the file on a flash drive to put on their own computer/projector, it would be nice to be able to run a video cable out, if needed.  At first I thought this would be a deal breaker for me.  But, then I read that Samsung is coming out with adapters for their proprietary port.  So, I WILL be able to connect a flash drive or video out, when needed.  Would it be nice to have these ports on board?  Sure.  But, frankly, the device is pretty much self-contained and very accessible via WiFi/cloud, so, assuming the adapters come out, I think the lack of ports is a non-issue.  And, I am used to buying accessories for my devices as needed.  I also use my phone as a WiFi hotspot, to which the GT10.1 connects flawlessly, and the combination of Android phone and Android tablet is pretty killer.Keyboard:  On board virtual keyboard is fine, quite large, in fact, if you are used to using one on a phone, as I am.  I also downloaded Swype, which works fine on Honeycomb.  Finally, just for those times, when I might need to do some more significant typing, I bought a Menotek flexible Bluetooth keyboard (kind of like the one in 'Live Free or Die Hard' but wireless).  It synced immediately, and it works great.  And, the keyboard is almost ridiculously portable (it rolls up/folds up).  So, I just leave it in my briefcase and have it, when I need it.  Have a leather case on order that will allow the tablet to be propped up like a monitor, so the combination of portable keyboard and angled tablet should be a nice substitute for a laptop.Battery life:  Have unplugged the tablet at 0600, used it off and on all day, and it still had just under 20% juice, when I plugged it back in at 0100 - 19 hours later.  That was not continuous use, but more real world use - emails (a lot), read docs, downloads, a few YouTube videos, a few games.  Not bad.  It only reported about 80% charged this morning after 5 hours plugged into an outlet, but from experience with other devices, I expect both the battery life and the charging time to improve over the next week or so, as it cycles several times.  As you can imagine, using video-intensive programs, like some games or lots of videos, drains the battery fastest.  Even so, I'd say the battery life is pretty good and more than sufficient for a day's work (and probably play).So, in conclusion, I think I might have found my laptop replacement, a first for me.  I thought I was going to get a Xoom, then an ASUS Transformer, and then this one came along.  It is really a very powerful device, given its REALLY small footprint.  Is it an IPad killer?  Who cares?  I have handled IPads owned by business associates.  Nice device, but all they ever seem to use it for is to show photos and play songs, maybe blog.  Large cool factor.  I don't see it as a business tool.  I DO see the Galaxy Tab 10.1 as a true business tool.  The same goes for my Android phone.  So, depending on your needs, one or the other probably will be better for you.  As for me, I am really sold on the Android OS; it is fast, powerful and small.  There are some differences between my phone and tablet versions, but they are minor.  If the new version that is due out at the end of this year really merged them, but was not downloadable to my current devices, I would keep both of them, since the differences are so small.  That should tell you something.Hope someone, who is considering the Galaxy Tab 10.1 as a business tool, finds the above useful.  My recommendation is to go for it; I do not think you will be disappointed.  It is not perfect, but I think it executes beautifully on all of its advertised features and capabilities, and for that reason I give it 5 stars.Bill", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Good, It Has Flaws, and It Will Improve... if you can wait a bit.", "Author": "J. Lax \"FunnyFreakingCalls\"", "ReviewID": "RSI4KE8H8FBN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Who is this Review for?Anyone considering the Galaxy 10.1\" Tablet or not sure whether to go with iPad or this (or any other Android tablet).If you're very confused by all the entries to the Android Tablet category lately, I'm going to try and help. First things first, if you're definitely going with an Android tablet, FORGET ALL THE OTHERS, this is the ONE (see why below). That is, unless price is a big concern for you, in which case you probably really should not buy a Tablet to begin with, but if you still want one, go with the Asus Transformer. OK, on to the review of the Galaxy 10.1:The GoodIn time this will be better than iPad2. It's a beautiful device. Don't listen to those saying there is some discernible difference in the hardware quality or the \"wow\" factor between this and ipad2. There really is not. Except for one thing-- you really can feel the small weight difference. Galaxy 10.1 is slightly lighter than iPad 2, and if you pick up one right after the other, you will notice the difference. Don't get me wrong, both are absurdly light, but I love how light and portable the Galaxy is. Don't even THINK of getting another Android Tablet on the market as of this writing. This is light years ahead of them all even though there is no SD slot. It's much lighter than the Xoom (and all the others out now), almost to the point that I would put it in a different class of product. It's kind of like carrying around clipboard (of very sturdy quality). No strain. Whereas carrying around the other Android Tabs is kind of like carrying around a light textbook. If the difference doesn't matter to you...then don't pay the price difference for this Tab. Just get an Asus Transformer. The ability to have customizable widgets and apps (like weather on your home screen), to me, makes this device, and Android in general, more powerful than iPad. And, if you already have an Android phone, you really should stick with the Android Tabs, which will allow a much better integration for you. For one thing, you can tether some Android phones VERY easily to the tablet. If you have an iPhone, I'd stick to ipad and their cloud, which will really protect everything on all your devices. Hopefully this advice will help you folks who have one phone or the other and are on the fence over whether to buy iPad or this Tablet (or any other Android Tablet). The screen on this Tablet is just gorgeous. Response, over all is good but not as fluid as Ipad. For most functions (except for one VERY important one, described below) you will not notice a difference. I promise you. I saw a review on here which is, ahem, ranked higher than mine --ugh-- saying that ithe Phone's \"cachet\" is something to be considered. Utter nonsense. You will look great with this tablet and you'll enjoy using it and people will say WOW when they see it. This device has better specs than the iPad, is just as sleek, just as functional, has flash (something that I believe is somewhat overrated though as websites move away from flash), and will eventually --EVENTUALLY-- have a better app experience than iPad. Eventually. :-) Which leads me to \"The Bad\":The BadI saw a previous review saying that the keyboard responded slowly. After using it I can confirm that there really IS a delay between typing and text appearing on screen using SOME features like the browser. WHY? Is it honeycomb? Something that will be resolved with an update? Or is the hardware faulty and just that slow? I really hope it's the former, but I have no idea and I'm not going to buy one until I find out.UPDATE (6/28/11): Awesome job by Commentor Scott Welch who seems to have found a fix for this. Scott explains,\"I experienced the keyboard delay. It appears to be a problem with the Samsung Keyboard. I switched to the Android keyboard and it works GREAT!!! Setting> Language & Input> Current input Method.\" THANK YOU Scott.Another disappointing thing is that there isn't Swype on the tablet (note: I haven't seen Swype on ANY Android Tablet yet, though, and it's disappointing).UPDATE(6/28/11): Swype IS now available for the Honeycomb Tablets! Thanks to Commentors C.V. Tang  and Brian Mason. C.V. Tang explains that \"The Swype Beta are out for Honeycomb [see his comment below for the link, Amazon won't allow links in reviews]. Brian Mason added that \"Swype 3.0 beta is now available for Honeycomb. Very cool how you can set it to small keyboard mode for single finger swyping on either side.\"Great job, C.V. and Brian! Based on their comments, bump this review from 4 to 4.5 Stars. I've always felt that Swype is one thing that really separates Android from iPhone/iPad and shows the difference between the two systems in terms of power and customization, as Android market has so many variations of Swype that are just wonderful. Having Swype on a screen of this size is just amazing and really speeds up use and usability of the device immeasurably. It's really difficult to justify sticking with iPad's tap-tap-tap which is SO 2009.The AppsApps are what Tabs are all about, so it really should be it's own discussion in any helpful review. Yes, iPad still kicks Android's Butt in apps. Yes, this will change. Yes, I know you keep hearing this. No, I don't work for Android or any company related to any of these devices and am just as annoyed as you that Android is still not up to par! But it really is inevitable with the dramatic increase in Android use that the Tablet App market will explode in the same way the Android phone app market has exploded. My Droid X phone has become more and more enjoyable to use as the market continues to grow and provide me with apps I used to have on my iPhone. When i first bought my Droid, I didn't have Sonos or my Bank's app and many other apps that were an Iphone. Now, I can't even think of an App that I had on my iPhone that I don't have on my Droid. And, best of all, I have cool widgets on my phone home screen that I could never have on my Iphone. This will happen with the Android Tab, too. And when it does and the growing number of customizable apps arrive on the Android Tabs, I do believe these Tablets will destroy the iPad. But not yet...What should you buy?Fortunately, I really think the answer to this question is very simple. If you already have an Iphone or Android phone, don't even think about getting the other company's Tablet. It's a huge waste. There are big advantages with sticking with the same company (tethering for Android, the cloud for Apple, and, most significantly, the APPS FOR BOTH. Why pay twice for the same apps and why go through all the hassle?). The differences between the Apple and Android Tablets are not so monumental as to justify losing all these efficiencies of sticking with your phone's company. I would compare it to using three different companies for home Cable, home internet and home phone line.UPDATE (6/28/11): Thanks very much to Commentor K. Smits who further explained what I meant here: \"I think [the review] is referring to the upcoming iCloud service baked into iOS 5 from Apple. Basically it will over-the-air sync your photos, music, etc. among your iOS 5 devices. Look up \"iCloud\" in google to see more details. Also, if you purchased apps for your iPhone you will be able to use them on your iPad as well without having to purchase an Android version. Of course this goes both ways. If you have an Android phone and have purchased an App, you would be able to use it on a Android based tablet as well.\" Yep, exactly! Smits also added some helpful information, saying \"there are other solutions for keeping everything synced (Dropbox, Picasa for pics, Google Music Beta for music) If Flash is an important thing, I would rule out iPad. While I do think Flash is an archaic and not very well designed rich media solution for webpages, it is not going anywhere for a while, so I would make this a big consideration for a device that should give you a \"PC like\" browsing experience.\"If you have an Android Phone and are debating which Android Tablet to buy, STOP THINKING ABOUT IT NOW, and get the Galaxy which is far and away a monumentally superior product than all previous Android tablets. If price is not an issue for you (and this device isn't really any more expensive than similar Tabs except the much heavier Transformer), you will regret passing up on the sleekness, hardware superiority and overall better experience and portability of the Galaxy. If you can't afford the Galaxy and don't mind a heavier Tab, go with the Transformer. If you have an iPhone, I wouldn't consider this, and definitely not other Android Tablets. Stick with the iPad.Questions, CommentorsFeel free to post messages on here and I'll try to respond best I can. I'm not an expert, just some guy who played extensively with bunch of these things!UPDATE (6/28/11): Thanks so much to all the wonderful and helpful Commentors. You guys really make this review so much more helpful for people and it's great to have so many different perspectives. Keep sending helpful comments and I'll weave them in here as I continue to update my review. You guys have helped confirm that Swype is AVAILABLE, that there IS a fix to the keyboard issue, and have helped explain some common questions from users. I'll continue to update my review as information comes in. Right now, I have upped it to 4.5 Stars.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Android Tablet to Date. First True iPad 2 Contender on the Hardware Front.", "Author": "M. Kim \"gadget freak and man-toy expert\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3Q1WJXC2VSY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also own a Asus Transformer (luckily got it first night it was available on  Amazon), and an iPad 1. I've handled the iPad 2 extensively as well (work issues iPad 2's, I develop UI's for iOS).I'm not going to go too far into Honeycomb 3.1, as that experience merits it's own review, and has already been covered extensively.So I'll just jump straight into what makes the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 good/bad. In a word, s-e-x-y!The perception of Android Honeycomb hasn't been helped by the plethora of cheap no-name manufacturers tarnishing the Android brand with 150 dollar resistive touch screen devices loaded with Android 2.0. Even the bigger names, like Acer, Motorola, even Samsungs own Tab 7\", have been left in the dust with \"other\" company's superior materials, manufacturing and design. For the first time, I can confidently say that an Android tablet has not only matched the iPad 2, but potentially surpassed it (that's debatable).First off, the good:1. LIGHT. 10\" tablets, particularly at the 16:9 aspect ratio have always been unwieldy, especially in portrait. the 4:3 ratio of the iPad's 1024x768 has always translated to a more comfortable portrait experience. Well, the Tab 10.1 is so svelte and light, that even at 16:9 portrait, the top doesn't outweigh the ability for one hand to hold it from the bottom.2. Skinny. First time I held an iPad 2, it was about the only thing that really impressed me. It's skinny. Well, the Tab 10 matches it (technically it's like 1-2mm skinnier I think). It feels GREAT in the hand. It almost feels more like a heavy e-reader. Something this light should not be able to do what it can do. Amazing.3. Grippy back. Love love love the back material. I don't think it's the same as the Special Edition Google i/o, as that one looks glossy. This back is a matte black, and very pleasant to hold w/ 1 hand.4. Camera's are noticably better then the Asus Transformer, although still not stellar. Whether or not this is an issue depends on how much you rely on your camera on a tablet. Video calls through Google chat were acceptable, but definitely not Skype quality. Waiting patiently for Skype video on  Android.5. Screen is gorgeous. I believe it's PLS technology, which is technically superior to the much vaunted IPS on the iPads. Personally, they look about the same to me. The Samsung might have a slight edge in color saturation, but generally speaking, they're on par w/ each other.6. Stereo speakers work surprisingly well. Better quality then that on the Asus transformer, with less distortion at high volumes.The Bad:1. As stated, camera quality is sub-par in general, but in context of tablet cameras, it's probably one of the better ones (this isn't saying much).2. No SD CARD slot, this sucks. Hard. But I knew it when I bought it.3. Proprietary connector hole thingy. C'mon, really... how Apple of you.Another note. I read some disparaging comments about the plastic back construction vs aluminum or some other metal. I don't know if people are making that comment about the Google i/O version or what, but I absolutely love the plastic back. It's grippy, looks like the business, and overall, it just looks sexy. There's no noticable flex, and at first glance, you might even mistake it for a piece of brushed metal.It comes with a set of black earbuds/mic, kinda nice for VOIP calls, and a wall charger.Again, I'm not going into Honeycomb too much. 3.1 is great. If you want to read my thoughts on Honeycomb, look for my Asus Transformer review, should be in the top 3. As for the Transformer, granted this thing is 100 bucks more, but you can absolutely see the 100 dollars and where it went. The build quality  and design is leaps and bounds beyond the Transformer, but of course, the Asus.. well.. Transforms.. which is awesome in it's own right.I've had it for a day, and it's already replaced my Transformer and iPad. Not just as a new toy, but with it's skinny and light form factor, it feels almost invisible, like it doesn't get in the way when I'm not using it. Definitely my new primary tablet.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice screen graphics weight but...", "Author": "pseudoty", "ReviewID": "R2KTKVK8ADE463", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1 for three days now so here are some of my first impressions.Pros: Excellent display it realy gives you the wow factor for brightness and contrast out of the box.  Also the battery life is good as I would think playing games would drain the battery but I get a full days use without charging.  The weight and size are great very easy to hold in one hand in portrait or landscape mode. Multitasking works and does not slow down the device.  You tube Hd video and web browsing are fast with minimal buffering but you must first download flash 10.3 as it is not preinstalled.Cons:  very short charging cord so if you plan on using this while plugged in you will need a usb extender.  Device takes over 3 hours and still does not get a full charge it went from 40% to 75%.  After flash download some websites still do not play video like phillies and mlb and I can watch them on my droid incredible phone. This next one is a big one for me and Samsung says an update will be coming this summer, there is NO support for DMR (Digital management rights ) so currently you can not download  movies from any sites  I have tried amazon, Google, fios, blockbuster, and the biggest disappointment is Samsungs own media hub  it is not compatible with this device, strange since it came with a 25 dollar gift card to use.  This is not good for a cloud device so the only way i can think of to get movies on it is to hook it up to a pc and i think that will only work for uncopyright  protected files. When I look at all of the professional site reviews on you tube I, now realize that none of them showed real movies only clips in you tube.  I know that is part of being an early adopter  as well as only 72 tablet specific apps.I wrote this on the tablet and there is a delay between when you type and it displays on the screen frustrating to say the least,I am not trying to be negative as this is a nice looking device with great graphics and portability but for 600 dollars I would expect more in the performance area.  I am sure it will wow a lot of people when the hold it and look at it in the store but when you take it home to use it that will wear off fast.My biggest concern is that by the time they have all the bugs worked out and it is a supported Google device there will be tegra 3 chip tablet available for less.

I am a technophile and use a HTC Evo 4G with Sprint and in the past I have used an iPhone (and iPod).  Never had a tablet before.  Here are my early thoughts:The Good:1. Build qualityThe 10.1 Tab is fantastically built.  Although mostly made of plastic, it surprisingly exudes quality, with firm and high quality materials without any flex or creaking at all during use.  I was most concerned about the plastic back, but it is actually quite nice (I have the gray back version) and not cheap looking or feeling at all.  It's matte (brushed metal type texture) and gets no fingerprints on it.  There are ony two buttons, a power button and a voume rocker button.  Both feel good when you press them and are easy to press.2. ScreenIt looks great!  It's 1280x800 and has excellent vertical and horizontal viewing angles.  It's bright (I have it set to 50%) and colors are vibrant.3. PerformanceThe 10.1 performs very well.  Websites load up quickly, the screen auto-rotates promptly, and applications boot and operate fluidly and without any perceptible lag most of the time.  I have not been disappointed by any performance issues thus far.4. Battery LifeI haven't done any real battery tests but it seems to last a good amount of time.  I'm not sure if it'll last 10 hours with moderate usage (frequent internet browsing, music streaming from Pandora or Google Music, email checking, wifi on continuously, GPS not in use, etc.) but I feel fairly confident that it'll last a good 6 hours with moderate to heavy usage, and 8+ hours with lighter use.  For me, this is satisfactory and allows me to go a full day on a single charge.5. Android 3.1 (Honeycomb)Overall, I think Honeycomb is great.  It has great functionality versus the iPad 2 which is still basically a huge iPod touch with pages of icons and most of the functionality coming from the optimized apps.  With Honeycomb, you get ultimate integration if you are a Google user, with integration of your Google account (contacts, gmail, chrome settings/bookmarks, Google music beta, web albums, etc.). You get widgets (now resizeable), notifications, and many customization options.  It's not just Android on a phone in a larger device -- you get tabbed browsing, nice Honeycomb optimized Google apps (gmail, youtube, music beta, etc.).  And unlike the native android phone browser (2.2 on my Evo 4G), websites pretty much all display properly.6. FlashYes, Flash does work pretty well overall with the websites that I've used it on, and adds to the functionality of this device.The Omissions that Some May Care About, but I Don't:1. Lack of SD/microSD card slot or HDMI/micro-HDMI portsI personally don't care about these omissions because I find that with streaming music from internet radio (Pandora) and Google Music Beta, I don't need or care about having expandable storage like I thought I would.  The reason I got the 32GB is for putting videos/movies on for watching when on long plane trips or times when I don't have wifi access.  HDMI out I don't need or want since I can use wireless media streaming to watch any video/photos from my Tab.  It's mostly a marketing gimmick feature IMO.2. Lack of USB/micro-USB jackSince Honeycomb apparently supports USB hosting, it is a bit disappointing that there is no USB port.  But in reality, it does not make much difference because unless this tablet had a full size USB port (like the upcoming Toshiba tablet), you wouldn't be able to directly plug in many USB devices.  For this thin tablet, a full size USB jack is not realistic (it would be as thick as the tablet itself).  And for devices that accept a full size USB plug, you can just use the proprietary connector USB cable (cheap replicas available from China on ebay/online) just fine.  So using the USB adapter is mostly a cost issue.The Not So Good:1. Derth of Optimized AppsThis is really the main area in which Honeycomb lags behind the iPad.  There just aren't many optimized apps, even with big time apps like Facebook, where it's basically stretched out to fill the screen.  This will no doubt improve over time as it did with Android for phones.2. YouTube 'HD'Rather disappointingly, the 'HD' videos on YouTube that you can view on Honeycomb appear to be the same 'HD' quality as when viewed on an android phone, so while it looks great on my Evo 4G it looks distinctly non-HD when viewed full screen on the 10.1 screen.  I'm not sure what resolution the 'HD' videos are but it could definitely be improved to 720p when available.My score: 90/100Conclusions: The Galaxy Tab 10.1 is pretty fantastic and overall I think it's awesome, with great buiid quality, solid performance, and good  battery life.  Highly recommended.UPDATE (6/29/11):So, I've been using my 10.1 Tab heavily over the past 10 days or so since I bought it and I can say that it is still a great device and I love using it.  A few updated pros and cons:(+) Slingbox compatible - I bought a Slingbox Pro HD specifically to see if it would work on my Tab and yes, it does.  You have to buy the 30 dollar Slingbox Mobile app but it does perform quite well on the Tab.  It plays fullscreen, with SD-quality type resolution (definitely not sharp) that is acceptable to me.  All the functions of Slingbox Mobile work great on it too, although it is a bit tedious sometimes to navigate the on screen guide/menus.  Also, when you buy the $30 app you can also install it on any other android devices that you use with the same Slingbox account (it works great on my Evo 4G as well).(+) IP Camera view-able - I have a Paanasonic BL-C230A wireless wifi camera that I can view easily on the tab with a 5 dollar app I downloaded,  It's great for those who use these types of cameras for either security or as a baby cam.(-) Random/Odd quirks - Occasionally (maybe a few times an hour) the screen will rotate by itself even when the Tab is docked in the keyboard dock and then quickly return to the original orientation.  It's not a biggie, but is vaguely annoying when it does happen (mostly because you want to believe that the device would not do such a thing).(-) Headphone vs speaker audio output issue - I've occasionally had the problem where sound will come out of the speakers even after I've plugged in headphones.  A power off/on cycle will solve the issue, but it's annoying that it happens on a somewhat regular basis (almost everyday).(-) Keyboard docking issue - When docked in the Samsung keyboard dock, sometimes the screen will show a clock screen (in which the home button does not work and you have to use the back key to get to the home screen) and sometimes it will just show the home screen, as it should.  In any case, it's fine to have a clock screen show when you first dock the Tab but it should be possible to easily go to the home screen by pressing a button so that you can actually use it while in the keyboard dock and not have to keep hitting the back button to get the main screen.  Annoying, but perhaps more of a keyboard dock issue or Honeycomb than an issue with the Tab itself.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Galaxy Tab 10.1 is simply awesome", "Author": "Deckard67", "ReviewID": "R27ZDTALT8X2JH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a fantastic device.  I had much difficulty choosing between this device and the ASUS transformer.  I was sold on this device when I was able to hold it while at a brick and mortar electronics store.  It is lighter and thinner than any other device on the market.  I was able to take it and compare it directly to even an iPad 2.  It was even lighter than than the iPad 2.  The Galaxy Tab makes the Acer Iconia Tab seem huge and heavy.  IT even makes the Xoom seem a bit brickish.  Aesthetically, this is the best looking Android device on the market.  It rivals even the sleekness of the iPad 2 (which is the benchmark, I think).Hardware...The device specs are similar to the other 10.1 tablets.  Tegra 2.  10.1 inch screen.  The screen on this device is supposed to be a bit brighter than even the IPS screens of the iPad 2 and the Transformer.  It does look brighter and sharper as far as I can tell.  It only has the one 30 pin port and has no micro sd slot.  This is the devices's biggest drawback.  Samsung remedies some of these issues with several accessories that are coming.  They include HDMI and RCA adapters for connecting to an external monitor or TV.  A USB adapter, and an SD card adapter. When I saw that these things had already been considered, I was sold.  I personally don't see the need right now, for an HDMI out, but the fact that there will be one coming, is a nice thing to have.  And remember all of those extra ports, which would be nice, reduce the form factor...and believe me the form factor/aesthetics is what makes this device a cut above the others.Android/Software--Honeycomb 3.1 is a great OS for tablets.  This is where Android beats IOS.  The ability to customize home screens, add widgets etc, helps to make one's android tablet \"his or her own.\"  The native apps such as gmail, gtalk, calendar are all redesigned and optimized for the tablet and work great.  The tegra 2 processor runs all of it smoothly.  Scrolling between home screens is very smooth.  The best part of the OS is the true multi-tasking environment.  Switching between apps is easy.  There are some occasional glitches, but firmware updates will help this.  Honeycomb is still new and will only get better.  3rd party android apps are the other big drawback.  There simply are not that many out yet that are optimized for Honeycomb, but I have found that most, if not all of apps that run my galaxy s 4g smartphone run on the tab.One other thing to consider. I had trouble connecting the Galaxy Tab to my Windows 7 computer.  Tech support for this device is in South Carolina...at least during the day.  I was able to get right to someone who helped me resolve the issue.  FYI, the issue was not with the tab but rather the USB port on the front of my PC.  IT took some time to troubleshoot and resolve, but the quality of service and the ability to speak with someone without the language barriers was extremely helpful and convenient.UPDATE 7/6/2011I just returned from a 10 day road trip, having taken the tablet with me. There are a few things I would like to add.1)  Even though the specs do not say this, the tablet supports MP4 videos.  I converted several of my own DVD's and put them on the galaxy.  I also downloaded MOBO player from the Market.  It is a great device for watching movies.2)  After two weeks with the device, I can honestly say I love Honeycomb 3.1, but it is not perfect.  I still love the fact that I can customize the home screens.  I did notice that after being on a couple days that the OS does get a bit sluggish, so I restart my device every day or two.  It starts up and is ready to use so fast that this is almost a non issue.3)  My biggest complaints are entering text in the stock browser and flash in the stock browser.  There is significant delay that can be annoying. It does not render the device unusable, but it is a slight annoyance.  Flash is not flawless on this device.  Flash video playback is hit and miss, sometimes choppy, sometimes laggy.  I don't visit a whole lot of flash sites, and it is nice to have it, but this needs work.  (IOS still does not support flash at all).The device retains its 5 stars, because I feel the overall experience is excellent.  In the market when I got the device there were 96 featured tablet apps.  In two weeks this has grown to 108.  This is only going to get better.  When the market matures, look out iPad.I will post another update when TouchWiz is pushed to the device.  i own an Galaxy S 4G, and i really do like the touchwiz interface on it, so I will let yall know.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "before you buy this.

What a tablet should be.", "Author": "Mashuqur Rahman", "ReviewID": "R338E2O62M0X56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to Android. I've had an iPhone 3G, 3GS and now own an iPhone 4. Last year I bought my daughter an iPad. I was all set to buy the iPad 2 when it came out but two things derailed my plans. First, the wait list to buy the iPad 2, and, second, the low-res camera. When I played with the demo unit at the store, the bad camera on the iPad 2 really made me sour on it. Its not that the camera is critical on a tablet, but if you are going to add a capability to your product at least it should not be embarrassingly inadequate.About the same time, I read about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and so I decided to wait. I am glad I did. I bought the Galaxy Tab on Amazon the day it was released and have been using it for a week now. I absolutely love it.Hardware:By now this is old news, but its worth reiterating that this device feels great in your hands. Its light, well balanced and feels sturdy. Even though on paper it is a hair lighter than the iPad 2, in practice that minor weight difference matters when you hold both for an extended period of time. The Tab is meant to be held in landscape orientation unlike the iPad 2, and that makes for a better tablet experience. The two side speakers are good enough that I've had music playing in the background on the Tab while I do work on it. I have yet to use the supplied earbuds since I like the quality of the sound coming from the speakers enough that the buds have been unnecessary.I like that there is no big button on the bezel unlike the iPad. The softkeys on the lower left that appear when the Tab is on get the navigation job done cleanly and gives the front of the Tab a clean look. The notification bar on the lower right informs me of incoming email and important events - very useful.The Desktop:This is where I think the Tab and Android Honeycomb excel over the iPad 2 and iOS. While the purpose of the desktop on an iPad is to just launch applications by clicking on the icons, the desktop on the Tab is designed to be much more functional and interactive. I absolutely love the widgets that I can place on the Tab's desktop. I have a desktop set up with widgets for my work email, my calendar, the weather, CNN headlines, NY Times headlines and a widget that shows me how long it will take me to drive to work in the morning (and back home in the evening). I start my day by turning on the Tab and at a glance I have information I need to start my day. I have similar screens set up with a Pandora widget, Amazon Cloud music player, Facebook, Twitter, Catch notes and my grocery list that I share with my significant other. To me, the widgets allow me to interact with the Tab and actually use it as a platform to help organize my life. This is the big differentiator between Android Honeycomb and iPad's iOS - and the main reason I am glad I got the Galaxy Tab 10.1.Oh, and one more thing. I love the Live Wallpapers. I downloaded and installed the Aquarium Live Wallpaper from the Android Market. Now I have a configurable animated aquarium as the background on my Tab with fish, turtles and jelly fish swimming around behind my desktop icons and widgets. Totally useless but also totally fun and a great way to personalize the Tab.The Apps:Everyone knows there are not a ton of apps for Android Honeycomb yet. But there are enough to make you productive. The two apps I wish I had are Netflix and the NY Times Crosswords (though both apparently are coming out in July 2011). Other than those two apps, I have pretty much everything I need. The one's I use the most are:The built-in web browser: works well, clean interface, easy to use, and fast. Of course it synchronizes your bookmarks.Amazon Cloud Player: I am loving streaming music from the Amazon Cloud. I've uploaded my existing music from my iTunes library and am now buying all my music from Amazon (bought music is automatically stored in the Cloud for no additional cost). I am done with iTunes. I've downloaded no music to the Tab, though I can if I need to. This frees up a ton of space of my 32GB that would otherwise be taken up by my music library. The Amazon Cloud player lets me play my music on my Tab, my Macbook Pro, and my PC laptop. Pretty neat and a must have.Pandora: great on the TabExchange email, Yahoo email and GMail: The email client is very well done and easy to use. GMail on the Tab is exceptional.SharePlus: a full featured Tablet optimized Sharepoint client that lets me access my work Sharepoint site.News360: best news aggregator I've seen. It has a unique \"360 View\" feature that lets you view the news through photos that scroll past your tablet screen. It looks great on the Tab and is fun to use.Pulse: another news aggregator that works very well on the Tab.CNN, USA Today and NYT: all optimized for the Tab, all with widgets. The CNN app is especially nice.Kindle: love my Kindle and the tablet app also works great.Google Talk: video chatting works really well with anyone else on Google Talk on another tablet or PC.Youtube: the Youtube app is fun to use. I really like the 3D scrollable interface.Opentable, Yelp and Flixter: dinner and movies, of course!Plume: gorgeous Twitter app with a desktop widget that keeps you up to date and helps you tweet what you are eating for lunch, etc.Facebook: so-so app (as bad as the one on the iPhone) but it does have a desktop widget that redeems it.GroceryIQ: very nice interface on the Tab. Helps keep my groceries and shopping lists in order and lets me share my list so I can send someone else to the store.Catch: this is a app that lets you take notes and keep the notes synchronized across devices. The tablet app looks and works great. I use it between my Tab, iPhone and laptop to keep my notes jotted down and organized. This is a must have little app.Angry Birds, Plants vs. Zombies, Pinball HD: must haves to waste away your free time.Bottom line: Light, easy to hold, it will replace your laptop for most uses. The widgets really make the tablet come alive and worthwhile. The Tab's desktop makes the iPad 2 desktop look dated.

Apps (yes, a little sparse but getting MUCH better in the month I have had the tab) are of equal quality and I don't find  myself spending at the app store (android market or whatever) like with the ipad.  Email setup is seamless, MSoffice products behave like they should, attachments or downloads are no problem (they open like they should) and for me, the entire tab experience has been spectacular.

I wish that the video options (Netflix, Hulu, etc) were better developed at this point, but that will come.  Hardware on tab is excellent.

I have the ipad 2 and the Samsung Galaxy 10.1. I wanted to have access to both app stores. Mainly I just like gadgets. I have tried the Acer Iconia, the Xoom and the Asus Transformer, as well before deciding on the Samsung. I would have purchased the 7 inch Samsung Galaxy, but the service plans at Verizon were not worth it. So how is the Galaxy 10.1? Pretty impressive. I would give it a 4.5, but rounded up for benefit of the doubt.Pros:- Look and feel is fantastic.- Weight is lighter than the ipad 2; I think it is substantially noticeable. This is likely due to the plastic material. I was worried about that at first, but not anymore (I chose the dark gray back, I think it looks great).- Resolution looks terrific.- Buttons are sparse but build quality is well done. I tend to judge build quality by how the buttons and such function (I was not a fan of the tiny Xoom AC pin, nor the Acer lock screen button. The Transformer felt really cheap due to the bendable plastic back. Too picky? Perhaps)Cons:- No HDMI, micro USB etc. I know they will have a dongle, but I haven't found one yet.- Lack of accessories so far.Comments:- It's probably just Honeycomb 3.1 but the choices are very sparse for lock screen wallpaper. The default is the blue broken street looking thing. I wanted to use that for the lock screen but it disappeared after I changed the main background. Very weird.- The box did not indicate what color the Samsung would be (unless it's near the SKU code). We had to open the box to see if it was white or the dark gray.- Is there a default movie player?Overall, the Tablet feels great. As I stated I already own the ipad2 and love it.

What changed my mind was finally having a tablet available without all the restrictions that the Apple IPad2 has.The Galaxy Tab 10.1 has become my favorite tech device very quickly..  I love all of it's features, it's ability to be customized, the screen display is VERY CLEAR and brilliant and it has High Definition resolution of 1280X800, IPad2 does not..  It has 2 stereo speakers unlike the single mono speaker of the IPad2,, it's the prefect size and very light-weight for me to easily carry through out the house, and it is also an excellent BOOK READER.. And un-like IPad2 and IPods, my Galaxy Tab 10.1 has ADOBE FLASH, so I'm Not restricted on the web..The lack of ADOBE FLASH was a major deal breaker for me when considering an Ipad2.. Making a device that's used on the internet but NOT having ADOBE FLASH, is like building a Car with NO RADIO, and then trying to tell the customers why they DON'T need a Radio.. It's crazy!!!The IPad2 \"NO ADOBE FLASH\" issue is all tied to one man, Steve Jobs, and not tied to what customers want and need.. Thousands of websites should not all have to cater to ONE man who refused to put FLASH in their devices.With my Galaxy Tab 10.1, I also love Not having to be tethered to my PC for everything, un-like with Apple products and their ITunes platform necessity; always having to connect to the PC and having to \"convert\" music and video files to a different format just so they'll play on Apple products. Too much hassle!!The Galaxy Tab has cut down the use of my laptop by 90%.. I'm able to check and respond to my e-mails, pay bills, watch Netflix movies, check and respond to comments on my YouTube channel, shop on Amazon.com, read and listen to books, and much, much more, all from my Galaxy Tab.. So, I am a VERY happy camper!!!:-)Another big plus is the Galaxy Tab also has 5.0 Wifi frequency, not only 2.4 Wifi frequency.. The 5.0 frequency has more available channels making it a \"less crowded\" connection , so it has less interference for a more reliable WiFi connection..

IPad only has a 1024x768 resolution that is not HD and with only 132 pixels per inch (ppi)Galaxy Tab has twice the Ram as an IPad2 @ 1 Ghz RamVS.. IPad has only 512 MB's of RamGalaxy Tab has Dual Band Wi-Fi with 2.4Ghz and 5GHz frequencyVS.. IPad2 has only 2.4 Ghz Wifi.Galaxy Tab has 2 Meg and 3 Megapixel Cameras with an LED camera FlashVS..

This cannot be done with IPad2Galaxy Tab lets you have several application open at the same time ( Multi-Task )VS.. Cannot multi-task with IPad.. Only 1 app at a time!And let's not forget ADOBE FLASH on the Galaxy Tab 10.1VS..

After reading reviews in every corner of the internets, I had it narrowed down to the tab 10.1, the Toshiba Thrive, and the ipad 2. I have been an Android phone user for a year now (EVO), but both my computers are bleeding edge Macs.My top reasons for getting a tablet were 1) going mostly electronic for research, so...pdf effective markup is key and 2) not wanting to lug my Macbook Pro with me evey time I leave the house and want a computer along for the ride. I wanted to be able to read for work and fun, play games, watch movies and TV, and check email and occaisionally do some writing. I visited and played with all three of my top tablet finalists at my local Best Buy, read tons of formal and informal reviews, and talked to my friends who have ipads (none have android tabs).First impressions (Will update when I have had it longer)The Good: Overall, this thing is so much better than I expected it would be, even after pretty much knowing exactly what I was getting myself into. The screen is awesome, very bright and pretty to look at. The sound is really good, both through two speakers on sides and included headphones. Playing the simple games I like to play is terrific, much better than on the EVO. The EZpdf reader app I purchashed for marking up pdfs for research is AMAZINGLY AWESOME. Being able to sync with App Brain and pull all my apps to the tab was super easy and convenient. And it comes with Quick Office pre-installed, so you save a few more bucks over ipad the since you don't have to buy Pages to edit docs. I also pulled my music from Amazon Cloud, so that was a breeze.The Not as Good: Typing on the screen definitely is not quite as rsponsive as it seemed to me in the store. I make more errors than I expected due to te letters not registerin, as you cansee fom the errors I chose not corect in this sentence. I have ordered the keyboard doc to use for longer note taking in future, and I am sure that my on screen typing wil improve as I learn how to work with/adapt to the keyboard a bit better. The built in sensor for screen brightness is also a weakness for me at this point since it doesn't seem to always get it right (screen dims at times when it would be easier to see it better lit).All in all, as a person with a familiarity and appreciation for Android OS, I am thrilled with my choice to get the 10.1. It is super sleek and light (unlike Thrive, which I ultimately decided was not going to be comfortable to hold for long periods of time, and what's the point of a tablet if you can't do that comfortably). It is beautiful inside and out. It is cheaper to fill with apps you know and love and have already paid for if you have an Android phone. Oh, and if you install a remote desktop app, you can get Netflix on it now, though it seems like an official app is in the works.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very solid tablet - great option on the market", "Author": "rvajeff", "ReviewID": "R2U7WSWXPBVOG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned both the iPad and iPad2, and now this one. After owning all 3, I have to say that I just really like Android more than iOS. I like the fact that I can look through the file structure and place shortcuts easily on the desktop. There are workarounds for this on iPad, but to me it's just more user friendly on Android. I love the fact that I can use news and calendar and clock widgets, for example, and customize the setup to my tastes, which is just more restrictive on the iPad. The gmail app is fantastic, web browsing looks great and it's an all around good solid product. Honeycomb works great and looks great, and this tab is a lot of fun to use.From a hardware perspective, there aren't a ton of differences between this and iPad. However there are some important ones, biggest in my opinion being the widescreen format versus iPad's 4:3, and the fact that the Samsung can play full HD videos. To me, that is a great win for this product as I have several HD videos for my business, and they look great on here. It's light and slim, and easy to grip (in my opinion, easier to grip the back than the smooth metal of iPad.)However, there is a lack of tablet-based applications available at this time. Apple has them beat on quantity and quality of tablet apps. This is the only downside and at least it seems that Google is working on it, so I imagine the market will grow rapidly. Soon we will be able to download movies and rent them in the market, but until then it gets a slightly lower review on my end.Overall it's a lot of fun to play with and great competition to Apple.",

I had the ipad 1 but didn't like how heavy it was and the fact that I had big holes surfing the web.  The ipad 2 is much better but still lacks the full internet experience.  If you intend on holding your tablet in your hands, want a big screen and the internet is your favorite \"app\" then I would highly consider the Galaxy 10.1.  Samsung is also coming out with the Galaxy 8.9 (Sept.22, 2011)which will be even lighter.  However if you play games, use a lot of Apple apps and use iTunes then you should probably stick with the ipad2.  If you intend on using your tablet with a stand and don't mind a little heavier player and don't want to pay the high price of the ipad2 and Galaxy tablets then you have more options.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best tablet available in market with some scope for improvement", "Author": "TechGuru", "ReviewID": "R2AQBR26GWNRTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best tablet available in market with some scope for improvementPros : Fast, Very good battery performance, flash support, very slim and lightweight, supports google video chat, widescreen aspect ratio, very good steriospeakers,best OS for tablets 3.1 (honeycomb)Cons : fewer apps available compared to ipad, doesn't load desktop version of sites by default, no skype, netflix, cablevision tv apps available, pricey,no storage card slot, no usb slotUpdate - You can switch the user agent to desktop for browser in debug mode. The desktop version sites would load by default.This is my first purchase of a tablet and it has exceeded most of my expectations. It's beautiful, blazing fast, slick and display is amazing.You can't really compare this with ipad as android is the best operating system for mobile devices, very powerful, highly customizable.Applications and web pages load very fast. Have not encountered any crashes so far. It seems to work faster than my 3Gz desktop and core i5 lenova.Can connect to phone data network (using the android froyo's mobile AP feature) and got 3-4 mbps connection. It is perfect for browsing in car and outdoor use.No need to get expensive 3g/4g version along with expensive data plan.Battery performance is unbelievable. Never had to use it continuously for 8-10 hours, however doesn't seem to discharge fast even while watching video.Battery never discharged fully even after hours of heavy use.Flash support is the highlight. Flash didn't work out of the box but installed flash 10.3 and then flash content would load and play smoothly exactly same as on desktop.Though marginally thinner than ipad2 it it does feel considerably thinner and slick while handling. The grip is very good while holding in hand, canbe easily hold in one hand while interacting using other. Edges are smooth and build quality does not look any way inferior to ipad2.Google video chat was amazing. Could take out of the house (within wifi range) and video chat worked perfectly. Can even switch from front to back camera.Did take good quality pictures though can not be compared to a regular good quality camera. Smile shot, panorama, action shot, geo-tagging seems to be handy features.Widescreen aspect ration is a must for watching videos. Don't understand why ipad2 is still stuck with old 3x4 ratio.Speakers work perfectly, crisp and loud enough for listening to music. Speakers are located on left and right side, doesn't come under fingers while holding and clearlyoutputs the stereophonic sounds.The honeycomb operating system is the best in already superior android OS series. Very powerful, fast, stable, customizable. Android is the best operating systemfor touch enabled devices. No comparison to Apple's iOS. iOS looks like a OS for dummies when compared to Android.Nothing is perfect. There are few areas improvement -Considerable less number of tablet version apps are there in market. Most missed ones are skype, netflix, cablevision tv which are available for ipad.Surprisingly the browser loads mobile version of sites. It is understandable on mobile phones however tablet should load the desktop versions by defaultsince it's tablet computer and not a mobile phone device. Some sites do not have links to their desktop version and you are stuck browsing mobile versions on the tab.Hopefully Google corrects this in near future.Update - You can switch the user agent to desktop for browser in debug mode. The desktop version sites would load by default.No SD card slot for storage expansion and no usb slot. That's a big minus. The adapter currently available from samsung is expensive.Being new to market not many accessories are available. Hopefully they will available in near future.Price though competitive with iPad, motorola zoom very high compared to other tablets in market which are sold as low as $150.So overall it's an amazing tablet which will replace your desktop/laptop with few shortcomings and undoubtably the best amongst those available in market.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it but the charge cord could be tougher.", "Author": "Dottodot", "ReviewID": "R1REZQRX5ZPQ9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only had my Galaxy Tab for a week and the charging plug got the littlest kink, not visible without a magnifying glass, in it so it no long works.

So I sold my iCant...Enough complaining about my iPad, the Xoom was great as well, but I wanted to share Movies and already Had some I got from my Droid Charge. So the Zoom got auctioned and I got the Galaxy Tab. I noticed there was no Facebook App, why... cause the website works perfect right from the browser. Picture uploads, messaging... yeah there's an app for that, its called the Browser!Runs snappy. Lighter than any 10\" Tab on market including the iPad2.Battery is better than my Xoom, slightly worse than my iPad.Screen is Vibrant and great for Movies. Easier to transfer movies if you download \"Kies\" for your laptop.Speaking of Laptop, I cannot believe that using an iPad requires you to hook up to a Computer 1st! That is just stupid. Both my android Tabs were surfing the Net right out of the Box, no Laptop necessary.Also, updates come Over The Air (OTA). Updates happen pretty quickly as well. Updating my iPad required plugging into my Laptop... again... The download took forever, the Backup took forever, the install took forever.Now all that said, the iPad still has a place. It is much better for younger people and the less Tech Saavy. The interface is dummed down (just icons)...

They can be described as oily looking marks between the Glass and Actual LCD display. It is similar to pressing down on a calculator display. This is a common issue. What happens is that some internal part warps (not quite sure which part) from the heat, and causes the LCD to touch the glass.

You can customize this tablet with ease, even resize the widgets if you like!

I even had my co-worker bring in his Ipad for a comparison, he was actually kind of upset that another tablet on the market was as good, if not better, than his Ipad! My only complaint right now is the lack of accessories and of course the lack of ports. Like the Ipad you have a dongle cable that you have to use to attach other cables onto. I will give the Ipad a one up on accessories, this just doesnt really offer that much but not a big deal, I am sure they will come in time.

My wife and I use a Windows 7 PC, Ubuntu Linux 11.04, Sprint HTC EVO 4G Android phones, and we also own an Ipod. As you can see, we are fans of great products no matter where they come from. That being said, my wife is in the market for a tablet. She is not a power user, she is not interested in workarounds, she just wants a tablet to perform all of the things she is interested in: Browsing the web, organizing and viewing pictures, watching movies and tv shows, youtube, facebook, Amazon Kindle & Barnes and Nobles Nook reader, purchasing music, and to have the ability to create and edit word documents.Lastly, I told her to compare the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and the IPad 2 (which were the two devices she was debating between) and form her OWN opinion as opposed to learning what is best for a particular critic/editor.. and to come up with her OWN pros and cons as opposed to listening to every other review website's pros and cons which may or may not be relevant to her needs. And if you are reading this, I urge you to come up with your own list of wants, features, pros, and cons - and before you listen to what anyone else has to say PICK UP THE TABLET AND PLAY WITH IT. If you, like many others are comparing the IPad2 to the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - bring BOTH devices home if you can.. my wife noticed a HUGE difference in her usage between using both tablets at home versus playing with both tablets in BestBuy for 30 minutes.Many others will tell you, \"Get the IPad.. Android sucks because of \" 100 random reasons. But most of these people have not used these devices extensively and NONE of these people are YOU. I was fine with my wife picking up either tablet, because in the end.. they are both great products. However, after trying both tablets in our home for a few days.. it was a hands down decision - Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.I know many will have an argument to each and every comment I make, so I will start off with saying \"this is MY opinion after having a hands-on experience with the Ipad 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1\"Here is the list of items that my wife found important and what she wanted out of the tablet/$600 we are spending.Browsing: the browsing experience in the Galaxy Tab trumps the Ipad 2. Google Chrome, Firefox, and Flash support compared to Safari proved to be a better browsing experience for us. At first, she wasn't concerned that the IPad2 didn't have any Flash support.. it didn't seem like a big deal at all.. BUT she likes looking at Korean videos on some random website.. and the videos are in Flash. I used to be in the Army and every so often we had to complete an Accident Avoidance course online.. which is in Flash. Also, my wife is a 48 Hours mystery nut.. their videos are in FLASH.. so in the store, we didn't even think to check out these sites.. but when we were at home and my wife was using both tablets as she would normally, without even thinking about it she encountered so many instances where Flash now became incredibly important to her. She doesn't even play any Flash games or games period for that matter.. but if you do, then take this into consideration - the IPad2 does not support Flash.And speaking of games (which was something not on my wife's list) - the Galaxy tab has NVIDIA's Tegra 2 chipset.. and it is AMAZING.. they have a free Tablet app - just search for \"Tegra\" or \"TegraZone\" which showcases many of their games.. if you play games, you WILL download some of these games.. they look absolutely stunning, especially since they are all designed for the Tablet and optimized for the Tegra 2 in the Galaxy Tab 10.1.Pictures: Of the pics we took with the IPad2, the images were grainy and looked pretty cruddy compared to the pictures we took with the Galaxy Tab. However, I informed my wife that we happen to have a 10 megapixel CAMERA as well as 2 phones that have 8.0 megapixel cameras built-in with a double flash. So, basically the likelihood of her taking pics with the tablet was pretty slim.Market/App Store: The absence of Itunes on the Galaxy tab was sort of a let down 'initially'. It was really the 'thought' of them not having a one-stop shop which seemed dreadful to my wife. But Google now has movies in their market.. Amazon is probably just as big as iTunes when it comes to music. And there are some really cool FREE apps in the Android Tablet market that allow you to get your podcasts on if you so choose. And of course, you can always use a free app called doubleTwist in order to sync your iTunes stuff onto the Android.. for $5 for the premium version, you can sync it wirelessly. Lastly, after performing a few internet searches such as \"top Android tablet apps\" etc, lo and behold my wife downloaded dozens of amazing, FREE tablet apps that are now going to take over her life.. that being said, the 65,000+ iPad2 tablet app claim is a non-issue if you are not going to be using ALL 65K apps. And in my wife's case, she ended up only downloading around 20 apps that she was interested in and were free in the IPad market. And she downloaded around 50 in the Android market that she was interested in and were free.. The sheer number screams more choices, but there are definitely apps in the Android tablet market that do not exist in the iPad2 market (and vice versa).. and during our searches, my wife found more useful FREE apps in the Android market. Nonetheless, think about what apps YOU will want to use and see which market has the one you want. period. Don't base your idea of what the market has to offer based on my wife's experience, on a critic's experience, etc.. base it on what YOU will want.. because you're the one whose going to be using the tablet, afterall, and the APPS will more than likely take up 50% to possibly 90% of your usage. So beware!Also, I will mention that some of the reviews that leaned towards the IPad put out some misinformation.. such as one editor stating that apps made for the Android phone look cruddy on the Android tablet and the IPad2 has the \"zoom\" feature which sizes the app to the IPad2's screen.. well, this true and Google is rolling out Android 3.2 as I type this which includes this same feature.. but the misinformation part is this - apps made for the iPhone look absolutely abysmal and pixelated on the IPad! And of course, as the reviewer stated the same goes for Android - apps made for the Android phone look absolutely abysmal on the Android tablet.. he just failed to mention the shortcoming of the IPad as well.. and even when Google rolls out 3.2 to the Galaxy Tab, I am certain the apps will STILL look awful.. on BOTH devices. So, in other words, just see for yourself and don't trust the misgivings of some of these professional \"possibly paid off\" reviews. Do yourself a favor and stick to Tablet apps ONLY. Another thing, no review ever mentioned that the IPad2 cannot charge via USB on a PC?!? My wife and I found this out only after taking it home.. it may be a non-issue for you if you are going to charge it in the wall or dock anyways, which is 'better' of course.. but still, I thought I'd make mention of it because no one else does..Youtube: Night and day between the Galaxy tab and Ipad 2, with the Galaxy tab being the better choice. Videos were better looking and sharper, and it streamed perfectly.. whereas the Ipad kept buffering every so many seconds on the same video, with the same exact internet connection and the images were \"clean\" but there was still a nicer appeal to the Galaxy tab. Also, the user interface itself was a much better experience on the Tab than the Ipad 2. You'll just have to pick both devices up to see for yourself.. then again, this was something we noticed and it was important to my wife.. whereas it may not be that important or make a difference to you.Facebook: There is NO official app for facebook on Android tablets and no news of one coming. Why? I have no idea, but to our surprise there was NO official facebook app on the iPad2 either.. although there is supposed to be an official one in the coming weeks. Aside from that, here were third-party ones called Friend ME and FriendCaster which both seemed to be just as good as the real deal. Also, if you have been following the news.. Google+ (the soon to be competitor to Facebook) is on the horizon.. you may or may not end up being a user. Only time will tell.Kindle and Barnes&Noble;: They work great on both devices.. they look great on both devices.Music: Itunes again.. I have to hand it to Apple, they have a really nice looking iStore with many options. However, with the Galaxy Tab you have the option of acquiring your music from any source you so choose. There are many cloud-type apps such as DropBox that will allow you to simply drag and drop any files on your PC to the dropbox on your PC and they instantly become available to ALL of your devices, to include the Galaxy Tab of course.. its really a matter of preference here.Documents: My wife is working on her Masters, she primarily uses our laptop to do her work, although she is interested in using the tablet for this on occasion as well. Both tablets have keyboards, keyboard carriers, etc made specifically for them.. as well as a slew of third-party accessories that can work for both devices, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Ipad 2. However, Quick Office ships FREE on the Galaxy Tab, whereas you will have to pay $15 or $20 for it on the IPad2 market depending on which version you want. After $600.. another $15 or $20 adds more money of course, but in the long run.. didn't make a big difference to us. There are also several other office programs that are available in both tablet markets. We ended up purchasing the Logitech keyboard for Android 3.0+.. and it is NICE. Whether you go with an Android tablet or even the IPad2 - GET THE LOGITECH KEYBOARD!! They make one specifically for IPad as well.Lastly, I won't mention the superior Google maps on the galaxy tab because we purchased the Wi-fi version and won't be doing much traveling with the tablet. But I will mention that the user interface for the Android (all customization, notifications, superior e-mail, and widgets aside) was much more appealing than the Ipad 2. On top of that, you can setup the Android to be as simple as the Ipad2.. but you CANNOT setup an Ipad 2 to be as customizable as the Android tablet. My wife preferred a simple setup regardless of whether it was the Galaxy tab or Ipad 2. She downloaded this live wallpaper on the Galaxy Tab of a cute, lively Panda bear.. and although it is not as fancy as some of the other live wallpapers (such as a fishtank, or floating galaxy) she is in LOVE with her Panda.. that's all I'll say about the customization because it may be a non-issue for some on the fence. But for others, you may fool yourself into thinking you don't care about the customization like my wife did.. but only after holding your new device/toy in your hands and having the ability to make it unique, make it your own (like my wife did).. there's a really cool feeling that comes with it.Anyways, my wife ended up \"favoring\" the Galaxy tab because she was simply disgusted with the Ipad2's poor camera, even though I mentioned she might not be making use of it very often. But, after taking both devices home and playing with them, she was overly enthralled by the Galaxy Tab and quickly set the IPad2 down. It has a lot more to do with functionality versus just looking at some pretty new toy as some would have you believe. Again, before you jump on the Android OR IPad bandwagon.. I urge you to not listen to ANYONE's advice except for your own and try the tablets out for yourself in the comfort of your own home OR whatever place you will be using the tablet the most. It is a $600+ decision after all.. Even if you will order from Amazon to save a bit of money, still go to BestBuy or whatever store you have available to you.. make a list of what you want to do on the tablet beforehand.. and try these tablets out.. honestly, it is a MUCH better scenario to try them in your home because the store will likely not allow you to download apps from either market.. and some of the stores don't even have these device setup for you to 'really' play around with them. Plus you don't get to experience the initial \"unboxing\" and setting up your new tablet in the stores. In either case, my vote is for everyone to pickup a Galaxy Tab.. even over the other Android tablet offerings. But my opinion and what's best for me or my wife or anyone else should not matter when it comes to what is best for YOU. And if my wife and I would have followed the advice of many of the web reviews we looked at, we would have simply made the mistake of purchasing the IPad2 without a second thought.So, there you have it.

The Samsung Galaxy 10.1 fits the bill ideally with its light weight, rocket-like speed and a display that's crisp yet easy on the eyes. I travel a fair amount for both business and pleasure and the Samsung tablet connects easily to most wi-fi, has a good dual-core processor so I can multi-task easily and has good battery life. Like most new automation, I'm getting used to its software \"quirks\" (both native and downloaded) such as wonky management of Windows-based e-mail programs and Powerpoint presentations that won't animate automatically from slide to slide...you have to swipe them manually. Not major drawbacks for me. I have an Android OS cell phone too and not having to even think about synching calendars or contacts is a blessing beyond description after having spent lots of hours doing so with prior phones and desktops that I've owned. Samsung got it right with this tablet and after a month of ownership I'm happier with it day by day. IMPORTANT TIP: be sure to also buy the very inexpensive Samsung-produced USB adaptor - it greatly increases flexibility and makes file and image transfers a snap.

Easy to handle. Very intuitive in use. The ability to sync multiple google accounts on the device and flawlessly switch between them is very helpful.Cons:No USB/Memory card slot. Slightly \"I can easily break this\" feeling to it.I have come to find out that for $20 from Samsung, an adapter is availalbe that allows USB drives to be plugged into the device. By doing so, you can connect cameras, thumb drives, and even ipods to the device. This ability lets you expand a 16gb unit up to whatever the thumb drive holds, which is very helpful. The ability to add cameras and immediately download photos is a perk too. However, using a wifi memory card, you can easily do the same without any cables.The unfortunate side is that skype has not made their app available through the market for video chat (like the ipad2 has), but with the google talk app, it's a done deal. Problem solved. I bought the tablet as a secondary replacement to the laptop and the webcam feature has worked without missing a beat.Like I mentioned about the photo syncing, having the multiple google accounts for the tablet, the photos are available from our picasa albums and always with the tablet which is very nice considering it doesn't eat into the storage space of the tablet.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mostly great and a little not so great....", "Author": "Cake", "ReviewID": "RQU0BJNBTKCPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my 10.1 for a month now and I am mostly happy with it.

Oh and one more thing that can be considered a negative- mine came with a locked bootloader. Some are unlocked and some are locked. There will be a lock icon when your tablet boots up - that means your bootloader is unlocked. No icon at bootup and you have a locked one. You may want to google this if its important feature for you. I am waiting for somebody to figure a way around it. That might be important to some if you want to put your own customised  kernel. I did root mine and have been modifying it for my needs. It did ship with honeycomb 3.1.  The battery life is excellant, the screen brightness is awesome. It is almost as light as a feather. I find that not having a sd card slot is a plus. I think it makes my tablet more secure as honeycomb supports whole device encyption. The power cable is a bit short, but you can attach a common radio cord to the end. The prongs on the plug slide out and you can insert a longer plug (the type that go to most portable radios). The sound is fair. The tablet seems sturdy as well. There is no keyboard lag except when using the android browser that I have seen.

In fact, I despise Apple. So the Galaxy was right up my alley. I bought a factory refurb and it has preformed flawlessly. I love the Android platform and that there is no proprietary BS like Apple. I got the 32GB version and also the Samsung SD Card Reader option with an additional 32GB storage. Used with my HTC Evo and hotspot, I have internet access anywhere. And Cloud storage means I don't have to store music, videos or files on the device itself. It's great for watching Netflix with no hitching on video or sound. I use a JBL bluetooth rechargeable headset for audio. The sound is fantastic.The apps available are numerous and getting better all the time. The battery life is really good. I get more than 10hrs usually and there are settings that can improve it. The screen quality is better than anything else I have seen. The colors are vibrant and clean. Samsung uses Corning Gorilla Glass which is really tough and scratch resistant.I use Mobile Cloth to clean the screen.All in all this is a fine product.

There is one major problem I encountered right off. I cannot transfer files between it and my computer. After checking online, it seems that the problem is that the Galaxy doesn't support communication between it and Windows XP. No problem, I thought, I'll plug it into my new Windows 7 laptop. Didn't work.After much finagling and fussing around with Windows Update while my tablet was plugged in, I was able to download something called Samsung Composit USB drivers. Now this thing is gonna work, I thought. But it didn't. Windows still does not recognize my tablet.That kind of defeats the whole reason why I bought this thing -- so I could have a portable multi-media platform capable of playing music, videos and photos.I have read forums on almost every site I can find, but nobody has been able to give me a solution. But should it be this difficult? Really?One of the things that kept me from buying the Toshiba Thrive was its size and weight. But, boy, did they have a sweet system for transferring files. Plug in a USB drive, etc., and a window pops up asking if you want to transfer the files to your Thrive, and where. Also, the Thrive has almost as many ports as a laptop.I've got 12 more days to figure out how to transfer files to my Galaxy, or it's going back to the store for a Xoom, Acer Iconia, Ausus Transformer ... or Thrive.Btw, if anybody can tell me how to transfer files to this thing, I'll be forever in your debt. Thanks.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:Thanks to everybody who responded to my post. The problem turned out to be a simple one. All I had to do was go into settings, applications, Development, and uncheck the USB debugging box. After that, I plugged my tablet into my Windows 7 computer and it instantly recognized it. I was able to drag and drop files into the Samsung icon in My Computer. However, I was surprised at how long it takes a video file to transfer -- don't try this on a low battery.Anyway, I have changed my rating to four stars. Why not five? Because of the lack of USB or SD card connectivity (without an adapter).

After one month of research, i decided to buy a Samsung since my phone is android. I also thought i could maybe stop using my laptop and use my new tablet for business purposes. First problem about Samsung is that there is definitely a problem about screen touch. I don't know how nobody has ever mentioned it. When you touch the screen, sometimes it doesn't get it. Sometimes it is impossible to move the cursor to the place you need. Specially when you need to select something from a box, for example you need to enter a date from a box in booking.com or select a destination from a menu, it just doesn't get it. Copy, paste and selecting is also extremely difficult. It is the first time am using a tablet and i understand that using the fingers instead of the mouse needs some time but this is definitely beyond it. Selecting a button on this pad is a big issue.

I played with the tablet for a couple days before I gave it to her.For comparison: I've had an iPad 2 for 8 months now. I also have a Samsung Galaxy phone and I hate my Galaxy phone! The picture is pretty, but it has all sorts of random glitches. Maybe only 2 to 3 glitches per week but its annoying.My first impression of the Galaxy tab: The picture quality was incredible. Better than my iPad 2. It's brighter and more colorful but Samsung always has great displays. The tablet seemed slow transitioning from one screen to the next. I restarted it and everything sped back up. I've (my daughter) had the tablet for about 6 weeks now without any issues.Android Honeycomb was very intimidating for me at first (yes I was a noob). There were way too many options! This made me like my iPad 2 and IOS software that much more - due to the simplicity of Apple. After playing with the Galaxy Tab and Honeycomb for 20 minutes, I realized I wanted to get rid of my iPad 2 and get a Galaxy Tab. The tab is awesome! Android Honeycomb really is incredible. I can't wait till I can install the Samsung Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade on the tab (I'm not into the rom's).After I gave my daughter the Galaxy Tab, I picked my iPad 2 up to use it, and the screen seemed very small and square shaped. The screen on the Galaxy is not much bigger than the iPad screen, but it seems like it is. The aspect ratio of the Galaxy must work wonders.One thing I must say about Apple is everything is smooth. My iPad 2 runs every app with ease. The Galaxy isn't quite as smooth, but honestly, I like the Galaxy better. I haven't tried the iPad 3 yet, but it may be overkill for my purposes.Example of what I mean by smooth: Screen rotation: Ipad 2: about 1.5 seconds. Galaxy Tab: about 2.5 to 3 seconds - Not a big deal for me but worth noting.Also, the iPad 2's battery life is a bit longer - I think I get another hour out of the iPad 2 but I had far more apps and widgets running on the Galaxy so that may be why the battery died faster. And I think my iPad 2 charges twice as fast as the Galaxy. I haven't measured it but my iPad charges faster.In closing; If I had a choice to buy either the Galaxy Tab or the iPad 2 for the exact same price, I wouldn't by either. I personally think Apples is a little overpriced and I don't think anyone should be charging the same amount for similar specs. It's kind of like Nike Shoes in the early 1990's: No other shoe company should have been charging as much money as Nike. It's not that Nike was that much better, or even better at all. It's that Nike was iconic at that time, and they charged accordingly/excessively (Apple is the early 90's Nike). If the Galaxy Tab was $100 less than iPad 2, sold! If I had it to do all over again, I would have a Galaxy Tab for myself today.

I really enjoy it, and not just because of the weight! The functionality is great. I have really pushed the battery, as I am a pretty heavy multi-tasker/have a few apps I leave running in the background (such as chats, etc). It will last for around 2 days. It does take a bit longer to charge than I thought it would.The screen is nice and vibrant, and responsive to touch. I have little problem with accuracy. The one drawback I have noticed is the on-screen keyboard won't register letters as quickly as I'd like. For example, when you are typing \"night,\" I am quick with the \"gh\", and it will only take the g. So may watch for typing errors if you don't like auto-correct (like me).The apps load quickly, and the wifi is snappy. The cameras are ok; as other reviews have posted it's better than the ipad2's but not as good as some cell phones. I have taken video and they are a little grainy on screen. The sound on it though is pretty good.It seems rather sturdy in hand. I purchased the case that has the built-in silicon keyboard, but to be honest I've hardly had to use that keyboard. I do like the case.One draw back I have found is it is difficult to find accessories at stores such as Wal-Mart, Target, or Best Buy. The majority of the accessories are for the ipad. So I have been looking more online than I have in store, which is a bit of a disappointment as I like to touch and feel as I consider purchases.The app store is ok. Definitely not as voluminous as ipad but I have faith it will get there. Amazon has some good apps going for it, so maybe check them out before you dive in as well.Edited 3/10/12: I have discovered that the wireless print feature only allows you to print to a SAMSUNG PRINTER. If I had known of this inconvenience, it probably would have been a deal-breaker and caused me to turn my eyes to Apple.

You can delete files directly from the Tab 10.1 as well.- Great display. Lightest among Android tabs- All the Google services (i.e.: email, maps, nav) feel really native and are much much better than Apple- Customizable widgetsCons:- S/W is somewhat buggy here and there. Not hugely critical but still bugging me once in a while. (It feels like the product was launched 3 months before it was ready. Willing to live with it and I hope next firmware will fix most of bugs)- Seems to heat up more than IPAD.

While I disagree with the premise of the lawsuits it is not impossible to see why they exist especially with the aesthetic design (good) and the lack of options (bad) in the Galaxy Tab 10.1Pros:1. Looks great. I have the BestBuy 16gig white version and it looks fantastic.2. At 10.1'' it is still only a hair heavier than my 7'' Barnes and Noble Nook Color3. Screen is vivid at only 15% brightness and easily outshines the iPad 2's screen in sunlight.4. Compared with my experience on the Motorola Xoom running 3.1 the Galaxy Tab 10.1 feels smoother after prolonged use.Cons:1. No options at all for extra storage. My phone is also a Samsung product (Galaxy S Verizon Fascinate) and it is equipped with a MicroSD slot despite being smaller and nearly the same thickness. This very nearly was a deal breaker for me.2. Price at 500 for 16gig/600 for 32gig is in line with the Ipad 2 and Motorola Xoom but I find myself wondering if it were not a better buy to get the Asus Transformer at 400 dollars, the Acer Iconia at 450 dollars or the Toshiba Thrive at 430 dollars with each of those 3 options also being equipped with SD slots, full sized USB ports and in the case of the Transformer, an option for keyboard dock.3. Can not play any form of high profile h.264 unless at very low resolutions. If you are intending to use this tablet or any other Honeycomb tablet as a portable media center then know that it will most likely not play even standard definition .mkv files using h.264Thoughts:The Galaxy Tab 7 was equipped with a relatively powerful GPU which could play most high profile h.264 movie files as was the Galaxy S line of phones. The Galaxy S II is equipped with the Samsung Exynos 4210 which is leaps and bounds more efficient at video playback than the nVidia Tegra 2 and it confounds me as to why Samsung allowed Google to lock everyone into using the Tegra 2 when it is clearly an awful product designed for games hobbled by poor controls endemic to touch screen devices.The lack of external storage is to be addressed by an add on for the tablet using the proprietary port but this is just as outrageous as the people who purchased this did so to enjoy the aesthetics of Apple with the relative freedom of Honeycomb and a dongle would ruin the looks of the tablet.Despite these complaints I am not returning the tablet as I originally intended as its weight is ideal for me as opposed to heavier alternatives. Video playback was somewhat resolved for me using Splashtop RDP client but this only works in areas with strong wifi connection and my computer being turned on.If I could I would award the product 3.5 stars but I can't and I feel it does not deserve a 3 star rating.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "getting files on android tablets", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R1KA80F2529WYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a review, but advice for consideration.

Even before that I've tried the ipad2 and various other Android tablets and in my opinion this is the best tablet currently out in the market. Then againI guess it all depends on what you will use it for.In my case, I use it mainly for reading so I was looking for a tablet which is light enough so that it won't strain my wrist by holding it up too long. That's why I didn't like the Xoom, Iconia, Thrive and Transformer because they were bulkier and heavier, even though they all offer the same screen size as the galaxy tab. On the other hand, Galaxy Tab's thin profile, light weight and the weight distribution has made it a lot more easier to hold it for longer periods of time.I have also been really impressed with the apps available on Android that lets you organize your reading material and keep up to date with your favorite feeds using Pulse and Google Reader. I also use Zinio to read magazines and Aldiko to organize and read my material which are on pdf formats.I have only good things to say about the galaxy tab 10.1 and I would highly recommend to anyone. But let me tell you what I've noticed compared to ipad2. iPad2's screen resolution (1024 x768) helps magazine/pdf reading more than the galaxy tab (1280 x 800). On galaxy tab, resolution and the relatively larger status bar makes the text little smaller at 100% zoom compared to the ipad2 where magazines take up more screen area and make the text bigger.

It is my first tablet. My objective in purchasing it was to have access to email, calendar, some web research and as a portal to my corporate network.  Unfortunately the the last objective is a bust.  It is impossible to get this device to work with our VPN.After having it for a while I decided to try and go paperless.  I take it to meetings for note taking. I've installed evernote (a great product) and dropbox. It took me some time to organize myself but it is a great device.  I would like to see better battery life. WiFi use can kill it.  I turn it on and off constantly and can go up to a week without charging it.  If I leave WiFi on, the battery is good for about 6 hours. I never power it down. I suppose I could charge it nightly.It has one glaring problem though, that is the keyboard.  Using both the chrome and android keyboard I find it will place the first character I type at the end of the sentence. I've played with some of the settings, but no luck in resolving it. The android keyboard seems to do it less often.I also have to say, I am very disappointed that I have to root the device if I want to install Android 4.0.

I own the Samsung Vibrant, which I've been very happy with, so it felt natural to stay with the Samsung family. I'd been using the Vizio Via for a few months, and while it was a great tablet, I hardly ever used it. It did everything it was advertised to do, but it was a bit heavy and awkward to hold, because of the \"touch pad\" style buttons in the frame of the tablet. This meant that whenever your finger accidentally swiped across the bottom of the screen, it would take you back to the home screen. So, I retired it earlier than I would've liked, but it wasn't as user-friendly as I'd hoped. Since I got my first taste of the Samsung Galaxy Tab, however, I've not been able to put it down. I LOOK for reasons to use it! \"Oh...you need me to look something up?\" ...\"You need to check the weather report?\" ...\"Yeah, let me look up the details of that news story for ya\" HAHA - it's been an absolute dream come true!My favorite thing about the SGT is how light and durable it is. I got the one with the titanium/aluminum backing and am very pleased with the look and feel of it, and after a few weeks of constant use, I take great comfort in the expectation that this little machine will hold up for a long time. I use it for early morning reading and have had no issues with my arms getting tired, like I did with the heavier Via Tablet. It's also lightning fast, which is great for a multi-tasker like myself. I'll switch from a webpage to my notepad, then to my music player to switch a song, then back to the webpage...and on and on. I'll be starting Law School in the fall and I'm excited about bringing this along with me as a little sidekick :) The screen is ULTRA bright and the colors are simply radiant with beauty, so for any photography buffs or movie lovers, this will be a perfect companion. I've uploaded about 5 digital movies and it's the closest thing to Blu-Ray quality that I've seen in any tablet. Cons are few, and the most frustrating one is the lack of media storage. I have a 16GB media card that I would really love to use, and it's a pain having to delete some of my movies and videos every time I want to upload new ones. My only other complaints are that the cable is proprietary - so if I lose it (which I probably will), I'll have spend a ton of money to buy another one - and the screen is difficult to keep clean. I keep lotion on my hands so I'm constantly having to wipe all my greasy, slimy fingerprints off the screen...haha!The bottom line is that the Samsung Galaxy Tab is the ultimate Anti-iPad. Everybody thought Apple was SO cool with their iPhones and iPads, but Samsung came along and laid the SMACK DOWN! The Galaxy-S product line, in my opinion, can go toe to toe with Apple's stuff any day of the week. It's sort of like the Hyundai of the technology world, coming along to dominate a market once ruled by the \"exclusive\" snob-magnet Apple. The expensive price is completely worth it for the quality, the durability, the speed, and EVERYTHING else you get with this amazing little machine. This would be perfect for any adult, because it seems to have an entire network of features and apps for work, school lessons, sports and hobbies, entertainment, health and fitness, reading, music, movies...you name it!  And I especially love this because it has helped me cut back on my electric bills. I love staying up late at night, and now instead of keeping the TV on to find something to watch or keep the computer on looking for entertainment, I can use my tablet. I love it, and highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for top-of-the-line quality and user-friendliness.

It's an extremely well made tablet, in regards to both hardware and software. It's thin and lightweight, yet doesn't feel cheaply made. The display is flat out amazing, which is what you should expect from a Samsung product. The speakers are surprisingly loud and of decent quality, although nothing to write home about. The battery life is outstanding, I can go days before needing to recharge. Samsung uses their TouchWiz UX skin on this tablet which, IMO, is a great user interface. It adds a button to take screenshots (a very welcome addition), along with a nifty feature that allows the user to select from a series of small programs that can run on top of whatever is currently running. These small programs include a calculator, calendar, task manager, and notepad. It's a cool idea that actually works very well, and comes in handy more often that you'd think. The Android experience is different for all people, and admittedly takes some getting used to. That being said, I'm a huge fan of Android and think it works extremely well on tablets, especially this one.There are only a few minor drawbacks to this tab. One of the most talked about is a lack of ports, which is definitely a disappointment. There are no native HDMI or USB ports, nor any memory card slots. Samsung does sell dongles that allow for HDMI and USB connectivity, but it should have been included out of the box. Not a dealbreaker for me, but for others this can be an issue. The only other drawback is the extremely long time it takes to reach a full charge.Aside from those two issues, this tablet is phenomenal and I highly recommend it.

(my galaxy S phone is a piece of poo for offline navigation, coz it will take forever to lock satellites & and usually lose them). This one works, GPS locks in a blink. Together with the \"download offline map\", the new lab feature from google Map, I prefer the 10.1 to Garmin.GPS & navigation is another reason you might want to buy the 10.1 than ipad, because not only is the ios Google Map application still in ancient age, but also the ipad wifi version not equips with offline GPS.Apart from GPS, the tablet is alright. Good construction. Honeycomb rocks. Thin, light, screen is bright, sharp, and wide, best screen in tablet category so far, ipad2 included ( I compared them all in best buy side by side, transformer/thrive/xoom/ipad2 ).The only thing that I don't like is the fact that samsung chose to not having memory slot, not even the tiny micro sd. This has a draw back when you connect it to computer, because the only available protocol is MTP (not sure if it's the galaxy fault or Honeycomb poor decision, or what), which is not as convenient as mounting it as \"storage\", which allow you to access just like a filesystem. In MTP you can only copy files to it (not confirm, but from what I've experienced so far).Anyway I use Ubuntu 11.04, when plugging the tablet in, it recognizes without having to install any samsung driver. But for whatever reason, tranfering many big files, sometimes fail, like couple days ago I attempted to transfer 3 movies about 1G each, 2 succeeded, 1 failed, I had to re-transfered it.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (wow that is a mouthful for a name) has delivered spectacularly.I had the tablet for almost a week now and I don't know how I lived without one before.  The size and thickness is truly amazing, as I compared this with my roommate's shiny new iPad2.  It was just a hair thinner and a hair lighter than the ipad2.  I love the widescreen since I usually watch videos on the pad, and the extra horizontal space is great for apps like Gmail and Pulse where you can have the index on the left and the content on the right without feeling cramped at all.The Honeycomb 3.1 addition of \"saving webpages for offline viewing\" works amazingly well.  I'm the type that opens 200 tabs on my Firefox and never get to reading them because I get tired of sitting in front of the desktop.  Well, now when I travel or when I'm in bed, I can browse through all the websites I want and just save the ones I don't get to for later reading.I do wish that Android supported Netflix or Hulu, but I don't use those two services that much, so it doesn't affect me.  For my uses, being able to see video reviews on websites (yay Flash) and get the full website experience on a great Google Chrome browser is well worth not having Netflix.  Plus, I can just rip my own DVDs and transfer them onto the tab to watch.  IT plays pretty much every video file I've thrown at it so far.In short, if you are an Android or Google user, this tablet is a no brainer.

Some decided negatives: flash player on websites dos NOT work properly, seizes up after a few seconds, sound goes on behind a static picture. Unacceptable. The Samsung book cover case, though OK by feel (far from the ingenuity of the iPad cover, though) has one appallingly bad design feature: when closed, the side edge presses on the on/off switch. It beggars belief that this could be allowed to happen. Plus, the tilt of the tablet, when used with the cover is with the 'top' pointing down and certain applications do not rotate 180 degrees to accommodate this. If you place the tablet the \"wrong\" way in the case, you solve that problem (and, ironically the one with the accidental on/off button press!) but the charging/USB cable is now on the inside, so you have to keep the case wide open to charge. Utterly idiotic.I deliberately refuse to by i-somethings as I refuse to believe that one company should have a global monopoly on style and good design, so it is extremely annoying to see stupid oversights like these handing Apple on a plate the image of epitomy of cool design.

I bought the original iPad and the original Galaxy Tab and I owned the ASUS Transformer before selling it this week. I will also post a video on YouTube showing a demo of the new Galaxy Tab and iPad 2 side by side to show the things I mention in my review (just type Lamar Taylor).The Galaxy Tab is by far the best Android tablet on the market. The screen is beautiful and the tablet is very thin and lite. Having said that though...it is still way behind the iPad 2 as far as user experience and overall entertainment value.The iPad debuted last year with over 1,000 tablet apps and Netflix from day one. Honeycomb debuted with about 100 tablet apps and still has very few QUALITY apps. Honeycomb tablets CAN'T download Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu, or Crackle.The biggest problem with Android phones and tablets is fragmentation. I own an Evo 4G for personal use and have about 30 apps on my phone. I tried to download all the same apps to my Galaxy Tab but CAN'T because I get a warning that says certain apps \"aren't compatible with this device\". Samsung claims that this tablet can access the Android Market but that is only half true because there are a ton of apps I can't download and searching for apps is always hit or miss.My iPad 2 can download and play ANY app in the App Store that pops up on the screen. I have ESPN, Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, HBO Go, and iheartradio at my fingertips daily plus iTunes has way more music and movies legally than Android will ever have.Another thing to consider is support. There are over 35 different cases, alarm clocks, stands, and radios for the iPad 2. Android tablets and phones have barely any support outside of phone cases.Last but not least is the biggest lie and myth about the iPad 2 and Android tablets. The iPad 2 and iPhone DO RUN FLASH thru the SkyFire app. The iPad 2 can play Flash videos and games thru the iSwifter app. Flash runs very smooth thru both apps.The Galaxy Tab doesn't run Flash until you install the Flash app. When you do play Flash videos even on Yahoo News...it is slow and sometimes the picture and audio are out of sync. On my Evo....Flash is very sluggish and kills my battery faster than regular websites. People make such a big deal about Flash but I don't miss it on my iPad or iPhone.People must remember that the iPad 2 has had a head start on the competition and it's OS is older and more mature than Honeycomb. Honeycomb is only 6 months old but is a better option than what RIM and HP are offering. The PlayBook can't compete with a Galaxy Tab on any level.Bottomline...the Galaxy Tab is the best Honeycomb tablet out right now. The iPad 2 is faster and has more apps, games, movies, and books. The Galaxy Tab has much better cameras, speakers, and navigation options as is just as light as thin as the iPad 2. Once the apps and games and fragmentation issues are addressed....this tablet will be neck and neck with the iPad 2.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "screen bleading", "Author": "Narasimha Vulisetti \"narsi\"", "ReviewID": "R3KISQQLZWU8GF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first samsung product.

K. Martin \"Mnemosyne\"", "ReviewID": "RV71EB1TGJAMU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just some background to hopefully validate what I feel are some glaring issues with the tablet. I've owned iOS devices (from the original iPhone to the the iPhone 4 and both the iPad and iPad 2). I moved over to an android phone more recently after a brief stint with a Windows phone (HTC Surround). I now have an HTC Inspire 4G and enjoy Android on my phone much more than I did iOS.I don't want to make this long as many others before me have stated many of the good/bad things about this tablet.The build quality of the tablet is great. It doesn't have AS solid a feel compared to the iPads but it feels great in your hand and is surprisingly light. Samsung did a great job with aesthetics and it's a pleasure to hold and read from. The speakers are on both sides of the unit (when holding it in landscape mode). This is probably my favorite feature about the tablet as it provides a fairly good sound-stage whether it's for videos on YouTube or just for playing back music, it really outshines the speakers on both iPad 1 and 2.My major gripe is that for a dual-core processor, the UI can be sluggish. Moving from pane to pane it gets choppy and I thought I wouldn't mind but when I have to repeatedly attempt to switch between panes because it isn't recognizing my touch, it gets cumbersome to operate. Again, this isn't everyone's experience, but I haven't experienced this on the iPads.Like many others have mentioned, it will only be a matter of time before tablet apps flood the Android Marketplace but because of what the iPad offers in terms of video streaming (AirVideo), Video chat (FaceTime), and just a vast array of other tablet apps, I can't justify keeping the device. When I first saw FaceTime on the Apple commercials, I thought to myself, \"that seems like a gimmick I'd never use.\" Ever since I picked up the iPad 2 I've used it almost every day. Because there isn't any one Android tablet, there isn't really a standardized app. I've been able to do video chat with people using gTalk (on my Samsung Tab) and Vtok on the iPad 2 but quality and consistency were sorely lacking. iPad 2 to iPhone 4 video quality is decent considering the poor front facing camera. I will say that the Samsung Tab's cameras are great and they would probably work really well if there was some sort of standard Android video chat application. gTalk is probably as close as we'll get for Android to Android video chat. I know it's not a problem of bandwidth as I've tested multiple scenarios.Other applications I've had issues downloading and installing. I've had instances where I will download an app, it will say \"Installing...\" for 2-3 minutes and sit there idle. I'll attempt to force the install by tapping the install button which in turn takes me to my contacts list?? I've had some really odd things happen but thankfully I haven't had repeated force close issues like others have exhibited.If you're looking in the near term for a tablet that has an extensive library of apps, you may want to stick with the iPad/iOS devices. If you're willing to stick it out for the long-term, the Galaxy Tab is a capable performer and may soon have an outpouring of great apps.I'll have the device for a couple weeks or so but I plan on returning it. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to comment and I'll try to answer any questions.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shame on Samsung and Google Engineers", "Author": "Bob Allen", "ReviewID": "R25REMT3QJPN0L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Normally I would have purchased this unit from Amazon but I wanted to take the unit on my vacationfor storing and viewing photos and videos. I only had three hours before my plane left so I purchased theunit from my local Big Box store. Right from the get go I noticed that the screen was no where near asresponsive as my Ipod Touch. I had several video tutorials from a class I'm taking which were in wmv andmpeg4 formats. Right away I noticed that out of the box there is no way to view the videos. With no clearinstructions that come with unit, I looked for a way to do this on Google and found a free app downloadcalled MoboPlayer. After downloading MoboPlayer the one thing positive I can say is that the videos lookedfantastic. Clear resolution and beautiful display.However, it was all downhill from there. I next set a password for the unit. Which worked for the first twobootups. On the third cold power up after charging the unit, the keyboard for entering the password would notcome up. Instead the unit was asking me to paste my password into the password box. Paste how? There is nomouse nor is there anyway to connect one. So next I rebooted and then the keyboard reappeared. I was able tolog in. However, that experience made me nervous about continuing with a password. So I went to Settings andattempted to delete the password. The functionality for deleting the password is there but it does not work.After several attempts to delete the password, I gave up. Several other functions in Settings also do not work.For instance, you can access the photo or video apps by pressing on the storage for those items but you can'tview them.Finally after exiting Settings I went to turn the unit off to see if my attempts to delete the password hadany affect. At this point, the unit totally locked up. It remained on the shutting down screen until it ranout of energy and became totally dead. Attempts to recharge the unit have thus far failed. It is now just apaperweight on my desk and after only 6 days of use I will be returning it and getting an Ipad2.

(I develop games, etc.)As a positive thing to say: the screen looks nice.1) The autodimming is way too aggressive, going black after about 10 seconds.  Fortunately you can change this pretty easily, after you find the right spot.2) This tablet comes loaded up with bloatware and (cr)applets that just occupy space and serve no other purpose.  I'd removing them as soon as you power on the device.3) By default, every tap on the tablet causes a brief vibration, much like a pager or cell phone.  I despise this behavior from long years of dealing with pagers for work.  What's worse is that turning off the vibrate options are only partially successful: the behavior stops in the control panels, resumes erratically on the soft keyboards and in web browsers.  Many application for Android don't bother to pay attention to your system settings and use their own.  It's just really awful programming.4) Samsung has gone out of their way to make their packaging, etc. look like that of Apple products, only done badly.  Clearly they're trying to compete with them.The bottom line: If you want a tablet that's a pain to use, doesn't follow your directions, otherwise just seems to do whatever it wants and gives you the distinct feeling of not actually owning your device, then this tablet is for you.

This is my first review on Amazon but I feel that I have to steer people away from this product.A few things that are terribly bad:1. Input lag averages 0.3-0.5 seconds which makes the experience terrible2. Lack of high quality apps, especially compared to the iOS alternative3. Very non-user friendly, difficult to find settings, non-intuitive user interface4. Not possible to sync data on a MAC. This is just terrible, and comparing to iPad this is just no-where near where things should be at this pointI am a pro Google person that usually praise Google products, but this is it. For me, being a hardcore user that appreciate the openness that Android brings I can almost persuade myself into using the Galaxy over the Ipad 1 those rare occations when my wife has the Ipad 2 and I have to choose between the Ipad 1 and the Galaxy. But, for people that are new to tablets or for people that just want things to work, choose the Ipad 2.That said, I don't like how closed iOS (e.g. no Flash) is and how they make everything proprietary.

Here's why:1 - The plastic back makes it feel like a cheap toy. I almost feel like I could flex it if I put only a little effort into it.2 - what I dislike most about the ipad is the lack of an SD card. For some reason Samsung choose to copy that decision.3 - no usb. no hdmi4 - It is the most snappy and responsive android tablet yet (way better than the xoom) but it's still not ipad caliber. You can see the difference most easily if you try scrolling a webpage that is still loading - on the ipad the page nearly appears to be stuck to your finger as you drag, and on the GT however it's laggy and sometimes unresponsive. I could live with this flaw, but not with the first three.So now I'm holding out again waiting for good one, and filled with hope that it will be the rumored nexus tablet.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice try... Samsung", "Author": "Sancho", "ReviewID": "R7UCLFWOSHIJS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After the big discussions between Apple and SAMSUNG, where Apple claims the galaxy 10.1 is a copy of the Ipad - I thought it would perfectly fit into the family I already own - means I already own an IPAD 1 and an IPAD 2.I am a bit frustrated about the fact that my Ipad one and two won't play Adobe flash and the cam on my ipad 2 is also not really the best in the state.... So I decided to buy this Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tab.The cam is excellent and it has also a good flash light and YES! it plays ADOBE FLASH on the internet. So everything is fantastic, right - why only 2 of 5 stars?Well, I forgot that I am using Itunes at home and almost all of my media (video and audio) is in itunes.... So I would have to export all of that to mp3 (audio) and mp4 (video) - which takes a lot of extra space as I am not planning to get rid of my also beloved ipad1 and 2...Also the communication between the Samsung and Mac requires an additional program which would create an additional database beside itunes... My MAC did not recognize the device while using the Samsung software - 3 out of 5 times...Sending recorded videos through mail is a pain. you need to save it first, go your albums select it from there and send it --- guys  at Samsung... please take a look at the solution which the ipad has... simple and quick...The CAM is not supported by SKYPE!!!! I need Skype for phone conferencing....I miss the stop button which stops appications immediately...So, overall a very good Tablett - but doesn't fit into my media world at home. I tried hardly to use it for 2 weeks before I made the decision getting rid of it because the above named problems. I dont remember if I ever had to reboot one of my two ipads - in fact I had to do reboot this one at least 10 times during the two weeks. Flash runs, but the quality is getting worse and worse each time you play flash content within the internet.Maybe, if I would not have the ipad one and two - maybe than I would be satisfied... I am using iswifter application to play flash on the ipad and it works fine.... Samsung  - this is a nice try of building and selling a competitor product...

After several hours of using both, I returned the Galaxy Tab.  There are two main reasons.  First, I like to play games and the number of games on the Ipad 2 (especially role playing games) is significantly higher than on the Galaxy.  Second, against contrary belief, the Ipad 2 is faster when surfing the web.  I am using the Atomic Browser not Safari for the Ipad.  I tested 20 web pages on both at the exact same time and the Ipad came back faster on 15 of the 20 web pages.  The size of the Galaxy tab is nice and the camera is much better.  The lack of flash was not a big deal to me.

I Can't Recommend it.", "Author": "Shanon Fernald", "ReviewID": "RZTLNOOZGRTKC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the iPad the day it was released.  Please keep in mind that I am a heavy and advanced user and use my tablet at least four hours a day so have certain expectations of quality and reliability.Instead of getting the iPad 2, I thought I would try the Galaxy Tab 10.1 since the reviews indicated they were comparable.Well guess what? They aren't and it's not even close. Using the web browser on the original iPad is as smooth as butter. Using it on the Galaxy Tab is a pain. It hiccups and stutters and moves like butter that has been frozen over for several days. Disabling all flash and javascipt didn't really help either. It just is not nearly as polished. Some sites i would go to such as RealGM would crash the browser. I even tried the dolphin HD browser but the sites crashed that one too. The fonts are not as good as the iPad. The whole browser is just not nearly as reliable.Some sites would only come up as the mobile versions. Had to put the browser into debug mode to change the user agent. Why isn't this kind of thing a default?Also, I had a hard time clicking links for some reason and there is very little feedback given for when you do click a link so you don't know if it's loading or not. By the way, the haptic feedback sucks and I couldn't turn it off fast enough.Managed to play a flash game online, but it wasn't worth it in the end. While trying to surf the web with flash enabled made the browser unusable for me.Gmail works great, but the one absolutely critical thing for me is to get my work emails. Why do I need a separate app for exchange emails? So I have an app for gmail and an app for my work emails. That is just ridiculous.Also, my work exchange set up quickly but it didn't work right. Only about one in four emails actually left the outbox. This was a showstopper. I have to be able to communicate with my work at all times and feel it is reliable. The keyboard was slow to type emails and I didn't see any spellchecking on the emails. Also, the way text is copied and selected is confusing and inferior to the iPad. The fonts are not nearly as nice either.I get that it is a widescreen tablet but what is up with the space hogging menu bar that makes it even more narrow? There seems to be no way to make it go away? The one button on the iPad is so much better than wasting all that space.Hardware seems every bit as good as iPad 2 (just picked it up this morning after mailing this return out), but the software is just too raw, unpolished and buggy for me. It has a great screen and is a thin light little machine. I really wanted to like it. I didn't care that there weren't any apps. I just wanted a google based tablet with email and great web browsing experience. Everything I use is google-based so I thought I would be a great candidate.But let me just warn you to stay clear of this. You will be disappointed if you have used the iPad at all (even the first one). I don't like to return stuff but this was just way too RAW for me. If it was substantially cheaper, it might be worth putting up with some of the issues, but at the same price as the iPad 2 it is a seriously inferior product.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00519RW1U"}}
