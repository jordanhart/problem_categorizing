The main issue seems to be almost entirely due to the slow processor speed and cobbled together software package.The computer runs significantly better on Windows 7, but is more prone to glitches and ominous blue screens. (Though perhaps a fresher installation of Windows 7 would fix this). Once support comes out for Windows 7 from Asus (drivers) and W7 is released, I think this can once again be a handy little machine. Though at this point it sits on my desk since I don't have the time to fix it but know it has the potential to do better.Hardware/package/look- is very good except for the slow processorSoftware- needs plenty of work to make it viable", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Notebook", "Author": "Linas Dapkus", "ReviewID": "R1MGG7DVC4U2P6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS T91 is a great notebook.

Touch function works well.Somewhat slow(I guess OK for the price).Touchgate with the three floating desktop screens is a dumb distraction and does not add any functionality.WORST OF ALL,the pen writing in the tablet mode (which was the main reason I bought this tablet)DOES NOT WORK, as the palm touch input is not blocked.This NEEDS to be fixed, including updated software for those of us who bought it without knowing this serious deficiency.And the User Manual (paper as well as oline) is virtually useless.

The T91 is great for online course content, as you can push buttons and click through equations and slides with just a tap on the screen.  I've quickly become so used to this awesomeness that I keep mistakenly touching the screen of my older, bigger laptop, expecting a mouse click.For fun and utility the T91 really can't be beat. I have all my textbooks on board, so it's the only resident of my bookbag save for my note paper. The screen-swiveled tablet mode is great for reading and reviewing slide shows and notes. And walking around campus it doubles as an mp3 player and a (web) radio!The only minor annoyances are a less-than-perfectly-responsive keyboard (please, Asus, tune this up in the next version) and the 1GB of RAM - I highly suggest upgrading to 2GB, unless you're a more patient soul than I.This is fantastic product for the price, and it allows for some seriously new and exciting uses.

As a computer technician I know and trust Asus products without question,and with my recent purchase of the T91 my trust has only grown.First off for the yokels that bought this for heavy work loads... you're a moron case in point; with a 16 Gb SSD (solid state drive) and 1 Gb memory topped off 1.6 Ghz processor and a 8.9\" screen did you really think that this could handle that kind of work load? And for the idiots that scratched the surface of your touchscreen with the stylus do you poke your wife or girlfreinds like that? If you do bet you spend alot of time \"Alone\".As a tech and a Sales executive for my own firm I needed a laptop that 1. I could travel with that wasn't to cumbersome (specially when I'm flying) and 2. when I was up in someones roof or in their wall fixing their network I could still have information and a great test tool at my finger tips. The T91 did that and never broke a sweat...if you haven't figered it out then let me spell it out for you...\"I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!\" My T91 has taken over as mission critical equipment in my work as a tech, I use her to trace network cables, shorts and hub problems. she connects to my test equipment and gives more information on the problems I face. Wireless interfarence and blind spots are no longer problems that bother me.So you want a good system to do a few things when you're on the road? want something not to bulky, enough speed to get info on the road, or you're a tech looking for a cheap alternative to buying high grade test equipment on a buget then look no further... The T91 in my opinion is a great buy and a great netbook / tablet.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "My darling little computer", "Author": "Gina \"The Gina\"", "ReviewID": "R34303BDHA9L78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really happy with my Asus Eee PC T91. The keyboard is perfect for my wrists (I have thin hands and long fingers). I love it so much I have bought a replacement battery and went through the long involved process of installing it (it is not user accessible) with the help of a youtube video.It is now a lot heavier than it used to be. Probably because everything else has gotten lighter and so now it seems more cumbersome.It does have a problem with the screen. The left fifth of the screen looks like it has an overlay of a transparent magenta. It has been that way since a short while after I got it. It just wasn't worth it to me to deal with doing something about it. About two years ago it lost the ability to notice when the lid was closed so it didn't go to sleep on its own. Now I just use the zzz function before I close it.

If you do handwriting in languages other than English, you should get Windows 7 Ultimate instead of professional.  It runs much better in Windows 7 just for the fact that Windows 7 supports Tablets right out of the box.Hard drive is a bit too small - 16GB is never enough, and I have to uninstall programs before I can even get a clean Windows 7 installed into it. After Windows 7 I have about 5-6GB left, and I seriously doubt I will install anything more to it at this point except some small utility softwares.Touch screen works great but expect minor delays in actions, although this may be common to all tablets.Performance is a bit sluggish but understandable.  This netbook is used primarily for my emails, browsing, and web TV, and reading - I don't use it for anything else and should not be.Overall not bad but not as intuitive as IPad (that is the OS problem not the machine itself).  The good part is it offers much more external ports that IPad can offers, so you will be able to connect multiple things to it.It is small, lightweight, good looking, and does well for what it intends to ... otherwise it is hard to type, a pain to look at the tiny screen for an extended time, a bit slow, and can't get everything you need into it.I guess that is the two sides of the same coin.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Netbook", "Author": "Slugo", "ReviewID": "R1RCW6QVEGUN7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the product from a referral and am happy that I did.

Merchandise delivered on 10/27/2010 as promised. Absolutely no regrets with my order. The price was the driving force behind my purchase. SD card and card slot became defective and I had to returned it. Amazon exceeded my expectations with their handling of my replacement unit and return authorization. Enough to make them my primary online retailer for all further purchases.I upgraded the memory to 2GB. Although the 1GB chip seem adequate, I preferred the added memory for better performance. This unit shipped with Windows XP and I am impressed with the overall touch performance in general, especially considering that it is a resistive touch screen. Being a Computer Science Major who is almost finish with my degree requirements, I installed Windows 7 (free) under the Academic Alliance Program with the community college that I am enrolled in. I am running a dual boot (Windows XP and Windows 7) from the 16GB SSD. Windows XP handles well and is the primary focus. The computer is small, lightweight, and is ideal for portability. Functionality is great and is a good alternative to the IPAD. Since showing off some of it's features and functionalities, I have had several colleagues order the same computer from Amazon. I gave it only four stars solely because of the small hard drive (despite the 16GB SSD card and 20GB of free online storage).

Having bought it im a little disappointed. First off its just too slow for the touch interface to function properly. The shift and enter keys are very poorly placed. The touch pad doesn't work very well, it occasionally thinks you are trying to do something else than move the cursor. If you use the touch pad to write there is no \"interpolations\" i.e. your writing looks like you wrote it in paint. All in all they should have held off on this till they had improved it a little but on the upside you do get a lot of features for a low price. I especially appreciate the ss-hdd and Bluetooth.

I wanted a Windows-based system, as I've had less than satisfactory results trying to edit Word docs with other OSs like Chrome. I've also found Windows 8 frustrating to use for several reasons. Being somewhat of an old fogey, the last version of Windows I really felt comfortable with was XP, so I prefer using that. I've had this little gem for over a month now and love it! The only negative thing I can say about it is that the keyboard is smaller than a standard keyboard so that my typing speed suffers a bit because of that. But I'm learning to compensate for that, and it's definitely not a deal breaker. If you're someone who has to have the latest and greatest, then this isn't for you.
