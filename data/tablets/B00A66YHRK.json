But it does what I need and for the price it's a nifty little tablet.  It seems to lock up quite a bit but for the most part it works well. One downfall I have found is finding accessories for this since it is an off brand tablet.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATED,,, Product dissapointed in end.", "Author": "Arturo G \"AG\"", "ReviewID": "R1F8CPMZ5S5VF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one of these on ebay,, exact same specs .  It worked great right out of the box, goes on google play, loads and runs apps and has a very nice color screen.  I think it represents a great value in a tablet compared to some of the premium brands that are more than twice the cost!UPDATE:  This item doesn't charge the battery while in use ,, goes dead all the time as a result,,, would not purchase another.......", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "useless paperweight", "Author": "4kidmama", "ReviewID": "RXM5G3DNTKRLZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered two of these for my twins 13th birthday and after two months, they wont charge and are no longer useable.  I contacted the seller and since I ordered them before their birthday the 30 day period to return was up and that's it.  So now I have two useless paperweights because I cant charge them so I cant use them.  They did say it was the charger and sent me another charger, but that isnt the problem and never was. Ive tried the USB charger and the one included and they dont charge.  Customer service is terrible, they take forever to respond and dont offer assistance.  Very dissapointed", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "G. Lake \"1233fire\"", "ReviewID": "R1O101QHKT6BSV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Product is pretty well made.

Now, I am no tech wiz which actually makes this review even better. I played with the TBS for just a few minutes and had pretty much figured everything out. It is easy to use, has enough functions to keep one busy and is built Ford Tough.The only issues that I have with it is the touch screen is not as sensitive as I had hoped and even with 4g internet it is a little slow. I still give it a 4 star rating.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet", "Author": "Francisco Mateos", "ReviewID": "R3AVDJWTQ3IP6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good tablet tablet.
