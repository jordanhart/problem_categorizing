{"Reviews": [{"Title": "KF HDX 8.9 is ok; do homework on Prime download before you buy", "Author": "B. Tarbuck", "ReviewID": "R3OSONR0PBKHU6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.  To Amazon's credit it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than originally claimed.I have a Galaxy S3 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing.  Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Cloud Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device.  Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion.  This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download to your HDX.  Caddyshack can be downloaded but not The Hunger Games.  You can download certain videos but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out.  There is no banner (like the Prime banner on the movie icon) to show that it's content you can download to the HDX.  You have to open the content to check.  *** Edited 12/21:  You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device.  That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content.  Nice job Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.  Also NOT the case.  So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption.  That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.  You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.  Many people will opt up for the 64 GB device like I did only to find that 16 GB would likely do fine since it would be hard to download enough content to fill 64 GB.  As another commenter pointed out if you downloaded long movies in full HD perhaps you'd really want the bigger device.  Which brings me to the final point.The final criticism is that once you start watching content you have to finish watching the content within 48 hours or you need to reconnect to the internet.  Again, I was surprised to find out that the content I downloaded expired.  Hopefully these criticisms lead to a more informed purchase decision on your part.Here is the official word from Amazon which is indeed on their site and the purpose for my edit.  I was unable to find this prior to my purchase and learned about it only after I acquired the device.*  Many (but not all as I note above) Prime Instant Video titles are also available for download on Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation and Kindle Fire HDX devices. The detail page for each Prime Instant Video title indicates whether the title is available for download. You can download available titles to only two separate devices at one time. If you have already downloaded a title to two devices, you need to delete it from one of them before downloading it to another device.*  You can have a maximum of 25 total Prime Instant Video titles downloaded at a time across all devices associated with your Amazon.com account. While not all Prime Instant Video titles are available for download, the same videos may be available for rental or purchase from Amazon Instant Video, and rented or purchased titles can be downloaded to compatible devices.*  Viewing Period: If you have a Prime membership or Prime free trial, you can stream any video that is currently designated as a Prime Instant Video title on its detail page. You can watch Prime Instant Video titles that you've downloaded within a limited viewing period, which varies by title. A typical viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the title or 15 or 30 days after the download, whichever is earlier. We'll typically notify you when the viewing period for a title is close to expiring. After your Prime membership or Prime free trial expires or is cancelled, you cannot watch any Prime Instant Video titles unless you've also rented or purchased that title.So my recommendations are this.  Amazon is a great company, one that I have committed to in a big way with Cloud Music, Prime and now the HDX.  They need to be more upfront about the download limitations and I'm very disappointed that I've had to discover these limitations on my own and feel it is important to convey that to others who may be considering this device over others based solely on the much touted video download feature.Also the rear facing camera in my particular device only works properly 30% of the time.  There is some weird RGB output happening.  It's not even close to the Galaxy S3 quality or acquisition speed so just don't expect that the camera will replace your SLR and you won't be disappointed.The rest of the device is great.  All my Cloud music magically appeared and it is very easy to operate. I can get on a primitive version of Gmail but it works fine.  Outlook Web Access for work is fine.  Yahoo! email works fine.  No Dropbox app yet and it won't work with Google Docs or Microsoft's online Excel / Word apps but that was known in advance and expected given the fact that Amazon isn't touting this as a work tool; it's for play.Amazon really owes it to their faithful customers who purchase these devices to improve the download / Prime experience and this will be a home run.  I'm looking forward to trying Mayday to help sort out the problems with the camera and inquire about the return policy as I felt very underinformed in advance on the downloaded video limitations.  I hope these comments help you ask good questions and help Amazon improve their product and content experience.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rocks!

The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning.  Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX.\u2714 BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9\" HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos.\u2714 PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet.  There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).---Videos you purchase do not have a viewing period.\u2714 GLITCHES---Verify your kindle is set for the correct TIME ZONE or you might have glitches.---If you cannot see your apps or any other items on the CLOUD then you probably need to RESET your device.---Filling the device to the max with videos then trying to delete a video might turn your kindle into a brick.\u2714 POWER ADAPTER INCLUDED---Yes, you get a  Kindle Power charger! Previously this had to be purchased separately ($19).\u2714 OFFICE SUITE MISSING---You can view an item with the integrated Office Suite but you cannot edit the item unless you upgrade to the professional version and paying $4.99.  That is, the HDX has a built in OfficeSuite shell, not the full functional program.  Hint: Use your 500 free coins to get the upgrade free.\u2714 No HDMI port (MIRACAST instead)---There is no HDMI port. To view kindle content on a television you need a Miracast enabled receiver (which can be your tv or a Dongle you connect to your tv). Although this is all done wirelessly, you are not using your local wi-fi connection, the receiver creates its own adhoc network.\u2714 PICTURE QUALITY---The picture quality on the HDX is stunning. It is noticeably better than the HD, there is no comparison between the two of them.\u2714 SOUND---The sound on this device is about the same as the Fire HD.\u2714 PROCESSOR---Faster. A lot faster than the HD!\u2714 VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS---The volume and power buttons are on the back of the device instead of the side. Fortunately the power button is on a different side than the volume buttons.\u2714 VIRTUAL KEYBOARD---There is white secondary text on the virtual keyboard buttons which makes information easier to read. On the HD, the secondary text is black which is difficult to read on dark gray keys.\u2714 KARAOKE (X-Ray)---You can now get x-ray on your music which shows the lyrics line-by-line. This feature is not available with all songs.\u2714 PRINTING---This new device will soon support printing documents straight from the kindle. Previously needed a .99 cents app.\u2714 STORAGE---This model can be purchased as 64GB without having 4G connectivity.\u2714 MAYDAY Customer support---Click the Mayday customer support button (in the Quick Settings) and you can see the rep but they cannot see you.  I have used Mayday about three times and it is wonderful.\u2714 REAR AND FRONT CAMERA (Important information)---The HDX includes a rear facing camera with an LED flash. There is also a front facing camera. On the HD there is only a front facing camera and no flash.\u2666Important:  once you take a photo it automatically goes to the CLOUD storage.  Please do not take any images that you do not want floating around in cyber space!\u2714 Special Offers---As before, Special Offers show up as screen savers. They are much better than the traditional screen savers. I recommend buying cheaper with the offers. If you do not want them then pay the extra to remove them. If you buy without the offers then change your mind and want them, you can't get the discount.\u2714 Amazon Coins---All new Kindle Fire owners receive 500 Amazon coins to spend in the app store. This equates to about $5. Plus there is always a free app of the day that can be downloaded. This is nothing new.\u2714 RETURN POLICY\u2666If you do not like the HDX (and you buy from now through the holidays) then you have until January 31, 2014 to return it.  In general there is a 30 day return policy.Cheers", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An enlarged version of the 7\" HDX - Same good internal components with a nicer screen- still a battery hog though", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer \"Reviewing is my greatest int...", "ReviewID": "R2GE0AJTQPLZ9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simply put, this is the Amazon\u2019s iPad Air Killer. The 7\u201d HDX is the iPad mini killer.  Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware.  This means the 8.9\u201d version is an enlarged version of the 7\u201d version.  For my 7\u201d version review, please search for my HDX 7\u201d review.My profile: I\u2019m a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) & use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.  It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7\u201d \u2013 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7\u201d as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7\u201d As I mentioned in the 7\u201d review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This screen is a much bigger step up from the original HD 8.9 1920x1200 screen to the Kindle Fire HDX screen at 2,560 x 1,600.  The screen is comparable to the iPad Air which I saw in Apple store and text is crystal clear now with such a high per pixel inch density.  The viewing angle is just as impressive as you can hang the kindle in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly. Last year's model was not as clear as this. The overall screen improvement for this year\u2019s Kindle lineup is just impressiveSound (8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound. Similar to the 7\u201d that gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):Like the 7\u201d HDX, this 8.9 HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device. It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.The biggest improvement is the weight for this HDX 8.9 compared to last year\u2019s HD 8.9, the device is noticeable lighter (567g for Kindle Fire HD vs 374g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue. It\u2019s also lighter than iPad Air and that\u2019s quite impressive.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting. It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view. However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful. Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it. Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):With higher resolution similar to the kindle fire hdx 7, the battery life is still the biggest drawback.  As mentioned in my HDX 7\u201d review, it takes more to power to drive the battery now thanks to the screen upgrade.  Anything on the screen requires higher resolution = more power draw.  The 2650x1600 screen pulls a lot of power still compare to last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  It maybe fine for casual use but for people who are more absent minded in charging or require this for business productivity purpose, it can be quite annoying when your batteryrunning out of power.  Regardless, how much power saving features you have, it seems that the screen resolution is still taking most of the power.  I'm able to pull 7 hours of moderately heavy usage vs 9.5 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time. Again, if something like a battery case is available, that will be great. Otherwise, it will be wise to find an external battery pack for this just in case.Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueLike the 7\u201d Silk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX. For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use). The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon. I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):Same problem here arises for the 8.9\" compare to 7\".  For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available. At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch. This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached. Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon. Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.  At the moment, will just have to go with the original origami case (which again can be pricey as you can see from my other review)Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use. The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and its does show relevant items I maywant. Compare to the iPad Air, this is a total steal.  At this screen range, you cannot find anything comparableConclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad Air killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade from HD 8.9, I say YES to that.  The overall lineup for Kindle Fire has vastly improved and that is great on Amazon\u2019s part.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade. The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It used to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag. It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case. You get great price, great screen and great performance that surpass iPad Air. To me, the HDX is Amazon\u2019s answer to an iPad killer. This tablet at the moment has the best performance/price ratio.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market with no only one device revamped, but an entire lineup of Kindle Fire HDX having such performance leap. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!With 7\" HDX, it is my e-reader device whereas my 8.9\" HDX, it will be my productivity deviceThis will be reviewed periodically throughout the year. A more comprehensive review on productivity will soon be available. [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ipad convert", "Author": "R. Kumar", "ReviewID": "RTVD01N5TDVFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an apple guy since 1994.  I learned how to program on the Iic and have been using just about every version of the macbook and iPhone since it's inception.  I've also been a very proud iPad owner since day 1.  I still have my original iPad and bought both the iPad 2 and most recently the iPad air.  The iPad air is a remarkable device, it is gorgeous, thin and light.  I realized quickly however that iOS 7 was not ready for primetime on the iPad air.  Not to mention that I was having memory crashes 5-6 times per day.  On mobile safari, I would have two web pages open and the device would slow down.  If I opened a third tab and went back to one of the original two, they would both need to reload.  On top of all that, even though I am fully vested in the apple ecosystem (I purchase all my apps, music and movies through iTunes), I was quickly realizing that the competition was catching up very quickly.That's what lead me to the 8.9 HDX, mind you, I tested out the Galaxy note 10\" as well as the Nexus 7 for a \"true\" android experience.  I found jelly bean to be no different than ice cream sandwich which was marginally better than the last version.  I know android purists will say there is a huge difference and jelly bean was designed for tablets, but in all honesty, android is just a boring experience.  Even with a gorgeous screen as there is on the nexus 7, it has the occasional stutter, and I don't find the operating system intuitive with the exception of google now, I swear they've got spies in my house.With all that said, the HDX is the first truly different tablet experience in almost four years.  You will be truly dumbfounded by how light this thing is.  I mean after holding an iPad air, you'll feel like this weighs nothing.  But even with the lightness there is a \"heft\" to the device, one that gives it a presence.  And 8.9\" is the perfect size.  I mean PERFECT.  You can hold it in one hand in landscape easily.  And the rubberized plastic feels phenomenal.  From an iPad guy, this thing is neck and neck when it comes to design.  Yes, it doesn't have an aluminum back, but the front screen feels so much better.  The iPad Air screen felt plasticky in comparison to previous versions.The OS on the HDX is good.  I like the launcher.  It doesn't give me the feeling of completeness that IOS does by allowing me to customize and launch different apps, but it does it's job well.  I've always wondered why Apple didn't just have a live screen that automatically selected the apps I use most often and put them on the front page.  That's where Mojito's (as an aside, dear Amazon and Android, stop. being. cute.  Just give me a OS Version number, I can't wait for Android \"lifesaver\" or \"mint julep\") carousel comes into play.  It updates as you use it.Oh, and I know some folks like to use tablets for productivity, but let's be honest, they are purely entertainment consumption devices.  I realized that quickly with my previous iPads.  As much as I liked having email, iMessage, FaceTime, office suites, etc, the reality was that I used my iPad to browse the web, shop, read, and watch movies.  Guess what, that's what the kindle fire focuses on.  This is not a laptop replacement, this is not a post-pc device, it's the dessert you know you shouldn't have but realize after eating that it was the best thing ever.Prime Content is not exactly amazon's strong suit unfortunately.  I love prime, I've been a prime user for a very long time.  The streaming features of prime are ok.  Decent shows (like the most recent daily show) and movies (most of Marvel's latest flicks) are available.  But I'm paying 7.99 for netflix and until Amazon shows me content like that, I'll stick with my buddy.  Prime again is ok, not bad, not great, it does the job, but don't buy this for prime.  You can obviously buy all the same shows and movies on amazon that you could on iTunes, but from a free content perspective, prime isn't the driving factor behind this device.So, should you get the HDX, here's a few questions for you:How vested are you in google's or apple's ecosystem?  Have you purchased dozens of apps, more importantly, do you use the dozens of apps you've purchased?How important is productivity software to you?  Do you have to check email constantly on your tablet, open attachments, edit documents?  Or do you find that using a laptop or other PC a better solution for that?Do you play lots of tablet games?Finally, where do you get most of your content and do you purchase, torrent, stream?  There are ways to get movies from both the play store and iTunes to the kindle fire legally and easily.I found for myself, that a laptop is the best solution, and with today's ultra books and the macbook air, you can get a small, light laptop for under $1000 that does exactly what you need.  But for content consumption, the kindle fire is very hard to beat.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW.  More than I expected!", "Author": "My $0.02", "ReviewID": "R2VTY8AFSMKDI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this delivered last week to an Amazon Locker so it wouldn't be sitting on my porch and so I could pick it up in the middle of a work day. The Amazon Locker experience was really cool and convenient.First impressions....fast, lightweight, thin, and super sharp picture.  How the heck are there so many enhancements stuffed in the Fire HDX without weighing it down or slowing the processor speed?Navigating through the apps is quick and smooth, very responsive to touch.  I had multiple apps (10-20) running at once and it didn't affect performance at all.The picture is amazing, the colors are vivid and the contrast and sharpness makes some content almost look 3D. It also handles glare pretty good. Best screen I've seen to date and I have an iPhone w/ retina.The speaker sound is really good, they actually put out some bass.The app selection in the AppStore is plentiful...once you have your top 50 apps you should be set and Amazon has all of the must-have apps (do you really need 500,000 apps?), every app I looked for/needed was found and downloaded quickly and painlessly (love the Yahoo fantasy football, Facebook, Pandora, TuneIn PRO, and Netflix apps).The video camera is crystal clear and the rear camera is a much welcomed addition.  Great pics and video! The built in Skype app works very well for free video calls with friends and family.  The good thing is, anyone with the Skype app can receive your video call on their device (unlike Facetime where both users must have an Apple device). This allows you to have free video calls with more of your contacts as long as they download Skype from their respective app store.The camera app is surprisingly useful considering it comes built in. It has a ton of photo editing capabilities including filters (way more than instagram), panorama shots, cropping, text, and funny stickers you can paste to pics. You would think this was a paid-for camera app.The email client was very easy to set up, I had my Gmail loaded in less than a minute.The overall build feels sturdy and just pure quality. Again, it is very thin and lightweight but feels like it was put together very well.The battery lasted for 10+ hours while I was hopping around fantasy football, Facebook, and email on Sunday during the games. This is very good for an HD tablet.  People must remember a tablet is more like a smartphone and needs to be charged when not using since apps and wifi are constantly running in the background. For being so thin and lightweight the battery is very impressive.The Silk browser is nice, although it defaults with Bing, so I changed it to Google (personal choice).I really like the icon with reading glasses that appears in the top right of the browser that let's you change to reading mode.  It converts the web page text into a book-like page, similar to the Kindle e-reader.  It really makes reading articles on various websites easy on the eyes.X-ray feature: Watching TV shows and movies is enhanced by x-ray.  Just tap on the screen and factoids about the actors in the scene (at that moment) pop up on the side of the screen without interrupting the play.  Just tap the screen again and the info disappears.  This also works when listening to music from the music tab; the lyrics of the song appear while the song is playing.  I've always had to interrupt myself and check my phone for movie info or song lyrics when I watched or listened on other devices, now it's all in one place and available with a tap of the finger.  No more asking \"what's that actor's name\", \"what other movie was she in\", or \"how does that song go\"!The keyboard is really accurate, no typos yet. I noticed there is an external keyboard by AmazonBasics, but I'm okay with the on-screen keyboard for now.The price was reasonable for what I got. It's good to know they're not making a profit on me before I even opened the box!Overall, I am very pleased with the appearance and performance after using it for 7 days.  I was really looking forward to this purchase and I must admit that I am more than satisfied. Amazon over-delivered on this. Well done Amazon.If you don't care about \"labels\", then this is the best tablet you can buy right now.  And if you ask me, Amazon is the best \"label\" when it comes to taking care of their customers.  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!P.S. - You really should be an Amazon Prime member to get the most out of this tablet. The free Amazon Instant Videos for Prime Members are awesome!  I also opted for the Special Offers, which knocked $15 off the price of the tablet and does not bother me at all.  In fact, I am glad I got the special  offers version!  Since I've owned the tablet I have received offers that only Kindle Fire owners have access to.  I got a new Kindle Paperwhite for $20 ($100 off) and a Cuisinart Juicer for $20 ($100 off) - these 2 deals alone practically paid for my tablet purchase!  There was a deal for Madden 25 for $5 but I missed that one.  They are really awesome deals to take advantage of or you can just ignore them since the special offers only appear for a split second on your screen as you swipe to unlock the tablet from sleep mode. Definitely recommend the special offers, you can always opt to pay $15 later to have it deactivated but you'll find they are totally worth having.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Screen Display and All Around Nice Tablet", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R3L6RNVTOIVG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $379 you are getting a good deal on a large tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $399 for last year's base unit of the first-generation 8.9\u201d Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi base version of the iPad; if your pocketbook can afford it, I would recommend upgrading to the one with 64 GB of memory. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year\u2019s 8.9\u201d HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer looking for the larger screen size, or where price vs. value is a key consideration, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $269.  If you're comparing last year's 8.9\u201d model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one because other than screen size, for what I am using it for, I can only tell the difference between the video playback and playing a couple of games.I\u2019ve been playing with this for over a week now, and my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the 8.9\u201d Fire HDX to the original 8.9\u201d Fire HD as well as this year's model of the \u201cregular\u201d Fire HDX, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Initial setup of this year's model of the 8.9\u201dKindle Fire HDX was pretty easy \u2013 that\u2019s saying a lot as this year\u2019s versions of the various models had significant crashing issues due to operating software updates.  While this unit did update the operating software, it ran quietly in the background with no issues at all.Screen Display / Video Playback:If video is your thing, this version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date: I\u2019ve been comparing various episodes of the first season of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d TV show to each of the previous Fire models and I am very impressed at the picture quality. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp.  The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 2,560 x 1,600 (25% better than the HD version of the 8.9\u201d Fire) with 50% more pixels per inch at 339 ppi than the 8.9\u201d Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:It was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version sitting next to last year's HD version and this year's version of the 7\u201d HDX Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of CNN, FoxNews, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a slight difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My usual test of this feature is cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks and hear the bass), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  To have the sound throw back at you, you need to have a cover on it as the sound reverberates from the back of the Fire off of the cover back to you (hopefully, you followed that).One thing to point out is there is not a default equalizer with this Fire: everything sounds the same.  To get the most out of the bass and treble, as well as to turn down the mid-range, I highly recommend you downloading and installing one of the many free equalizer apps here from the Amazon app store as it makes a huge difference, especially if you are listening with headphones.The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account with the software came with the Fire.  Previously, I had to install and use an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store because like many of you I have more than one email account: Amazon eliminated the need for this aftermarket app because you can now switch back and forth between your various email accounts and it was very easy to setup my particulars.  The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.  The last tab on the top right contains a link to various deals on Amazon you can tap to open (or not) as you see fit.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app  here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There are two cameras on this model - one faces the front or toward the user / reader and one in the back.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.I really don\u2019t like the positioning of the back facing camera \u2013 primarily because if you use the Origami cover purchased here from Amazon (about the only one available as I type this review), the cover hides not only the camera but the LED flash.  That makes the back camera essentially worthless to me.Game Apps:Playing most of the games I play on my tablet is a much better visual experience than the 8.9\u201d HD model.  Now if this device would help me move up faster with Candy Crush I would be even happier!Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  Better yet, it is the \u201cpower fast\u201d charger that charges your Fire faster.  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.  Amazon touts it takes about 5 hours to charge this version of the Fire when the battery is completely empty.  I\u2019ve charged it several times when it was in the 20% - 22% remaining charge, and it took about six hours.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I pressed the button but felt pretty dumb: when the person who answered asked me how can they help, I basically said \"Hi, I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"  They laughed and I promptly let them get back to work answering other \u201cI just wanted to try this out\u201d queries.What I Wish it Had: a screen protector that was ready to go.  With all of the tapping, sliding, etc. on the screen, you can easily scratch the unit.  The screen protectors have been out of stock for a while now and I hope mine gets here soon.Overall, I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be.If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but I would recommend you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the 8.9\u201d Fire HD at $269.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Most Beautiful Screen I've Ever Seen", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae",

To see more videos on this Kindle Fire HDX, visit my YouTube channel:YouTube/JohnnySaigon2013You've already read a few detailed reviews from here, so I'll make this one simple to read: bullet points!PROS:*Beeee-ay-ew-tee-full screen: 8.9 inches at 2560x1600 resolution means the highest pixels per inch(339 PPI) for ANY tablet to date. Compare that with 299 PPI for the new iPad Air. This screen will literally blow you away. Apple is known to have the best phone and tablet screens on the market, and the new iPad Air is leaps and bounds better than the original iPad. However, compared to the Kindle HDX 8.9\", even it has to take a second seat.I read an article where DisplayMate compared this Kindle HDX's screen to that of the Nexus 10 and the new iPad Air:-100% color accuracy means whatever that is displayed is true to form. The best way to compare this is to pick up the Nexus 10(Samsung-made) and any Samsung AMOLED on Vivid settings.-This screen also has the brightest output - 527 cd/m2(or \"nits\"). This means that whether you're using it in pitch black, or on a sunny day in direct sunlight, this screen has enough brightness to excel in any situation. For a comparison, the best computer monitors output in the 400 nits range, and most TVs are in the 300 range.-Viewing angles are also top notch - you will not lose much quality even when you're not looking at it straight on.-Reflectivity is also minor. You bought this Kindle to see what's on the screen, not use it as a mirror. You don't know how important this becomes until you see a crappy screen such as cheap laptops.-Finally, it uses very little power, which means more battery life, and won't heat up and burn your hands.*Awesome stereo speakers. The virtual Dolby surround sound is really effective, and really immersive. You can crank the sound to 11 and it won't distort. By far the best speakers I've heard on any tablet or phone.*Truly lighter than \"Air.\" I hated holding the iPad 3(the most recent iPad I have). It was uncomfortable and wrist-breaking. Even with the iPad Air weight reductions, it still weighs about a pound(16 ounces). The Kindle HDX is 13.2 ounces. I can now finally read and watch videos in bed comfortably. Even holding it one-handed is now a comfortable reality.*Downloading movies, streaming videos, etc. through WiFi is super fast with the built in dual-band, dual-antenna.*This tablet is fast! Having a Snapdragon 800 processor means you'll never have to worry about apps and games slowing down on you. Having 2GB of RAM also means you can multi-task and run multiple apps to your heart's content.*It has never gotten hot or uncomfortable while holding/using it so far, so in totality the form factor and userability are excellent.*This is subjective, but I think at 8.9,\" this is the perfect screen size for a tablet. I have the old Nexus 7, and when compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3(5.5\"), or even my HTC One(4.7\"), there wasn't a big upgrade in screen size for me to use it more than my phones. The iPad, while having a nice screen size at 9.7,\" is too heavy and uncomfortable to use for a long session, even with the improved iPad Air. The Kindle HDX, at 8.9\" and 13.2 ounces, has the perfect combination. If you want something bigger, then just use your laptop!CONS:*There is no Micro-SD slot, so there is no potential of increasing your storage capacity. This is perhaps where the hardest decisions will be. The 16GB version has 10.9GB of useable space left, so it would not make sense if you want to download or store more than a handful of movies. Considering an HD movie can be anywhere from 2-10GB, make sure you select the right capacity for you.*There is no micro HDMI-out like on the older Kindle HD. The new HDX uses a wireless system called Miracast. This is all great, however, it is a new functionality that has not been widely implemented, meaning most likely that the TV you are using now isn't Miracast-enabled. So if you want to mirror your Kindle screen to your TV, you'll need to buy a new TV, or find an app or dongle that would provide an alternative.*The only other thing I can think of for the casual user on the fence is, because the ecosystem is not as robust as Apple iOS and pure Google Anroid, they won't have access to all those apps of the other two ecosystems. The Amazon App Store is growing rapidly, but it is climbing an uphill battle to reach the other two.CONCLUSION:The two most important factors I think people will have to decide from is:1) Do you love and live Amazon enough so that the lack of apps you would get from the iOS and Google app stores won't affect you?2) Are you one of those that uses your tablet as your universal multimedia hub, and want to store all your apps, games, music, photos/videos, and movies in there?I only play other media and games occasionally, so for me the lack of app quantity of Amazon from iOS and pure Android is not a deal breaker for me. It is for a lot of people, so in the end, it might come down to user preference and brand loyalty.Overall, for my needs, which is to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Videos, and surf the Net/read the news apps, this is the perfect tablet for me.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miracast and other misc.", "Author": "AMB", "ReviewID": "R3B8OZYWBFO34Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I love my new Fire HDX (64Gb, wifi only with ads), but all the positives have already been reviewed at length by others, so I will concentrate on what I have not yet seen discussed elsewhere in a lot of detail:1) Display mirroring (with Miracast).  I got the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and finally managed to make it work, no thanks to Netgear who have just lost a customer.  Well, not really since I never bought a Netgear product before and arguably I didn't this time either as I bought it refurbished, but still.  Installation issues notwithstanding, after it started working, it was pretty amazing.  I tested the Miracast functionality successfully with both my Win8 laptop and my Kindle Fire HDX.  Yes, there is a very slight lag, but nothing major and I suspect the technology will only get better what with the rate of the firmware updates being pushed out by Netgear for this product, trying to keep up with their competition which I think will be fierce now that Amazon has put its weight behind the Miracast technology by doing away with the HDMI output port entirely in the Fire HDX models.  Which means that if you are emotionally attached to using an HDMI cable to connect to your external screen or TV, or just do not want to put up with the potential pain in the neck the installation of the PTV3000 may turn out to be (though to be fair, some people had no trouble whatsoever?), you will want to stick with the HD models instead.  If you are excited about Miracast and want a WiDi adapter for your TV, use some caution, because as my review of said item demonstrates, it can be a hassle to setup.A cheaper alternative is the Tronsmart T1000 Mirror2TV Wireless Display HDMI Dongle Support Miracast DLNA EZCAST AirPlay Compatible with Android OS / Apple iOS / Samsung AllShare Cast S3 S4 Note2 Note3 Note10.1 / Google Nexus4 Nexus5 Nexus7 / Amazon Kindle Fire HDX / DELL VENUE 8 PRO which performance is unfortunately not as good as the PTV3000 (noticeable time delays and pixelation when mirroring and requires use of their free proprietary app, EZCast).2) Customer service.  I have never seen any company spend so much time and effort into ensuring customers were happy with their flagship product (the Kindles, I mean.  When it comes to every other product and services, they are just as impersonal and crushing as you would expect).  I have rarely -if ever- had to contact Amazon with any of my Kindle issues before, but I was forced to contact an Amazon representative three times since my HDX arrived and each rep was unbelievably polite, helpful (and downright nice! all three of them!  What?) and went to extraordinary lengths to resolve my issues (minor hardware problems - I'll update this review upon final resolution).[UPDATED:  my issues were resolved very satisfactorily, all it took was the guts to call Amazon support in the first place... All the customer service reps I spoke with -all 6 of them by now!- were helpful, patient, reasonable and even technically competent!?  I don't understand this minor miracle, but it's certainly no coincidence and I was very glad to be able to take advantage of it.  This great level of customer support is available for all your Kindle issues, not just HDX models, by the way].One of my calls was made while testing the Mayday feature and I was stunned by how amazingly good the concept and execution of this idea was!  Kudos to Jeff Bezos, this new feature is brilliant and will gain him major customer loyalty, especially among the older set (this is not meant to be insulting as I am no spring chicken myself).3) Accessories.  This tablet is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, granted, but it is also a fingerprint magnet -especially its display which is a touch screen, of course- and the rubberized back, which was so convenient and comfortable in the 7\" original Fire, seems to have become a sponge for natural skin oils with the 8.9\" HDX model?  Fingerprints are everywhere and stay obstinately attached to every surface, not just the display, and personally I never figured on wiping them off as a full-time occupation.My solution?  DecalGirl skins (check their website for a dazzling number of choices or why not, the original DIY look: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" DecalGirl Skin - 'Create Your Own'):  no, I do not work for them, I just spend a lot of time and as little money as possible trying to get the right accessories for my Kindles.  They are a tad expensive ($20), but they are unbelievably easy to apply, of superior quality, extremely durable, come in a huge variety of designs from colorfully eccentric to classically elegant and DecalGirl often offers up to 25% discounts on their website. They will keep your Kindle looking and feeling like new.Note that most cases easily fit over these skins but remember that if you also want a screen protector (I did!), it should be applied before the skin is applied to the body of the Kindle (front and back).  By the way, covering the front of the Kindle (the bezel around the screen) makes holding your Kindle a lot more comfortable... This is no ad for DecalGirl:  if you prefer one of their competitors (for instance:  Protective Skin Decal Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Tablet (2013) Sticker Skins Books), do your research and go for it, I am merely pointing out that I believe getting a good quality skin for your HDX is more important than buying a case.  Also a lot cheaper than an Origami case, Amazon's preferred solution which at $50+ is just too rich for my tastes (sorry, this bon mot was just too easy)!Speaking of accessories, since I cannot recommend any one case wholeheartedly, I can at least recommend the Targus Mini Stand Designed for Apple iPad, iPad 2, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, Clear (AWE65US).  It's surprisingly practical and elegant for a simple block of acrylic!  Designed for any smartphone or tablet up to 10\", it's perfect if you like watching videos on your HDX from a desk or a table rather than balanced in your lap.4) Downloading videos.  The limitations mentioned in B. Tarbuck's review could be a problem for everyone who purchased the 64Gb model with the new downloading features in mind, which was my case... but a few months of heavy usage later, I can confirm that the points he raises are not necessarily a big deal.- First, you'll want to keep in mind that not all Prime videos are available for download as licensing rights limit what Amazon offers and which videos are Prime and downloadable is liable to change without notice.- Second, there is indeed a 25 downloaded videos maximum at any given time which personally I find is acceptable, even though I would have preferred to have heard about it beforehand rather than discover it afterwards.- Third, the Viewing Period limitation (48 hours or so depending on the video) is a lot easier to swallow when you realize it only starts applying to videos once you start watching them.So the Viewing Period limit is actually quite comparable to the Lending Library's limitations:  you just need to remember that Prime Videos are not available for streaming while you are traveling outside the US which is why you need to download them to your Fire HDX before leaving the US.  Or if you are an overseas customer:  yes, this IS discrimination!  Just kidding, it's due to the same licensing rights limits referred to above which Amazon negotiates with the content owners (Warner, Fox etc.) themselves, ie the same people who insist on different DVD regions etc.[IMPORTANT:  the 'Viewing period' limit actually applies only once you've STARTED watching a video.  As long as you simply keep your downloaded videos on your Kindle Fire for later viewing without starting the playback of the file, the Viewing Period limit is irrelevant.  Now, that's more like it!  :)  ]Personally I invested in the 64Gb model because I am often in the position of traveling overseas for months, with very little personal internet access.  Let's not get into a discussion of what most hotels overseas -ahem UK, I am looking at you here, not that Italy or Germany or Japan have a leg to stand on either- think is 'free internet access' or the availability of English-speaking entertainment media outside the US.  Can you believe that some countries expect you to understand their own non-English language to get your entertainment?!  Just joking:  English is not my native language...  My point stands, however.Therefore purchasing the 64Gb model may be worthwhile if you like to load up your Kindle with lots of videos in preparation for a long overseas trip:  just remember that once you start watching a video, a fairly short Viewing Period time limit starts running - about 48 hours (more or less depending on the movie/show in question).  This is similar to the time limit you run into when downloading Prime Videos to your PC or renting vs. purchasing movies from Amazon, by the way... Please also note that movies and TV shows take up a huge amount of space when downloaded from Amazon, even when you do not choose the HD version, compared to your own personal videos (ripped from your own DVDs, I mean) which usually take up no more than 1 or 2 Gb per movie. Plus, your own videos have no such intrinsic Viewing Period time limit and can be re-watched as often as you want, forever, just like the videos you actually purchase from Amazon.Remember, if you are willing to actually pay money to purchase a video from Amazon, you can then download it to your device at any time (while you are in the US), and keep it on the hard disk of your Kindle Fire -and any other Kindle Fire you own, past and future- forever (or you can re-download it repeatedly).  Which is what Amazon is hoping we'll do, in fact...  That's the whole point of selling the Kindles at near cost, after all.One more relevant item of information when it come to the HDX hard disk:  the micro USB port is not OTG compatible, so you cannot simply use an OTG USB key (like this little beauty for instance: Patriot Stellar Series 64GB USB 3.0 OTG With Up To 140MB/s Transfer For Android Base Tablet/ Smartphone- PSF64GSTROTG) to easily increase the size of your Fire hard disk. Oh well...5) non-Amazon content and apps:  let's just reiterate a few points which most official reviews I have seen rarely make.- you can totally get non-Amazon apps from the Google Play store.  Or any reputable website, as long as you are careful and do a bit/a lot of research first if you don't want to be sorry later.  Download the .apk file (all Android apps are really files with an apk extension), then transfer it to the appropriate folder on your Kindle.  Opening the apk file then installs the app on your Kindle Fire and the app will afterwards appear in your Fire's Apps section. It's that easy!  This simple process is called sideloading and no, it's not difficult or complicated and does not require rooting and does not invalidate your warranty or anything:  the internet is full of simple how-tos on the subject, just begging to be read.  And Amazon is perfectly fine with your sideloading non-Amazon apps, especially free apps.Obviously Amazon will not refer to it or explain how to do it and they will avoid even mentioning it, but Jeff Bezos is well aware that lack of flexibility on this issue would be a deal breaker, even if he'd rather not admit as much officially.  Which is why it's a fairly straightforward process, even though it would have been quite easy for Amazon to prevent us from sideloading non-Amazon apps.- you can easily get non-Amazon ebooks (pdf or epub or any other commonly used ebook format, free or otherwise - B&N; etc.) to your Kindle:  just install the Calibre software on your computer and it will handle all the format converting and transferring to your Kindles, from the oldest Kindle e-reader to the latest HDX.  Plus lots of other neat and amazing features, including tagging or helping with the rental of ebooks from your public library system.  Calibre is free, it's got heaps of documentation and technical help, it's regularly updated and it can and will handle your whole ebook collection beautifully while synchronizing all your e-Readers easily.  It's like iTunes for ebooks!  If iTunes was easy to use, efficient, inclusive of formats and platforms.  And came with helpful free add-ins like Firefox does.  And did not lose your full music library the way iTunes loses mine all the time.- comic books/graphic novels/mangas and magazines in pdf format. This is a seldom mentioned advantage of the 8.9\" HDX:  its larger screen size and higher resolution makes it a great way to read comics in pdf format with the built-in pdf reader!  It's a bit less practical in cbr or cbz format (as opposed to reading comics on a PC where using a free cbr/cbz reader is best), but easily doable and well worth it for facing the hours of tedium that travel often requires.  No need to use a comic book reader app, especially since the best such apps are not free, if your comics are in pdf format!  But if your non pdf comics library is too just too extensive to convert, then you can check out ComiCat which costs $2.99:  it handles most comic formats, organizes your collection nicely on your Kindle HDX and allows easy synchronization with cloud services like Dropbox, which is pretty nifty - compared to having to copy your comics files to your HDX yourself.- other external content (music, photos, audiobooks and videos):  nothing is to stop you from ripping your favorite DVDs and CDs (reliable free and paying tools are all around you) and transferring them to your Kindle Fire.  It's even easier with an HDX than ever before!I've been doing all of the above since the Kindle Fire 1st gen all the way to the HDX without any trouble via the USB port of my computer:  a simple USB to micro USB cable -the same type of cable you use to recharge your Kindle- and you're all set!  Or send your ebooks attached to an email to your Kindle's email address:  Amazon Help pages are full of detailed descriptions about it... this email method incidentally lets you share your non-DRM ebooks with your friends and family simply by emailing them with your ebook.  Assuming their own Kindles have been set up to accept documents from your email address - this last requirement is a security measure to avoid spam.  Personally, I use this nifty 'sending books via email to a Kindle device' functionality to guilt my relatives into reading edifying books I think they would benefit from (passive-aggressive stuff about healthy diet, exercise and the like... ) and it helps with their insomnia issues, if nothing else!Google will lead you to numerous helpful how-tos explaining which folder you should copy your video/audio files to on your Kindle Fire and which free apps to use if for some reason you do not want/cannot use the default app.  Videos and Photos will show up in your gallery under your Photos section and your uploaded music and audiobooks, naturally enough, in your Music section.  If your files are in a format your Kindle Fire cannot open and you don't want the headache of having to convert your files, just use one of several apps that open most files:  personally, I use ES File Explorer to navigate the hard disk of my Fire and open all my non-Amazon content.  You can also check out MoboPlayer which plays any video file format, not just only mp4 files like the Fire default video viewer app.  These two apps are both available free on the Amazon app store and are very popular for good reasons.Again:  all of the above in point 5 works for all Fire models, not just the HDX.6) On a different, UNRELATED topic:  if for some reason you want to root your Amazon Fire in order to run the non-Amazon version of Android and be able to control the look and feel and functionality of your tablet, please be aware that you will lose all Prime membership advantages on this Fire tablet (though not on your computer or any other Fire you may own).  Such as free Instant Prime Videos and the Lending Library. And Mayday functionality, also a bonus of the FireOS.I just want to emphasize the fact that sideloading has nothing to do with rooting:  the amount of ignorance and misinformation floating about this topic is simply astonishing.  And by the way, I really don't recommend rooting a Kindle Fire, though yes, technically speaking, it is doable.  By anyone with nerves of steel.  And at least several hours of free, preferably uninterrupted time for in-depth research beforehand...  Just be prepared to take responsibility for the waste of hundreds of your dollars if you do brick your Kindle device.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed in the 8.9\" HDX vs the 8.9\" HD", "Author": "Harold W. George", "ReviewID": "R1EQJON9NR9QR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD for a year, having gotten it last Christmas (2012).  I have also been an Amazon Prime customer for some time. So I was pretty excited when I saw the hype for the new HDX.  This seemed like it would be a great upgrade.  It seemed like it had several things I wanted in the HD, like all my icons on one page, a rear facing camera, and faster Wi-Fi and internet, and a lighter, thinner package.  Since I already had the HD, this should be a pretty seamless upgrade.Well that's not how things went for me.  First of all taking the HDX out of the box, it felt really cheap and flimsy compared to my HD.  Even though both tablets are 8.9\", the HDX has a slightly smaller display.  It actually seemed like a tablet you might buy your 10 year old.  I already was having my doubts, but let's fire it up and give it a try.I started it up and went through all the registration hoops, and then had to go to the cloud to get all of my apps loaded onto the HDX.  Well, immediately, I noticed that apps I had purchased were missing.  Most notably was Weatherbug, which is my main weather app on the HD.  I went to the app store, and it's not there, either.  Ditto a calendar, contact list and calculator I have on the HD.  Apparently these are not compatible with the HDX.There are some items on the HDX that are not on the HD, as well, but for someone that has already set up all their apps, this is disappointing.  Most of the games, candy crush, deer hunter, pipes, etc., that I play came over, but you lose the levels you have achieved playing them on the HD.  That was a big disappointment.The other thing missing from the HDX is an HDMI port to connect the tablet to your TV.  The HDX uses some kind of sync technology, but it would not work with any of the 4 TVs, two of which are HD flat screen, in my house.  So there is no way I can watch videos or movies on my TV.  That was the real deal breaker.In addition, Amazon touts a much better display, faster Wi-Fi and faster browsing.  I didn't see it.  comparing the 2 tablets side by side, I noticed no difference in speed, and couldn't discern a difference in the screen quality.  They are both very good.  When I turned both tablets on from a cold start, the HD actually booted up and was ready to go slightly faster than the HDX,  The browser interface is different and much less intuitive in the HDX than in the HD.If you like to read books, which my wife and I do a lot of, you will also be disappointed in the ability to control font size in the HDX.  In the HD I have the font set to 7.  There is no comparable setting in the HDX.  You get small, bigger, bigger yet, and HUGE.  None of those suited me like the settings on the HD, which are easily adjusted.If you already have an HD and are thinking about an upgrade, I would suggest you not waste the money.  You are not gaining much with the HDX (the rear camera, mostly), and are giving up a lot.  If you haven't purchased a tablet yet and are considering the Kindle Fire, I think I would still buy the HD, the prices have dropped to $229 for the 8.9\", which I feel is a great value.If you find you must buy the 8.9\" HDX, definitely stay away from the Origami cover.  It's expensive and it's a piece of junk.  I returned it along with the HDX, and would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE:I have since returned both the HDX and the Origami case.  Seeing how this was a Christmas present to me from my wife, we are both disappointed.  I certainly hope Amazon rethinks the HDX and it's marketing.  For now, my old 8.9\" HD workhorse is still going strong!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2YPITHVTYLCZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9\" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7\" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9\" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9\" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" vs. 9.4\" x 6.4\" x 0.35\"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9\" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7\", and the Nexus is 10\". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:\"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy.\"It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4\" x 6.6\" x 0.29\" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful tablet!", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R23L7BXQOFIB6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my HDX 8.9\" on the day it was released and have been enjoying it since then. Here are some of my impressions that may help you decide whether or not to buy one for yourself.1. Very nice to hold. This tablet is amazingly lightweight and thin. The HDX weight is about 1/3 less than the iPad Air! It is quite thin, and in a very good way. The back is nicely rubberized for a good grip, unlike some cell phones that are too thin and slippery, so much so that they feel fragile and are difficult to manipulate without a good case. The HDX is very, very comfortable to hold and manage.2. AMAZING screen. The screen on the HDX is the best I've ever seen. \"Beyond HD\" is not an empty marketing phrase. This thing surprised me with its color, clarity, and brightness. It still reflects noticeably, though.3. Easy to navigate. I can quickly and easily switch among reading, watching videos, shopping, and more. I happen to like the carousel system, because it lets me return effortlessly to any of the last few things I looked at. With the instant response of the touchscreen of the HDX, I can find books faster than on my Paperwhite.4. App selection. Most of the apps I want are available for my HDX. Dropbox and almost anything Google, including YouTube, are what I miss the most. But YouTube works just fine on the Silk Browser. And there are plenty of news apps, games, alarm clocks, The most annoying aspect of apps for Fire is the prevalence of 3rd-party apps that do a poor imitation of the original. There are scads of apps that try to connect you with Google, YouTube, etc. but do so poorly.5. Seamlessly integrated with all things Amazon. I buy the vast majority of books and movies from Amazon, and my HDX provides an unbeatable way to enjoy them. I have come to prefer watching movies and reading books on my HDX over and above anything else I have, including a nice large HD television with sound bar and fancy ultrabook with >HD resolution. Plus, I can shop from my favorite retailer. The HDX makes it easy and enjoyable to watch movies and TV shows, read books, shop, listen to music, go through my email, catch up on the news, and more. Our family has owned the 1st and 3rd generation iPads and numerous smartphones including the latest iPhones. When you consider CONTENT, other tablets cannot match the ease and seamless integration of the HDX.6. Mayday. I've only used it once, but I was pleasantly surprised. I honestly was not expecting Mayday to live up to the hype Amazon is putting out there, but my experience was just like the commercials! Hardly any wait and a prompt answer to my question.  Amazing!You may have recognized in the past that great hardware is nothing without great software. Well, in 2013, you might say that great hardware and software are nothing without great content. And now you can get all 3 from Amazon!!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The good the bad and the ugly - Missing items like \"Officesuite\"", "Author": "Artist formerly known as Amazon Customer \"ghe...", "ReviewID": "R2Y13IX845STIG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I am exactly the audience that Amazon aims at with the Kindle.  I am complexity immersed in the Amazon universe as a Prime member for the last 7-8 years (and customer long before that) all of my music is on the cloud player and a huge consumer of Kindle books and prime videos. Amazon makes it easy by offering more than competitive pricing including freebies and really low cost books, music and apps. You don't get that with iTunes and the App store.  I used to buy a lot from the Apple store but since I discovered how much more I always had to pay for everything I switched and haven't been back.This is my sixth Kindle starting with a Kindle 2, Kindle 3, original Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9. So the day the HDX's were announced I ordered the 8.9.  I am a gadget freak so in addition to the multiple computers I own, I also own a New Nexus 7, and an Asus Vivotab Smart. I have also played a bunch with various iPads.The good:I can honestly and truly say this is the fastest, smoothest most appealing tablet by far (in terms of hardware)that I have ever held in my had.  The screen is simply stunning, my Google Nexus 7 has a gorgeous screen and is the same resolution as the 7\" HDX.  but in spite of the similar dpi (326 vs 339) the screen on the HDX in my opinion is more vibrant, the colors just pop and at times it looks almost 3D.  One thing I haven't seen in any of the reviews is all that much about the sound. It is truly AMAZING sound for a tablet and frankly is better than my HP Envy with Beats Audio.  I watched Galaxy Quest on Thursday night.  It is one of my favorite movies is almost mesmerizing on this tablet.  I keep hearing about \"virtual surround\" on devices with two speakers.  I have never really experienced it.  But watching this movie I could hear Foley sound behind me!  Music is sharp and clear and not at all tinny like an iPad.  Web browsing is incredible, it is fast and smooth and easy to use. The enhancements to the interface and browser functionality work really well. I can honestly say this is the first tablet I have seen that I can really use as more than a casual browser.  I much prefer a PC most of the time but I am confident I can use this on the road.  With a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I have full function.  Screen sensitivity is excellent and the on board keyboard is terrific but for these older hands separate devices are needed for real work.  (which makes my \"ugly\" part even more frustrating.Mayday is as good as advertised.The Bad:I have found several apps that don't seem to work on this including Madden 2014 Football.  I am sure they will be fixed in a matter of days but it is an irritation because I want to play!Speaking of play, it is really irritating that Amazon and Google continue to have an impasse on allowing downloads from the Google Play store. It may be true that Android is so customized that many apps won't work properly.  But many do if you know how to side load which isn't true for most users.  But what it does do is give people a lot of ammunition to the \"The Kindle is just a machine for Amazon sales\" argument.  Virtually every review I see says the Kindle family is only useful for people that are married to Amazon already.  Virtually every time I am in a retail store like Best Buy that has Kindles and other tablets I hear the store personnel steering away from Kindle for that reason. It is a very short sided policy on the part of Amazon.  Yes you bind your already loyal customers more closely to you but a more open policy would sell far more tablets and bring in many more new customers. The relatively small amount of sales lost to Google Play would be way overcompensated by the number of new customers Amazon would gain.  And it would take away the biggest criticism of Kindle.  I know that Amazon is providing a lot of encouragement to developers to provide apps for the Kindle store. One of those developers should be Google!Make sure if you plan on using the new Amazon Prime movie download service that you get at least the 32 Gig. HDX and preferably the 64.  The average 2 hour movie in 1080p is almost 10 gig of space, which is roughly twice what it would be on a PC.The Ugly:Missing promised items like OfficeSuite? One of the reasons I was really excited was that an office suite was supposed to be available on this and available for the previous Kindle Fire devices I already own at a fee.  There are a number of \"Office\" apps in the store, most of which are mediocre at best.An \"office suite\"  includes at a minimum a word processor, some kind of spreadsheet and a presentation editor.  When I gave up searching and contacted Mayday I was told that no I wouldn't find an app but if I had a document on the device I could open it.  She couldn't tell me what file formats it would open, like if it would open spreadsheets or presentations.That is not considered an office suite, that is a document viewer.  I do not see any way to create documents or even edit existing documents. At this point all major tablet vendors bundle at least basic Office capability. MS Surface and other Windows tablets offer MS Office 2013,  Apple offers iWorks suite which appears to be really nice.  I am using QuickOffice on my Nexus 7 which is of course written by Google and free for Nexus devices and a part of Android 4.4 KitKat.  Not providing an office suite when everybody else is and then trying to promote your device as being work and business friendly is not a good thing.  Saying you have an office suite when all you have is a viewer is false advertising and frankly shakes my loyalty to Amazon badly.Update:Actually when I copy something over from my PC and open it there is an \"OfficeSuite\" that shows up long enough to view the item and now yes it does open docx, xlsx and pptx files in addition to pdf. And it does allow for at least some rudimentary editing.  From the icon and capabilities it appears to be OfficeSuite Viewer from Mobile Systems Inc. The same app is available for free on Google Play and the Amazon store for free.But there is NO ability to create new documents and the application does not appear as available anywhere on the Kindle.  The average user isn't going to know how to find the viewer the way you and I just did.  There is an OfficeSuite Pro that I was not prompted to download that costs $4.99.What is included does not in any way constitute an \"included Officesuite\" any way you would care to define it.I am not an average user.  I support enterprise middleware and MS SQL systems for a major corporation and have been a systems professional for over 20 years.  If I have troubles what  kinds of problems will the average user have?", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mirroring is great! Mayday is unbelievable!", "Author": "kdsm", "ReviewID": "RVW91PO437UBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for my wife. She already had a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD and was in love with it. She uses the oldone for reading books (works great),e-mail,and her jigsaw puzzles which she is fascinated with. She thought it couldn't get anybetter. I am a retired electronics guy and was blown away by the specifications of the new HDX with its fast quad core processorand its graphics coprocessor. I was particularly drawn to the MIRACAST capability that was mentioned. This is a wireless way tosend the screen content of the Kindle to a HDMI equipped T.V.There isn't much written about the MIRACAST feature, but I found out that NETGEAR makes a streaming video device called thePush2TV (PTV3000) which I also bought from Amazon at the same time. It arrived before the Kindle Fire HDX.I was so proud of myself for finding and downloading the \"firmware\" update for the Push2TV and I was ready for the Kindle to arrive. When the KIndle arrived it was cold from the outside and I decided to let it warm  to room temperature and wait for wifeyto come home from work.Wifey arrives and we began the process of trying to connect to the Push2TV device. I followed the directions to the letter that was a BIG mistake! I tapped the MAYDAY button (unbelievable genius that) and was connected to a very pleasant young ladywho knew less about \"mirroring\" than I did but she REALLY tried. Unfortunately that connection was cut off. I tapped the MAYDAYbutton again and was again connected to a pleasant lady who couldn't help me and was again disconnected. I think the disconnections were due to the fact that the MAYDAY operators took control of my Kindle and accidentally disconnected the WiFilink. I was getting frustrated at this point and I was also very disappointed, The mirroring was a big reason for my HDX purchase.I tapped the MAYDAY button for the third time (wifey says I'm stubborn, I prefer tenacious) and again spoke to a very pleasantyoung lady who could not have been any nicer. She and I could not resolve the problem either but she set me up to receive a call from an Amazon help operator. The call arrived within seconds and again I'm speaking to a really nice young lady (do you see a pattern here?). This lady's name was Charlie and she couldn't help me either but promised to research the problem andconnect me with an I.T. deity which I requested for after Thanksgiving because it was already after 10:00 p.m. my time.Here comes all the good stuff. Even though it was late, I was determined to make this thing work I'm retired and can work all night if I want to. I started at the beginning! This time I DIDN'T follow directions about pushing the button on the side of the Push2TV box! I did push the reset button with a paper clip on the Push2TV unit. I observed my T.V. screen and noticed that the versionnumber on my Push2TV was 2.4.3 this is really important! I did NOT need to upload new firmware. The firmware in my unit as shipped was NEWER than on the NETGEAR website which was 2.4.26! In the end all you have to do is connect the Push2TV toyour T.V. the turn on mirroring in the Kindle and your done.Mirroring is beyond belief. The picture on the T.V. is stunning.

I returned that one, because the bezel around the screen, invaded the screen to much to make the device prove useful when reading magazines, and for viewing some webpages.Also, I have owned pretty much every tablet made including, the ipad 1 & 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab (orginial), Kindle Fire HD 7\", Kindle Paperwhite, Microsoft Surface Pro, and most recently the Dell Venue Pro 8.I feel qualified to speak to the usability of this tablet in comparison to the others and in its own right. What I will not do in my review is review the technical aspects of the HDX, as you can read them on the product page.1. First Impressions:This device is solidly built, and it light as a feather. It is really a shame to put a case on this device as anything that makes this baby heavier is a shame. For the women out there that may be wondering, if you threw this in your handbag, your arm would not fall off, provided you have it stowed in a sleeve case or very light weight case. The speakers are placed at the top of the device and have a good output of sound at low and high volume. If you are using the device flat on a table it can muffle the sounds a bit.2. Screen:The screen is perfect. No blue haze, or abnoramalities whatsoever. The brightness of the screen is wonderful, and while I have not used the device outside, I have used it sitting near a window with the sun streaming in and I had no problems seeing the screen.3. Ecosystem (OS)It should not be a surprise to anyone that this device points to Amazon's ecosystem. People that knock this tablet for this seem to be off base. If you want a google tablet with no restictions, then buy a Nexus or some other type of tablet. Amazon is not going to build a table that points to another company ecosystem, anymore than Apple would allow you to interact with Google directly. Lowering the rating of the HDX for this reason is unwarranted.Using the Kindle OS is simple, and the onscreen hints help for first time users. If you are coming from a previous generation Kindle you should be able to navigate without much trouble with a few small differences. I also use Amazon's Cloud service for photos and docs, and you probably should also. Installing the Cloud Photo app on your cell phone will allow any picture you take to upload to the cloud and once you register your HDX, they will automatically populate. Such an awesome and thoughtful feature. The Cloud Doc feature works the same, install on your PC or Mac and any document you drag into the doc folder will automatically show up on your HDX4. Music Player:To my surprise, the HDX will show the lyrics to certain songs that have the Xray enabled. This is an awesome feature if you are someone that likes to know the words to songs, or if you are like me, a singer, and need to actually KNOW the lyrics to some songs. If you also have songs in Amazon's Cloud Music Player these will automatically populate on your Kindle when you register is, and if the lyrics are available they automatically show. You can also place your music directly on your Kindle via usb as well from your PC or MAC if you want.5. Kindle Book ReaderI read entire book on my HDX just to make sure that I did not have eye strain or any other issues before deciding to rate this tablet. Amazon for me has always been about books first and of course my HDX excels here as well. I read well into the night and all the next day with no eye fatigue, or issues.6. Video/Prime SubscriptionOk, people here are getting upset about the prime subscription. For the $79 bucks a year you get free 2 day shipping on most anything in the Amazon market place and a thousands of free movies, of which some are downloadable, 1 free book you can borrow each month, and now a free book that is new to the Kindle store to preview. That's a lot of stuff to consider, and yes there are improvements to be made, such as choosing a movie from the Prime Movies to Download category showed movies that I could not download along side the downloadable ones (so why the category?) but overall, its not a deal breaker. You have a month to decide either way.The videos are beautiful, with wonderful color and sound. Not much to say here. This was another expected point.7. ProductivityI wanted to see if the tablet could really function as quasi laptop for when I was out of the office and still needed to stay in touch with work. I added my Microsoft Exchange Account (along with my personal email accounts) and was surprised to see that my work email was able to sync easily along with my Exchange Calendar. All my contacts were added to the HDX as well. The true test came when I needed to open a spreadsheet emailed to me, which I was able to do. The HDX comes with a program that allows you to view office documents, to edit requires you to purchase the full version. I own my own business, so being out of the loop is never really an option, and I am always looking for devices to allow me some acces to work without carrying 3 or 4 different devices.8. PrintingI was able to print to my HP Laserjet printer, the HDX required me to download a HP Printer App, which allowed me to print an email just fine. You are supposed to be able to print emails and docs. I would like to be able to print from the Silk Browser as well, but I'm not sure that this device allows that. Maybe I'm wrong. Somebody please correct me if I am.9. Mayday Button:This may seem gimmicky, until you actually need help, which I did. I purchased another HDX for my husband, and while setting up his, all the books and music and newsstand items synced, but not the apps. Odd to say the least! I pushed the Mayday Button and within seconds I was connected to a nice lady who tried to help me, but was unable to fix my problem. She transfered me to another woman, who I could not see as she was with Kindle Second Level Support, but who I was able to speak to online. She needed to call me back becuause I had to reset the HDX, which she did right away, and helped me solve my issue. Which by the way was to deregister and then re-register the device and everything was able to sync perfectly.10. Magazine Reading:As I stated earlier reading a magazine on the 7\" HDX is just too small to see the pictures and text completely. The 8.9\" solves that problem, opening up a whole new world for me. I subscribe to several boating magazines, where there are a lot of pictures of beautiful boats that I want to see. Also, utilizing the 'reading view' allows you to pull the article you are reading into one cohesive reading screen. Great!11. BrowsingSilk is fast and easy to use. Not sure why people do not like it. Not much to say here.12. BluetoothI was able to pair the HDX to a Bose Speaker easily and an external keyboard within seconds. Again, not much to say here, bluetooth works as expected.In conclusion, I hoped I have answered any questions you may have from the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" I cannot really speak to gaming, as I do not use any gaming apps, but take it from somebody that loves trying out new tablet, this one is definately one I'd recommend to someone that loves to read, watch movies, read a few emails, and listen to their favorite music. This a consumption device, and all roads lead you to being able to read, watch, listen or browse easily and quickly.**Update 12/21/2013**I thought I'd update you on how my and my husband's experience has been with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.My husband has an Ipad2 which he uses daily. I have noticed that he uses the Kindle Fire a lot more everyday. I asked him about his experience and he told me that the Kindle Fire is much lighter and the screen resolution is better. The only thing that stops him for using it fully, it that he has some apps he paid for on the Ipad that he does not want to pay for again. He is a bit of a technophobe, and he has also found that navigating the Kindle is pretty easy.We also purchased the device with special offers and he really likes it. He likes getting the special deals on the lock screen, and even the recommendations from the Carousel.He is a big Netflix, Slingbox, HBOGO user, and he finds that the Kindle Fire handles all of these apps well.My experience is really surprising for me, as I find myself using my Kindle Fire HDX for work a lot more. I can easily look up information on our company website when I am away from my office, and even respond to emails easily. I am having a bit a trouble transferring documents to my Kindle via usb for some reason. PDFs and word docs transfer easily, but for some reason excel files will not. Not sure why I keep getting an error. Beware though, it does take a few minutes for docs transferred via usb to show up on the Kindle for some reason.Working with the docs with the Office Suite App is pretty easy too!Revision 1/4/2014There seems to be some problem with my Fire HDX hanging a lot. I am getting a message saying that I do not have a wireless connection, when clearly I have full bars. I have made sure there is no issue with my WI-FI - none of my other devices are losing a signal. The only fix is to disconnect from the network and reconnect and then I can continue with what I was doing.I also have had an issue playing videos. Both on Prime, and on the A&E; App. At first I thought it was the app, so I closed it an reopened, still was unable to play videos. Next I tried to watch a Amazon video and was unable to even pull up the first screen that pops up when you press video. I had to turn my Fire on and off before I was able to play any videos. I do not that sometimes these devices need to be turned off and on to 'clear' or reset them, but with these two issues, I'm getting a little concerned. The WI-FI issue is starting to be a hourly occurance. I am going to have to press Mayday to find out what is going on. I will have to lower my review by one star. This whole device is dependent on the wireless connection. If that does not work well, then it's just a nice looking paperweight.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Let's take a look....", "Author": "ND Mike \"rabid1\"", "ReviewID": "RB19URRPGZ104", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first. I have been one of the most outspoken people against Kindle tablets. The lack of hardware options and the proprietary interface always were a big minus to me. That is why writing this review is painful in soooo many ways.As a big supporter and developer for the lesser brand and generic tablets I have owned around 50 tablets in the last 3 years. I always look at hardware potential first, OS functionality second because that can be fixed. That is also why I decided to check out the Fire HDX 8.9. The hardware specs made it difficult to believe it can't deliver. It does indeed deliver.While benchmarks can often be misleading in real world application but they still give a good performance comparison and an idea of what to expect. In Quadrant it hits with a blazing 19,546 and in Antutu it jumps in at 31,765. To put this into perspective the Galaxy Note * get's about 18,000 in Antutu.The tablet is thin and light to the point of thinking I got an empty shell, but it still manages to feel solid. I have an Afunta 8 inch that while a little heavier still feels like it is going to break in your hands. As thin as the HDX is there is no flex to the case.When I booted the HDX the display is obviously the first thing I noticed. (OK the boot speed surprised me first) It is really crisp and bright and the colors are crisp. Even when set at the lowest brightness movies are still entirely watchable. The touchscreen itself is very responsive, a little sensitive so it took a a bit of getting used to. But having big fingers isn't the tablet fault.Both the N and A wifi are strong and solid. The 5GHZ connection is the best of the 3 tablets I have that use it. The 32GB HP Touchpad is the closest. I can hold -55dbm all the way out to the curb. With Netflix set to the highest quality it needs no refresh time when the movie starts.The speaker quality is easily the best I have experienced. Not just volume but actual sound quality.The rear camera with flash always sounds great. I have several tablets with this feature and up until I bought the Sero 7 Pro it has always been short of useless. The HDX exceeds the 7 Pro. The pictures taken with flash off the HDX look like they came off a camera, not a tablet with a camera on it.As for the things the HDX is missing. HDMI out, MicroSD, I can't knock off points for thing that you should know about before you buy. Lack of research on the part of the buyer isn't the manufacturers fault. Just like knocking a tablet for not having Google Play when it isn't a Google certified device.  You don't buy a chain saw to hammer nails do you?As for apps it is simple enough to side load apps onto the HDX.I really was planning on writing a scathing review thus justifying my dislike for proprietary tablets. But as a pure tablet the Kindle Fire HDX is amazing. There are tablets within the price point that may have more features, but none can do what the HDX does as well as the HDX. That goes for much more expensive tablets as well. Time will tell if there will be a lot of independent development on the HDX but I would guess the hardware will draw developers like candy draws a fat kid.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "one more", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "RLED3IV8E8HNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been buying kindles since the 1st generation, so I will leave the very wordy reviews to others and simply tell you, this is the fastest smoothest kindle so far.

The Kindle reset on it's own once or twice within a span of twenty minutes, but it eventually loaded after a few minutes. Then the device reset itself after I tried to start up a new app for my e-mail, it took 20 minutes with the Kindle resetting over and over before it came back on. I contacted customer service and I was told that my problem would have to be forwarded to the Kindle developers and I probably wouldn't hear back for a few business days.So far my Kindle is still running through the power cycle, over and over, but if I don't get this issue resolved and receive a new Kindle within the next week I will be demanding a refund.I did enjoy the high-def quality of the screen and how it played videos. I just wish Amazon got rid of all the bugs before putting stock into this new device. I also happened to order the Origami case and I am very happy with this accessory.I really hope this was a fluke and I happened to receive the one Kindle in the whole bunch that didn't work. I'll update my review if I happen to receive a new Kindle.UPDATE:Earlier this week I received a brand new replacement Kindle. Fortunately it seems that the first Kindle Fire HDX that I received just happened to be a, one in a million, defective device. I wanted to wait a few days before I reviewed this item for the second time. I did this so I could see if my new Kindle had the same problems as the old one and I wanted to be able to play with and try to experiment with all the bells and whistles.Display: The display is crisp and clear, with no blue bleeding around the border. This was a problem that some people reported, but that isn't the case with mine.Ease of Use: The Kindle Fire HDX is very simple and easy to use. I have yet to use the Mayday button, but the mere fact that it is there makes all the difference.Apps: There are a lot of apps available for the Kindle and I have downloaded most of the same games and apps that I use on my phone. There are a few apps that are not availble for the Kindle, but they are few and far between.Video: I have used my Amazon Prime membership to watch several free movies and tv shows on the Kindle and I am very impressed with the resolution and playback.Books: I really enjoy using the Kindle to read books. I was dead set against using an e-reader, but my growing hardback and paperback collection and the slowly dwindling space in which to put my books, has made me rethink purchasing a Kindle. I like how the kindle allows me to place bookmarks, toggle text size and most importantly the price of each Kindle version of books I read.The only real issue I had with Amazon, was how long it took them to send me a replacement.

Hohnstein \"Mugwump\"", "ReviewID": "R3EDRP3T5V2YXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lovely device! First thing I noticed was the weight -- rather, the \"lack of\" weight. I hoisted the HDX in one hand and my \"old\" Kindle Fire HD in the other, and it was the proverbial night-and-day moment. The fact it's slightly smaller and thinner as well is great, but holding it for a long time, say reading in bed, the older one made my arthritic hands carp and grumble every time. This one does not.Although I had specified the \"no-offers\" option in my order (which is what I got, let me add) all of a sudden last night at around 10:30 PM I suddenly started getting \"offers,\" much to my shock. However, that turned into an enjoyable experience: I got to test, firsthand, the new Mayday button. I spent perhaps five minutes chatting with a friendly girl named Deborah who, once she verified my claim, took over my Kindle and fixed my problem. This, admittedly, was not an earth-shaking concern, but I was very impressed with how easy it was to use this new service as well as its novelty. iPod, eat your heart out!Two small complaints, neither of which impel me to change my rating of the device from five to four stars: a few of the apps I BOUGHT for the Kindle Fire HD apparently will not work on the new one; and I miss the variety of \"wallpaper\" available on my earlier one, being left with this slightly odd copper and blue whatever-it-is that appears each time the Kindle opens. I would enjoy having the ability to change the wallpaper at will as I do other Android devices, such as my LG cell.Admittedly, I've used it for only a few days. But so far, I am greatly impressed with its quality in all respects. Stunning screen quality, excellent Dolby sound, very quick responses to moving from, say, email to one's current book . . .

Ferrell \"virtualgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R26J06WBJ4XIPE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first say I really wanted to be a Kindle Fire HDX fan. I recently ditched an iPad 4 in favor of the Kindle but found ultimately that the device just doesn't perform. Upon receiving the Kindle I connected to my lab network powered by an Ubiquiti Unifi AP-LR which provides 802.11n MIMO. I went about downloading my cloud stored apps and books but found some interesting symptoms.When downloading my Kindle would sometimes timeout after prolonged periods of waiting with no start of the download, other times with apps like Olive Tree's Bible Study I would download one of the Bibles and the download would stall and timeout at different points maybe after 1MB or even nearly complete. When surfing my page load times were unbearable. It wasn't just that my pages loaded slowly but my pages wouldn't start to load until several seconds after hitting a link or enter at best. Sometimes they would never load. I tried restarting the Kindle, resetting the Kindle, completely erasing the Kindle, de-registering and registering the Kindle again. I changed my wireless security, I changed from HT20 to HT40, I assigned static IPs vs. DHCP, I used public DNS versus my internal DNS server. I turned every single device off in the house, disabled Amazon's page surfing booster and still didn't see a performance improvement. I downloaded a Wifi Analyzer and watched the Kindle drop the signal strength every few seconds, I pinged internal servers and saw fairly typical responses but if I pinged an external server I saw between 10-15% packet losses. Other devices on the network did not experience the same performance and even other Android devices running the same analyzer never saw the same signal drop at all.I called Kindle customer service who asked me to do all I had already done and then went on to ask that I reset the router I use to power over 40 different devices including our virtual machines in a lab environment. When I explained to them why I couldn't they told me it was because I had too many \"people\" on my network that my Kindle didn't work as fast despite no other machines experiencing the same. I eventually conceded and reset the router, no difference. I open the Kindle IP up to the internet completely unprotected by the firewall and still got no different response. The last recommended step per Amazon was to drive to an Internet cafe and try their internet. Despite how ridiculous that sounded I did go to another location and get on their wireless connection with the same results. I exchanged the Kindle for another Kindle thinking I had a defective unit. The second Kindle did have marginally better performance but still the same symptoms so today I forfeited and got a RMA to go back to the iPad.As a device the interface is great, I didn't have an issue with reading a book or using an application if it worked but it seldom worked and since tablets are primarily internet connected devices it just isn't anything above one star without functioning wireless. Prior to boxing it up the Kindle started to not show a MAC address or valid wireless option and would take several restarts to get the wireless connection to appear again. I may have left out one of the resolutions I tried but I believe I went well beyond what a typical consumer would do anyway to troubleshoot a device.If Amazon's engineers need it, I finally ended up on channel 1 of HT40 for the best performance which is to say I was able to surf with still long delays or no page load at all unless I sent the request a second time. I think it's fairly common but the initial ping was often times 4 to 5x longer then the subsequent replies and the software my wireless APs run showed the Kindle as going in and out of powersave mode from second to second. I booted up Wireshark and did notice that when pinging an address from the time I started the command using Fing on the Kindle to the time it showed up on my network was near equivalent to the maximum ping response time minus the average ping response time. I have a feel that the power save features of the wireless chipset may give an additional hour or so of run time but create a performance issue and since it isn't user selectable it's a pain.Thanks again Amazon, better luck on the next release.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fan, Amazon Fan, but HDX experience not the best", "Author": "lovelovelove", "ReviewID": "RK7R9WMNAOKLJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have two 32GB Kindle Fire HD's, one of which I bought as refurbished for a lower price than retail.  Wanted the new HDX too - it was shiny and seemingly fabulous.  Advertising promises \"faster\" and better display, and \"mayday.\", etc.  HAD to have it!  Got it about 40 days ago - had issues with it right away:  No volume on device once any earbuds are removed and had to hard start it to get sound back (happened often). Videos which were deleted were still taking up storage on the device even though I couldn't actually access the deleted video any longer.  Had to force stop apps and restart; device frozen/unresponsive.  Had to do factory reset.  Kept calling Mayday, which is a great concept except that when you have to power down to fix something Mayday disconnects.  Problems with Wifi (would drop or show as only 1 bar while my Kindle Fire HD had full wifi bars and never drops). Videos slower to download than on my HD.  I expected the HDX would be \"better\" based on the advertising; I think it would be if everything works as promised.  Finally, when I had no volume again and it had crashed the night before, I called Amazon and requested a replacement.  Today, received a REFURBISHED HDX to replace the 40-day old HDX.  Not acceptable Amazon!  I paid for a NEW HDX.  Refurbished can be a good option when you pay the cost of a refurbished device.  I am returning the replacement (the refurbished HDX) and am also returning the HDX I bought 40 days ago.  Amazon originally stated because I am past the 30 days they would only refund 80% of HDX cost, not 100%.  Guess I should not have been patient in trying to make the HDX work - should have returned it immediately.  Amazon has agreed now to refund 100% once they receive the returned items.  All of my frustration could be avoided if they would have sent me a NEW replacement, not refurbished (AND offered to do it before the 30 days expired when I was calling \"Mayday\" every few days).  Not cool, Amazon!  The lesson I learned:  If your HDX doesn't work perfectly immediately, send it back, don't be patient.  I also learned that Amazon customer service is not as terrific as I had once thought they were.Updated comment:  When I finally received my refund,  it wasn't the full amount expected.  Amazon imposed a restocking fee.  I had to call them, explain my situation again and  request the restocking fee be refunded.I did end up ordering a new HDX and paid in full for it.  It works great and I'm happy with it.  However, note that when the first HDX was purchased, I bought it on an installment plan being offered at the time.  Two weeks ago they charged me the second installment on the returned (first) HDX.  I had to call Amazon, explain the situation again and they are \"working on reversing\" that installment.

Here is my take on this, my second Kindle Fire. I've been waiting on a tablet with decent resolution that will play HD video smoothly... I tried a few different tablets for this and I was dissatisfied with the video display or the smoothness of the rendering.My search is over. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is a marvel. The color reproduction is fantastic - truly, you have to see this with your own eyes to really appreciate how stunning this display looks. HD video streamed from Amazon Prime is so good I almost prefer watching on this screen over my TV. My laptop looks like a piece of junk next to this... not to mention the sound! WOW! It's loud, clear, without being overly tinny. Again, blows all three of my laptops out of the water. My wife and I just watched an episode of Firefly streamed from Prime (yes!) with it sitting on a stool while we were on a couch and it both sounded and looked great!The camera is far better than I expected - even the forward facing camera is of solid quality. But, considering this isn't why I bought the tablet, I haven't really run the camera through any real paces.Bluetooth connection is solid. I've connected my headphones and a song sheet pedal (to switch between pages on chord charts for guitar) and both devices paired and worked as expected with no problems.I've actually used the Mayday feature twice - both times I was connected within a minute to someone who was cheerful and ready to assist. Best tech support experience I've ever had. Maybe it's because you can actually see these people (though they can't see you), they were professional and courteous and seemed genuinely interested in my issue with a desire to help me fix the problem.Turns out they'll have to send me a new Fire because my issue seems hardware related (lock screen image never changes and I've had two random restarts and a force close on the Store). So... do you see that... even WITH those issues, I'm incredibly pleased with this device. I have spent HOURS on this thing, reading, listening, playing games, watching videos, downloading content, editing documents, taking notes... and except for the few times I mentioned... this thing has been flawless.This is one of the best electronic devices I have ever purchased.So... glowing review... why only 4 stars? The browser. Silk is simply terrible. Sideload Dolphin HD and sideload Flash... you will be sorely disappointed with your web browsing experience if you don't.

Not exactly what we call \"High Quality\".So, why did I rate it a '3' instead of a '1'?First, let's go over the problems.1) While the device was supposed to have 64 GB of storage, it ran out of storage after downloading 6 movies.  My rule of thumb is that an HD movie takes around 4.5 GB of storage, so WTF?  When I talked to the Amazon Help Desk rep, he agreed that this shouldn't have been a problem.2) When attempting to remove movies from the device, it didn't just freeze, it turned into a brick.  Nothing I did (under the Amazon agent's direction, mind you) fixed it.  Nothing like a $500 brick.3) The menus are not intuitive.  I've seen better GUIs designed by freshmen college students.4) The size of the menu items are VERY SMALL... barely readable with my 62 year-old eyes, and I inadvertently selected the wrong item twice in a row.  There appears to be no way to change the font size of the selectable items.5) There's no way to Search to find downloadable movies.  It's just \"click each item until you can download it\".  There ought to be a better way to find items that you can download without a random Drunkard's Walk.So, if the Kindle Fire HDX is so bad, why did I rate it a '3'?Well, normally the \"Brick after less than 24 hours\" would make it a '1', but I like the potential for the device.  As with my initial purchase of a Kindle Paperwhite, it appears that Amazon releases products before they've undergone sufficient testing.  However, Amazon has the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've ever seen.  Their agents are well-trained, and capable of responding to hostile / unhappy customers, and they move heaven-and-earth to fix problems / dis-satisfactions.  I've already shipped the Kindle back to Amazon, and they've already shipped me a replacement device.  Unfortunately, I'll be in Europe when it arrives, but I can't fault Amazon for their response.Bottom Line?  I'm a fan of the company, even if their initial product rollouts suck.For you early adopters, be aware that the quality may be substandard.

Glad I read more reviews and ordered my kindle because you can download the app you just have to do it through the online website and the people that are on the mayday button helped me through the steps (though they did not tell me that when I don't see the app on the main carousel our in the apps tab that you need to go to the apps tab and in upper right corner select \"on device\" to get it to show up).

I'd bought the original Kindle Fire 2 years ago and thought it a good reader for those who need color for illustrations, as I do, but its design and functionality struck me as rather clunky and hit-or-miss. Its use as an internet surfing device was frustratingly slow and whatever other functions there were never seemed to shine because of its meager storage. I used the Kindle Fire as a reader almost exclusively and was satisfied with that.The new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" takes direct aim at the heavyweights, especially the iPad, and does so successfully. Its Wi-Fi version weight of 13.2 oz. feels feather light and its slightly smaller size makes it easy to manipulate using only one hand. For me, that ability to comfortably carry it one-handed, leaving the other hand free for data entry, is a significant breakthrough. My iPad, despite all of its many virtues, never felt truly portable. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is the first truly portable full-sized tablet I've used.The Kindle Fire 8.9\" HDX touchscreen display with 2560x1600 resolution is impressive. As my eyes get used to 1080p high definition images from pretty much everywhere these days, it is one indication of how beautiful such densely-packed pixels can look when you let out an involuntary \"ooh\" as I did at the beginning of The Hobbit. Hobbiton has never looked so green and verdant. This new touch screen display is a triumph. The screen is responsive to the lightest touch, something owners of the original Kindle Fire could only dream about.Browsing the web in a Silk environment is meant to be faster by dispensing with \"unnecessary images and other website clutter\" (according to Amazon) by using Reading View. I prefer my websites un-tampered with but normal browsing is extremely fast and responsive due to the new Kindle's Quad-Core 2.2 GHz processor and the Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. This is a very fast tablet in all respects.There is one aspect of the Kindle Fire experience every prospective buyer must take into consideration. This tablet is designed to operate within an Amazon ecosystem. There are limitations built into the Kindle. Its Android operating system is modified so that there are differences users of Android devices will quickly notice. But Amazon Prime members (like me) can at last really experience membership - the way it was designed to be experienced - every time they dip into a vast pool of free films and TV shows, both streaming and downloading for offline viewing. The earlier Kindle Fires were simply not equiped for enjoying high definition films, for example. The speed of the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" finally delivers on the promise of Amazon Prime membership.There are a host of other features that give value to the new Kindle Fire. Its increased storage capacity means no more desperate decision making on what items to keep and what to discard. Music lovers will enjoy having their Amazon CD purchases instantly appear on screen and available for either streaming or downloading from the cloud, eliminating the need for time consuming ripping. X-Ray showcases the song's lyrics onscreen, adding another dimension to music listening. The Kindle's Dolby Digital speakers are well separated when it's held in landscape position, producing true stereo sound, a first in my tablet experience. The new Mayday feature will be a boon to many, though techies will probably snort in derision and dismiss it. But the Kindle Fire tablet is meant for a larger audience: those who are still uncomfortable with technology and appreciate help wherever they can find it. Well, here it is.The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is two things: Amazon's delivery on a promise made several years ago, and a portent of the future in technology. The Kindle is a content delivery system and, within its rich Amazon ecosystem, it is probably the most effective device of its kind. With the increasing use of cloud computing, devices like this one are the future of computing for personal use: both for work and entertainment.

The volume control (which doubles as a zoom control when in camera mode) is on the back of the unit by the headphone jack, and the on-off button is next to where you plug the unit in -- a BIG improvement over the HD side volume and power controls.  This unit has plenty of tools for the visually and hearing impaired; a big step forward from the HD.  BUT, there's something Amazon ISN'T telling you...and I have no idea why they aren't using this as a selling point. The HDX has VOICE RECOGNITION...when ever the on-screen keyboard pops-up, there's a button right by the space bar that has a microphone on it; so instead of typing something in, you hit the microphone button...a little graphic equalizer animation comes on, and you say whatever you would have typed, push the microphone button again when you're done, and all of a sudden you see the text you were going to type in the blank you would have typed it in!  I haven't worked much with voice recognition software, and I really wasn't expecting much -- it has done a GREAT job...in fact if you've got some kind of audio source across the room you'll need to turn it down/off..when I wasn't speaking the unit recognized every word from the source across the room!  Do you see ANYTHING about this feature in Amazons promotions???  Maybe I need to try that 'panic' button and ask them why they're keeping this secret!  Fortunately I haven't had any reason to use the 'panic button.

It was a Christmas present from my husband that I got to buy myself (He wanted to make sure I got the one I wanted, one of those know what it is can't have it Christmas gifts)Awesome. It arrived. When I got to open it I went about all the instructions, and finally got to play around with it.One issue.....it kept glitching on me. When i would open my book up the screen would glitch for a split second. Odd.....Then the wifi started to refuse to connect, or the web browser would completely crash and my whole kindle wouldn't open up apps, Allow me to get to the internet, the device kept glitching on me. I had to do a few 'Mayday' calls and even those crashed.Off to actually call amazon because after having it a few months, it was obviously not working right.Making a long story short I have done quite a few 'Mayday' calls with them and every single call would crash. I have been on the phone with them a few times trying to fix my kindle. It came down to I has re-booting my kindle every single day, if not twice a day for it to work. And I would have to do a whole system re-start for it to work after so many days of the re-booting not working. I have cleared everything off the Silk browser  through the apps like I was told to many times, I would force stop....pretty much everything, then re-boot. I had a 60/40 chance of that working before I had to do a whole system re-boot (Which, BTW, deletes everything off the device, if you back things up on cloud no issues, but cloud does not back up any games you have played)So anyway, finally fully fed up, Amazon said they would send me a new kindle. Awesome right? Here I am all excited that I was getting a new kindle to replace the one thats been giving me so much trouble.Except....it was a reconditioned one. Now...usually I wouldn't have an issue with this, except I paid (my total came out to just shy of 500 dollars, but the kindle was closer to about 400, I also got a protective case for the kindle) for a brand new kindle when I bought it, Obviously it didn't work and they sent me a used one. So.....I paid.....400 dollars.....for a refurbished kindle. This doesn't make me happy.Now I know they have this 'its been checked, its working like new, its backed up' guarantee, however, if I wanted a used one I would've paid for a used one and there is nothing they can do for the amount I paid for my first glitchy kindle  and the used one they sent me.Bad taste in mouth.So now I'm debating returning both kindles (The new used one they sent me AND my old one) and taking what refund (They can only refund me 80% of the original price I paid, fine I get it, I have used it, I'm not mad about that) and buying a different device. I feel pretty ripped off here. I wasn't told I would be getting a reconditioned one and they never gave me an option for a new or used. So yeah....I was actually a huge lover of amazon but now? I'm not sure I am.

Have had the Nexus 7 and currently own a first edition ipad mini. Also have a Samsung Galaxy SII phone and other family members have assorted android tablets, phones and apple products. So we are quite versed in tablets and phones. The 8,9\" HDX is far superior to other androids in all aspects. Purchased the 64 Gig version before Christmas using the payment plan. Note that I am not a fan of the android system for several reasons. Mostly related to the Google intrusion and the apps forced on you by other manufacturers that use android.They got rid of all the battery eating proprietary google play and Samsung apps. The battery life is very good. When comparing to the ipad mini, the ipad mini is a little better. But, considering the excellent resolution of the display and the lightening fast processor, the battery life is really quite good. I couldn't even get a full day use from the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy SII is abysmal.Video playback is speedy with no faltering for the movie when it is downloaded to the HDX. Have used the feature that allows you to play amazon prime videos on the PS3. It is a pain to set up on the PS3 because you have to log in to amazon prime on the PS3 first and every time. With the ipad mini I just use the airplay feature and it plays without further logging in on the apple TV and our Yamaha surround sound receiver. The only real plus for using the HDX to play movies on the PS3 is that you can watch the HDX screen and see what actors are playing in each scene and you get little tidbits of information about the making of the movie while the movie is playing on the PS3. Otherwise, why not just play your movies using Amazon Prime on the PS3 since you have to log on to the service to use the HDX playback feature. Playing movies that are not downloaded is also seamless with no problems loading and playing the movie over wifi. Note that our wifi is the best available (5 Gig router) and we get our internet service through cable. HD movies have excellent resolution and it is one of the reasons, I purchased the HDX. The quality of movie playback on the first edition mini is OK but nothing like the resolution on the HDX, which makes sense since the first mini does not have anything comparable to the resolution of the HDX. Took the HDX to work and streamed one of my movies from my library and it worked great.The speakers are quite tolerable for such a small device. Leaps and bounds above any other android I have been around and better than the apple ipad mini speakers. Bluetooth works but you have to go through several menus to get to it. Haven't tried to find an app that could access it quicker. I use several bluetooth devices so it is a nuisance to go menu hopping. The sound from the bluetooth into my Creative headphones was as good if not better than the apple, which is known for excellent music processing and quality. Although bluetooth is bluetooth and you do get quality loss.I have had a little difficulty with the silk browser but cannot really recommend or criticize it. Most of the apps I already had were usable on the HDX. Some were not.If you are trying to decide between an HDX and an apple ipad, you will have to think about what functions you wish to utilize. There is no replacement for the functionality of my ipad for one touch appointment scheduling and verbal searches with Siri. It doesn't have the bloated android operating system. But the HDX has a screaming fast processor, great resolution, trimmed the Google app crap, good battery life and a very nice size in the 8.9\". Both are pretty lightweight.

I like the 8.9\" display over the iPad's 9.7\" display because there is really no place to hold the iPad in your hand because the screen goes all the way to the edge of the iPad. That might work asthetically but with the Kindle's 8.9\" screen, you can hold the unit by it's edges without getting your fingers on the screen. That's more practical.True, there may be more apps available for the iPad but that isn't such a big deal. For instance, I think there are a dozen different solitare apps for the iPad. Most of them aren't very good and you would end up deleting them after you try them. On the other hand, the Kindle has fewer solitare apps but those are the best ones. The same goes for other apps.The Kindle and iPad email apps are almost identical. I haven't worked with Apple's new \"Office\" apps but the Kindle \"Office\" apps work just fine. They tie into my Skydrive, Google Drive and DropBox seamlessly. I was able to create and edit several files without problem. Don't know that I would sit down to write the great American novel on either the iPad or Kindle but for 99% of the things I would need to do on the go, the Kindle apps work well and are intuitively easy to use.I also like the fact that I can charge my Kindle using the USB-Micro cables I already have. No need to mess with a lightning cable which obsoletes my original Apple accessories. Apple must make a fortune on those cables. They can't cost more than a buck or two, tops, to make. To sell them for $19 buck is just highway robbery!Three words about the origami case - Don't buy it! It's too heavy, It's cumbersome and the magnets don't hold the Kindle in place very well. It's ok if you want to put your Kindle on a desk but doesn't work well if you want to put the Kindle in your lap or hold it in your hand while reading. Just too heavy.Bottom line - The Kindle 8.9 HDX is a great tablet and an even better value. Unless you are an Apple fanatic, you can't go wrong with the Kindle. As for me, I am giving my iPad to my son.

Other commenters, as well as the on-site blurb, cover the features in detail and accurately.  I have nothing to add.  It is an excellent device, leading in the state of the art for now.Why 4 stars instead of 5?  It's mainly about the Amazon app store and the apps included on the device as-delivered.I have an android phone, and get apps via Amazon and Google.  Useful offerings in the Amazon Android store that I enjoy on the phone are not yet on the Kindle.  Swiftkey is a good example.  I would like Amazon to ensure that all offerings in the Android app store, except those that are cell-phone specific, will also work on the Kindle.  Sometimes, mainly due to different screen dimensions, a difference in presentation would be OK.What's missing? I would *really* like to have the actual Gmail app, as the included e-mail app has some dysfunctions. And I would *really* like to have Firefox, mainly to sync with my desktop and laptop.

I have been setting it up so when she opens it at Christmas time it will be already to go. I found it extremely easy to use, I just connected it to my computer and looked at it like you would another hard drive. I found there were folders all ready for what I wanted to do. I simply transferred (dragged) my pictures and videos to these folders and they ran just fine.At a prior date and location I had downloaded different apps for it, games, utilities, Netflix and HBOGO. When I got home and she wasn\u2019t around I turned on the Kindle HDX 16 gig and there they were all ready to sign into or play. I couldn\u2019t help trying the video on Netflix and HBOGO, the picture and sound was exquisite, I looked at some pictures and home made videos that I had made for her and I was extremely pleased with them. Oh, I bought this using my account with Amazon.com so all my books were also on it. EASY, EASY, EASY!Even though my wife has no technical skills I think she should do fine with this Kindle HDX.

The screen, as others have said, is amazing. Hands down the best on any tablet. The auto adjusting feature on it is also amazing. Clarity in any light conditions is a million times better than in previous models and the best I have seen in any tablet. I read books and magazine today in bright sun without any squinting or tilting or adjustments. Same goes for the processor and RAM, which make the HDX a joy to use - so fast and responsive.I was also surprised by the improvements in the touch screen itself. Typing is so unbelievably easy now, I barely even have to look - accuracy is excellent. The OS so far is also excellent. I love the small touches that really integrate the device. Whether I am listening to a song or reading a book I can always get more information easily. I also love that I can see my other apps with a side swipe. Viewing device and system details is also more detailed and easier. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery life, but it did seem to deplete slower despite my video watching and playing with it for hours.Also, I was surprised at how cool it stayed despite extended use. Likewise, I was shocked by how light and thin it feels. My HD 8.9 feels like holding an encyclopedia in comparison. The HDX is a tad smaller, but its feel is so much smaller. It is very easy to hold in one hand for extended periods of time. Although I wish there were more cases available.Oh and the sound! The sound! It booms and the surround is amazing! My son came to my room to ask me to stop blaring the tv when I was watching Avengers. It seems a huge improvement from before. Same for button placement. Easy to access and user friendly. Big improvement over the previous buttons. The feel and placement are super easy to use. I no longer have to stumble looking for them or turn it around trying to figure out what I am touching.I'm sure I am forgetting something, but overall, this is an amazing tablet that feels and works like it costs twice as much. I have never seen the beauty in electronic devices (e.g. the way ipad is described as elegant etc., to me a white rectangle with metal edges is just that), but I have to say, I love the tapered edges. They make holding it extremely easy and I am glad they thought of user comfort instead of just looks. That being said, it does look great - I almost hate to use a cover.Anyway, to sum it up, as an independent consumer, I can't think of another tablet that I would spend my money on. The HDX 8.9 is all around just beautiful, powerful, fun to use and gives me easy access to everything I want, not to mention, the productivity I need. I don't want to sound the way the Apple fanatics sound, but it is getting really difficult not to when the Kindle HDX 8.9 is everything I wanted in a tablet and more. I had thought about the ipad many times during the past few years, but the features, specs, and experience just were not compelling enough for me. I had been waiting for a quality android based tablet when I bought the first Kindle and I have not been disappointed by sticking with Amazon.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good device, but the price is high and you're locked into Fire OS unless a root surfaces.", "Author": "Tyler B", "ReviewID": "R1PB8V5OBV2WK7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a part of an Amazon promotion, I received a Kindle Fire HDX for free as a trial for 30 days. I took this opportunity as I liked the specifications for this. I got it and I was impressed. It plays emulators great and we've had a great time with Fruit Ninja.I have some issues though. Some of my apps crash. I have no idea as to why this happens. But it happens often and is irritating. It seems the OS wasn't fully prepared for release.It's great for web browsing and has been exciting to use. I do plan to use it for my full trial period as I don't have my own tablet yet and this is nice.My biggest problem is the wireless. I have two networks broadcasting. Both work fine for every single device we connect to it. Our computers, phones and consoles all run off this big network without any connection problems. However, the Kindle Fire HDX likes to suddenly \"drop\" its connection. It'll show it's connected to my network in the settings menu, but it acts as if I'm connected to a network with no internet access. Fixing this requires the device to be put into \"Airplane Mode\" or a system reboot. This happens at least a few times a day.Otherwise, it's a great device. The setback is it's a $500 tablet that is locked down to Amazon's Fire OS. Once root is available, this is a great device if you can get it and install your own version of Android.EDIT: Several attempts to contact Amazon have failed.

Ever since Amazon's announcement of the Kindle Fire HDX, I was looking forward to this device.  It's so thin and light, and you can download Amazon Prime instant videos for offline viewing.

From the beginning, the device had its issues.  I charged it a full 6 hours prior to using it (the fast charger says it reaches a full charge in less than 5 hours), and yet it would restart randomly when it got bogged down.The battery is not great, but it's such a thin and light device I can almost look past that issue.What finally broke my Kindle's back was the issue some other reviewers seem to be having -- deleting downloaded Amazon Prime Instant Videos \"bricked\" my Kindle.  My memory was getting full, so I watched an episode of Parks & Rec, tried to delete it, and the device froze for a few seconds before shutting off completely.  I tried a few restarts and plugging it into my computer and an electrical outlet, but it never responded after shutting down.  To Amazon's credit, their customer service has been stellar as always.  It was a very easy process to try to debug/troubleshoot my device before the agent offered to replace it.I chose to return for a refund because I honestly don't know how prevalent this issue is.  It seems that a few people have had a consistent issue with their Kindles, and I don't want to have to return multiple units.  I'm sure there are people out there who've had great experiences and haven't had any issues with their devices.

The screen is outrageously good, the processor is lightning quick, and the 64 gb is on par storage for all top grade tablets.

Using the HDX tablet, and I have compared it to the same new top of the line tablets from others top companies......The HDX Fire holds its ground and in my opinion surpasses many other tablet offerings.What I think Amazon should be proud of more than anything their HDX hardware has to offer is this companies courage to present a radical new concept, a revolution in the the internet, customer service based arena, that has never been done before,and when perfected, will change the way customers interact with a company and their product....and that is the Mayday button initiative.The Mayday button concept will be remembered in history as the turning point/starting point, of how customer service and technical support  for internet based companies interact with the consumer with regards to the products and services that particular company sells.This is a great product with great customer service and technical support.

I wanted to like it since I have so much video media and books (eBooks and audio) purchased from amazon or amazon companies. I used the fire for a 10 hour bus trip and again on the way back. The battery lasted for the entire 10 hour trip and the fire was running about 75% of the time.As an entertainment device, movies, books, and audio it was very nice. I also loved the idea of downloading the movies and TV shows from amazon prime to watch off line when there wasn\u2019t any internet available. With 64GB I had plenty of room to load my device with mp4 movies I already owned to watch later. Strange you have to use the photo app on the kindle to watch a downloaded mp4 movie.The email was very easy to set up and worked seamlessly with my work email, a big plus. I purchased excel contacts (5 Star app by Sam YU, samapp.net, in kindle store) to load all my contacts from my ios device to an excel spreadsheet then to my kindle.Why I sent mine back.The operating system supporting apps needs more time to mature. The apps I commonly used were not always available on the fire and there were no substitutes.A problem I had I tried using the mayday feature. I wanted to convert my ios calendars to use on the kindle. I have hundreds of appointments, birthdates, anniversaries etc. plugged into a calendar already and I was trying to convert it. I used mayday to get information, she had no help for me. Next step for mayday, I asked if I converted the ios calendar to a google calendar (information on the web on how to do this) how do I change it to the kindle calendar. I kept getting a repeated message, which I believe she was reading, \"You can only use what is available in the kindle app store\". I wrote to Sam Yu, one of the developers at, samapp.net. They have the excel contact app (in kindle store) but they also have a great excel calendar app which I have used on ios and was hoping they were close to one for the kindle. No luck.ConclusionThere weren\u2019t enough PRIME movies or shows that I have not seen available for download. My main reason for purchasing the kindle hdx, to justify keeping the Kindle HDX. I also do not like you do not know if a movie or TV show can be downloaded until you click and open the movie options. Most of the newer movies and shows cannot and must be streamed and will not work without a fast internet connection. I had to spend a lot of time opening every movie or show to see which ones I could download to take on the bus with me. The internet provided at most places on the road, or on our bus, will not support streaming without the constant buffering stops.I ended up sending the kindle fire hdx back and purchased an IPad Mini retina. I\u2019m pretty sure square trades will transfer the warranty over so I just pay the upgrade in price. They told me to call them directly. I have not given up and will most likely purchase a kindle fire, maybe the next version.

Even the iPhone and iPad Kindle apps and the original Kindle let you do that.  What were they thinking leaving this out of the software?  Honestly, the Kindle functionality was the main reason I chose the HDX over the iPad, so I'm kind of disappointed, but the Mayday person assured me it would be available in the software upgrade before the end of the year.  If not, I would have returned it, but the other features are so nice, I really don't want to do that.  The Mayday feature worked great, I got help within 10 seconds.  And there are more than enough apps for anybody to be happy.**Update** - I have a lot of movies on my computer and the only way to view them in the Kindle is under Videos - Personal Collection.  The way they are displayed is very stupid!  They are displayed graphically in a grid with the first still shot of the movie showing, and there is no way to organize them by title.  So if you want to watch a particular movie, you have to guess and keep opening movies until you find the one you want.  I asked Mayday for help and they said it's not possible to do it any differently.  This may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for me.  I may be returning it for the iPad (in which you can just import anything into iTunes) if I can't figure out a way around this.

Some movies won't play (it seems to be the ones purchased through iTunes) but I've been satisfied enough with this program that I didn't return the HDX.

I had planned to just borrow his device for mobile reading.  I often find myself waiting for him to finish with an activity or work.  I had been using my smartphone, Android os, to read and play a few games.  However, the tiny screen was leading to major eyestrain.  I can read a paper book, but during the winter it is dark when I am waiting on him to finish work and I was running down the car battery to read, if I didn't use the phone.  There also were some issues with the Android os and the Kindle app, Amazon kindly fixed those, but the screen was still very small.With the latest sale price on the Kindle, I decided to go ahead and purchase one.  I had intended to purchase the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", but after some encouragement from my son, I purchased the 8.9\".  I was afraid the larger device would be awkward to tote around.  I was very wrong.  I am actually reading more since I purchased the HDX,  The device was fairly easy to set up.  I turned it on and signed in -- and it defaulted to mountain time zone.  I don't live there anymore and it was annoying to hunt to find where to change the time zone.  I ended up borrowing one of the Kindle guides and learned many interesting things about the device.The device is for me, most of the time, but I was pleased to find apps for studying for the GRE for my son who is a junior in college.  I also like the language apps which help us master correct pronunciation.Since I have a small iPod, I don't use the Kindle much for music, at least not yet.  It isn't portable enough to fit in my pocket when I exercise, therefore I cannot comment on the speakers.  We will likely use the device for watching Amazon prime movies, assuming the streaming doesn't eat up our internet allowance which is why we chose the larger size.  I also find the clarity of the screen and speed to be excellent.A few things I would like to see changed -- I read more than one book at once.  With this Kindle I can set more than one bookmark in a book, but I can't \"name\" the bookmarks -- one for where I'm reading, one for something of note....  I would also like to be able to have a tiny box or something to display the current time and battery icon when I am reading, or playing a game.  I know others won't want that, so I would like to see it be an option.I purchased the WiFi model because I could not afford 4G.  I am pleased that the device automatically connects to the WiFi devices it has \"met\" before, automatically.  One thing I learned early on, make certain to fully shut the device off to conserve battery power.  If used mostly for reading, the battery really will last 16 hours, or more, but only if fully shut down, in sleep mode it will continue to consume battery power.We don't watch much tv, although we love old movies.  We don't do social networks, I tend to be a more private person, so I wasn't certain if I could find enough uses to justify the Kindle purchase.  I was excited to find one of my favorite apps, Laudate available, and I can get an assortment of other theological resources easily.There are enough differences between the HD and the HDX that I am very happy I waited and purchased the faster and clearer device.  I do recommend a cover and if possible a padded bag for anyone who is as prone to dropping things as I am.  Actually, I have put my ID, credit card, and cell phone in the outside pocket of the padded bag and left everything else behind.  I purchased the set of 12 accessories at the same time I purchased the device.  The cover isn't fancy and if I use it often, I'll have to replace it within a year, but it is fine for now.I did not think I would like reading without the physical feel of a book in my hands.  Admittedly, I cannot close the book when I finish an electronic book with the same finality.  However, we already have 20 bookcases, very full, and I am reluctant to purchase more paper books without getting rid of some.  It will be so much easier to throw the Kindle in the vehicle and know I don't have to box up all the books included in it when my son head off to post-graduate work and studies!  I also love that I can change the font of the electronic books on days when my eyes are tired instead of digging out a stronger pair of reading glasses!I will next see how I like having the Kindle read to me, but that is another adventure.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen, good sound, a few  minor dislikes...", "Author": "CMB", "ReviewID": "R2DGYF70H05JY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a woman in my late 50's, computer savvy but not a techie, and I like electronic gadgets.  I thought long and hard about buying a tablet (do I really need one???), and then about which one to buy.  Based on reviews on both Amazon and other websites, I had a hard time deciding between the Google Nexus 7 (the 2013 model) and the Kindle Fire HDX.  After playing with both of them for about an hour in Staples, I decided on the Fire.  I was originally going to buy the smaller Fire but got the 8.9\" because I wanted to use it to watch videos.I really like it very much.  I'm not into apps, so it doesn't matter to me that I don't have access to the Google (or Apple) app store.  I use the Fire mainly for surfing, checking emails, watching video and listening to music. The interface is easy to learn and use, and things move with lightning speed.  The Fire does have an absolutely beautiful screen which makes watching videos a pleasure (the picture is much better than my TV).  I haven't actually purchased any videos but have found lots of things I like in the streaming videos.  Of course, this thing is an Amazombie's delight - it's easy (maybe too easy) to access videos, books, my Kindle library, etc.  I think the speakers sound pretty good on their own, but I got a little Jam speaker and also some bluetooth headphones and love listening to music via Pandora or my iTunes library.Some minor complaints:  I understand that the Silk browser is improved on the HDX, but I absolutely don't understand why it doesn't support Flash.  It would be much more useful if it did.  I installed the Dolphin browser, and can play flash videos, but Dolphin acts a little twitchy on the Fire.  Also, there's no way to organize bookmarks in Silk (there is in Dolphin).I wish that I didn't need a smart TV in order to mirror the screen and watch videos on my TV, but it could be time for a new TV anyway.  However, I've read other reviews and people are generally disappointed about not being able to use a cable to connect their Kindle to a TV while traveling.  It's too bad this feature was removed, but I knew that when I bought it.It's really easy to set up email accounts, but there's no way to organize email other than the standard folders.  Also, there appears to be no way to select all messages so I can delete them - I have to go through and select them one by one.  I wouldn't want to have this as my only was to receive and send email.I've had a couple of Kindle e-readers, and I like reading on the dedicated e-reader better than reading on the Fire.  It's nice to have color and the back lit screen is good sometimes, but there's a lot of glare.  The 8.9\" size is a bit heavy for reading.  I've had to get used to reading on it, and I still use my Kindle Touch a lot.In general I'm really pleased with the Kindle Fire, and I use it a lot rather than getting out my laptop.  Although as I said, I like gadgets, but I don't have a smart phone and the Fire is in between a smart phone and a laptop - very useful except for making phone calls!  I chose the Wi-Fi only version because I don't want to pay for a data plan, and it was great on a recent trip where there was Wi-Fi everywhere.  I didn't have to bring along the laptop but was able to have all my books, music, plus check out hotels etc. all in one small package.

This is the 6th Kindle we've owned in our family.  Our first foray into the Kindle world was the original Kindle Fire.  After that we purchased 2 of the second generation Kindle Fires and then I purchased a Kindle Fire HD 7inch.  We also have a basic Kindle e-reader.  Now, I've finally gotten the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.....the 8.9 HDX.  I'm not a techno whiz by any means, so I can't tell you about all the bells and whistles this little baby has.  What I can tell you is that it is super user friendly and almost absurdly easy to use.  This tablet is now my primary means of surfing the web, watching videos, checking email, as well as reading.  It's like an all in one entertainment center.  I love the bigger 8.9 screen.  The additional ability to categorize my books into collections is awesome!  I have so many books, I often overlook ones that I've yet to read.  Furthermore, when I'm in the mood for a particular type of book I would have to search through my entire library to figure just what to read, and then oftentimes I'd forget whether a specific book was of the genre I was looking for.  Now that I've organized my books by genre, I no longer have that problem.  I love it!  My only complaint is that, while I am still able to review a book directly after reading it on my tablet, Amazon has removed the ability to edit the review once it's been submitted.  So many times after I submit a review I realize, after rereading it, that I've made some grammatical error.  Now because I am no longer able to edit the review once it's submitted, I have to go online via \"Silk\" and find my review in order to do the editing.  It is a bit of a pain in the....., but not overly so.  Otherwise, this tablet is just about perfect.  My husband has an Ipad and I would not give up this tablet for that one EVER!

But for being a primary book reader for their kindle books, there are a couple of serious flaws for the dedicated kindle reader that enjoys the digital version as well as the audio version. With their \"Immersion Reading\" `which isthe digital book along with the professional narration; I get skips in the highlighting and the highlighting not keeping up with the narration; seems to depend on the book and/or the size of the text you've selected; also if you're reading in double columns or not.Text To Speech;Even tho they have now included 6 voices only 2 of these are US English; Amazon needs to have many more choices and better quality voices like the Neospeech voices. The Text To Speech is also flawed in that it will skip pages (not the audio); the written text will skip ahead of the audio; it's a pain then to page back because you have start all over at the beginning of the page; sometimes it will get halfway into a page; then the page will jump to the next page or even 2 pages ahead.I have talked to Mayday and have also talked to their regular support staff about these issues. Nobody knows what to do about these or how to fix them.They need to have highlighting with the Text To Speech and better highlighting where you can change the colors of the highlighting.I had the HD also (the 2012 Kindle Fire); I had the same problems with it.Narration along with the digital is a great idea, but it needs to work better.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "No HDMI port", "Author": "Tammy", "ReviewID": "R1D5OJ0MYQV4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this unit to replace my current Kindle Fire HD which has 32 GB.

I got the top of the line, 64G 4G Kindle, and love it. Using AT&T;, the Share plan or whatever its called between iPhone plus Kindle - my monthly plan is virtually the SAME PRICE split between 2 devices - not hardly a penny more, for top of the line plan, so its not even an extra cost- which is great, my monthly bill is about $135 for cell and now for cell + Kindle. the Kindle picture is gorgeous. Its like watching the best little TV you ever bought, incredibly high quality viewing.It was NOT ready/charged right out of the box, but big deal, it charged quickly. Had a bit of trouble, needed a couple resets but Amazon CUSTOMER SERVICE was RIGHT THERE for chat plus then phone help and when they say 24/7, they mean it! There was NO wait and no issue with any language barrier with the reps on the phone - very courteous, helpful, and quickly resolved the setup issue- I was very pleased w/Amazon's service and was able to enjoy the Kindle quickly.LOTS of FREE games for kids plus adults - a HUGE plus, totally worth getting AMAZON PRIME for, free shipping, etc with the 80/annual fee. I am sure I will get my $$$ worth on Prime membership with all the available movies, TV, books, and free shipping on so many items. I probably already have just with Christmas shopping.

I usually buy Apple products but I was intrigued with the marketing campaign by Amazon. I am a marketing professional so I appreciate it when a company goes the extra mile with a quality campaign. I spent three months comparing the different options and ended up with two; iPad Air and Kindle HDX 8.9. I think the iPad Air is Nirvana, it is made with such quality that it has a museum piece. I feel. the only problem is that I am so familiar with Apple products that it was too familiar, just like what I work on every day. The Kindle on the other hand was new and different and that made it interesting to me. I then decided to see which company wanted my business more.....Apple offered no discounts and Amazon offered a payment plan plus had a special that week for Prime members. Plus when I went to the Best Buy to give them both a try the Apple rep was arrogant and rude. I read all the customer reviews for the Kindle on the Amazon site so I was familiar with all the major complaints i.e., no access to Google Docs and Google Play and Google Apps store. I learned all about side loading the google apps via Mobile 1 app etc. These learnings really helped shape my decision because I knew that it was not a plain old Google Android based device and I was glad because that was what made this Kindle interesting....it was daring to be different. I actually like the Silk Browser, I like the way that Youtube works on it and yes, I can sign into Youtube and have access to all my channels and subscriptions (may have been an issue in the past but not anymore). I side loaded Chrome and yes it does not work exactly like it should but it allows me to use Google Maps with GPS so it knows my location. I use the Kindle at work and can do everything that I want with my Exchange Active Sync Email for my corporate email and I use the Office Suite Pro for word, excel, powerpoint and adobe PDFs. I use the Amazon Cloud Drive for storage and Amazon Cloud Player for transferring my music from my laptop. The issue with the Cloud Drive is that you can only stream videos that are less than 20 minutes from the Cloud Drive onto your Kindle (don't know why they limit that and wish they would not). I bought the 16GB version thinking that I could upgrade my Cloud Drive account and store everything on it but the video limitation is a problem. That is the reason that I only gave this tablet 4 stars. Otherwise, I love the functionality of the Kindle and the Amazon ecosystem for my books, magazines, movies, tv shows, music, Prime Membership, shopping etc...it makes life much easier and convenient.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it.

I'm just going to respond to some points that seem to keep cropping up in reviews.The App StoreSince I spent more than six seconds researching this before I bought it, I already knew the Amazon App Store wasn't Google Play, and that there would be apps missing.  I'm a heavy Google user -- Gmail, Maps, Voice, all of it.  I still don't miss these functions on my Kindle.  Why?  Because I have all that on my PHONE, and I'm not trying to have my Kindle just be the same device I already have, just bigger.  Apps that are missing are handled ably by replacements.  The native Mail/Calendar/Contacts apps are functional if simple, and they stay perfectly synced with my Google info.  It's not Gmail but it works.  All the other apps I wanted WERE available and work fantastic -- Evernote, Netflix, HBO GO, Pandora, Goodreads, etc.  Disappointed that the Facebook app is just a shell around the mobile FB website, but all the other apps are the real thing.BluetoothYes it does come with Bluetooth, and yes it works great.  I spent the weekend streaming music from my Kindle to a Bose Soundlink and it worked perfectly nonstop.GPSIf you get the 4G model (I have Verizon), you do get GPS.  No Google Maps, but Waze is in the App Store and works just as well, for turn-by-turn nav and everything.  (My only beef here is with Verizon charging me a $35 \"activation charge\" to add the Kindle to my account, which I did by myself, online.  $35 charge anyway.  Thanks, phone company.)Origami coverI got the blue Origami cover/case.  It looks fantastic, and works fine for what it says it does.  It is a bit heavy, but the device is only held in with magnets so if you want to take it out for holding and reading it's super easy.  Buttons for power and volume are mirrored exactly with buttons on the case.  It's way overpriced, but it's a perfect match for the device.ChargerI bought the $19,99 \"fast charger,\" not knowing that the exact same one comes with it in the box.  (Buyer beware.)  One thing that did make me go \"huh\" was, while it was plugged in, I got a \"you are using a low-voltage charger, if using your device while charging the battery may still drain,\" etc. message.  It doesn't act like a low-voltage charger -- charges all the way up from dead in just a few hours, EVEN while you are using it.  Not sure what that message was about.Now, on to the good stuff:Reading books (Kindle)This is my first e-reader/tablet of any kind, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but the Kindle Fire makes reading books an unexpected pleasure.  I chewed through an entire novel in one day, last weekend.  I like the ability to look up words, make highlights and notes to go back to, and the X-Ray feature is interesting, not as much fun as for TV/Movies (more on that in a minute) but still provides some fun trivia/info.  I don't notice any blue or purple haze anywhere on the screen, edges or otherwise.  Apparently they have taken care of that issue.  (And IMHO the beige/sepia color scheme is more comfortable for reading than black/white anyway.)MusicPlaying music is no-frills, but solid.  I have all my music in Amazon's Cloud player ($25/year).  This is the first time since the old-school iPods with the giant hard drives, that I have been able to \"bring my whole collection with me.\"  Not literally, since 90% of it lives in the cloud, but between the Wi-Fi and the 4G for when I'm not in a usual haunt, same difference.  The X-Ray for music isn't as useful to me, mostly it shows you song lyrics, and most of my music is indie/DJ/mixtape/etc so Amazon doesn't have the sing-a-long lyrics for much of it.Movies/TV\"Competitors:\"  Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu+ all work seamlessly and look beautiful.  They're not kidding about the screen on this thing -- I know I have old eyes, but I seriously cannot even see pixels, even when trying to.  It's like the picture is smoother than in real life.  The picture is so good it is *almost* too much.  I have 1080p TV's at home and the Kindle Fire HDX is starting to make them look grainy by comparison.  I really can't say enough good things about the picture quality.  Held up next to an iPad Air there is no comparison -- the Kindle wins hands down.  Here is where I really do like the X-Ray.  I like to re-watch movies and TV shows, and with X-Ray activated, everyone currently in scene on the screen, appears to the left, in a selectable list that takes you to that person's IMDB bio.  I can't be the only one who watches shows and wonders, \"Where else have I seen him/her...\"  Well now that info is a click away.  (X-Ray only works with content streamed or purchased from Amazon.)  One note regarding downloading videos -- I got the 64 GB version (just in case), and I find it takes FOR EVER to download movies, especially HD but even the regular ones really seem to take their time.  If you're going on a plane trip and are wanting to bring a few downloaded movies with you, be prepared to queue them up and then let it spend the whole day downloading.  This is true regardless of where I'm connected -- including at work, where we have the fastest internet known to mankind -- so I don't think it's a network issue.  Either Amazon is throttling movie downloads or these files really do just take forever to download, but it ALMOST makes the ability to download seem beside the point.  It's just as fast an easy to stream them instead.  If I had it to do over again I would probably just stick with 32 GB.ConclusionYes, this device is basically a very fancy, window-dressed portal to your purchasing and consuming Amazon stuff.  This is not a secret.  I went with the Kindle over a pure-Google/Android Samsung or something or the iPad, because I'm already invested in Amazon's \"ecosystem.\"  I'm a Prime member, and I've had Amazon VoD on my Roku for years now, so I have a medium-sized collection of purchased videos.  I uploaded my whole music library as well.  If you're just as heavily invested in iTunes/Apple stuff then you may feel there's something lacking, just like I would have, had I bought an iPad.  As it is, as soon as I logged in with my account on the Kindle, there was all of my stuff.  Boom.  The \"pure Android\" Google tablets, I didn't even consider.  As I said at the top, I bought the Kindle fire *because* it was not trying to be a clone of my phone.  (And I don't like the Google media apps that I *have* tried to use -- Google Play Music on my phone is glitchy, crashy, and I don't like the interface.)  This device is for reading books, listening to music, and watching movies.  Yes, preferably (and easily) from Amazon.  I don't think anyone is making a secret of this.  I don't need to be able to edit Excel spreadsheets.  (That's what the laptop is for.)  I don't need Google Maps (that's what my phone is for.)  What this device does, it does very, VERY well.I just priced iPads on Apples's site and the iPad air, similarly configured to my Kindle (64GB, 4G Wireless + GPS) is $829.  I paid $539 for the Kindle.  For a difference nearly $300, I can put up with looking at an advertisement for 2 seconds while I flip open the cover.  (I can't believe people complain about those ads.  You can get rid of them by paying the $15 -- even if you've bought one with ads, the \"upgrade\" is simple.)No, this is not \"just like the iPad,\" and it is not a clone of the Google Nexus, and neither is it trying to be either of those things.  I love it, and I could not be happier with my purchase.Quick update/additionTwo things I forgot to mention above:Silk web browserWorks fine for me, even when browsing my school's eCollege website, which is famously glitchy - looks just as good as on my computer.  And the \"reading mode\" (where it clears away all the artwork and clutter and leaves only text, Kindle book-style) is a game changer.  Love it.GamesI am not at all a big gamer, but since they give you a bunch of Amazon coin credits, I decided to give it a whirl.  GT Racing 2 is too much fun, and The Room is fun and interesting and relaxing in a weird way.  Among many others.  I didn't get this device to play games on, specifically, but that has quickly become one of my favorite things about it.

Thus far, the last 2 hours spent with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" have been amazing.  The screen on this device needs to be experienced first hand.  I've had some amazing LCD screens for my PCs and smartphones, but this thing is just remarkable.  It is hands down more beautiful than any other screen I've had my hands on.It's also a very \"snappy\" tablet. It just speeds along without a single slow down.  I had it downloading books, a hand full of graphic novels, The Hobbit Extended edition (also just purchased), and all the apps I needed...and it never slowed down.  No hiccups, no lag, no freezes...NO PROBLEMS...no sweat.I also don't see the \"blue border\" issue reported for the 7\" HDX. I've tried all different brightness levels and white/sepia/black backgrounds (in bright and dark rooms) and I just don't see the blue \"halo\" around the edge of the device.

I've played with all the settings and it's just leaving bigger margins.  I prefer to have it almost edge to edge all around, but this doesn't let me get nearly as close as my old HD did.  Not a deal breaker...but odd.  Also, for some reason I've only seen 1 lock-screen image.  All I've seen is the film reel and there is no time on the lock-screen, which I would have sworn I saw in pre-release screenshots and is currently on my old 7\" HD. Weird...I even tried to turn the power off several times...and it's always the same image. The old HD had a handful it went through...I thought the new versions would too, and I really wish the time was listed. Heck...while I'm making wishes, how about notifications for emails on the lock-screen!Overall, this device is spooky fast and beautiful.  I'll update this review as I use it more.

I'm looking for a long-term relationship-but I am swinging between infatuation for the many things that are terrific, to swinging back to mild disappointment with the things that bother me. A partial list of the very good:* The fabulous screen (FAB-U-LOUS!)* The ulta-lightness (it feel like the battery must be missing)* The great sound* Sharp sharp sharp text* The joy of reading Kindle books on it (no rim of purple or blue)* The smooth, quick operation--no stuttering!* The really surprisingly decent cameras front and back* The straight-forward and easy process to add (and view) my photographs and videos to this Kindle (Bravo! nothing hidden or difficult!)* The placement of the power and sound buttons are perfect for me* ALL the improvements in the operating system from the previous model listed in previous reviews are spot on. Great job Amazon!HOWEVER:* The fit and finish on mine is off. Where the rubberized section meets the shiny plastic on the back is not level, so there's just enough of a sharp ridge of the shiny plastic close to the top corners on both sides to make it uncomfortable to hold. It's where I normally would grasp it, and it's irritating like a bad seam in a shoe or a tag in a shirt that has to be cut out. It makes it feel cheap and I find myself wondering if I could just take a bit of sandpaper & fix it, but one shouldn't need to fix the finish on a tablet.* The app store (you've already read about it)* I thought I would not mind the ads on the opening screen, but I find that I dislike them more and more. They tend toward unattractive or childish ads for apps in which I have no interest. Again, this cheapens the experience for me. I really wish for the ability to personalize the screens with my own photographs to take advantage of that beautiful screen.Tablets are a very personal choice and what may not bother many may rub someone else the wrong way. It's obvious that this little much improved jewel will be love at first sight for some, but I'm beginning to feel that the Kindle HDX 8.9 and I will just be friends.

I ended up going with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 with 32 gb.  The applications that are avaialble are what I would use for any other device.  Keep in mind all devices have there limitations.  The limitation here is that you can only get apps from Amazon and not all applications available will work on your device.Pros:- The screen has crisp colors and the brightness can be adjusted to personal tast.-Start screen,  the start screen falls in line with the other tablets showing icons that you use the most along with the carosel.- Recently used apps are available while in an applications, by running fingure at the bottom of the page and dragging up to the top._ Built in speakers and volume are nice it has an setting to control the volume, that is behind the applications, so if you only want the valume you go so loud that can be set in the setting,- Battery life is decent, however standby time could be improved (a week at most).- Integration with the Amazon app store and Prime instant video was very seamless and easy to use._ With the latest version Doc go to the cloud so they can be retrieved by other devices, orginally had a seperate doc folder that was not accessable from the web.- The interface is surprisingly easy to navigate, although there are some inconsistencies (ie. the back button moving between apps) that could be improved with software updates.- CPU speed is really responsive, takes less then 30 seconds to boot from a cold start. tapping on once of the categories will bring up the screen within 10 seconds.-  Prime Movie Downloads.  While traveling I was able to download movies to watch on the plane,- MAYDAY!!! feature is good, they will help you troubleshoot your issues, must have WiFi acess for this to work.  If they cannot help you they will take your number and have a rep call you back.  They called me within 60 seconds.-Battery Life - I am able to get 8 - 12 hours of video usage out of my device.-Power on/off button.  Having the power off button on the back rather than on the bottom like the orginal fire is alot easier to use.- Easily transfer between device and cloud-Able to use Kindle to make telephone calls, that were crisp and clear.- Bluetooth - used a bluetooth keyboard that worked great. ( when not in use need to remember to turn bluetooth off)Cons:- No Google apps or Google features (only a problem if you\u2019re mobile world is heavily influenced by Google; pictures, contacts, etc)- I had issues with switching between airplane mode and wifi, my WiFi would cut out after using airplane mode.- Not all web pages are compatabile with SILK the new web browser ( was trying to use Skillport).- Games show under apps and under Games-Cannot have an application open and display song information at the same time.-Had issues with the speakers, would not play sound after being in airplane mode.

I called Amazon, the technical department told me that blue haze was an enhancement and is not a defect.  So, I tried to live with the \"enhancement\" for about a week, and found that I could not overlook the \"enhancement\".  I tried different level of brightness, different color background, but found the blue haze to be intolerable.  I took, the advice of the Amazon technician who told me that there is no blue haze around the 8.9 inch HDX, and ordered the larger sibling with 64GB Wifi.Indeed, the new unit 8.9\" has _NO_ blue haze.  The screen is clear and more crisper than 7\" and I think better than the IPad.  The functionality of 8.9\" unit is otherwise identical to the smaller 7\" little brother( same cpu, ram, etc.)I opted for 64GB to be able to store about 30Gb of music on the tablet, along with some amount of videos for keeping kids entertained in road tripsI have LG G2 with 5.3\" screen, 10 inch IPad and Android tablet,  12\" laptop, 15\" laptop, 17\" laptop, and 24\" desktop. Originally I thought 7\" would be the nice intermediate size between the smart phone and the IPad.  I found that after using both 7\" and 8.9\",  8.9\" is a more proper size that best fit my objectives.It is my belief, that there is no one device that can be designed to be best in all aspects of its function. So, depending on your objectives, IPAD, Nexus 7, Galaxy tab, etc. maybe a better fit.In order of importance for my objectives for the device:1) For reading books, which is THE primary objective for purchasing  Kindle 8.9 HDX, I believe that this unit is better than other competing devices.2) For viewing Video for entertainment purpose.  The screen is vivid and more than adequate for viewing any video.  Also, audio streaming to Bluetooth speaker.  I have already taken up about 28 GB of spaces for the MP3 files, and have currently 27GB left over for other purposes.  The sound quality of the built-in speaker cannot escape its physical limitations.  However, for medium background noise environment, the built-in speaker is adequate.3) The non-writing based work such as web surfing, and simple web interactions.  For simple viewing of web pages such as Wiki, it is very good choice due to its light weight and long running battery life.4) For Apps: For simple apps such as guitar tuner, FFT, Wolfram Alpha, specialized calculators, etc. the Kindle is a capable tool.  However, since I also have Android devices with me always, the most applications do not need to be in both Android phone and Kindle.  For application that can use larger \"real estate\" such as Wolfram Alpha in displaying graphs and visual, the 8.9 inch is a great advantage.The Play Store apps, though not directly accessible, most app can be side-loaded and used in Kindle.  If the Apps were the primary objectives, I would have chosen Google devices such as Nexus 7 ( cheaper though less size in \"real estate\").So, if your primary objective is to read books using Kindle (as it should be), it has no rival.  The screen is gorgeous.  Then, add to it, the battery life, the feather-light weight, the Prime membership, the ability to run apps, browse web in reasonably responsive manner, all give it a very high mark.My wish list for the Kindle future added enhancement or functionality:\u2022 Full support of Play Store.\u2022 mini-SD card slot\u2022 Streaming Video from NAS drives (wirelessly)\u2022 USB 3.0 connection.  This would enable video streaming from external USB HD.Above will definitely make Kindle a IPAD killer.

I decided to try out the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9''.  I currently use the iPad Air and been using iPad 2 for a year and a half.  I really enjoyed playing with this Kindle Fire.  Interface needed some getting used to, but one I figured it out, it was very user friendly. It was strange not having a home button.  Sometimes, when playing games, I would accidentally bring up the 'home' bar, but face that with iOS 7 also.  I love the cloud feature and the integration of all of my Amazon services.Amazon gave 500 coins, which was about $5.00 to try some apps.  I purchased a game and a move rental.  Screen was clear and sharp for all videos, including the rental and videos on Amazon Prime.  But the games seem to lose resolution.  I am going to assume its due the games haven't been formatted for new higher resolution screen.Design was sharp looking and Kindle is lighter than the iPad Air, but the plastic makes it feel less expensive and not as sturdy as I feel with the iPad Air.  I did like the separation of the Left and Right speakers, gave it a more stereo feel to it.Price was great, cheaper than iPad Air, this comes with my biggest issue.  All my apps, games, music, and movies are from iTunes.  Even though I really enjoyed the Kindle, it will require me to make another couple of thousand of dollars investment to switch from iTunes to Amazon.  Which I cannot do.

For most of the years since I have had an Archos because up to this point nothing else beat it for speed, resolution or versatility (compatibility with the broadest array of file types).  My Archos 101 G9 Turbo ICS 8GB 10-Inch Tablet 2 generations back still beats the specs of most existing tablets.  I read a lot of reviews before I buy and am usually up on not only what is out, but what has not yet been released.  I finally bought a kindle this year because it is the first tablet that bests the Archos on speed, resolution and value.  I went to best buy to look at it and had a hard time getting near it. The kids were lined up, could not put it down.  It really is as fast as a console.  Most people honestly do not need this much speed lol.  Where it will shine for the average person is in superior video, high pixel count, clarity of color.  It was the improved color rendering which was most noticeable to me.  I am amazed at reviews complaining about either speed or resolution. Nothing else out now touches it.  The form factor and build quality are really nice.  This is a wonderful little device which really is beyond the needs of most people.  There is little to legitimately complain about.  Most of the valid criticism I have seen has to do with access to the play store.  For me it is not an issue. I have been able to find all the aps I want or need on Amazon, but I do understand that some people want specific things for business which may or may not be available.  If that is a potential issue for you check Amazon's ap store.But, honestly, ignore reviews complaining about speed or screen resolution.  Go to any tech site and you will see that this tablet is the highest on both counts.I really didn't *need* a new tablet. I have 4 already :O but was grabbed by the form factor and build, had to check out the screen.  It really is an instant on tablet with just gorgeous color rendition and amazing clarity.

I knew early on that the Kindle HDX was not meant to be a full featured tablet like the Thrive and Nexus. But I was still disappointed at how much Amazon unnecessarily left out or disabled features that are common on Android tablets. The Mojito OS takes some getting used to even if you are accustomed to Android, not seeing a whole list of configuration options was a little jarring. But overall the HDX OS performed very smoothly.PROS:- Lightweight. About a third of what my Thrive tablet used to weigh.- Great display and video.- Sound was clear and crisp.- Nice case texture and screen. The back has a subtle rubber texture that makes it very easy and comfortable to hold. The screen is super smooth; it feels like you're moving your finger on an oily surface.- Painless E-Mail & Calendar Sync. I was able to connect my Google GMail account to the HDX's email client quickly and easily. However the email & calendar client are basic and limited in what they can show. For example my GMail Inbox message categories did not carry over into the HDX email client.- Speedy performance. I was able to stream Prime movies with no noticeable lag.- Connection to Amazon.com was seamless. When I took my HDX out of the box it recognized me right away and connected me to my account.- Mayday Tech Support. Really works as advertised. I was connected to a tech adviser in about 30 seconds. He was knowledgeable although he did misunderstand my initial problem and I had to interrupt to correct him.CONS:- Speech-to-Text(Voice Dictation). This is a new feature that was added in an update after my purchase. Is accurate but is noticeably slower than the voice recognition in other Android devices.- No GPS. I have read conflicting reports on whether or not the HDX has GPS or not. Either way using your HDX with GPS enabled apps is a no go.- No Haptic Feedback. It would've been nice to have a tablet that provided tactile feedback for text entry and games.- Bad photos with the Camera. My HDX took pics that were very grainy with inaccurate color. The photo options available for the HDX are also very limited. About the only things that you can change while taking a picture are the flash and panorama modes. You cannot adjust the white levels, spot metering, etc.- Limited personalization options. On my old Android tablet I like being able to organize my apps as I saw fit. Also I liked being able to change the wallpaper every now and them. There is no way to do these things with the HDX.At this point I'm torn on whether to keep my HDX or to return it. I like the idea of watching Prime Movies on a tablet even if I am not connected to the internet. However not having basic tablet functions is very frustrating. Also Amazon makes no promises that the problems will be addressed in the future. All I was told by Kindle Support was that a new update was coming soon.

I was in the market for a new tablet anyway so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to test the kindle.  I own a first generation iPad retina already and I'm looking to possibly upgrade to the Air.  Amazon puts the Kindle HDX 8.9 directly against the Air.I will start the comparison with my current retina.  When I unpacked the HDX the first thing that stands out is the weight of the machine.  It's very light and comfortable to hold.  Seams appear tight, however the plastic housing feels a bit cheap.  No doubt they used the plastic to cut weight but it does not have a quality feel and I worry about it's durability.  Next I plugged the HDX in, the plug is either purposefully angled awkwardly up (I doubt it) or it's just poorly aligned when built.  The plug works, but it is not anywhere as smooth to plug as the lightning plug on my 5s and on the new air.  It's about as easy to plug as the old Apple 30 pin on my retina.Once it was fired up and ready to roll the home screen is fairly spartan.  I decided to open my Amazon cloud account and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my stuff there and waiting.  Your Amazon account is very nicely linked to HDX.  I pulled up BB King's \"Live in Japan\" on both the HDX and my Retina iPad and did some side by side audio.  There is no easy way to put this, the HDX is an audio dud with the external speakers.  the iPad was capable of getting much louder, clearer and better bass response.  I tried with both on flat hard surfaces and holding in hand.  I use the external speakers when I'm working on projects around the house and want some music around so this is a fairly important feature to me.  Next came the headphones test.  Both performed equally with my Klipsch S4i headphones and my Sennheiser over ear headphones.My Amazon prime streaming was very handy on the HDX.  Easy to access and I had zero issue streaming HD quality movies.When it comes to the screen it's a bit off a toss up between the Retina and the HDX.  The HDX is capable of a slightly sharper image thanks to the higher resolution but the Retina has better colors...The HDX display just looked dull.  Whites appeared with a distinct yellow tint and nothing seemed to pop off the screen. Try as I might, I could not get it to display colors as well as my Retina.  But again, the resolution is sharper on the HDX so you need to decide whats more important to you.  To me, the colors are far more important so I will say that I prefer the Retina display, slightly, but it's still my preference.In terms of general use.  I do not, at all, like the lay out of the HDX.  Simply finding things is much more of a chore compared to the iOS layout.  This might be more to do with the fact that I'm very accustomed to iOS, but I would like to think that a well laid out tablet is something that you can pick up and it feels great right away.  I never really had a learning curve on any iOS device, it was all fairly natural.  It's hard to blame Amazon here, ease of use is something Apple has been leading the industry on for a long time, but Amazon does have a long way to go to catch Apple here.Next I did some simple web browsing.  Silk on the HDX was VERY disappointing...It's a standard web browser, but it was not smooth at all.  Load times were twice that of my Retina and scrolling up and down pages was vert stuttered.  Safari on my Retina is very smooth and very quick.  Keep in mind this is a two year old machine.Besides Safari Vs. Silk, the Retina and HDX seemed to run at about the same pace, if not slightly quicker on the Retina.  Very upsetting considering the Retina by Apple terms is a slug now.  In all reality my 5s runs circles around the HDX.When I was visiting a friend that I know picked up a brand new Air, I brought the HDX with me to do a direct head to head.  Now that it's all said and done, Amazon has zero business comparing the HDX to anything Apple is producing today...The Air just blew the HDX out of the water in nearly every aspect.  Once again, the only thing the HDX had on the Air was the resolution.  The Air loaded everything faster, was snappy and smooth as butter.The HDX is lighter, but it's also a smaller screen...IF you consider the extra screen size, the weight difference is in my opinion a non factor.  Add to that the Air keeps that solid quality Apple feel with it's metal case.  I found the Air to feel very light and nearly as tiresome to hold as my Retina.With the Air everything that has bothered me about my Retina since the latest rollout of iOS is fixed.  Mainly my Retina is now a bit laggy.  Most notably when typing.  The HDX touchscreen keyboard was hands down the worst part of it.  Almost impossible to type on in my opinion.  Laggy and a lot of mistypes compared to my iPad and even my 5s.All in all, this is not a BAD product.  But to act like it competes with the Air is just down right false.If $400 is your MAX budget, I would go with the iPad Mini Retina all day long.  If you can swing the $500 for the Air, it's no contest.My advice to Amazon, continue to fine tune this thing.  The next generation NEEDS to be MUCH faster and the HDX screen must display better colors.Maybe in the future, but it's just not there yet to sway me away from from Apple.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Amazon.com Fan", "ReviewID": "RHJVV00FGIZG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful, light, thin, fast, easy to use...the new Kindle HDX seamlessly incorporated all my videos, magazines and books from my other Kindle devises within seconds of the very simple and short setup.

The HDX support asked me to download some log files (by typing ;dm in the home search) to my laptop for emailing.  Alas the zipped logs exceeded the 6MB amazon email limit so I had to unzip and repackage the logs to be sent in 5 separate emails.  I stopped trying to solve the issue and returned the kindle when I found out that the email that Amazon told me to reply to was a donotreply address.I went with the kindle because I was willing to accept the kindle-ized version of android as long as everything worked smoothly and I coudl enjoy the amazon content.

However, I have always stayed away from tablets as I work with workstations and servers.  I was finally drawn into the tablet market when I saw how well the Kindle fire 8.9 HDX could play videos.  My main concern was the cost of having to pay for 4G option to be able to have access to the internet all of the time.  I opted out of the 4G option and went with the 64 GB for the following reason.  I can sideload ( another way of saying copying files from your pc to the kindle via the usb cable) many of my MP4 movies and photo charts and mp3 music files ot my Kindle.  I can even make a folder on the kindle when connected to my pc using the pc to do the work.  So, you can have personal folders for putting all of you material into an organized matter.  You can also turn off \"auto update to personal cloud\" so you do not go over your personal 5GB of space free.  The battery stays charged longer when wifi is off (known as airplane mode which you can set on your kindle).  I had to order the 64GB directly from amazon as Best Buy does not carry the 64GB option.  I have placed a lot of charts, books and personal videos and personal music files on the kindle and still have only used up around 5 GB of space with around 49 GB still available.  The 64 GB model actually uses around 5+ GB of system memory so you end up with around 58 GB available for storage space when you first turn it on.The back camera takes a very high quality movie file in mp4 format.  It played back upside down at first on my pc but I used premiere to flip the video and exported it to a straight up video.If you take a picture with the back camera you will get a very high quality photo.  The catch is that if you email the pic to yourself it will be of a size around `1600 x 1200 picture.  If you hook it up to your computer via the usb cable then you will find it under a Dicom folder looking for camera then look through the subfolders and the file will be located.  copying from the dicom folder to your pc will end up giving you the maximum size of the photo without being sized down.  So it is extremely high resoulution at 300 dpi.Also if you want to turn off the auto to personal cloud  you will go through the settings device storage personal movies settings and buried that deep is the option to turn off auto load to personal cloud.  recommend you turn that feature off.The speakers give you great audio for personal use while you may need to use an external speaker for a louder sound.  In mentioning this the Bluetooth external speakers around 49 and below do not play any louder than the speakers you all ready have so you do not need to purchase a blue tooth speaker unless of course you get a high end one with high gain at 100 dollars or more.I would recommend this (64GB) to anyone who has lots of mp4 videos and charts and pictures and music to sideloadI played netflix on my kindle via the wifi in Books a Million and it played great.

A friend gave me the Kindle Fire HDX with 64g as a gift.  My first impression was OMG at the beautiful screen.  It is so clean and clear and just gorgeous!  A little smaller than a 10\", but come on.  Not really noticeable.  Watching movies and everything else is just plain great.I was very surprised that a lot of my Apple products automatically synced with Kindle with no hassle whatsoever.  I also have a Energi charger for my iPad that also works with the Kindle!  I was amazed.Mayday, where you have access to 24/7 help, is awesome.  Where else can you get service like this?  Try and even find a live person on Apple to help you.  I dare you.  I was having trouble with setting up music and they walked me right through it.I found it difficult to figure out setting up music and movies.  I was used to iTunes and I just couldn't figure out the Cloud Player.  I find it sort of clumsy, but after I figured it out it was no problem.  Amazon books and music are cheaper than iTunes.  I have an Apple TV and now Amazon plays on there as well.I read that getting 64 gig wasn't necessary.  Well, music and movies and photos take up most of your space.  Even though Amazon doesn't allow you to have a ton of videos on your device, we always end up using more space than we think we will.  On my Apple devices, I have my music and audiobooks on my ipod.  I put my photos on my computer.  The rest goes on my Ipad.  With Kindle, I can pretty much put it all on one device, if I choose to do so.Amazon Prime does not have the movie and tv selection for free that Netflix or Hulu have.  They need to work on that.  But the free shipping more than offsets this little glitch.I also love Amazon because you can get help.  If something goes wrong or you get a product you don't like, they make it right.  You get your money back and they help you and they appear to listen.  So I am a big Amazon fan and always will be.  In this day and age, customer service is important to me.Lots of neat little features.  Too many to go into here.I do not like the email, the way it is set up.  Confusing and just pretty much hate it.  I get emails much quicker on my ipad. Don't like the keypad.  It's a little different in that the space bar is small and there's a period next to it, so I keep hitting the period.  Little stuff I don't like, and it doesn't matter in the scheme of things.I don't have an Ipad Air, but from what I've read, it's probably awesome.  But I got 64 gig of memory and an awesome tablet with wonderful features for $439 on a Kindle.  Try buying an Ipad Air with 64 gig and see what it costs you.I think it all comes down to what do you want from your tablet, which will probably last you about three years.  If it doesn't go bad, technology will move forward and you will want to replace it.  I think Amazon hit a home run with their Kindle HDX.  I have had it a couple weeks and I absolutely love it.  Oh, and by the way.  I did not get the Origami case for it.  I bought a bundle called DigitalsOnDemand and it gave me the most awesome leather case, sleeve cover, stylus pen, USB cable, chargers, etc...  a steal for the money.  The screen protector was a piece of junk, so I got the Moshi iVisor XT.And best of all.  Try it and if you don't like it, send it back.  You can't go wrong.  You can't do that with Apple.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Even a seventy year old can use it.", "Author": "NC. movie man", "ReviewID": "R3NPR4JCG425VE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I want to say I know nothing about computers only how to turn them on and off but I love to read I saw the 7\"HD and wanted it. My son fell in love with it so I ordered the 9.8 HD because of the bigger screen loved that so I gave my son the 7\" the 9.8 HDX came out I wanted it for the mayday. The others I had no trouble getting the wi-fi working but this one no matter what I did it would not connect so I hit the mayday a very nice young girl came on I told her my problem. She asked if she could take over my screen I told her by all means so bless her heart she did everything she could to connect it for me, she told me I had to get a number from my IP what ever that is so I call the telephone service they gave it to me, well I hit the mayday button again, this time an older man came on I told him what the little girl did and about IP he said I didn't need that he took over in 10 seconds it was up and running. Have not used it again but it's so nice to know it's there for old farts like me. I say jump on it, get the protection plan if you are butter fingers like me you will need it. There is no hue around the screen like I have read, I can't see for the life of me why some on here has been giving it one star. The picture is so clear the sound I am hard of hearing had to use head phones with my others I can hear this one very well. I can take pictures of my grand kids and e-mail them to my computer after my son showed me how. Word of advice don't buy a cheap cover the back camera will not slide up to take them it's a pain taking it out of the cover. Oh yes one more thing I didn't know anything about the point credits on my prime card I came across them by chance at the time I made up my mind to go for it, between the points and the one time fifty off  I only paid one hundred and twenty five dollars so check for them.

Price, need a tablet, want a tablet, buy most your products off Amazon.When I first got it, I was in need of downloading a file manager or else I was stuck wondering how to access them. My head was hurting at trying to find apps I might actually use. My head still hurts while attempting to find games I would like that are both paid and free. No Google Play store, so Amazon forces you to buy their products. There are ways around this, but it has been a few weeks so far and I have not even found many apk files I am happy with. I swear Amazon would sell nearly 10 times more tablets if their tablet were already rooted, and I would be willing to pay an extra $50 to Amazon for this feature.Samsung Galaxy phones are rooted and I buy things from Google Play because there is more, but I also use Amazon shopping app for when I am not at home. If Amazon were to contract for Google Play on their tablet, it would solve at least 80% of my problems with this thing and likely make Amazon a ton of money off Google's apps through the tablet. Of course, some CEOs of Amazon might not consider this, or there might have been contract negotiations but they were not in agreement. Could just be that CEOs are not the brightest in the company.I love Amazon, I love most of the ways they handle their business. I just do not like some of their marketing schemes, or most of them. With talks of Amazon now in favor of closing off online tax loopholes they once used to gain their wealth as a company, to an increased yearly subscription fee which is marketed mainly for their video services, to the best of the low-priced tablets forcing you to spend money on them even though they can make more money by catering to the consumer's wants.I bought my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Wi-Fi 64GB for a decent price. I think the current price is steep, and would suggest buying for substantially less until they can either \"root\" it or add Google Play so that you feel the need to use it more than you think you might. I was thinking of nearly selling it back to someone just because of the headache. Do yourself a favor though, and take a look at it carefully if you know someone who has this.The screen is bright, you can get many apps still off the web built in to the software, and overall am satisfied with this machine only because I know my way around roadblocks with computers and phones. If you like to read, watch movies, browse the web this is a great tablet. If you like to play games or are not much knowledgeable about current tech, I suggest against buying this. Oh, and it only seems to use keyboard controls, not gamepad controls.

This means no Mp3 store, and no video streaming for me. This could be a showstopper when contemplating the HDX in my situation. I've had every Eink Kindle except the Kindle 1 and the big DX. I've sold my old models when upgrading to the newer device. My most recent Eink Kindle was the Paperwhite 1 3G. When upgrading, and passing on to my son the Kindle Fire HD 1, 7\" to get the HDX 7, the latter gave me such a good reading experience (in addition to the much improved browser, speed and form factor) that I sold my Paperwhite 1 3G without upgrading to the Paperwhite 2, and switched fully to reading on KF HDX LCD. I had to get used to it, but I read several hours per day, without complaint and the only gripe I have is the lesser battery time compared to an Eink Kindle, although the lighting has speeded up the drainage in the Paperwhite.  In practice, the battery life is quite sufficient to last a full day of reading and surfing the web. When comparing the HDX 7 with larger tablets in shops, I found the bigger screens very comfy for reading and surfing. That made me buy the HDX 8.9. I thought for a long time about buying the ipad mini retina, but the HDX 8.9 had a bigger screen for less (32gb version) and the awesome integrated Amazon experience and after sales. Plus, the Kindle reader software  is the best, more optioned out, on a Kindle device. The geographical mp3 and video restrictions I took for granted, because I mostly read and surf. Plus, Spotify takes care of the music streaming for now.I'm very pleased with the HDX 8.9, it is as fast as the HDX7, and the screen is even better, in particular the more even gray reading background. The text sharpness and colors are incredible. The overall size is not too big, though the HDX 7 disappears in you hands and flips into a coat pocket and has the edge in that respect. The 8.9 weight is low, even with the wonderful origami cover. The camera is good, and the speakers are the same good quality as the HDX 7. The 8.9\" screen really opens up an Ebook page, and web surfing is luxurious compared to a smaller screen. Compared to the newest iPad models screens, the HDX 8.9 does not disappoint, to say the least. To hold, the HDX 8.9 is more comfy than the Air, lighter and less slippery, and even, in my opinion than the iPad mini. On a personal note, I always liked the Fire Home screen better than the somewhat \"paler\" iPad home screen with the smaller app icons. The slightly compromised handling compared to the HDX 7 is a compromise that comes with the bigger screen. For me, it is worth the trade off.

It is comparable to the Apple i Pad Air, but a whopping 35% less expensive, saving you a lot of money.  Forget that the Kindle is Amazon-centric (the i Pad is Apple-centric anyway), this device has a beautifully crisp and bright display as well as exceptional speed.  But most importantly, it has the 'Mayday' button which has prevented much anxiety between my wife and I over tutoring of the tablet.  I don't own a Kindle myself, so when my wife asks for help, I am usually at a loss for the answer because I have no Kindle experience.  Enter the relationship saving (just kidding) 'Mayday' button.  If I am unable to help answer a question, 'Mayday' is initiated and I stay close by to help explain the question/need/issue.  The wait for assistance has always been very short.  The 'Mayday' folks have been amazing with their product and accessory knowledge, as well as their patience and guidance.  The fact that the 'Mayday' people are able to see the user's screen and circle items that the user is seeing on-screen and may need to access or be aware of during the tutoring ('Mayday')session is an amazing boon for those who are non-verbal learners.  I would recommend this device to anyone who is unfamiliar with technology, doesn't own a cell phone and is still using an alpha-numeric pager,any non-linear thinker, anyone who is dyslexic or unable to grasp 'state of the art' gadgets.  It certainly makes technology much more accessible and usable for those people.

It's slow, it can screw up page rendering by placing graphics over text, it's inflexible to font size adjustment (a BIG use-case Amazon should know better being a book company), and it can make font blurry upon the end of scrolling a page (and won't sharpen the font unless you tap on the screen a couple times).  I've tested tens of websites using the Kindle HDX 8.9\" via the Silk browser vs laptops (Macbook and Win7, a fair comparison because many tablets are replacing laptop purchases) from Facebook to worldbank.org to programming sites to wikipedia to government sites (ex. cdc.gov) to search sites (like Yahoo...this case it doesn't seem to work as well holding the tablet in landscape mode) investment sites (ex. The Motley Fool). They all get screwed up somehow, some-way, even if the screw-up is just crazy-slow page loading (probably partly due to how Silk traffic gets redirected to Amazon servers). This is a big problem for a device like this because a core competency of tablets are web browsing.Thus, I give the product a low ranking and I will most likely return it to Amazon because Amazon does not provide web browser alternatives on their app store (which I don't blame them, but then the company better deliver on an awesome web browser solution, which the company certainly does not).  It pains me to say this, because I really like the potential of this device, I just cannot get around justifying an almost $400 tablet with crummy web browsing that you really have no work-around solution (like try an alternative web browser).If you want to read further, below is a specific example of one site and example issues I run into and then an example on how Silk could be better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Goto http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/computersciencetheory/sortcomp.html (yes, I work in computers).Problem 1- tiny font. Even setting the Kindle OS settings to \"big font\" will not fix the font. Yes, I can zoom in w/my fingers but then I have to always side swipe and scroll the screen to read the text.  I want Silk to be able to increase the font settings and re-render the page so the font fits within the viewable window.  This is something Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all do well via \"hold Ctrl key, then hit + +\" key sequence on laptops.Problem 2.- Silk does give you the option of hitting \"reading view\" button, IF the button it actually appears for that page (does not always happen). For this page it does.  Sometimes the \"reading view\" button does provide a good reading experience. however, not in this case.  Two problems occur: 1. Scrolling the window and when it stops there is nothing but blurred, almost unreadable font.  Tapping the screen a few times seems to correct it.  2. It makes the main text font SMALLER and cannot be adjusted at all (no zoom and the 'increase font key' only adjusts the title of the page).How I would like Silk to work?  A good start is exactly mimicking the wikipedia.org phone app you can download to the HDX device for every web site Silk encounters (not just wikipedia web pages).  For a phone app, the wikipedia does a pretty good job re-rendering wikipedia pages and sticking graphics in the right place when you increase the font size on the HDX (I set it to 300% font size and it's plenty easy on the eyes).  It will be easy to see the shortcomings of Silk browser by just surfing and clicking wikipedia pages (and comparing it to either the wikipedia app running on the HDX or a web browser on a laptop).", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cajun", "Author": "Robert C.

Here are some thoughts1) The screen--its pretty amazing.  Bright and clear with great colors, and its very high resolution.  I believe its a low temperature silicon on LCD screen like the nexus 7.  Its really good. It makes the solid ips screen of the LG  G 8.3 tablet look tame by comparison.The source material is important--but streaming episodes of sherlock or the movie D13- Ultimatum looks amazing. Lower res stuff on netflix not so much, but if its quality video, you will not be sorry.  I could see the pores on Martin Freeman's face!  Just imagine if Edward James Olmos was on Sherlock!2) The sound--the speakers are good and louder than most tablets--surely way louder than the lg 8.3 tablet or the nexus 7. But they could be louder.  Why are they on the BACK of the device and not the front?3)  Construction-high quality--for plastic is impressive and yes, shockingly light.  I am a bit confounded by the button placement, which forces it to be in landscape orientation more than portrait, but its not a deal breaker.  Fortunately its so light it makes for different orientations still pretty easy--and way better in this regard than the samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition (and its much lighter)The snapdragon 800 processor in this is a beast and is very impressively fast and responsive.  Plenty of horsepower here for most everything you can throw at it.4) The software--this is really for Amazon consumption of media--be it audio, songs, or video.  Its not really an android tablet although android powers it--no access to google play store.  For productivity....I think you will have some issues.Given limitations in video downloads from the amazon store and the size of the amazon app store vs the google play store, I'm not sure if you need a 64 gig tablet--this one seems to be best as a home media streaming device, not a road warrior, but I will revise the longer I have it.Aside from a few minor quirks (button, speakers) its a winner. Just keep in mind--it does not have access to the google play store so it is NOT really an android tablet--it has a different function.I guess you can try to hack the tablet but it will void warranty and its easy to ruin it in a lockup or \"brick\" the device and then you are out of luck.

The Nexus is wonderful. Although it is a great size at 8.9 inches, I find the Fire tablet to be very frustrating.When using the keyboard it seems that it put spaces in all over the place and is very hard to type what we want. When editing it is almost impossible to put the cursor where you want it - sometimes the cursor is not visible and sometimes it isn't showing up even though the computer has you set to type from that spot . The capitalization seems to jump around without asking it to. It seems to put a space at the beginning of each paragraph, and takes several steps to get rid of it since you can't move the cursor accurately. Voice recognition is ever so much better on the Google Nexus.  And in general the screen touch sensitivity just seems to be off.  Lots of retyping.When you set a bookmark it is named sometimes in caps sometimes not, sometimes with icons and sometimes not.  Bookmarks are in one menu system at the top left. Saving a bookmark is in another menu on the right. The buttons on the edge of the screen are not there for some of the applications, so you have to get completely out of the application to get the home button back.We knew that the application store would not include many of the games and other applications that are available on all other tablets. Didn't think that would be such a big deal. But to discover that some very common applications and games are not available in any way on this tablet makes it much less useful.I could go on with many other little frustrations, and there are many more .

The app selection is seriously lacking and the apps that they do offer are way behind the ball on updates.

Most of the stuff can be accessed in a roundabout way or over the Internet, but certainly not as convenient.

I started my reviews recently but I have been a member of Amazon since the company started selling online in 1995. I am not a person that says, \"I know it all\" but trust me, I purchase thousands of dollars worth of products a year from Amazon. If I do not like the item after testing it or wearing it or even better, looking at the way it was manufactured, I return it.I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" 32GB for my mother for Christmas. My brother bought her the iPad Air. After my mother used both tablets, we returned the iPad Air because it was so difficult to use especially with the game Ruzzle, the play screens and layout were for some reason different and confusing on the iPad, just to name a few negatives.My mom uses the Kindle HDX Tablet for email, a few games and surfing the net. She reads her books on it and jots down notes with the tablet. The Kindle HDX is one Amazing Tablet and for the price, you cannot beat the deal! The screen is crystal clear, sharp and vivid. The colors are bright, true, and brilliant.Amazon \"Nailed It\" with the Kindle vs. iPad TV Ad. The Kindle is a fraction of the cost and the quality of the Kindle HDX is just as good if not better than the iPad. With Apple, you are paying for the name, nothing else. Apple gives you nothing extra, in fact, the iPad is a Tablet with no bells or whistles but yet because the name Apple is written on it, the company feels they can \"Rip-Off\" the customer and charge an arm and a leg for the iPad. Also, Apple tracks you all over the web including the push for you to purchase the Apple Cloud Storage space. This is sale smasher in itself. No company will tell me I have to purchase cloud storage when the cloud is not safe.When we first registered the iPad, Apple wanted all kinds of information, it was intrusive and aggravating. Registering the Kindle HDX was as simple as a few clicks.The iPad cannot even run flash, we tried, it would not work.Buy the Kindle HDX, you will not look back especially for the price you paid. If Amazon puts an SD Card Slot in the next version of the Kindle, it will be a hands down slam dunk winner and could crush Samsung.I hope this review helped.

This feature works pretty damn good. See:dmediamomDotCom/2013/12/11/are-you-using-the-kindle-fire-hdx-dictation-feature/2 - Screen, duh! It *is* nice and everybody has talked about it.3 - Keyboard, especially \"long-press\" for numbers and special characters.4 - There is a scrollable word correction display as you type that would be annoying on an android phone but work well here.5 - Battery charges to 100% overnight and I have never gone below 50% with the exact same usage I gave my laptop every day. But I do not remain tethered to it like some people that I know. As for playing games, although I had about a dozen on the HDX I did not find one addictive enough to play for more than just a little while.The Bad (FYI, submitted to Amazon's returns-feedback email address.)1- Documents I copied over according to directions that the HDX provided after clicking on the \"Docs\" menu were not showing up in the docs section. I copied them over in individual year-dated subdirectories that the HDX does not recognize. It appears that, although folders (sub-directories) can be copied from laptops to Documents through Android File Manager (AFM) and are visible on the kindle through AFM, the Kindle software through the DOCS menu cannot see sub-directories (folders). I have several years of files on my laptop that reside in their respective years' folders. It appears the only option I have is to copy every year into the single Documents folder on the Kindle. This is unacceptable as it would make sorting (without renaming each and every file) impossible because most of the files have the same name. Sub-directories and sub-folders have been included since computers' existence. Leaving such a basic capability out (it is not even a \"feature\" but a common sense capability of all computing) makes the Kindle Fire HDX \"Documents\" menu item useless. This screams for a software update. Fortunately, I could see the document subdirectories in ES file explorer and in Kingsoft Office.2 - I also tried using the email documents option. The only problem with that is you cannot edit documents once they get to Kindle because double-clicking on the document pops it into Kindle like it was a non-editable book.3 - I could not watch live internet television due to I get the \"need to update flash player.\" Sideloading Adobe Flash works but audio/visual is out of sync. I tried with both Firefox and Dolphin. Forums here and on XDA were no help. \"Mayday\" rep said \"they are working on it and I will submit a ticket.\" Like that would help with a known issue.4 - Attempted to watch CBS's new series Intelligence.\" When prompted, I allowed Amazon's BETA streaming player to load but the video/audio sync is still off. Audio is before video. To confirm it was not my router, I put the Kindle HDX next to my laptop and started both of them at the same time. My laptop was perfectly sync'ed. [Note I was only offered to use this BETA software when watching CBS, not CNN or other networks streaming through the internet.]5 - The most disturbing thing to me is that after using Amazon's BETA streaming player for 30 minutes it started playing commercials! It even-numbered them in the top left corner one of five. The same exact feed through my internet router had ZERO commercials. I paid $15 to not be bothered with commercials but yet I get them on Amazon's BETA streaming player! I don't care if it is a beta player. I am not going to be a beta tester after paying nearly $500! This was the final straw for me deciding to return the HDX.\"Mayday\" rep had not heard of, nor had any notification of an Amazon BETA streaming player. Such things are to be expected from large corporations that typically do not inform Customer Service Reps about BETAs or updates. However, even after the rep put me on hold (meaning she was asking someone else), she denied any knowledge of any such \"workaround\" and suggested I sideload Adobe Flash. I explained I already tried that.From my career as a Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 CSR and trainer in hardware and software support I know that even the best CSR's will not know everything if they don't think outside of the box and keep asking questions from \"veteran\" reps and their Systems people. Instead, I received the \"I apologize\" excuse ad infinitum despite the fact that I told the rep that she had no reason to apologize as it was not her fault that a basic feature expected from all such hardware is sorely lacking in the HDX.6 - If you are used to texting on your phone, type and edit in portrait mode. Typing in landscape is difficult. Swipe is not supported. Every piece of nonsupported software that I try to sideload eventually had glitches and problems trying to run on the HDX.7 - I explained that I could not find a way to change the internet background color on websites in Silk. The white background is hard on my eyes and the screen has a bad glare on it. She hesitated for a moment, checked her screen and advised that there indeed was no way to change it. I now know that changing to \"Reader View\" allows for font and color changes. The \"Mayday\" rep was either not sufficiently trained or was not provided hands-on testing after the training; either of which would have solved that problem.8 - As far as the Carousel is concerned, I want the same icons on it every time and I don't want them moving around based on usage frequency. And, adding the first photo from the photo collection to the carousel each and every time I go to photos even if I never looked at that first photo is really annoying. The rep explained that she understood and started to explain my options of deleting or moving each Carousel item. I explained that I already knew this as well as just scrolling the Carousel up to hide it but that lack of simple customization is frustrating.9 - If I attach a photo to an email and then later go out and choose photos from the top menu it brings up the email. Just a tiny bug that can probably be quickly fixed. This should have been caught before rushing this to market but this type of bug is typical for corporations that rush products to market to beat holiday (or other internal) deadlines.10 - Screen glare is bad especially on the Bezel. A color other than white might help the screen background but the only option to change the screen background is while reading a Kindle book or in Silk's \"Reading Mode.\" A black bezel is not recommended for any product if you will be using it in a brightly-lit room or where there is artificial light behind you. I notice no difference from my current laptop's 1680x1050 resolution except my laptop glare is much less.11 -  It is a fingerprint magnet. You need to leave a soft glasses cleaner cloth nearby.12- As almost all people have noticed, there is a pesky backlight issue. At first I thought it was because of the extremely sensitive screen but it makes no difference how long you leave your finger on the screen. Moving from screen to screen causes the screen to change from bright to dim with auto-brightness turned off. The screen is way too dim with auto-brightness turned on.13 - I could not access Kindle book discussions from the book menu. I do not think HDX is a complete \"fail\" or the software is completely broken but, even as a PRIME, movie-watching member, I can't live with it. You will need time and patience for its learning curve and for software updates if you need to do more than what it was designed for, reading books and watching Prime movies.Last, it was very difficult to hear my \"Mayday\" rep [name omitted for this review], even with the HDX volume turned all the way up and my home completely quiet. This may also be attributed to either not having her headset adjusted correctly or her non-English accent.  And NO, there is nothing wrong with my hearing! I got the definite impression that she was extremely uncomfortable in her job due to she was not prepared. Hiring bi-lingual reps strictly for their language capabilities and ignoring their lack of customer service experience and lack of communication skills is a Human Resources issue that I strongly suggest Amazon address if they want to keep their \"#1 Customer Satisfaction\" rating.\" Finally, when I asked the \"Mayday\" rep to help start my return process, she again put me on hold and a minute later another (male) rep came on the line. I could hear him saying hello to me but because the original rep left her system on hold, he could not hear me, nor could I see him. He continued to try saying hello to me with my hellos going un-answered for 5 minutes until the connection was lost. My email address was previously confirmed and the first rep accessed my account so they also had my phone number. When a connection is lost, common customer service dictates the rep attempt to contact the customer again. Not here! This experience was the poorest I have ever received from any company in my 30 years of IT experience.

First off, if you are going to get a Kindle, get this one.  While I am not sure the screen upgrade is noticeable under the majority of conditions, the processor upgrade definitely is.  The HDX is much faster and more fluid, whereas the regular HD is noticeably sluggish and does not handle things like streaming movies nearly as well.  If you are using it primarily as a media device (reading, watching movies, listening to music) the HDX does pretty well.  It has a simple to use interface, the carousel makes it easy to get back to things you were recently viewing or using like tv shows or apps, Amazon purchased movies, music etc automatically show up--no searching for apps and hoping they work, just click on music or movies and they are there.  If you want to watch Vikings using the History app it actually works, whereas the ipad hangs most of the time (the Dell doesn't have the HC app but you can just go to the website and it works fine--the Dell is much faster/more at home on the web than the others).  So while the Ipad has more apps, they are much more likely to not work from my testing, whereas the Kindle ones, though fewer, seem more likely to actually work.  Your basic multimedia apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc are there (though not Vudu at the time of this review).  There is a Roku app so you can use the Kindle as the remote for your Roku if you have one (which gets you a keyboard rather than picking out each letter when searching).  The speakers are quite good, noticeable on music compared to the ipad.  Main downsides would be a smaller screen than the competitors mentioned, and it is somewhat pricey, especially compared to the Dell Venue Pro 8, which has a larger screen and the more full operating system if you are looking for more of a netbook replacement.  It also seems somewhat slow to charge and doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as the others mentioned, which is somewhat odd given the smaller screen size.  The browser is somewhat cheesy and internet usage is slower than with the Dell/Windows device, probably on a par with the Ipad which is also somewhat slow (although when I say that it is comparable with the ipad using Mercury, Safari is pretty bad so the Kindle probably does better than the ipad using the default Safari).  The HDX seems to find and connect to networks faster/more smoothly than the Ipad, which again seems sluggish at that and tends to hang.  The only other con I can think of is for Android devices in general not just the kindle, and that would be the Big Brotherish nature of Android apps compared to say a comparable windows one (and we don't know on Apple ones, since they don't seem to even let you know what permissions you are granting).  An app that from the Windows side wants 1-3 permissions might well want a dozen or more from Android, and you are left wondering why some basic calculator app or whatever needs to have access to all of your contacts, identity, location, etc., so if you worry about such things you end up using a lot less of the apps than you might, even though they are available.  Still, if you want an easy to use no hassles way to watch movies, read books, listen to music, and occasionally browse the web a bit, the Kindle is the way to go.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB", "Author": "Donald Ngai \"Donald\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q5NV0TKTIOKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and couldn't wait to trade it in when the new version came out.

If I could I'd give it a 3.5 star rating, but I can't quite bring myself to give it 4 stars.  I was really, really hoping for this tablet to be better than it is.  While there are plenty of pluses, the minuses are just too significant.On the plus side, I love how sharp and bright the display is, and it is incredibly light (even after I added a bluetooth keyboard/case to it).  As someone who is very invested in Amazon products (on my Android phone I am all about the Amazon MP3 player and Kindle e-reader app), it is great to have a device that doesn't have all that Google Play bloatware on it, and I love that the music player and e-reader are integrated into the OS on the Kindle Fire (although there are a few things about the music player that could be better).But now for the downside (and there's much more downside than I'd like).  Firstlly, the tablet is glitchy.  I'm constantly finding that when I click on an icon on the home page, nothing happens, and I have to go up to the carousel to get the app to start (which is really annoying when the app I want to use is one I haven't used in a while, so I have to scroll through the carousel trying to find it).  And even more frustrating is how many apps I have that routinely crash.  This seems especially true for high end apps (like almost all of the games I play on it).So while I love the integration with Amazon, and have no complaints about the interface, at the end of the day Amazon needs to put a lot more effort into making their operating system more stable than it is.  I don't know if the problem is that FireOS is starting to be enough different from Android that standard Android apps aren't fully compatible, but whatever it is, it is something Amazon needs to address sooner rather than later if they want the Kindle Fire HDX to truly be a top-end tablet.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the best!!", "Author": "Amazon fan \"Lourdes\"", "ReviewID": "R17623EMKCEQ9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 a few months ago.

The real power isn't fully realized unless combined with Amazon Prime - seamlessly integrated into the operating system. If you have a bunch of Apple or Google Play content, the case for the HDX isn't nearly as compelling, but even then I think it's still a strong case on the combination of ease of use, perfect size, light weight, performance, and price. But with Prime, it's really no contest. Very satisfied. We use our Kindle HDXs (we have both a 7 inch and 8.9 inch) daily.The only thing I wish it had was GPS....you can still use Google Maps (no, it's not in the Amazon App Store, but it's fairly easy to add, along with Chrome, as the included Silk browser...well....kinda sucks) but it won't enable turn-by-turn directions since there's no GPS.

Beautiful HD screen.  Very fast on internet.  Surprising sound - not like my Kindle Fire.I chose not to get the 3G version, as I have the FoxFi app on my smart phone which makes it a hot spot as long as the phone has a signal.I waited until Amazon had a special offer and last month they had thirty bucks off any HDX so I pulled the trigger the last day of the offer.  Also signed up for the Amazon CC for an additional fifty bucks off.  I'm a prime member so free two day shipping and a price of $399 delivered for this bad boy.  How good is that?Oops, forgot to add that when I opened the box and took the Kindle out I'm thinking this is a work of art.  Very thin, elegant with simple controls on the back and light as a feather.As far as 'limited apps' go, how many does one want?  From what I gather but haven't tried yet is to go to settings and allow downloading of non-Kindle Amazon apps.  Also, some complain they can't access YouTube.  Oh contraire!  Go to silk and then type your default browser in the address box (I use MSN but freebies like FoxFire would probably work)  and then go to YouTube or whatever you wish.  Easy Peasy :o)I've had this jewel for only a couple of weeks, but I'm totally satisfied.  My wife, who has no experience with a Kindle at all was very impressed with it, checked her email, etc and she is somewhat of a Luddite :o).  I had to talk long and hard for her to switch from dumb to smart phone.  She now loves her Samsung Galaxy III.One thing I don't get is the many reviewers who complain that this is not a full featured notebook and the many who compare it to iOS units.  But then I'm biased against anything Apple, be it phone, mp3, computer, whatever.  This Kindle fits my needs and I'm pretty sure there are workarounds for utilities, such as Word, but then I have computers for those tasks.One more thing.

If you're on the fence about getting this - GET IT.The good: The display is breathtaking. Seriously. It's very user-friendly. My non-tech savvy mother figured out how to play around with it almost immediately (after i showed her how to turn it on... see my comment below). If you have prime (which you should - if you want to get the most out of your kindle), they have plenty of content available for viewing. The lending library is awesome. They also have this program called \"kindle first\", where you can get an advance copy of next-months releases. So... free movies + free TV shows + free books = happy girl. Some people have complained it's hard to find the free stuff. I'd have to disagree. There's an entire category for \"free\" stuff in the store, which makes it super simple. Amazon cloud drive is pretty neat too. I can back up my photos from my phone and tablet to the cloud drive so they are nice and safe.The bad: why are the buttons on the back? This is kind of silly. My tech-savvy boyfriend couldn't figure out how to turn the dang thing on because there's a tiny tiny little button in back. I always have to turn it around every time to find it so i can put it to sleep or wake it up. Also - 16gb is going to be too small for the average user. I bought the 32gb and i'm already close to capacity after downloading three HD movies and a few apps. If you're trying to decide which size to get - go with the 32 or larger. Also - the special offers are annoying. Get it without. We see enough ads in our everyday life to have ads on our reading devices, right?! one last thing. This is not an android tablet so you won't be able to download all the apps your android or apple phone has. It doesn't have a few apps that i use (instagram, google hangouts, gmail, etc.) But i'll survive. This might be a deal-breaker for a few people, but i have my android phone to fill in the gaps.Have I mentioned how amazing the display is???

The power/volume buttons seemed to be in strange locations, but after a few minutes, I was used to them. The buttons work very well if you are using the tablet in landscape, they are a little awkward in portrait mode. The finish/feel of the tablet was great, it's very slim and light.Once powered on, I loaded up a couple Amazon HD videos. The screen is amazing. There really isn't much more to say about it. Everything is so sharp and clear. And color reproduction seems great to me, but i'm not a videophile. Besides the screen, the next thing that really stood out to me was the sound. The speakers are some of the best ones I've ever heard on a portable device. They are not going to blow you socks off like some high end Bose system, but they seemed well above what the norm is for portable devices.The OS (operating system) on the Fire HDX works well. Everything was very smooth while navigating. Loading and switching between apps was nice and quick. The factory installed apps seemed to work well. I had never used a Kindle Fire tablet before and the OS seemed pretty easy to figure out. The Amazon App Store seems to have a lot of decent apps/games, but is still missing some of the apps I was looking forward to using. This is where things just didn't fit for me.I can use the Amazon App Store on my android phone, but can't use the Play Store from the Kindle. I understand why Amazon want's you to use their store, but I wish I had the option to use others without having to \"hack\" the device. I did find a way to load unsupported apps onto the Kindle, but it took a decent amount of effort, and I felt like it was a little too much to go through for unsupported apps.The only other complaint I have is that you can't change the background in the OS. I know you can change the lock screen background (if you paid to remove the ads, which I didn't mind the ads at all), but not the one inside the OS. It seems you are stuck to a black background. Which maybe I just didn't figure out how to change it. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.In conclusion, the kindle fire HDX 8.9 tablet is truly an amazing piece of hardware, I think as far as tablets go, it's a top dog for sure. The OS is not bad by any means, but it's not the \"pure\" android experience I was hoping for. The Amazon App Store not supporting some of the apps I mainly bought this tablet for, was the deal breaker. It seemed like way to much money for something I couldn't use as I had planned, so I ended up returning this tablet to Amazon.That said, I did purchase two of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD's for my kids for Christmas :)I will be going to a more pure android tablet for myself.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is Incredible!", "Author": "Robert C Brown", "ReviewID": "R2J7GC8QRBEA9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have the Fire HD and the features on the HDX really improve the experience!

I own a Note 3, MSI GT70, Ipad4, Note 10.1 2014, and a few older tablets for reading including an underwhelming 2012 HD refurbished Kindle. I was annoyed with the old HD for many reasons and was going to return it until my son stole it for Kindle Free Time, which btw, is worth the subscription. However, as many people do who don't have multiple screen homes (Kindle HD 2012 was first and only at the time) I was annoyed by its limits and didn't see it's merits.Even with my plethora of fancy and infancy devices I missed Amazon's set up for books and video streaming. I could have got the all new version of the HD cheaply but I thought for a few dollars more having the most recent Kindle would've hurt, would have all the product support (os updates, lending library, and Prime HD streams). However, what I didn't know about was the free Prime downloads they added!!!!!Unfortunately this feature will only be amazingly useful on Kindle with higher memory. It makes me want to cry. :( If you want to store your music and have up to four or so 1080p movies downloaded for offline use 16 gigs is too small. It's the case for any tablet, and to be honest 32 is really very little. The os your apps and games will eat that space in no time. It's not like the olden days.Aside from the os eating all my space, I have to say if you're a Prime Member the HDX is a need. It's so lovely watching videos for free that were optimized for your device in impressive full 1080p. I had no idea how useful this would be for more than a bedside companion. No 4G or purchases necessary to enjoy a show while you're waiting at the doctor. In that respect alone, if you're a loyal Amazon subscriber regardless of the tablet this is a no brained thing you will enjoy.The old HD lags and is slow, but this model is fast. You can write accurately and with ease. The battery life might make you sad, but if you're reading I believe you have 17 hours. Which, is totally why you own a fire right? ;)The app store is still limited, and behind ios and android in updates and releases, but Amazon is working on getting exclusive games for its tablet owners like the Telltale Walking Dead series. Which is amazing...I'm pregnant and struggling with a lot of physical issues and have been confined to my bed so gadgets have become very important. I doubt I could rationalize spending $300 of tech money on an 8.9 or even a 7 inch HDX when for that I could purchase a Nexus 10 or 7, or even a used retina ipad mini, but I can't say I don't want one. (There is one on my wishlist).If you're new to technology and tablets you will love an HDX, if you're a loyal Amazon Prime fan and use their wonderful services then you will enjoy this. It's fast. So fast, and streams in true HD with proper broadband connection so you will only miss the downloads when you're mobile. We all know Kindle Ebooks beat all other ebooks, and Amazon makes the best reading app. It's still an impressive ereader, and the Goodreads integration makes my nerdy soul happy.Cons are it's still a bit heavy for a reader, but a nice case with a strap should remedy that. No back camera, so if this is going to be your main tablet you will be saddened. No HDMI port but those are becoming dinosaur tech, and adapters or Miracast exists now for older tv's. No Google Play store... But I have to say something as a techie dork. Amazon I hope you're listening, you guys almost have it right. What do I mean?You're providing great hardware for discounted prices and adding amazing customer service to your product for no additional cost. *Slow Clap* You're producing Amazon Exclusive content that is available only on your devices, but you allow other devices access to your main features so you're not self isolating either like Apple can.The HDX is truly a step in the right direction of you guys can do the following:Open The Play Store. Trust your products and store, it's great. Apps are discounted, and fair. Limiting yourself in this area is hurting you. I believe you'll see the errors of your ways here. Have exclusive content and offer your own, and win the internet even more than you already have.Step the prices down for the bigger memory tablets. You're not selling machines, you're selling a portal to one of the best services out there. I save so much money using your physical stores alone!! Your videos are beautifully optimized. Your tablets are now impressive, and no one can best your customer service for the services you provide. So, since you're selling physical products, movies, and exclusive content take a bit more of a hit on them HDX tablets so the service is available to more people everywhere.Allow us to customize the carousel. We know it's a Kindle, but give us some options. Let us display a book collection up there instead of all the recently opened things. Remove from carousel is one of my least favorite things. I don't mind the special offers, because there are great deals and recommendations there but allow us some level of customization and I don't mean those weird decals.Let Google into your hearts all the way. Give us a normal page or two with widgets. I love the folders feature.If you made those tweaks your tablet might win the internet completely. (Maybe usb 3.0 too)That all being said this is a great tablet for Prime members, readers, and streamers. The 16 gig HDX is worth keeping around for a long time, and I believe newbies and tech lovers alike will be happy with the hardware.If this is your only tab expect app store limits and some frustrations, but Amazon is really working to improve those things, and HDX owners will reap the benefits of this in the future. Music sounds great for back speakers and is the best I've heard from any non Bluetooth connected tablet yet. Price is still good. May Day is useful for even the savviest of us because it saves time. If you're not going to be a Prime Member, you want the biggest selection of apps and all of their updates immediately and this is going to be your main and only device... you're not a reader... or you're looking for a productivity or Jack of all trades machine this isn't for you. Don't buy it then give it a horrible review. This is a media tab. Movies, music, books, and shopping. All the best things in life. It does do some productivity but if that's what you need look elsewhere.When you pick up an HDX you're picking up well crafted fun. The pixels are so pretty you'll want to shed a tear. Amazon's media access is so extensive you'll want for little, and combined with other services, you may just want for nothing.If you get an HDX no matter what you will find things that will bring you joy, hopefully for a few years to come. I wish I paid full price for device help if it malfunctions (they all do) because dealing with Amazon directly is usually a dream, but I got a great deal. I am absolutely pleasantly surprised and taken with this device, and I think you will be too if this is what you choose for your ereading and Amazon media needs.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "CHRISTINA M WOOD", "ReviewID": "RC9TOLJZZ6XQ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved my Kindle Fire...used it until it died, would no longer charge.

I find this is almost always the case with steaming video apps that might compete with Amazons streaming service.3) FreeTime is a great concept, but unless you pay for the premium version you can't share your downloaded prime content or your borrowed prime books with your kids, you can only share the apps.4) No Google integration at all.  No Gmail, no way to play my music from GooglePlay, no Hangouts.This device is inexpensive because it forces you into Amazons content and if forces you to play by their rules.

I would have to uninstall apps just to install new ones.  This shouldn't be limited (but it is), especially when there was plenty of GB still available.I was able to obtain the OtterBox Defender Series for Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" (will only fit Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"), Black, which is a perfect case for this.  Sure, it adds a little bulk, but it's a good quality product that protects my new Kindle, and the clear plastic screen protector doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touch screen.The color & display is crisp & absolutely gorgeous.I also opted not to pay extra just to shut off the special offers.  Initially, I was irked that I'd have to endure them, but honestly, I don't find them bothersome at all.  Actually, I like that they offer items specifically for my Kindle (I purchased a Marware speaker that was just offered for $10, as opposed to the regular $29 price), plus, have gotten a few mp3 credits.  Honestly, I don't think it's worth paying to get rid of them, and that actually still surprises me to be saying that.  They're not nearly as intrusive and I thought they would be.I don't notice much of a difference in charging times between my old Gen 1 KF and this one.  Both seem to need to be charged quite frequently.The only issue I have with this Kindle is that even though it's connected to my router, no internet connection is detected.  To rectify, I can either go into the Wifi section and switch to another Wifi, then switch back to mine, or I can just shut the Kindle down and turn it back on.  I seem to be doing this more frequently, and it's getting rather annoying.I also don't like the email connection.  I'd much rather put my password in each and  every time I want to check my email.

I love all the features, but noticed that it would never charge above 82%. I contacted Amazon who quickly sent me a new charger. But that didn't fix the problem. So they sent me a \"new\" kindle which was actually a \"reconditioned\" kindle. This one didn't include a charger, so I purchased another one from Amazon (the same one that comes with the kindle). This charger didn't work at all--the lightening bolt wouldn't even appear. So I gave up on those chargers altogether and ordered an aftermarket charger from a company that had good reviews. It charged the \"new\" kindle but again, only to 82%, even when charging overnight. But occasionally it will pop up to 100% randomly. I've given up on expecting the kindle to fully charge and am living with the 82% charge.Others have mentioned this other problem--it drops my wifi at odd moments. I have to wait sometimes several minutes for it to pick it up again, even though the device says it has connected to my wifi, and sometimes I have to shut it down completely and restart before it will pick up the wifi again. I don't have this problem with any of my other devices.On balance, I wish I had waited to get this version of kindle until it had been out for a while. I have a first generation Kindle Fire that still works perfectly, which I bought after it had been on the market for over a year. I think if I had waited to buy the Kindle HDX, it would have given them time to fix the glitches. Still concerned that they sent me a reconditioned Kindle instead of a brand new one, especially as it was still easily under warranty.

And I flip it around I like the new design compared to last years body, It feels so good when I hold it I just love it, and the other thing that amazes me is how thin it is, its not as thinner then the iPad but still just as thin I would say, but its way lighter, they have removed the HDMI port so you wont be able to connect it to a TV but you can do it wirelessly with Mira case, I first turn it on and the screen is really Beyond HD, its beautiful its really amazing, the only thing I don't like about this device is they made the volume lower then the Kindle Fire HD 7 (2012) the HD was the loudest tablet I have ever heard but they made this tablet speakers worse but it is much more clear and has surround sound, but its just not as loud as the HD. When I first power house game (Dragon Slayer) it ran smoothly with no lag what so ever and the game gas I would say PlayStation 2 or 1 graphics, and it ran smoothly with no lag or stutter, Its a really fast and snappy device really it will handle any app you put on it, Its running the latest  Snap Dragon processor, and its really fast, its the fastest tablet you can get for its price. The other thing I like is that they finally added a rear camera its 8 Mp (mega pixels) its not so great but it will do what ever you want knowing tablets don't and shouldn't have really good cameras and this one has flash not many tablets have flash, only Samsung really does that and Sony is all I know of but its nice that they include that. I also like the interface its has a good design instead of fire os 2.0 which just had a plain black background, this one has a grey and black background mixture that looks amazing, and with this perfect screen it looks even better, with Fire OS 3.0 (mojito) Its a skin version of android made of all Amazon content which has a good selection, but not much of it on its app store, but it only has all the good stuff none of those useless apps. This Tablet is amazing I love it and its a great family tablet with Kindle Free time, I mean if you are an amazon user you will LOVE this device, and maybe if you never used amazon you will soon start to love it, really its the most easiest thing to get used to, its so simple.

I was really intrigued by the hardware (primarily the display) and lower price than the competing \"Air\" product.I am very impressed how cool it runs (but I have not tried to play games with it and the display's brightness is turned down) and it has not crashed even once. Also, the battery is good for many hours of lightweight use.>I probably would have returned it by now, but I've found a couple of very good applications that I would like to continue to use: CalenGoo and Polaris Office (I don't think spending a few hundred dollars on just a \"content viewer\" is such a good idea), so I will probably keep it.>I keep discovering user interface issues. I have just discovered a problem with Kindle's PDF reader where I was unable to exit the reader when viewing a single-page PDF (would not display any \"soft\" buttons/icons and there is no hardware \"home\" or \"exit\" button). Apparently there is no way to empty \"email trash\" other than selecting each and every deleted email first (!). There seem to be NO WAY to place photos in collections or folders (I've created folders with a file explorer but they were ignored). I am just wandering who wrote the software...>So far, I have not been able to set up the Kindle calendar (this just amazed me). It wanted me to synchronize with an existing online calendar of some sort, but I don't have one. It will NOT work in a stand-alone mode and, apparently, it will not store it's data in Amazon's Cloud either. With \"CalenGoo,\" I created a few Google calendars (as it recommended), and so far it is working very well.>I was able to open, edit, and save older versions of Microsoft Excel files with \"Polaris Office,\" but it does not work with Google Drive. I used a file explorer to transfer files from-and-to Google drive and then I moved them from-to another subfolder on the Kindle; it was doable but unnecessarily tedious.>The often bad-mouthed Silk Browser has worked quite well (but I've turned the \"acceleration\" off); the only problem I've discovered so far was NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) site (disappointing).>A fact that the user cannot change the screen backgrounds (login and \"desktop\") is astonishing...The included user guide is too basic. I've just bought an e-book to solve that problem.>Amazon does not allow access to Google Play, which has some applications that are either newer or even not-available in the Amazon's App Store. I have also discovered that a lot of the available applications I was looking for (productivity and utilities) have poor users' ratings.>It would have not bothered me that there was no easy way to connect to Google Drive directly if Amazon offered a similar functionality. For example, not allowing storage of calendar data in IT'S OWN \"cloud\" totally amazed me (unless I am missing something here or I am just having a bad dream).I think, the Kindle Fire has a great potential; Amazon just needs more ambition to go beyond the reader-viewer-listener-shopper business model, or sell them for half price so we can buy multiple tablets for different purposes.Please report all shortcomings to Amazon, so the software can be improved (hopefully soon).>For clarity sake, I am a long time, \"loyal\" Amazon's customer.==============================================================================================For people new to Kindle Fire 2013 (now or in the near future), I recommend this e-book by Michael J.

I tried to inquire if a certain amount of broad band was needed and she said you don't have enough. You can return it so I did. Later I called again to see about another device and I was told that the HDX did not need certain broadband requirements. No one really offered to trouble shoot the situations and I could hardly understand the person helping me. She did not seem to fully understand my questions and seemed like she was reading from a script saying the same thing over and over.

I got the 32 gig 8.9 incher and have only managed to fill up 4 gigs, and I have a few dozen apps and over 220 e-books on it (mostly in large part still on amazon servers, ie the cloud).  The sound is loud enough that everyone in the room can hear when someone reads to us from the 2 able speakers on the tablet, but I wish it were just a tad bit louder.  It is louder than my 16 inch notepad speakers.  Amazon whisper sync is the cat's meow for starting a book on my HP laptop and finishing it sometimes on the tablet or vice versa.  This tablet is overkill for my wife's reading needs, but I am enjoying it's other features.  I have 3 browsers on it and 2 readers, and the pixel count exceeds that of most apps and games,  so it should be a photographers delight. The 8 mp camera takes the best pics compared to a certain fruiti pad.I hope the screen is gorilla glass; so far so good.  Stays charged a long time also.  The reflexes and speed  on the kindle exceed those of a cheetah, no gripes there.  I have no gripes about the wifi.  I do find that the auto brightness can be distracting, so I turn that off most of the time.  I discovered quite by accident that it has sleep mode and Off, and no instructions about that unless I do some internet research.  It's really simple to use.  Sleep mode is a power sipper.  I can charge it from way low to over 90% in about 2 hours with the handy dandy wall wart and usb plug.

The interest-free installment plan makes it extremely affordable.  Having my Amazon Prime services at my fingertips is great.  If this were all that matters in a tablet, FIVE STARS!But, the Amazon app store and ecosystem is a sad and depressing state of affairs. Google has apparently boycotted Amazon's store, so any app you've purchased on Google Play Store will not be available. There's no Chrome browser, no YouTube app (OMG!), no Gmail app... what about the Google star map app?  Nope.  Google maps?  *sigh*  I'm usually aggravated that the normal, every day tasks that I take for granted on my Android phone are a P.I.T.A on this thing.  I rarely leave the house with it.Worse still, major publishers *might* have their Android apps on the Amazon store, but when you search for your favorite apps you're more than likely to find a ton of cunningly named applications from unknown publishers.  If you do find a major vendor's application from a (hopefully) legitimate publisher, you'll pay for it again and maybe they'll update the app as often as the Google Play store version.  Or maybe not.The Amazon Silk browser works well, but it's not what I want (privacy??) and good luck finding an alternative.  At least I could find proper versions of Spotify, Tumblr and Facebook.  Sketchbook Pro is nice.  I managed to find a PC tool to download apps from Google's store as .APK files and then sideload them into the Amazon Fire OS, but that's a lot of effort and the Google services are not available to keep that app updated or enable many of it's features.  You'll be tempted to download .APK files from forums and warez sites, but then you're guaranteed to become infected.Anyway, If you're an Android hacker with an Amazon Prime account and looking for great hardware at a very low price (all seven of you), you might have a few, warranty-voiding choices after buying this tablet: 1) find a way to root the device and install Google's Play services and applications.  Or, 2) root the device, flash it with a custom Android ROM, load Google's services and apps, and then install Amazon's applications from the Google Store (Kindle Reader, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Workspaces, etc).Or, rather, I'm still researching this.

Then you have to either cycle your Kindle through standby or go to the offer and decline it. That's the hassle from saving the $30.00 to $40.00 more you'll pay for NOT having offers come up on your Kindle. Just the same, I would recommend having this Kindle over the iPad and Samsung Galaxy.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "DEBS", "ReviewID": "REQ0C7QTAAHJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

It was heavy and far from perfect with a horrible keyboard and limited storage on a small display. So I was admittedly a little hesitant to consider the latest update to this product. The iPad was out of the question as an overpriced technical prison. But I looked at several options among current Android tablets including ones from Samsung and Asus. But as a happy Amazon Prime customer, I gave the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" a closer look despite common objections about limits of the Amazon app store, and the absence of widgets and customization in the Fire OS. A techie snob, I was impressed with the specifications of the Kindle Fire HDX when compared to other tablets. I decided that I had to take the chance when Amazon sweetened the deal with the offer to break up the payments. Sold Amazon, and make mine 32GB.When the box arrived and I pulled the Fire out, I was blown away at how light the Kindle Fire HDX was in my hands. The matte black back felt great as well. Turning it on, I quickly found I was in love with the beautiful display and the lightning fast response of my new tablet. And thankfully Amazon updated Fire OS with a well designed Swype enabled keyboard. After playing with my new toy a while, I noticed the slightest blemish in my display, especially when displaying dark colors. So I tried out a feature of my new Kindle Fire HDX that I thought I would never use..... Mayday.I was greeted by a friendly smiling support rep that asked me to explain my problem. I mentioned the blemish and she asked me to point at it, since she could see my display. I did and she drew a circle right where the problem was and said I had some dead pixels. Amazon would send out a new device and I would have to return the defective one. As a computer support person with many years of experience, the feature I thought I would never use taught me that I had chosen exactly the right tablet. Outstanding feature that is sure to be appreciated by many Kindle owners.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that deserves praise. Speaking of which, I never considered my original Fire as a tablet. Just didn't seem deserving. But the 8.9\" Fire HDX is difficult to call anything else because it's clearly just not another Kindle reader device. Just the right size for reading and consuming web media or movies, and the battery life has been far beyond my expectations. The included charger gets the Kindle Fire HDX back on its feet in no time at all. And at $120+ cheaper than competitors, there is no reason to look beyond this tablet.

The one that will and that I have yet to find a good work around is the Silk Browser.  I don't like it and I wish I could more easily replace it with a different browser.  No matter how many times I change the search engine it reverts to Bing.  Nothing against Bing but I am a google man.  Taunting me with settings that seem to let me change my default search engine (and it does until you reboot) does not help.This is not Android.  Anymore than Apple OS is Linux.  This is built on an Android core but it is not native Android.  As such some apps are not available for it and some need to be side loaded (download the apk and load it manually).  If you want to always check the latest and greatest of each type of app out there then this might be a big negative for you.  Me? I want to find one I like and never change it again until a major upgrade is demonstrated to me.The App store is more arrogant than Microsoft used to be.  The App store thinks it knows you and it doesn't.  It takes your Amazon purchase history, your books, and then assumes you just want movies, books, and games when it returns search results.  Use google (or Bing I guess) and get software reviews there then search for them specifically.  I like to use the full Amazon online shop and search within Android Apps to get a better return on my search.So why did I give it 5 stars?  It is powerful, its graphics are beautiful, it is exactly what I thought I would be getting and it cost less than other comparable systems I looked at.  I am an Amazon Prime member so it fit with my current online usage and I did my homework and was aware of the flaws and work arounds before I ordered it.  Get some utilities (ES3, Evernote, King Soft Office) to compensate for issues and check to make sure your treasured games are available (no haytown for my wife was an issue) and then decide if it is worth the extra 100 to 200 dollars to get a pure Android device or worth the risk of voiding your support if you root it.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1IYK4C0OM5YFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are not enough stars to calculate how much I love my kindle fire 8.9 HDX.

I saw her watching a movie on her smart phone and asked her why she wasn't using the HDX.  She told me that the Netflix streaming kept stopping and she had to start it all over again, which didn't occur on her smart phone.  She also told me that she could not watch youtube videos on it.  I called Amazon customer service but with Kindles one must now call a special Kindle service line.  The Kindle CSR told us that we needed to do a number of things and then call back if the problem persisted.  It persisted but not as often.  We called back to report this and we were instructed by the Kindle CSR to reload some apps including Netflix.  It was strange that the Kindle CSR blamed Netflix's streaming for the glitch or our wireless router when our family of six watches wireless Netflix & Amazon streaming on numerous devices in numerous rooms throughout the house with no issues.  My daughter told him that she accessed Netflix with both the Kindle HDX and her laptop side by side watching the same movie from Netflix and the Kindle froze but the laptop did not.  She told him that this should be evidence that the problem was not Netflix or a wireless issue at our house.  the Kindle CSR told her that if this second round of steps did not fix the problem, then a new Kindle HDX would be sent out.  After she reloaded the apps and did what the Kindle CSR told her to do, the problem was still there, so Amazon sent out a new Kindle Fire HDX.  The new one has not encountered the problems that the old one did.  It is an expensive item to have issues with streaming when other items like our numerous laptops, smartphones, iPads, and Android tablets do not and we think that something must have been updated to fix this glitch.  My daughter likes the light weight and portability of the HDX, the image is clear and crisp, and she can download some college textbooks to it if she wants to.

Each one has met expectations.  The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because many of the books now have the table of contents grayed out.  I could see and use the table of contents on previous devices.  However, I have located the table on most books and bookmarked it.The second reason for only 4 stars:  I have purchased 3 cases- looking for the perfect one.  Have not found it yet.  I do not want to raise the camera from the case to take a picture.  One case allows me to take a picture without raising the camera, but there is a black spot hiding the center of the picture, but the picture comes out great.

This tablet is amazingly lightweight and thin. The HDX is very, very comfortable to hold and manage.The screen on the HDX is the best I've ever seen. \"Beyond HD\" is not an empty marketing phrase. This thing surprised me with its color, clarity, and brightness. It still reflects noticeably, though. Just to test it, I downloaded a movie and WOW!!!! Sound and picture beyond belief!!! Navigation is intuitive and easy. I can quickly and easily switch among reading, watching videos, shopping, and moreMost of the apps I want are available for my HDX. YouTube works just fine on the Silk Browser. And there are plenty of news apps, games, alarm clocks, etc. Seamlessly integrated with all things Amazon. I buy the vast majority of books and movies from Amazon, and my HDX provides an unbeatable way to enjoy them.Looking for a e-reader, tablet that offers great ease-of-use, picture and sound, and, and, and people always complain about support, not that they can solve every problem but at least you can get help.

Though we already own two Kindles, we felt that this device finally allow us to enjoy the full scope of the Prime membership.  I especially enjoy watching Amazon Prime movies on the Fire because of the amazing X-ray features.  The names of the actors, trivia, goofs appear automatically at the relevant scenes.  I rewatched many of my favorite movies and oh boy how much more I learned about them!That said, we do have the following issues:1. It does not support Adobe Flash.  So my son cannot do his homework and my husband cannot do his online study on this tablet.  I know I can make it work if I jump some loops, but it really is a hassle and it always make me nervous installing unauthorized third party app.2. The tablet reset several time for no reason in the first week we got it.  It was a bit annoying because after each reset I needed to login to all the apps we have been using again.  In fact I was so annoyed that I thought of have it replaced.  The second week onward this phenomenon did not occur and I am keeping my fingers crossed.3. Occasional lose of WiFi connection, despite of strong signal.  I need to turn off and then turn the WiFi back on to get the connection again.4. Despite this tablet is basically running on Android, many of the Android apps are not available in Kindle Fire.5. It boosts to be able to print documents directly from the tablet to the network printer, it does not have a standard app to help you set up the printer to achieve that function.  I am totally lost in the process of shopping for the appropriate app for this purpose.  Why can't Amazon recommend the right app to do it?To conclude, a great device if you are already a Prime member and  the majority of usage is for movies, books and audiobooks.

After the larger keyboard version and a smaller keyboard version for my purse this one is great.  My larger keyboard Kindle tanked after 3 yrs and 1000 bks and I wasn\u2019t as crazy about the smaller screen on my other Kindle. Now instead of needing 2 Kindles (one at home and the other in my purse) this version fits perfectly in my purse and isn\u2019t too small or too heavy. And no more clumsy book light attachments. My new HDX was money well spent. While I\u2019d like a larger screen this size works well enough.

I would like to have gmail, and chrome on it. I would not recommend the advertising one, it is worth the thirty dollars to not have it especially if you have kids.The battery life is great, lasts a long time. I get two days on one charge and that is with full use during the day. 17 hours is not a lie, this battery lasts 17 hours of use. The screen is great and is very better than my 42 hd tv with a blueray player, my son actually prefers to watch his shows on it. (16 months). He just got interested in educational shows and responds better to the Kindle than the TV.I like how easy it is to use your amazon products in kindle, I have prime so I download Barney videos and when out and about son can watch them. Makes for a nice dinner when he is watching his shows.Where would I go with this, well I would integrate Kindle fire OS with Ubuntu because of the close business relationship they have with Canonical also a tablet as powerful as the new kindle fire hdx would kill with Ubuntu. I have an old HP laptop with similar hardware specs and when I first was using it with Ubuntu I thought I had bought a new laptop. I am thinking of getting several more Kindle's for my wife and son, and maybe then one will convert into a Ubuntu tablet.I bought it because it was similar to or better than an Ipad or Ipad mini after owning one I know it is better than an Ipad even the latest ones on market right now, my friend just bough an Ipad and is thinking of returning it to get a KIndle HDX 8.9 because of price and well, he also has prime and likes he can rent/download videos with his prime. The kindle freetime is great too, although I have not set up an account for my son because he is just a bit too young.My only complaint is well Amazon is a bit like Apple with the apps and restrictions, let us use all the android apps, also allow for a dual boot Ubuntu :) tablet with an Amazon prime app that allows us to still take advantage of all the Amazon-Kindle environment.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful first tablet!", "Author": "shelby220", "ReviewID": "RYJ2SEHKKHK14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, great picture/camera!

She plays a lot of downloaded games, uses Facebook, email, and browses websites probably 16 hours a day, while she works from home.

I don't know why they tell us this if it isn't true! But oh well, it worked out because Kindle gave me a bunch of \"coins\" for downloading certain apps that they were advertising that I could use towards the already discounted price of the app. It's originally I think $10 but was on sale for $5 and I didn't have to pay for the app anyway which is good! But now I can do everything on my Kindle! Watch Netflix or Hulu or go on Facebook and create documents! Screen and display is perfect even if you download a Movie or Show in Standard instead of HD it still looks like HD!! I just wish downloading movies didn't take up SO much space on the Kindle but it does. Plus it sooo lightweight and pretty. It sucks though that it has no nice and normal screen savers and they're just AD's and if you want them gone you have to pay an extra $15 but some are helpful and they're not too annoying. But overall I have no complaints. I got mine for Chistmas '14 and so far nothing has gone wrong! Tested out the Help option and they are true to their word that you can speak with a live person!

That makes 2 - 720 HD movies downloaded and with my other apps/books the device still has 5.3 GB available... so still plenty of space available. Due to download times I use 720 HD which is still an incredible picture quality due to the small size of tablets.  It's really is a waste of time and space to download 1080 HD... unless the 13\" table down the road is not a myth...*** I love the X-Ray feature showing the movie and TV shows' with the IMDB connection of cast biographies and other their titles, ratings and interesting general trivia...  the IMDB cast changes as the actors change from scene to scene...*** The Dolby sound is amazing.***  In my opinion, the KF may not have the quantity of apps, but does have a ton of 'useful' apps.  The KF and other android tablets have the best euchre app by far... compared to the other non-android tablet...  and I love playing euchre.  The other word and numbers (such as Sudoku) type apps are on par with any other tablet...***  Cannot comment on the camera - who uses a tablet to take pictures anyway?***  THE BEST WARRANTY even when out of the warranty period...  Amazon has replaced several our older KFs which were out of warranty since it was our first problem... that is incredible service.***  I used the Mayday feature and sure enough the response was just a few minutes... he corrected the audio problem quickly which I should have figured out myself in the first place.

I was VERY impressed by how quick they were to help.  I waited less than 3 minutes for a tech to answer. They were very patient with teaching this elderly person,  it was my first first ereader.Then I got the first Kindle Fire 2 years ago...color made a big difference!  What got me interested in upgrading to the HDX  8.9 this time was the Mayday feature.  I have used it every day since I got it a week ago.  Again I am very impressed how quick they are to answer.  The battery on this one holds a charge so much longer than my old Fire, it is much lighter to hold, the color is sooo much better/bolder.  There is no end to the number of apps available thru Amazon.  At my age I have lots of eye problems and I love the fact  that I can read books without my glasses with no difficulty.  I am reading more now than I have read in years.  One little problem so far.  Sometimes the print can't be made bigger on certain web pages.  I was trying to download a new book thru my Prime and it wouldn't let me do it.  I hit the Mayday button and the tech person went to that page and even he could not read the message under that order page.  Together we both figured it out.  It said I had reached my Prime limit for January.

I had previously purchased my wife a Nook since she is an avid Barnes and Noble shopper, but since I primarily shop for books at Amazon and have purchased quite a few music CDs from Amazon as well, I figured that I might as well go with the Fire HDX. Another factor in my decision was that I had already downloaded the Kindle reading app on my phone and computers and acquired quite a few free books for my library. I am a teacher and having these available on my classroom computer appealed to me.So that is \"why\" I went with the Fire HDX. I decided on the top of the line with everything except for 4G coverage because I figured that I would always have enough content to keep myself occupied between wifi hotspots and would never need the Kindle to download something urgently enough to require it right then when I was not in an area of coverage.I am totally impressed with the display on videos, the music sounds great when connected to quality headphones, and I already have enough books to keep me busy reading for quite a while. I need to remember to utilize my 64gb hard drive since so far everything that I need is sitting in the Amazon cloud. I never was a big gamer fan, but I've downloaded several free games and a few interesting apps and being a traditional guy, I will probably stay with a steady rotation of those when I feel like playing something instead of trying to improve my mind by reading.If I would have to give any negative comment to this device at all, it would have to be that it occasionally doesn't keep up with the buffer on streaming and doesn't play perfectly with a few online video apps like Watch ESPN or CBSSports. So far, I have had only one instance of it needing to catch up with an Amazon Prime video but it wasn't a huge problem and obviously could be remedied if you went ahead and downloaded the video before watching.Speaking of Amazon Prime, it seems many people are upset because all videos are not available with an Amazon Prime subscription. I just started my trial and will spending the next 30 days checking to see what is actually available with Prime. If I cannot find enough of the videos that I want to stream for free, then I will simply discontinue after the free trial. I did the same thing with Netflix because their selection did not have the newest or best videos available for streaming. The same seems to be true of Amazon Prime but I will give them the full trial period before passing judgement.  I suggest everyone check out the videos that are available through Prime before jumping on that wagon.Anyway, the Amazon Fire HDX is everything it says it is and apparently every bit the competitor for the Apple Ipad Air or the Nook, with a display that tips the scales in favor of the Fire HDX.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "kindle", "Author": "joshua diaz", "ReviewID": "R3DX474QQ7G6U0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is just ok.

Upon deleting them the last movie would not allow me to delete it in the conventional manner so I re-booted and the screen responded with a question that basically asked if I wanted to restore factory defaults or continue to boot normally. I chose not to restore settings and continued to boot. I later went into the settings screen and found an alternative way to delete the movie without having to resort to losing my personal settings.Other than these issues, I really like and would purchase it again. The live help feature works great with knowledgeable and professional support techs. I perhaps should have asked them to assist me with the two aforementioned issues and still may do so.

I have only had a small issue with the downloadable Prime movies listed on the device in that some were on the list but could not be downloaded.

I have never had issues with Amazon, I love Prime and my new Fire HDX is the best ever!The HDX is so light and thin, but still very strong in its construction.  I did decide on the roocase oragami instead of the Amazon version as it is lighter and I really wasn't worried about the slide to take pictures function.  I did find, however, that the roocase functions that way as well purely by accident!  If you have the case open and the cover flipped all of the way over to the back it will turn on the camera automatically if you slide it down just a half inch!

Also, being a technically oriented type I'm feel that the support for apps is a little thin in the areas of performance and user friendliness. In order to support a tablet like device I think Amazon may need to add a little bandwidth to their  servers and require their app developers to provide more extensive help resources for their work.

I have a first-generation Kindle which is fine for reading novels.

It works a treat for that.The text is clear, adjustable for size, spacing, and font, and easy to read. The \"brown text on cream background\" is nice for reducing glare when reading in a dark room (like in bed or on a plane). Syncing a book between devices is simple.I have a smartphone so didn't want the 3G/4G feature, and I use a PC for mail and word processing.  But having e-mail comes in handy for forwarding \"sync links\" to the device (over wireless) to set up synchronization functions without connecting to the PC.Have downloaded games, a map, BBC iPlayer, and other apps without difficulty.  Am enjoying discovering the toys out there.My only complaint is that the \"auto brightness\" feature leaves the screen too bright.  You can manually set it, but it's fiddly if you have to do it often.  And it's a shame that you can't change the brightness while reading.

It has some of the apps people use nowadays like: Facebook, Twitter, Angry Birds, Netflix, Skype, etc.What bothered me was the lack of personalization. I tried out this device under ads and it is annoying. If you are buying a device then in theory you own it. While the Kindle Fire with ads makes the purchase \"cheaper\" in a way you are not free to make a choice. Consider using the device everyday, just the thought of looking at an ad displayed on your own device is odd.Compared to other tablets out there, the Kindle Fire is the lightest and affordable. If you are new to Android, consider the Kindle Fire. It has the popular apps people use, the battery life is great and simply a great device to hold and to read from.

I use my Kindles mainly for watching videos and tv, as well as web browsing, shopping via Amazon and very occasionally checking email when not near my laptop or pc. My daughter, who is 12, is constantly using my other Kindle, so it's a good tablet for kids- very easy to use with the added security of parental control options. Something I neglected to mention in the video is the placement of the power and volume controls which are now located on the back of the tablet, along the beveled edge. I find this to be an improvement over the prior Fire HD version, on which these were located flush with the tablet's right side edge, making them somewhat cumbersome to use without feeling around or actually looking at them.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Display!

It's a decent size for her, but you really need a case to hold it successfully. Here are the issues we have:1. It doesn't hold its internet connection. It says the WiFi is working & signal strength is excellent, but then it won't even connect to Amazon. To solve this, you must shutdown & restart. My plain old Kindle Fire doesn't have this issue.2. The Mayday button was the one reason this wonout over cheaper & larger screen options. The button is buried in tiny type on the menu.3. Tiny type. Vision-impaired persons who aren't  computer wizards may never be able to read Facebook or numerous other websites. Trying to enlarge something using the same technique you'd  use on your phone doesn't work here.We had to send the first Kindle back because it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 2 hours of idle time. We got a replacement within one day; however, the didn't send a new charger. They gave a credit so we could order it & promised to refund the cost of next day shipping within 3 days. I sent an email a month later asking what happened to the credit & it was posted to my bank account the next day.So overall, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is a bit disappointing, but the customer service of Amazon is quite good.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "the jury is still out on this one", "Author": "JulieMontana", "ReviewID": "RP0PV6L142E40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Arrived as promised with packaging in excellent condition. Within 5 minutes, I had the Kindle Fire HDX turned on, connected to my wifi, it knew it belonged to me, and had my email set up. By far the quickest start-up of any device I have had. After having it a while, I do have issues with the fact that it will not let a number of my music cd's transfer correctly. I am gathering it is because they are mwav files. Using the Mayday button did not provide a lot of help. The wait for help was less than 15 seconds, but the assistant did not have any ideas why I could not see a number of my cds on the Kindle at the same time I could see through my laptop that they were in the Kindle internal storage in the music folder. He suggested I download the Cloud player, put my music on the cloud, and listen from the cloud. After several attempts to download the Cloud player to my laptop using internet explorer, I eventually got it to download properly using Google Chrome. Then I discovered you can only have 250 songs on the cloud without paying the $24.99 fee to put more music on the cloud. After picking and choosing what music to send to the cloud, I then found out you can't download from the cloud to the Kindle, you have to transfer from the laptop. Useless.  The Amazon cloud player would not accept about 20% of the songs I tried to transfer due to the wrong format(I think that is the issue, anyway). That is how I then looked at the properties of the tracks on the CDs and discovered the ones that would not transfer were all mwav files (windows media) so they must somehow be incompatible with the Kindle (or protected) not sure. So it appears my music issue is not just a Kindle issue, but an Amazon issue. Anyway, I am not happy with the fact that I can't put a lot of my music on the Kindle Fire HDX. That is why I have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I have been overall happy with the Apps I have downloaded. The location of the power and volume buttons is difficult to get used to. The screen has stellar resolution, and reading books is easy. I have not downloaded any movies to comment on viewing those videos.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, But Poor User Guide", "Author": "Peggy", "ReviewID": "R3KLDU7K48S2MJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, the HDX 8.9 is a 5 star, great item.  This is my 6th Kindle.  (2 used by grown children, 1 to sr. citizen mother, 1 used by grandchild, and my Kindle HD 8.9 now goes to husband.) So I've grown with the Kindles, from Fire 7\", Fire HD 7\", Fire HD 8.9\", and now the Fire HDX 8.9\".  Each one has new improvements.  And up until the HDX 8.9 the user guide has been really good.  But with this Kindle, you can now use the Mayday feature and get instant help (I haven't used it, so don't rely on this info).  Apparently Amazon has decided that no one would prefer to just look it up for themselves.  So you can't.  The information isn't there. The user guide is a very shallow overview.  If you have never used a Kindle Fire, the guide will tell you how to charge, plug in to a computer, register or unregister your Kindle, purchase content, and other basics.  But you won't be able to find out how to do the new, nifty stuff.  For that, you need to contact Amazon or hit the Kindle Forum.  Which means you may not know what you're missing because there isn't anything in the user guide to tell you what your Kindle can do. I've already had to contact Amazon twice to find out how to do things I could do on the HD 8.9.  It's just different enough on the HDX that I needed info.  An adequate user guide would have been useful. Perhaps Amazon will make one available in the near future (I hope).Don't let this deter you from getting the HDX 8.9.  It's a great tablet. And Amazon has the BEST customer service I have ever used, so the answer to my questions were just a quick phone call away. I just wish I had the choice to use the user guide instead. This is especially true when I'm in the middle of nowhere, because wifi isn't always available. 4G isn't always available. Electricity and running water aren't available.  We're that kind of weekends and vacations people.The HDX 8.9 comes with a 9W AC adapter and cord to charge your Kindle.  These adapters are $20 if purchased separately, and charge Kindle Fire models, as well as phones and similar items, in half the time of standard adapters. The HDX 8.9 takes great pictures (haven't used the video function yet), and is so light, you actually feel the difference compared to the HD 8.9.  Because it's different from the HD, I'm still getting used to some differences in using features, but after a week, I haven't found anything missing from the HDX 8.9 that the HD 8.9 had, and there are lots of new goodies.

It requires Microsoft Silverlight which cannot be downloaded on this device at all. After this I realized that I did not need 64 GB since Amazon limited number of videos to download to 25 even if it is YouTube short videos. Size of your storage does not mean anything. From the other site you can store things on Amazon Cloud, but you cannot use it if there is no internet. After several days I took one picture and my kindle died, became unresponsive and all CPR their tech support tried to do did not help.

Works great, no complaints. Will keep it for reading books. Wanted a larger tablet mainly for watching movies/tv shows and just got the HDX8.9 (1/13/14) which is great except for the following issues which seems to be a prevalent concern from most everyone who has purchased this product.1. SOUND: very weak when watching videos. I have the device volume at max and the video volume at max and still had a hard time hearing the movie. I even tried ear plugs to drown out any ambient room noise and that didn't work either. Bass is really low too. I ckecked the HDX along side my KF1stGen and the KF1 sound was far better. Note: Some owners had luck installing a volume control app that includes an equalizer. Will try that next.2. NO HMDI PORT: to attach a cable to your TV to view movies/tv shows directly on your TV without having a set top box. This feature was on the KFHD, but they took it away in lieu of adding the \"mirroring function\" of Miracast. THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA, AMAZON!!!3. MIRACAST: Now, if you don't have \"select Miracast-enabled accessories and TV\" (specific Samsung Smart TV with Miracast, PS3-4, or a miracast dongle that you have to pay extra $$ for and stick it in the back of your TV) then you are out of luck in trying to mirror to your TV!  Since Miracast is the \"new\" thing it's just not available on TV's yet and you have spend more money to use this function...which if you don't want to spend the money....mirroring is basically useless. Going back to #2, Amazon should have kept the HMDI port on the HDX as a back up!4. SECOND SCREEN: Well, you can't use this either unless you get \"select Miracast-enabled accessories and TVs\".5. IN LIEU OF MIRACAST AND SECOND SCREEN: I've got ROKU so I tried using Plex, Twonky and USBtv to stream TV shows from KFHDX to my TV through ROKU and nothing worked. I'm not talking \"live\" shows. Just shows that are 2-3 episodes old. Kept getting an error on my Kindle saying \"could not play in mobile view\" when I was in desktop view. Very frustrating.6. MIRROR & SOUND APP/Update: It would be nice if Amazon would do a program update or make an app that allows set top boxes (ROKU, PS3-4, Blueray) to recognize the Miracast function so we could view KFHDX media content on TV and get better sound quality.FYI: KF-HDX has never had an update as of Nov 14, 2013 which is the \"build date\" on my device.

This is a very powerful tablet with good cameras for a tablet, Includes a good decently loud stereo speakers. The lack of apps and some ui elements are the only thing holding this back, as well as ui customizations. But you are a huge amazon consumer and already part of the Amazon Ecosystem, i see no reason why you wouldn't fall in love with this tablet.Pros:-Thin and light but NOT cheap feeling (except on the first point made below)-Screen is not too small or too big, i really think they hit the sweet spot on this 8.9'' Display, not a huge reach when you want to reach something in the middle and it allows it to be light enough to hold with one hand for a long time.-Bright Gorgeous Screen with high pixel density and great color accuracy.-Stereo Speakers (although not the loudest but it is just a tablet)-Great specs and Graphics-Simplistic UI good for adults and kids Alike-Good Assortment of free apps and free app of the day is a great idea.-Clever UI additions like swiping out the on screen navigation to get to recent apps, as well as, getting new application suggestions based on what you have already below the app.-Great amazon services and quick customer service even on the mayday. Mayday took me all of 10 to 15 seconds to get a live person pretty much every time.-Probably the best reading experience ive ever had on any tablet, hands down. This integration of the tablet with the reading app is fantastic. Its fast fluid and a pleasure to read with, They really picked apart the experience to make it better in pretty much every way, looking up words,authors, more information on the book as well as text customization's that all actually had a function and weren't too complicated and convoluted.Cons:-Bezel Pressing on the short sides lead to discoloration-The back buttons are a great idea and are implemented well enough this time BUT, they are too recessed into the unit and are hard to find and feel for, I never got used to it.-when lightly pressing on the short sides, the screens light seems to bleed into the display discoloring it. It doesn't burn into the screen, its something i noticed with this unit. My other tablets and phones have never done this.-Lack of Customization's even if you want them or not-Notification bar is full screen and seems like a blown up phone UI- The Soft touch back is a finger print magnet making the device look cheap and requiring regular cleaning and wiping down to make it look good.-Taking apps off the recent Carousel is annoying and tedious requiring a long press and hold then a tap on \"Remove from carousel\". This needs a faster and more intuitive way of removing them, especially since it gets so populated quickly with nonsense.-Lack of google Apps, and people should be given to choice to download from either the Play store or the Amazon App Store, but having said that, there app store is respectable has come a long way since the original Kindle fire, by a lot. They should give users the choice but obviously giving them incentive to use and buy the apps from the amazon store when they can find it.Basically this Kindle fire tablet is easy to fall in love with when you first pick it up.Any basic computing tasks are completed without a hiccup. Advanced tasks and gaming are also completed without any hiccups and are absolutely gorgeous on this display. Its Simple yet sexy exterior makes you want to pick it up and get enveloped. Although it not perfect it would be a great choice for Adults and kids and Adults who own it and let they're kids play it. There's parental controls and locks making this convenient.I wouldn't have trouble recommending this tablet to anyone looking for a fast simple and intuitive tablet experience, especially for adults.

It is now December and the capability to print material from the Fire HDX is not apparent.  Might be there, but I cannot find it.  Pre-delivery advertising made no mention of having to purchase - at additional cost - an app to get the printing capability.  The advertising made the printing capability sound like something included in a software update.I have become used to the weight of my Kindle ebook reader.

The tablet's performance is stellar, I have yet to trip it up with any game or application. Opening applications and switching between them is not just fast, it's nearly instantaneous. The screen is amazing and puts Apple's retina display to shame. Physically the tablet is comfortable to hold, pleasing to the touch, and extremely lightweight, making it very easy to tote around the house for a myriad of uses. The speakers are top notch with crystal clear audio. The optional origami case is very useful for table-top use of the tablet, holding it at a comfortable viewing angle and standing up to repeated pokes and swipes.The OS is very content-centric and responsive with the only major downside being the lack of Google Play store access. I'm a gamer and a lot of new generation games have companion apps that are just not available in the Amazon store. A workaround is to download the .APK and .OBB files of the application and upload them through USB via a PC, but that's a bit more of a pain than it needs to be to get this kind of functionality.Overall it's a great tablet, but the lack of Google Play access is slightly heartbreaking. You can search for your desired apps in the Amazon App store and it will auto-complete your searches like it has your app, only to discover that it's not available through the AA store.

Initially I loved the many of the great features of the new Kindle HDX. Other reviews detail them quite well so I wont. I will add that, as a photographer, I found a great little wireless device on Amamzon to upload my picture from my sd cards (or a usb drive) on to the outstanding screen very conveniently. Here is a link to the EZOpower device..it's great with the Kindle once you sideload the app for it.B00EP13JBCNot cheap but a super work around .What I didnt know is that the rear facing camera appears to only work correctly with the Origami cases. I dislike that they need a table like surface to keep the kindle in a stable upright position so I bought a case from FInite. What I discovered (after 3 hours of very nice tech support from various folks at Amazon) is that the case causes the Kindle to think it is not ready to take a picture and therefore it stays in the instruction mode waiting for you to slide the tablet out as you would with the Origami cases. The ONLY way to get it to work it to remove the case entirely. It basically means you care forced to use the Origami case if you want full functionality with your Kindle. I got a response from Finite saying that they were aware of the problem and that all 3rd party cases have this issue to to an update done to the HDX line by Amazon in November after the cases were produced. Amazon folks were nice but said they can only verify the Oragami cases as being fully compatible with the new Kindle line. So I am very sad butgoing to return this snappy piece of technology. As a consumer I dont like having to be forced into a corner and limited by my equipment but at this point it seems that Amazon has created a problem I cant work around. :-(", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Device For Accessing Amazon Content, But Otherwise Very Limited", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3O9J6I1V5SOCK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This device has a ton of potential. The hardware is top notch and the screen is near-perfect. Some of the software features are fantastic, especially the Mayday help feature which works great and has been helpful multiple times already. The tight integration with Amazon services is a huge plus for us, since we use so many Amazon services.Unfortunately, we also use many Google services, and this device doesn't speak Google very well. Specifically, we use Google Apps for Business for almost everything online, but this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 just doesn't allow us to use those services the same way a regular Android device would.Also, one of the things I love about Android devices is the customization, and most of that is right out the window on Fire OS. No custom launchers, no custom lock screens, no home screen widgets... and this highlights the biggest drawback for me: the Amazon App Store is just too limited. For example, I really dislike the stock Kindle Fire keyboard. It auto-corrects at the most annoying times, it doesn't learn very well, and it's generally just not very efficient. I'm used to the 3rd party SwiftKey keyboard. But that's not available for Fire OS at all. Neither is ANY 3rd party keyboard app. Most of the stuff available in the Amazon App Store is a bunch of games which are intended to separate me from my money rather than provide a useful function. Since I'm not much of a gamer, that's not useful for me. There are SOME productivity and utility apps available in the store, but very few. Nothing even close to what I can do with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.And that really sums up this device in a nutshell... there's a whole lot of things you can't do with it. About the only thing this tablet can do that an Android tablet can't do is play Amazon Videos. This device is mostly meant as an easy way to access Amazon content, not as a serious productivity tool. I was looking more for a companion device to my Galaxy Note II, but instead I ended up with something closer to an entertainment gateway.I'm still trying to decide if I want to send it back. It's not seeing much use right now. It just kinda sits on our living room table for a few days, until someone needs to use it and realizes that the battery has died. Then we plug it in to recharge it and the process starts all over again.I did try to shoehorn some Google-specific apps in there, like Gmail and Chrome. There are guides on the web that explain how to do so without voiding your warranty. But the Kindle Fire just isn't designed to handle some of the functions these apps require, and there are frequent error messages that crop up and need to be dismissed, even when you're not actively using those Google apps. It's not a very pleasant experience. We'd be better off sticking to what this device was meant for, which is consuming Amazon content.edit: it really is a gorgeous device, and that bears repeating.

Of the ones I checked - about 20% are downloadable - and that stinks too!I have had minor glitch with the browser crapping out.

First to get more storage than my original Kindle Fire and second to achieve more versatility. I definitely have more storage and can put more content on it. But the promised versatility is disappointing. The only way to \"output\" content from your Kindle to a TV is through Miracast. So, if you have an older TV, it HAS to have an HDMI port and you have to have purchase an adapter, which is another $60-$90.(I bought the Netgear version.)The mirroring works pretty well if you have nice, high def media. So a high def movie I created looks great; HBO-to-go streaming, not so much. The movies I downloaded from Amazon were not \"highest\" quality, so on larger TVs, these movies get pixelated pretty fast. Consequently, when traveling and I want to hook up this device to another television to substitute for local content, I will make sure to download the highest resolution. Good thing I got maximum storage. I'll also need to plan for the longer downloads of highest quality content before traveling and will make sure I purchase the high def versions from Amazon.I also purchased the Bluetooth keyboard. The keyboard is kind of cheap feeling--lightweight plastic. That isn't necessarily bad,I like the lightness. But the size is just a bit bigger than the device so hauling it around requires some slop in a case. I have the origami case right now, and it's okay, but I'm not sure the designers of the device, case, and keyboard talked to each other to create transport efficiencies.Also, I've found that the device is sensitive and often \"quits\" from an application or a book with the slightest movement. (This might be a result of the buttons on the back of the device and their interaction with the origami case.) This also is disappointing. The screen, size, and weight are outstanding. The sound isn't all it's amped up to  be but it's still pretty good for a small device. If it weren't for the disappointing versatility, I would say this provides beautiful high-def quality and a pretty good choice. But for larger display use, this device is limited. As a mobile device for doing work, it's not bad, but still doesn't offer the versatility of a Surface, for example. In the end, the amount I spent on this device and all the accoutrements could have purchased a high-end Windows 8 or similar tablet and provided me greater flexibility.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love My New 8.9 HDX, 64GB Kindle", "Author": "Kate Fredericks \"Kate\"", "ReviewID": "R3F6UC5ZB0DKXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th Kindle and by far the best yet. I am not well versed in all things technology, I just like what I like. The very first thing I noticed when lifting it out of its box, was how light it is. I truly had no idea it was going to be lighter than all of the previous versions, but the difference is, I can actually hold this tablet comfortably with one hand while typing with the other. I could not do this for more than a minute or so with my other 4 Kindles. Plus, the sleekness of the style helps, too. It is not boxy like the other versions, but curves under which surprisingly gives my holding hand a much better grip.The clarity of picture was the second thing I noticed when I fired up my knew super-duper Kindle. Everything was so sharp, it almost hurt my eyes! The third thing I noticed was the speed. Compared to my last 8.9 HD, this thing flies! The fourth thing I noticed is FINALLY a new and far better key board. I type about 80 WPM on my laptop. I know I don't type that fast on these built in keyboards, but this is the first time I have felt like I am typing on a solid, well-built tablet keyboard. It has kept up with everything I type (something the old 8.9 HD never did), and has a far better auto correct function. The auto correct function is also much faster learning words it doesn't recognize, something that drove me crazy on the old 8.9 HD.As for the battery, I am in the process of testing it now. I gave it a full charge yesterday and took it off around 5:00 p.m. I did some Twitter and Facebook, accidentally found the camera which I immediately took several pictures and movies in very low light. I have a black Lab and a black cat. In low light I literally can't get a decent picture of either of them and if I use flash, all I get are eyes (in low light). This thing took amazing pictures AND movies of both of my animals which when played back were the clearest I have been able to get them.As for the Mayday button, having owned so many Kindles, I chuckled when I read it was a feature. But when I could NOT figure out how to move some important apps from my 8.9 HD to this new HDX, I decided to give it a try. Within a minute, I was talking to a very nice young lady, who took control of my Kindle, showed me how to move what could be moved and along with me learning that my favorite weather app was not yet compatible with this one. RATS! So, I suppose you all who know electronics well might not need that button, but THANK YOU AMAZON, for the likes of me who need a helping hand now and again.I actually brought home and tried the new Windows 8 tablet and it SERIOUSLY could not even remotely compare with the old 8.9 HD let alone my new HDX which is way way better than that Surface (in my opinion). Not going to go into details here, let's just say I already know the Kindle, and after using this new HDX, I am staying with the Kindle. To get back to the battery. I have been on and off all day, and am finishing this review with 75% of the battery left! That is jaw dropping for me. I had to stay plugged into my old Kindles because I was lucky to get 3 hours doing the same thing. It has now been 27 hours and this Kindle has only used 25% of its battery?I wholeheartedly recommend this 8.9 HDX, 64 GB Kindle.

A true Wifi device needs to offer a means of downloading or streaming away from your home.The download speed was limited to 3 kbps which is typical of limited public Wifi sites. Streaming was impossible on the Kindle while my Lenovo Twist had no trouble at all streaming Netflix. Also, after purchasing hundreds of paperback and hardbound books only 6 books were available from the Matchbook Kindle special pricing(2.99, 1.99, 99) on books I already own. So sad.

I am extremely pleased with my decision.  After extensive research, comparing the KF HDX 8.9\" to the competition tablets, I decided to purchase the KF HDX 8.9\" since it met my needs the most.  I\u2019m already an active member of the Amazon family in that I\u2019m a Prime member, I currently own the Kindle Keyboard, and have MP3 music stored in my Amazon Cloud, so it was almost a given decision for me.  What was important for me was to have a large amount of storage and have the 4G LTE option tablet, therefore I purchased the 64G with the AT&T; 4G LTE built into my tablet.I have the ease of adding the 4G LTE prepaid monthly plan onto my tablet when traveling, and have enough storage to store several downloaded movies for airline flight viewing, along with many games, books, and music already stored onto my device.  The 4G LTE service works great when out of Wi-Fi range, and with being an Amazon Prime member I\u2019m able to download certain T.V. shows and movies.  It took me about 1 hour to download a 50 minute T.V. episode in HD 1080 quality (I kept the tablet plugged in and charging while performing the download).  I had no problems with downloading and viewing the episodes was just fine.The built in Amazon environment is perfect, and easy to navigate on the tablet.  Watching videos via my Prime Membership is flawless and the HD quality and surround sound is excellent, better than expected.  Having the Mayday button is convenient, and I\u2019ve successfully utilized this feature about six times.My battery consumption averages about 10 \u2013 13 hours between charges, depending on my use.  If my use is higher on playing games and streaming/downloading, then I get about 10 hours.  If I use the tablet for reading more, than it\u2019s about 12 \u2013 14 hours.  I perform the functions that help prolong the battery usage, in that I keep my tablet in airplane mode so that it is not constantly pinging for Wi-Fi behind the scenes, manually power off my tablet when not in use, lowered the brightness as much as possible, set my device to go into the power save mode after 1 minute of non-use, and to check for emails every hour.Even though the KF tablet is lightweight, I do wish that the screen size for the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" was larger (about the IPad Air size) since the actual screen size when powered on is less than 8.9 due to the blank black edging.  Also, not having flash player support is a negative.  I haven\u2019t tried out the mirror-flick to my T.V. since my T.V. doesn\u2019t have this feature.  I wish the HDX tablet also had the HDMI outlet built in like the older models.For the most part, I feel the Kindle Fire available apps meet my needs, however, there\u2019s a few apps that I wish were available, from companies like SW Airlines, etc\u2026 I do like that the HDX 8.9\"  has GPS built in (you can turn this feature off), so I\u2019m able to utilize the Mapquest app perfectly.  Also, the silk browser seems to respond quickly and I like being able to access multiple tabs at the same time.For night reading, since the white backlit background is too bright for me even when the brightness is reduced to zero, I like the choice of background colors in which I change mine to light brown that is much easier on the eyes for nighttime reading.  However, for daylight reading I still prefer my old Kindle Keyboard in which I can read in direct sunlight with no glare.  I\u2019m unable to do that with the tablet, but I\u2019ve heard changing the reading background to black with white text helps (haven\u2019t tried that yet).In summary, the 64 G Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" with built in 4G LTE service meets/exceed my needs.  I\u2019m very pleased with my purchased.

I was not motivated to try Gen 2 but when they rolled out the new HDX I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to the KF HDX 8.9 w/32 GB, w/o special offers.Overall this device has had it\u2019s issues.  If you read most of the 1 and 2 star reviews these are largely people who apparently didn\u2019t do much if any research prior to purchase and now discover the limitations with access to certain features they expected, dedicated \u201cappholes\u201d who still can\u2019t believe the device doesn\u2019t support Flash or some esoteric game or another, and then die-hard Apple devotees who will never be satisfied unless there\u2019s a Macintosh apple logo on it and the few who missed the part about no mini- HDMI port.I went in eyes wide open and yet there are many things that could be better.  Much touted battery life isn\u2019t so great from what I\u2019ve observed and agree with many the charging port appears to be very fragile.  I bought the overpriced Origami vinyl case and dislike the floppy foldable cover and the fact it takes your featherweight KF and turns it into a boat anchor (using it will tone up your forearms pronto).  It also does quirky things like after the last OS update a number of the very few apps I have installed lost their color icons only to be replaced by a grayed out box\u2026they still work but why are they like this (on the cloud too).  The new KF will pester you constantly to enable \u201cLocation Based Services\u201d and there\u2019s no way to make it stop.  You\u2019ll be watching a video and the dialog box will pop up interrupting the show, once I say \u201cno\u201d , that should suffice.  Prior to the OS update often when turning on Wi-Fi the device would re-boot itself, many folks have complained of this but for now with mine it seems to have stopped.  Finally, even though I paid the $15 to spare myself the \u201cspecial offers\u201d advertising you still get little \u201csuggestions\u201d on the carousel with whatever book, song, app, etc. that\u2019s showing which I could live without.So far, none of these are show stoppers but they do give me pause and given some of the fine Android based tablets available as an alternative I may try one of those next go-round.

I had an original Kindle Fire 7 inch and a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and both felt fairly sluggish compared to other tablets.  I remember reading about how revolutionary the Silk browser would be but in practical use it was much slower than other browsers.  The extra speed gained by caching certain websites was lost when the processor couldn't handle loading pages.  Not any more! With the new processor every thing on this thing flies.  going into to apps, and books and trying processor heavy actions couldn't hold it back, every thing felt really fast and I wasn't constantly waiting for things to load like I had with the previous versions of kindle fire.  It really is a noticeable difference and a huge improvement.The fire OS 3.0 is really great.  while things look similar its a fresh coat of paint that was desperately needed.  the all ways there carousel is a lot better than the favorites tray of days past.  It really does make a big difference having all the apps immediately available instead of digging through menus.Video and the screen are super clear.  HD video looks amazing and every thing on the carousel is crisp and clear.  While this is a big upside there is a small downside in that i can see pixilation in some of my comic book novels I bought on kindle.  They apparently weren't created with HD in mind and now its distracting to see pixilation when every thing else on screen is so clear.  Comixology has upgraded their app for HD comics so its not an issue their.  My comixology books look incredible.  Hopefully this is temporary and the resolution of said books will be updated (I won't hold my breath though).x-ray features are really cool.  The movie and book x-ray features are back and even better.  you can make flashcards in books, you can see every time a character or place is mentioned and simply navigate books better than ever.  I was never a fan of having to hyperlink to the table of contents then hyperlink from there to the chapter you want and hope its the right now.  Now the chapters appear within the control menu of the book so you can go directly to another chapter while not switching pages.  You can highlight in more than one color now.  The notes and other extras are all a lot better integrated and slicker than ever.  There is also goodreads integration so you can read your friends reviews, write reviews from in the book, and see general good reads reviews as well all within the book.  The music x-ray is cool, you can now karaoke along with lyrics of songs you own.  It feels gimmicky but its nice to have and once there is better mirrorcast functionality its cool you can have impromptu karaoke sessions.  The movies x-ray is improved too.  Now you can go directly to famous quotes and trivia scenes via hyperlink.  Trivia from IMDB now shows up along with the actors/actresses that are on screen.  All and all lots of good improvements here.Mayday is all right.  I did it as a test run when I got it and while its nice its there I doubt i'll ever need it again.  It is nice that I could recommend a kindle fire to older non-tech savvy relatives and they have an easy tech support outlet that isn't me.Not so GoodApps, apps, apps.  Same complaint with every model in that you don't get the complete android app store.  While they are getting better at getting bigger apps there are still a slew of what I would consider top priority apps I can't get.  There is the entire google suite which we will pretty much never get our hands on but also apps like marvel comics unlimited, weight watchers, uverse, darkhorse comics, dropbox, etc. which have an android app but not in the amazon store.  I have been sideloading them on with varying degrees of success but it is frustrating to know the app exists but you are locked out of it.  This alone is the biggest downside of the kindle fire experience.  If I had access to all these apps it'd be a 5 out of 5 with just beaming radiance of amazon love.Long term upgrades.  With this being the third generation its clear that after a year you aren't going to get upgrades or support for your kindle.  I can understand when you upgrade the processor like you do for this iteration that putting fire os 3.0 might now be possible on the kindle fire HD 8.9 but there are a lot of things they could have upgraded they didn't.  The kindle reading app on the kindle fire hd 8.9 is inferior to the reading app on the ipad.  This just shouldn't be the case.  when you add features like multicolor highlighting and x-ray it should be across the line of devices.  While I love my kindle now there is real fear that in a year it will be missing cool new features and I know I will never get them.  It makes the iPad a lot better looking device when you know you'll have at least two and maybe more years of support to follow.Lack of Chromecast/screen share.  Maybe this will get better down the line but with out a hdmi output the solution of being able to mirrorcast your screen has a utter lack of support.  There are a couple of dongles you can by to use this feature and apparently future Samsung TV's will support it but as of now that's it.  The Fire Netflix app supports chromecast but the HBOGO app doesn't.  Amazon needs to get release its own screencast device and support chromecast fully to give people options.Battery life seems better all though it does drain a lot of battery while in stand by.  With my ipad if in stand by it'll last like a week, with my kindle fire a good 20-30% battery is lost if I leave it on and asleep all day.  usage battery life is up which is nice but like I said its a pain when I pick it up at the end of the day and find the battery is dead or close to dead.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little tablet", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "RNYJXWPI5214T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Will not be buying that new laptop, this tablet does everything I need.

Again, I thought the HD 9\" Kindle would be all I needed and loved it, but then the HDX came out and had even more capabilities that I could use.  One of the most important reasons why I bought the HDX is because it is thinner and weighs less than the Kindle HD.  The picture/screen is more resilient and the other driving reason I bought it is because of the camera - not just a front facing one (which is an app on the HD camera) but is a real camera with zoom and video and other capabilities.  The one main issue that is somewhat of a negative however is that nowhere does it tell you that if you want to watch a movie by connecting to the TV, you have to purchase an additional 'unit' (I spent $60 for it).  I thought that the 'adapter' I bought for the Kindle HD would work just fine - but no, it is entirely incompatible with the HDX!

But they must have more demands for there office than I do. Let me say though that the arguments about it not having a good office suite are false. I live by my office suit and I love the one that I have one my Kindle Fire HDX. You can get Polaris Office, King Soft Office and several others that will allow full editing of documents, Spread Sheets and Power Points. No, it is not like Microsoft Office, nor can it be. A tablet of any kind simply does not have the capacity to operate such a monster of a program. But the features and abilities of a good office app on the Kindle are nothing to sneeze at. The idea that the Kindle is a toy is anything but accurate. I have no games or movies on my K.F.HDX and just a few books. It is filled with stuff for work... that is what I got it for. I am able to transfer data back home when I am in Russia, I can do anything I need to in my documents and spreadsheets. Great Map apps, Calendars, Database apps, transfer of old docs to Kindle, Cloud apps, Bible apps, Email, Notebooks, Calculators, unit converters and other office tools, the list goes on and on. The only thing I can figure is that either some people demand more than a man who has an office in the states and has to access it overseas, or they did not spend much time looking for an app that did there job right.

(Did a lot of reading about tablets.)  I needed the 4G due to needing it in some isolated locations.  First one--I went through HELL trying to activate the 4G.  Surprisingly, Verizon was beyond horrible.  I can't begin to describe how non-functional and totally not customer oriented they were.  But the Fire SIM card for Verizon wasn't functional--which was on Amazon.  Ultimately, had to get a new SIM card from Verizon and finally got it activated.  Fine.  Worked well for a week--and then slowly died!  Finally had to get another Fire from Amazon.  The new one is working fairly well now.  Not sure if the difficulties I'm having on occasion are with the Apps, or it's the Fire.  Such a bad experience initially, I'm a bit leery now.  The really fabulous thing about the Fire, though is the MayDay function!!!  If you're not a tech geek and would like some help with, well, anything about your Fire, the MayDay function is absolutely everything they say it is!  The people I've worked with have been absolutely incredible, patient, and work with you until things are solved.  Without that function, I'd probably being rating the Fire a zero right now.  I'd rate the MayDay function 10 stars!

What amazes me is how fast it is.  I setup my apps and subscriptions so much faster and simpler than I did with other devices.  When I took it out of the box, there is a quick start guide which I used to hook up the charger, and I began running it while it was charging up the battery.  When I tested my video apps such as Netflix,Hulu Plus,Epix and HBO GO, I was surprised at how fluid the motion pictures were.  Also they were in HD.  I downloaded some of my Kindle books that were stored in the cloud, and that was quick.  There seems to be so much that can be done with this that I have yet to find out.  I like the fact that the user manual is installed on the device for easy access, and there is a \"mayday\" button to talk with a live customer service rep to walk me through any problems if I should have need to.

I always enjoyed it, with the exception of the poor workmanship of the charging port. Amazon made that right by giving me a Fire HD (the first gen of the HD with the camera) for a minor cost upgrade even though my Fire was 2 years old.  I appreciated that and then bought this.  This really does a great job of tying it all together.  The only complaint I have about the Fire platform is that it's a little too \"Apple\" for me.  What I mean by that is that because Amazon earns so much off their content, they purposely limit what they feel is competition.  I can't use Chrome as a browser and I can't download dropbox. (on their native settings... I've not attempted to d/l apps from other sources yet), but that's all on the \"App\" side. The actual tablet is a nice tablet (a great size) and has most of the bells and whistles i need. I wish it had GPS for the basic WiFi version (My Nexus 7 does) but where they go wrong there, they have a flash for the camera.

It wasn't hard to figure out, even though I'm not very tech savvy. Whenever I got stuck, I called the Help line and with one exception, everyone was very knowledgeable and walked me through my questions/problems.  The battery life is great! I use it to read daily and when it gets down to 60-70%, I charge it for a while.  Doesn't take long to get back to 100%.  The issues/downside:  There was (is?) a packaging snafu and the adapter cord did not fit the adapter properly, therefore, the Kindle wouldn't charge. I had gotten an extra 9W adapter and after problem solving this with the Help line, I was sent what I needed at no charge, in very little time. After resolving that problem, recharging is much faster than my laptop.  My other disappointments were 1) it's not compatible with the program that allows me to play some of my online games, although I've been told that addition is being negotiated; and 2) I live in the Florida Keys, too far from the mainland for greater access to E books, so aside from purchasing the books I want to read, what's available to me for free is very limited. This is probably not an issue for people on the mainland. I have, however, been able to buy the books I wanted from Amazon ($9.99).

Other tablets I have/have used extensively are: two previous versions of the ipad (job issued), a nexus 7, galaxy note 8 and a galaxy note 10.1 2014 (beautiful but returned because of changes to how handwriting recognition worked - see my review if interested) and a kindle fire 7 (original).  I have some background for comparison.Pro's:  A beautiful and responsive touch screen with plenty of power \"under the hood\".  The device is never laggy.  Great \"consumable content\" through the Amazon ecosystem including the ability to download some prime video (great for me because I travel extensively).  Relatively long battery life when compared to the Galaxy note 8.  Great value for the price.  Superb Amazon customer service - they stand behind their products and my experience with this product has been no different.  I consider this last pro to be one of the most important to me.Cons:  Limited apps in the appstore.  I agree with most reviewers that you can find most of what you need, HOWEVER, there are some caveats:  some of my favorite apps are not the most recent versions and can be buggy (Flipboard and Zite crash occasionally and im not sure if its the apps themselves or something with the Kindle), silk browser is improved over prior versions but still isnt on par with other browsers in rendering the odd page here and there (and what do you know?  you cant easily use any other browser yeah, I know I can sideload but should I have to? maybe this is because the default is for use of accelerated page loading so your data goes through Amazon's servers and they can use it to market to you?)  Additionally, battery life can be erratic occasionally and I had a black screen that didnt go away with power button reset so I had to completely reset it.  The onscreen keyboard is shifted to the right and makes it difficult to touch type but the ability to \"swype\" type negates that issue for me.I know the cons look like a long list but in reality it isnt.

She loves it. The download speeds are quick and the picture on it is amazing. The operating system was no problem because she was already familiar with the Android system thanks to her phone. She takes it with her when my daughter is at practice which before, with her laptop, would have been too cumbersome. If she is using her Kindle and she needs to do something, she simply (and easily) sets it to the side, goes about her task and easily returns to where she left off. The size is ideal and she doesn't worry about the \"leg burn\" you can get from a laptop sitting on your legs. The battery life is perfect and she takes it with her everywhere she goes. The portability is miles ahead of where a traditional laptop would be.

When tying it onto the Prime membership, it makes it a winning combination. There are a few reasons why I can't give 5 stars to this Kindle:1. No Google integration - Yes, I know what everyone else will say. If you really want that you should've bought either Google hardware or go with Samsung, etc. Sure, you're right. But no, that doesn't mean Google integration should not be part of the package. What happened if Google decided not to support any Amazon app (and just removed them all from Play store)? I wish Amazon would just allow Google apps in and let the market decide who they want to go with. Again, this hardware is just plain beautiful.2. Problem with speakers - Within the first few weeks I had a problem with speakers where they just stopped working.After reaching out to Mayday (awesome service, Amazon!) the service person suggested that I would insert/remove headphone jack and see if that would fix the issue. It did immediately. The person went on to say that it was a known issue and product development was working on it. I just wish there was some communication/fix on the issue already.Overall this is a great device. I am still enjoying it very much and look forward to updates to the ecosystem.

I found the iPad4 overpriced for my needs and it is heavy compared to the Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet.  As most rave about in these reviews, I agree the screen display is superior on the HDX and it is faster.  I suppose there are users that can actually use many of the missing apps that the iPad offers but I can't.I trust Amazon to enhance the Fire HDX as time goes on.  The Flash player or something equivalent would be a great addition.For me, a portable device, like a tablet, will never replace a \"real\" computer.  I chose the Fire HDX because I'm a big reader of eBooks and I think Amazon has the edge on Apple with regard to the number and price of their eBooks.I have had my HDX for two months and have no complaints;  I recommend this device without reservations.TBlue Moon over Cuba: Aerial Reconnaissance during the Cuban Missile Crisis (General Aviation)", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best", "Author": "LINDA HOUGHOTN", "ReviewID": "R2AGB8FQ5CY06I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so in love with my Kindle Fire HDX.
