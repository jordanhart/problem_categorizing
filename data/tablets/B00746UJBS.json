{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10\" class.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R3IQD3SQXBM5AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7\" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10\" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11\" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like \"Dissolve\" with \"Zoom in on Faces\", or the nifty multi-photo \"Origami\" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled \"productivity\" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10\" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations\u00bb UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10\" class, but I personally find all 10\" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7\" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7\" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8\" than 7\". If 10\" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10\" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but ...", "Author": "Bookenz", "ReviewID": "R2Z4YKL3AP05RB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a big iPad fan and was waiting anxiously for the third generation to come out.  I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded.  I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2.  So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one.  Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was.  I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot.  I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side  by side.  I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard.  I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue.  Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm.  Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it.  This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book.  My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot.  I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2.  They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem.  He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me.  But I'm certainly no expert.  I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again.  For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad.  These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both.  Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.Update January 7, 2014 - since writing this review for the iPad 3, which I ended up returning, I've moved on to the iPad Air, which is noticeably lighter and faster than the iPad 2.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead?", "Author": "Ron Cronovich \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R1CZFLUXXQIC7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10\" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are \"post-paid\" and \"pre-paid.\"  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can \"suspend\" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perspective from an Android and Windows User", "Author": "J. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RUYOPTD4UA08T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I realize I must have been living under a rock for the past few years since I've never owned an Apple product.  I've been using PCs since I was a kid in the early 90s and Android on my smartphone for three years (Blackberry before that).  So it was not an easy decision for me to take the plunge on the New iPad.  Below are my findings thus far, some of which I knew before buying and some that I've learned since.  I won't spend time reviewing technical details or comparisons to the iPad 2.  There are dozens of professional reviews out there that have done as much.  Instead, this is my perspective in using the iPad after so many years with non iOS products.Positives:+ Beautiful design, form, fit, etc.  Always seems to be the case for Apple products (sometimes to the point of diminished functionality as noted below)+ Best screen.  I've always worked with large, high resolution monitors (current is 1440 27\").  This screen is gorgeous as everyone has called out.+ Best battery life at 10 or so hours; I've only had it 6 days but nothing leads me to believe 10 hours is overstated+ Best selection of tablet-specific apps.  There's really no comparison here and it will likely take years for Android and eventually Win 8 to catch up+ Tons of 3rd party products such as cases in every possible style+ Easy to use content via iTunes+ Compared to laptop, instant on and long battery life are ideal for videos and entertainment on the go, quick surfing, etc.  Touch of course is very intuitive (love to watch my five year old use it on her own)Negatives:- Big Brother In Charge:  Locked factory home screen, really?  I guess I've been spoiled with all the freedoms that Android includes (no iron curtain there).  But if I want to get rid of an Apple factory icon, I can't.  Instead, only secondary screens are up to me.  In general, there is very limited ability to tweak settings.  Way too controlling for a $700 device in my opinion.- No guided turn by turn navigation and GPS struggles to get location where my Android phone picks it up instantly;  standard on even $50 Android phones- Having used the Android Market (now Play) for years, I am accustomed to trying out ad-supported apps for free, and then buying ad-free versions of the ones I find the most useful.  Now I'm still early into iOS, but I am finding a lot more paid only apps and far fewer ad-supported free apps.  I'll keep looking but this is my initial impression.- No SD and overpriced memory upgrade only available at time of purchase- No USB to connect camera and other accessories to, and Apple OEM only camera kit for a high price for what it is.- Occasional stutter or delayed response.  Generally very smooth as reviewers have said, but both my wife and I have seen this happen once or twice an hour.I'll do a follow-up in a couple weeks when I've had more time with it.  I still wouldn't consider an iPhone over Android.  But for tablets, Apple is the game in town right now both for hardware and ecosystem.  If Android/Win 8 tablets approached the hardware quality of the new iPad (screen, battery life, etc), and their respective app stores built up a good base of available apps, I probably would choose one of them over iOS due to above negatives.  I realize some of the reasons Apple has been so successful is that they lock their products down fairly tight.  But they also clearly are gaming the customer to drive additional purchases, expensive upgrades or future product replacements, etc.In summary, I think the new iPad is an amazing product that I wouldn't have imagined only a few years ago.  For that, I'm willing to part with my hard earned dollars and enjoy it.  But I'd also gladly swap it for an Android/Win 8 tablet in a couple years when those markets mature.Update 1 Month In:+ Battery life continues to be amazing+ Form/weight/screen all a delight+ Compared to using laptop, find that we use more including short-bursts; instant on is great+ Awesome as a digital photo frame for sharing photos- 10 Watt power supply is somewhat ridiculous considering iPad contains laptop size battery; charges take about 6-8 hours, depending on how far one lets it run down;  for comparison, typical laptop comes with 40-60 watt power supply and charge in 1.5-2.5 hours- Lack of Flash is bigger drawback than I anticipated; Kids sites/games especially depend on Flash- Wi-Fi is considerably slower than on laptop and even Android phones;  SpeedTest confirms speeds 50-60% slower", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The New ipad, to be or not to be?", "Author": "LionKing \"bas\"", "ReviewID": "R2YMNHE7JHO3UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Retina Display", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R3P5S7NHNE0Z0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40\" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins.

Some quick pros and cons:PROS vs Android/Asus:*Retina Display: The screen is very good, but coming from the Asus, which has a higher resolution than the iPad 2, I was not blown away by it. It feels like a larger version of the Retina display on the iPod Touch, a device which I also use frequently. Coming from these two quality screens, the new iPad display was not a massive step up in quality, but I suspect many people who have been using different devices will be pleasantly surprised. Where this display shines is in color saturation and text quality. Images pop off of the screen and reading is the best I have seen on any handheld device.*App Selection: Many have made this point, but it is worth mentioning again. The App selection on iPad blows Android out of the water. There really is no comparison here. Even the free apps seem to be of higher quality than on Android.* UI: The smoothness of the UI on the iPad is second to none. The screen registers every swipe and gesture, and pages flip seamlessly and with high quality animation. The ASUS Transformer features the much discussed 2 second \"Android lag,\" which is not a deal breaker, but feels less sophisticated compared to the iPad (although this seems less of an issue in ICS).s* Build Quality: The solidity of the iPad is a major plus compared to the Transformer. The iPad is heavy, solid, and the tactile transition from glass to brushed metal is appealing and borderline luxurious. The Asus simply feels like a sheet of plastic (which it is). The Asus also suffers from noticeable light bleeding, the charger also died within a year and the keyboard dock had to be RMA'd and repaired. I don't think these things will be an issue with the iPad.CONS vs Android/Asus:* OS: I may be in the minority here, but I find Android to be a more feature rich and deep OS. I like having some degree of control over my devices, and I appreciate the fact that Android lets me get \"under the hood\" a bit more than iOS. It doesn't trap me within a proprietary \"ecosystem\" of content, it allows me to use the device as an external hard drive to transfer media, and I can expand the storage via MicroUSB as I see fit (This has been beaten to death, but Apple really needs to allow users to expand storage-even on a proprietary basis). And there are also little touches that I think are well done, such as Android's ability to run many programs at once and allow the user to flip through them- a feature that I miss in iOS.  Its Gmail widget is an invaluable and quick way to check email, and its placement of the back button is far superior to iOS. This last point may seem minor, but the Android back button at the bottom of the screen is more convenient as you do not have to remove your hands from the device to go back to a previous screen.*Weight: I prefer a heavier device but I know this is an issue for some people. The iPad is noticeably heavier than the Transformer (but lighter than other Android tablets, such as the Acer Iconia).*Keyboard Dock: This is a wonderful, albeit expensive, add-on for the Asus Transformer. The keyboard dock/charger is incredibly useful as it extends battery life, expands storage, and enhances usability. I know that you can use Apple's bluetooth mouse and keyboard with the iPad, but the all-in-one solution from Asus is more appealing as it basically affords you the convenience of a netbook and a tablet. I suspect this will be the future of mobile computing. As I noted above, however, my keyboard was defective out of the box and reviews suggest that the build quality of these units is quite poor.OVERALL: If you are new to tablets and want the best UI and great ease of use, go for the iPad. If you are technically inclined and want more control over your device, go with a high-end Android tablet. The iPad has the best tablet hardware on the market, but Android as an OS is closing the gap.  That having been said, Apple's iPad, while not revolutionizing the act of computing, is instead changing how we consume the internet, and the newest iteration of the iPad is the most convincing example of this vision.**UPDATE**I just wanted to confirm that I too have experienced the extremely long recharge times reported various internet outlets (about 5 and a half hours in my case). It by no means detracts from my enjoyment of the product, but planning recharges and making sure to top off the charge at appropriate times does reduce the device's mobility.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Desktop Replacement?  Almost there!", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "RQOIJ6LERWJ60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the pleasure of trying out most of the new Apple products for the last few years.  If you have any questions or requests for clarifications you can leave a comment, and I'll be emailed, or you can email me directly by clicking on my name and looking for the link.I mostly use an iPad 1, but I have the opportunity to use an iPad 2 often.A lot has changed since the iPad came out, and I wrote my original review (located here:Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi) titled with a quote from Woz, saying \"Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing\" and its still very true.  Tablets aren't like PCs, you don't need to maintain them or worry about software requirements at all.  Its wonderful for people who hate that.  My friend can tell you exactly what processor his last laptop had, but what processor does his iPad have?  He'll say \"Don't know, don't care\".  If you are wondering why to get a tablet at all, I would recommend that you read that review. Its the second review on that page.So I bought the new iPad, the 2.5, or whatever you want to call it.  I'm not going to go into the tech specs, because, they are posted everywhere and unless you are a geek you will also fall into the \"don't know/don't care\" category.  I'm going to try to focus on just telling you what I would want to know before I bought it.  This review will be about real use.I chose a 32GB version.  Why?1) The new apps that will support the retina display are supposed to take more memory, so you should expect that whatever you had on your older iPad will take more space on this new one.2) I feel that the days of 16GB being enough may soon be passing.  With my 16GB iPad I was actually having to start managing my memory.  I had to start leaving things off it.3) The more powerful the iPad becomes, the more I expect to use it.  And this means, more memory will be needed.  The iPad has never been my primary \"computer\", but with this iteration it might be there:  I can plug an HD screen into it via HDMI now, and use a nice bluetooth keyboard.  However, you have to use the iPad itself as a gigantic touchpad, as you can't use a pointing device.  It mirrors whats on the screen, so, its clumsy-but-possible.  Still, we are getting so close to throwing the ipad down on the desk at work and just... working.So for the first time I plunked down my hard earned money for the 32GB version.  I think the 16GB version will be like having a 4GB iPhone 2G.I'd also like to point out that despite the improvements and upgrades, Apple is maintaining the same starting price that it did for the iPad 1 and the iPad 2.  This is very nice.The main new things -for me- in order of importance are:1)  The 4G LTE network (I have the AT&T; version).  We'll skip the cell phone enthusiast argument over whether this is really a 4G device, because 4G was actually supposed to be (clears throat) even better.  Because in spite of that, the 4G LTE may be the primary reason I plunked down my change and bought it.  I want to be able to do my work remotely without problems.I ran some tests on the new iPad.--In my office, which has a 6mbps DSL and wifi, I saw a 3.6Mbps upload and a  512k upload.  You might say \"who cares?\"  Ah but wait.--I signed up for the 3GB Data Plan at $30/mo, and when using the 4g LTE network, I saw a 17Mbps connection.--And at home, where we have the fiber optic connection, I only saw an 11Mbps connection.--And finally, my iPhone 4s got a lousy 2.5Mbps on the AT&T; 4G non-LTE network.So there you have the relative speeds.  All calculated using the Speed Test app.So here's the point... the new 4G service is a major upgrade.  On the LTE network it is very fast - however, I did experience some latency when just checking emails traveling in a car driving 70 mph.  This is typical for this technology, it seems to have problem switching from tower to tower.  But if you are sitting at a park downtown then I don't think you'll see those problems.  What does this mean?  You should see a movie download in 1/2 to 1/4 of the time. And the iPad will be able to act as a wifi hub for all your devices.  In other words, I will be able to use the iPad for internet for my laptop too.  Now, at the time of this writing, it should be noted that you cannot use your iPad as a wifi hotspot with AT&T.;  At this time only Verizon supports that feature.  (Maybe you want to pick the Verizon version if this is important to you).Now, I live in a metro area in one of the biggest cities in the USA, so, your 4g service may vary.  And they are charging a super premium price:  $10 per GB.  A full length movie on iTunes is 2GB or 3GB, so it can't replace my home connection, but its great for work and casual use.Back to the countdown:2) The \"resolutionary\" screen.  It is true that this screen is amazing and a pleasure to look at.  You can't see the pixels, and I love that.  I love that on my iPhone 4 too.  It will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent, so I don't think you need to got all excited and upgrade tomorrow.3) The faster processor.  I actually did not have a problem with my old iPad processor, but soon my old iPad will be like using a 2G iPhone.  But it will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent.  Once again, I don't think you need to upgrade tomorrow, but, a few months after release it should be a lock (I happen to know that many iPad developers wait until they can actually get their hands on a retail unit before upgrading their existing apps, although once they get the retail unit its like a race to finish).4) Dictation.  I have used this with success.  However, like most voice recognition software its usefulness is reduced by the fact that I'm seldom in a quiet place. Still, I like it.  I think its a valuable addition, and I typically use it when I only would have to type a few words.  I don't use it to type long letters, as its not completely accurate and I think editing out all the mistakes would take longer than typing it out.  (I do use an Apple brand bluetooth keyboard for serious typing: Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION] I have also tried a chicklet style one but it didn't work well for me: Kensington iPad 2 Case with Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad 2 3G Tablet, WIFI Model K39521US.5) The camera.  I don't think I'll use this much.  Mostly when taking pictures of things that I'm writing about, which isn't that often.  Maybe for some FaceTime.  But I don't think this makes it worth it to upgrade from the Original Ipad.  (the iPad 2 had a camera, so you can ignore this if you have an iPad 2)Other usage changes since iPad 1:1) I bought an HP envy (HP Envy 110 e-All-in-One Printer for the wireless printing from iPad and iPhone.  This has worked out VERY well.  I think the AirPrint implementation has worked nicely.2) One thing I was disappointed with the original iPad for was the inability to see what was on the iPad screen on a TV.  Since then I have purchased an Apple TV Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010) [OLD VERSION] which is now the old version.  And Apple has made it possible to see whatever is on the screen of the iPad on a bigger screen, and you can buy HDMI adapters now: Apple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A)3) On my first review I talked about the ability to put your iPhone sim card into your iPad and share your existing data service.  I tried this out, putting my iPhone microsim in the new iPad and I was invited to purchase a new data plan.  So apparently that little moneysaver has been eliminated.Other things that stay the same:You still won't be able to use Flash, a website programming language that allows websites to act more like computer programs.  I've read that the reason that Apple won't allow this is that Flash is often the gateway to getting viruses and other nasties.  As a result, there is no need to have antivirus software on your iPad, its very very safe.  The iPad is rock solid reliable.  In fact, the only virus I've heard of for the iPad is where someone had to send you a Pdf via email and get you to open it.  And of course, thats threat was removed before I even heard about it.On my last review, I talked about usage.  Apps I use a lot now:1) Logmein: to do anything on my computer that I can't do on an iPad.  This would include Flash based software.  I connect to a computer THROUGH my iPad, and control the computer to go to flash sites.  Ordinarily I would say this is not worth it, but the computer also runs engineering programs and other programs that don't really exist for the iPad.2) Gopayment to accept credit cards, although Quickbooks Online usage is hampered by the fact that Quickbooks makes you use a stripped down version through the safari web browser.  Once again, use LogMein Ignition.3) I find the spreadsheet program (numbers) to be highly annoying.  However, there was recently an announcement that MS Office programs Excel Word and Powerpoint will soon be available for the iPad with an interface similar to MS OneNote.  I'll be buying a copy of Excel and hoping that it doesn't suck.4) Find my Friends: I see where people are without having to call them and say \"where are you?\" which is nice.  Because I can see where my wife is without calling her, I get less honeydos.  Wipe that smirk off your face >:(  But also if you know they are driving you don't have to worry about distracted driving causing an accident.5) I don't end up playing many games on the iPad.  I play a lot of games on the iPhone.  But thats just my usage experience.  Maybe that will change with the new screen.You can read my original iPad review (linked above) for more usage ideas, if you are new to tablets.A bit more about usage, someone pointed out in a comment that you don't need the HDMI adapter if you intend to use AirPlay.  Airplay includes the ability to wirelessly stream audio and video from your iPad to a TV.  Typically this is only from apps that share music and movies, which is the functionality of Airplay (You PLAY things over the air).  There are Airplay adapters, including the AppleTV.  However, the HDMI connector does more than the Airplay allows: You can share the actual screen of your iPad, no matter what it shows, to a TV as a mirror image.  If you were to want to use the iPad as your primary \"computer\", you would probably want an HDMI adapter for big screen use.  I meet more people each month who do use a Tablet as their primary computer, so I felt this was an important point to clarify.  I own the AppleTV and the HDMI adapter, and use them in different ways at different times.Will this Ipad 2.5 make my original iPad as useless as a 4GB iPhone 2G?  For the first 6 months, no.  But after that, its likely.  Overall I am happy I bought it, mostly for the native 4G LTE internet.  Followed by the beautiful screen.  The faster processor is the 3rd reason, and as soon as the app developers start utilizing it to greater advantage, it will likely become the #1 reason.  And I think I'll feel that that has happened in about 6 months.After MS Excel comes out I may make an attempt to make the iPad my primary computing device, using the HDMI out and a bluetooth keyboard.  Wish me luck.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Verizon (and AT&T;)  iPad Buyer Beware", "Author": "RSaunders", "ReviewID": "R31QU3JV3F46BU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review by stating that the iPad is a remarkable product that is worthy of a five star rating. My one star valuation is specific to the new Verizon iPad which in my opinion contains a major flaw detrimental to all consumers unwary of Verizon's tactics.The Verizon iPad is equipped with a sim card that permits cell data usage by subscription. With my AT&T; iPad 2 I am able to subscribe and unsubscribe at-will one month at a time. This is the way a cell data subscription should work. The Verizon iPad does not permit this type of usage. If you cancel a monthly subscription for cell data with Verizon that cancellation permanently inactivates the Verizon sim card. The only remedy is to go to the Verizon store to obtain a new card. I have had to do that twice since I purchased the Verizon iPad and each time it is a major time consuming inconvenience and problem.My first stop at the Verizon store took an hour while the customer service representative insisted that I could not replace the sim card without signing up then and there for a monthly plan. After some argument and consultation with others he recanted but insisted that he could not install the sim card without obtaining from me full personal identifying information (telephone number, e-mail address, home address).The next time I needed a sim card the Verizon store representative insisted she had to charge $10 for the card. She didn't require any personal information and she didn't make any effort to link the sim card with my iPad. She simply insisted on $10 for the sim card and handed it to me.It seems as if Verizon is using the expense and inconvenience of forced sim card inactivation in order to discourage a la carte usage of cell data and to encourage people to pay $20 or $30 dollars a month whether or not they need data service.Had I know about this policy I would never have purchased the Verizon iPad.  The Apple Store saleswoman who sold me the iPad was not aware of this flaw and did not advise me that it was an issue. Surprisingly, none of the Apple Store sales persons I have spoken to since then were aware of this issue.Unless you enjoy spending time at the Verizon Store or unless you intend to use a cellular data plan without interruption, you should stay away from the Verizon iPad.Update on February 4, 2013: I just left my local AT&T; store after speaking with the AT&T; store manager about this issue. He confirmed that AT&T; has adopted the Verizon policy and their new iPads also discourage a la carte usage by requiring the customer to purchase a new sim card if the customer cancels a la carte cell data service. It is clear that both major companies want to discourage at-will cell data usage and promote the more lucrative monthly subscription. What a shame and what a rip-off.  They will probably continue to do this until the customers rebel and refuse to purchase the higher priced iPad and/or the monthly cell data service plan.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "All that sizzle and no steak", "Author": "YS Sheu \"ss\"", "ReviewID": "R1LAYFDEKV7AE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I own an Apple Mac Air, iPod touch, and work on a Mac Pro at school, and I have to say, the iPad is my least like Apple product.  iPad is essentially a bigger and more expensive version of iPod touch plus the optional cellular function, which you have to pay at least $20 each month for the service, so that you can use the navigation function (cheaper just to get a GPS with antiglare screen).  First, my biggest complaint is the lack of flash function.  It is true that I know about that limit before my purchase, but it is only when I started to use iPad, I realized how many things it couldn't do without flash, such as watching Amazon online stream movies.  It is really stupid that an iPad, which is targeted as a tablet, could not do flash.  Second, I thought it could at least play DVD if I have the right USB adapter, since I have an external DVD drive, but after searching online, I realized it could not do that either, because some format issues.  It really drives me nuts, because what is good about retina display if you can't watch movies, and I am not about to pay extra money for movies on iTune.  Then, it is the multi-tasking function, I really thought that was a joke. Originally, I thought multitasking means that you can open two apps and have them side-by-side on the screen, and I was dead wrong.  First, there is no side-by-side, and second, once you switch to another app, the previous app (such as safari) stops.  For example, if I am watching a dateline story streaming on CBS, I cannot have it play in the background and use other apps.  There are also small things like I can't use the Apple magic track pad with iPad (wireless keyboard works fine).  Overall, the new iPad sucks compares to other Apple device.  I feel for the price I paid, I am getting a mediocre device with multiple restrictions (mostly for business reasons such as no flash so that you have to stick with iTuen for movies) and no special talent other than the retina display.  Anyhow, I hope my love for iPad could increase a bit after Siri being available on new iPad in OS6.*UPDATE*:  another disappointment about new iPad - it takes ages to recharge.  I use the 10W USB power adapter and I closed the smart cover (sleep mode) when I was charging the new iPad.  I tested the battery at 3 different times, and it is roughly 10% increase per 35 minutes, which means it will take roughly 5 hours and 50 minutes to charge from 0% to 100% full, which is very close to PC world's report.  On another note, the techs at Apple store told me that apps and bluetooth draw a lot of power, so that I should close them if I want to save battery.*UPDATE 2*: on the postive side - I downloaded the GPS drive app and it actually works without data plan.  The catch is that you have to get the direction while you have internet access, and then it will take you to your destination without continuous 3G/4G or wireless connections.  However, you won't be able to get another direction to a new place unless you have internet, nor can you find the nearby restaurants, gas station, etc without internet connection.*UPDATE 3\"(8/2/12): Amazon Prime videos are now available on iPad!!  The video quality is pretty good, but I don't think it is HD quality.*UPDATE 4*(9/27/2012): I updated my iOS to version 6, and I like it so far!  Siri is now incorporated to my iPad 3, and I've been talking to her ever since.  Youtube app is gone from my iPad, Apple says their contract with YouTube is expired.  So for now, I have to use Safari to watch youtube.  Google maps is gone and replaced with Apple's new map system.  It does voice turn-by-turn direction, but I haven't really tested it out yet.  As for other newly released apps, for some strange reason, iPad 3 owners did not get to have passbook app.  I guess Apple figures that I won't be carrying my iPad around to the airports, concerts, or watching a movie, or going to a ballgame, which I do....*UPDATE 5*(10/28/2012): Apple just announced few days ago that they have a new iPad (for convenience, let's call it iPad 4) - by looking into the technical specs, I think the only two changes are: the chip (upgraded to A6 from A5), and the power adapter (from the 30-pin to lightening connector).  In the future, someone has to comment on whether the lightening power adapter is able to charge the iPad faster than the 30-pin adapter. Otherwise, I don't see any benefit of changing power adapter, as the the lightening charger won't work with previous versions of power docks.  People who are interested in buying the mini iPad should also know that the mini iPad does not have retina display (it is 163 ppi), and thus no HD.  On a separate note, I've been testing the Apple's new map system recently, and the results are so far so good! I think in some ways it is better than Motion X HD (a paid third party GPS app).  To summarize: First, the color system in Apple's map only has four to five colors, but that is not a issue to me, as it looks plain but clear.  Second, you can only get one voice: the voice of Siri, but it sounds great, so no complain.  Third, Apple's map gives much earlier warning compares to Motion X in terms of the next direction.  I had many experience that Motion X was late on telling me to take an exist or make a turn.  So kudos to Apple's map.  Overall, I don't know why there are so much criticism against Apple's map (most complaint is that the map system is not as mature as Google's).  I mean, it is possible that Apple's map won't work for you if you are going to somewhere remote, but you can always double check on Google's map using Safari.  I think if you mainly use Apple's map in places other than country side, then you should be fine!  After all, you don't need to pay extra (Motion X is $10/year) for voice navigation.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review Against Company: Ordered New, Was Shipped Used...Taking Forever to Exchange", "Author": "Rebecca Cheung", "ReviewID": "R3CYD67XCQPO73", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Originally when I opened the box, I was surprised to see a protective smart case, screen cover, and stylus pen included with the purchase. I opened the iPad box to discover...no protective plastic over the accessories and the screen, and a few hand prints over the iPad. I contacted WOW and it looks like they \"accidentally\" sent me a used one, when it's pretty blatant all over the order if you purchase a new or used one. Thankfully they provided a FedEx shipping label to return so I could exchange the used iPad for a new one. UNFORTUNATELY, despite them having my credit card information and charging it twice, they did not want to ship me the iPad first before me returning it (I use this for work so it's a hassle to get rid of and return it and wait again). So I dropped it off at the nearest FedEx only to become nervous again as they said they couldn't provide any receipt. It's been almost a week now since I've dropped off the package, with no tracking label or confirmation code and I've yet to hear form WOW what the status is of my new iPad.

I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie \"The Lorax and Acts of Valor\" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app \"Note\" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at \"AUTO\" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  \" GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY!

Then the Kindle 2 came out, and I upgraded to that.  I found that most of my reading was done laying in bed before going to sleep, and I was getting tired of having a little lamp clamped to the Kindle.  When the first iPad came out, I sneered at it.  I've done tablet PC's since their inception back in 2004, and had no plans on buying one.  But after playing with one at a local brick and mortar, I grabbed a 16GB version and brought it home.  30 Minutes later, I returned it for the 32GB version since I knew 16 would never be enough.  Gave the kindle to my mother.  Then when iPad 2 came out, I gave my 7 year old son the old one and got the new.  Now that the third gen is out, I gave my son my iPad2, my mom the iPad 1, and am enjoying the third generation immensely.The processor step each time was very noticeable - even for something simple like changing orientation in iBooks.  The convenience of checking mail while i'm reading, or doing quick searches on the web when I come across something I'm reading that I want to look into a little more, it's like having the options on my laptop but in an easy to use anywhere form factor.Since I can find wireless pretty much anywhere I go, there was no need for any version other than just the WiFi one.The screen is incredible.  The resolution if notably different, much like the iPhone 4 was when it was released.  It was the screen more than anything that made me get the iPhone 4 when it came out (was my first iPhone), and seeing it on the larger tablet format is just stunning.  And it's not just photos or movies that it looks good, since I don't do much of either on here, but everything else, even just the text while reading.  Everything is just crisper and much easier on the eye.Having spent the majority of my almost 45 years scoffing at Apple, and not buying anything they offered until almost 3 years ago, it's quite a change for me.  The app store makes it so easy to find things (almost too easy, like how it's so easy to spend money at Amazon).  Most items I can install on all my devices (3 iPads and 2 iPhones now) as long as they don't require in app purchases.The screen is easy to use, the touch component works great.  The only downside is the handwriting - even with apps designed for it and styli, it's not anything as good as the Microsoft tablet platform.  Which leaves the on screen keyboard for input, which works alright, but just not as easy or quick as a full screen keyboard for those of us who touch type.Fortunately I have a Macbook Pro so I can charge it from USB, but I also have several speaker docks, a few alarm clock docks, so there's plenty of options.  But it does not charge on my son's laptop or all in one dell touchscreen via USB.Weight is nice - but if you're used to a kindle, it's a shock, since the kindles are SO light.  But still not heavy enough to really be a problem usually.  The back is just brushed metal though so it's not very \"grippy\" (one of the things I liked the most from the original Kindle was the back, which helped it to be held without slipping).  I always have a snap on case of some sort that gives me a better handhold.I'm using the smart cover from my iPad 2 and it works fine on this new one.Sound is good for something with just the single speaker on it.  But sometimes your hand partially blocks it depending on how you're holding it.Sensitivity for game input (tilting, etc) is outstanding.Camera works great, better than the previous version, but it still will never replace a real digital camera.

There are very few improvements over the ipad 2. If you have never had an ipad, then go for the ipad 3. If you have an ipad 2 like I did, I would say stick with it and wait for the next year's ipad. Let me nonetheless talk about how I use this device.What do I use my iPad for -a) I stepped on my Kindle four months back and have been using my ipad for \"reading\" since. It is a much better experience because of the backlight, the smooth transitioning of fonts. It is so easy for me to send myself an ebook. I simply attach the .epub file to an email and send it to myself and it opens within seconds on iBook. On the other hand, if I have a .mobi file - I can simply open it using the Kindle app. If the Kindle app is installed on your ipad, when you click on the attached .mobi file in your email it simply opens it in Kindle.b) I sometimes like to watch mp4 files on my ipad. I do this when I'm lying on the bed leaning on a couple of cushions I can simply place the ipad on my stomach holding it with a hand and watch an episode of Game of Thrones. Bear in mind, it will not play any avi files or divx files and Apple iOS devices support only mp4. If you have a mac, I recommend a s/w called \"smartconverter\" which specifically converts avi files to mp4 for iPad 3.c) I'm using a Speck case so the fact that this little man heats up more than the predecessor hardly makes a difference. Does it heat up? yes, sometimes, it gets very annoying and does definitely heat up more than the ipad 2.d) Portable mp3. If you switch the screen on the ipad off and let it play music for you, it will keep playing at a sufficient volume for hours. I often go to sleep on my couch with the iPad singing away for hours. It can play audio for several hours without losing the battery.  I am disappointed in saying the audio is the exact same as it was on the ipad 2, so it not Louder than the ipad 2.e) Checking email, facebook, the web browsing still needs improvement because often times I have found Safari a bit lacking and buggy but trust me I am saying this from the point of view of someone who's been using the iPad for a year. If you have never used an iPad you will find it sufficient, I just find it annoying when I'm trying to use it on forums. The world wide web is still not very iPad friendly. Is it better to serve than any other tablet? Hell yes. But is it as good as using Firefox on my macbook air? Never. The keyboard is great.WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM THE IPAD 2 -a) A bit heavier but I got over that soon.b) The graphics are slightly better. The retina display is not that different. Brightness is the same.c) The 5 megapixel camera is very bad for indoor shooting. I havent traveled that much with my ipad so I can't say if the camera is all that good outdoors.d) This heats, that didnte) The battery is the same. I thought this will give me a much better battery because the battery is thicker, turns out, the battery is thicker to support the RETINA display.f) Faster graphical processor .. making it overall the fastest ipad.4G iPad - I feel all of this technology behind ipads supporting 4g is actually very misleading. In what you will really use your ipad for you will never need 4g. I urge you not to fall and become prey to ill effects of consumerism. I strongly advocate purchasing the wifi model. Even if you do get 4G and want to watch Netflix video, you get a limited data limit so why would you do that to your money?**Pulse application is good. Youtube looks the same but the newest OS has made it buggy and sometimes you have reload a video. Very amateur mistakes by Apple.I should have stuck with my ipad 2. This is really the iPad 2s. Facebook app is good. I wish Apple would charge us five bucks more and include one of those white headphones. Do buy a case if you're buying the new iPad because if you drop this it is more likely to crack the screen. Stay away from big cases, buy something practical, be a little careful and avoid those screen protectors. There is no excuse to making such a good looking device cheesy. Though it's a good reader, bear in mind, you will need to charge it daily. I turn it to aeroplane mood when Im reading but I'm not sure how much battery that saves.RETINA DISPLAY - If you put the ipad 2 and ipad 3 side by side you will notice the ipad 3 icons seems to be more clear and seem to take less space, seem more organized. It is a slight increase in the dots per inch. The hue on the buttons and icons for the ipad 2 is MISSING from the ipad 3. The new ipad does have a better display guaranteed. Here's a funny thing to consider. When I stopped looking at my ipad 2 and playing with it, I thought a month after using the ipad 3, the ipad 2 would look a little cheesy. The same way my ipod touch looked cheesy compared to the new ipod touch. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. The ipad 2 still holds its own. All said and done, gotta love the iPad.Do I use a case? Yes. Speck.

So, like anyone else who had ordered the new iPad on the same day Apple announced it, I snatched my package up and ran into my room, closed the blinds, slit the package open, and turned the slate on. And the rest is history.Actually, most of that is a lie. I waited in shifts with my fianc\u00e9 to sign off on our packages, and then let the iPad sit in its shipping box for a few hours while I tried to sort out a racial conflict in Mass Effect 3. Anyhow, I did eventually open it, and now that I've spent nearly half a week using my iPad to do a variety of different tasks, I feel comfortable writing a brief little review of the device, to follow up my review of the Acer Iconia A500 tablet that I reviewed late last year.The first thing a user will notice when picking up the iPad is that it looks identical to the iPad 2. However, this third iteration is also slightly heavier, has a wider camera lens on the back, and, apparently, has slightly more tapered edges. I don't know about that, but to be totally frank, I couldn't have told the physical form factor apart from the iPad 2 if you'd held them in front of me. And that's OK with me, to be frank. The iPad, like all high-quality tablets, has a simple and understated look that stays out of the user's way. Like previous iterations, the 3rd generation iPad comes in two flavors (black and white), with a variety of storage (16, 32, 64 gigs) and connection arrangements (Wi-Fi and LTE (4g)). Whether you care to pay for the extra space or connectivity is a matter of personal preference, I opted for just the 16 gig Wi-Fi only model. So my review is based on that.Once you turn your new toy on, you'll notice the retina display. It's impossible not to. The screen on the iPad has effectively 4 times the number of pixels as previous generations, despite remaining the same size. Text on the screen is as crisp as print, and colors are more vibrant and defined. If you've spent any time with a laptop, desktop, tablet or Smartphone, you'll be able to see the difference immediately. It's gorgeous, and as near to life-like as we're like to get (for a few more years, anyway...). A lot of people are saying the retina screen is worth upgrading for alone. I don't know if that's totally true, but it is certainly a good argument.Despite the massive increase in pixel density, the iPad doesn't slow down at all. It packs an enhanced A5X processor chip inside, which runs a quad-core processor (basically as fast as most laptops and computers now, if not faster), and since it runs a smaller screen without all of the hardware attachments, the extra speed is put into driving the display with fluid speed. It's a lot of fun to just flip the pages back and forth. The quad-core processor also enables more advanced graphics for games; expect to see a few envelope-pushers coming out soon, like Epic/Chair's Infinity Blade: Dungeons here soon. With a quad-core, we might even see some more console games debut on the iPad, like GTA III did last year, to major success. The speed of the machine, plus the mobility, and the glorious retina display make for a beautiful, fun gaming experience. While there are very few retina-ready games out, most still up-scale well and look quite purdy. I use my iPad primarily for web-surfing and gaming, and I'm very glad I waited for the retina display.Oh, yeah. Web surfing. There's something so much more appealing about surfing the web on a tablet as compared to doing it on a laptop or other dedicated computing device. The tactile scrolling, the literal pointing and clicking, the meandering finger-tracing through websites and wiki-safaris--it makes for a great experience that leaves the user loathe to return to their old machines (I've taken to calling my laptop the \"diesel rig\"). While RSS-readers are available through most major browsers, the iPad (and other mobile devices) make a show of formatting a user's plethora of feeds and headlines into magazine forms. With my Acer tab, I used Google Reader to do just that, but on the iPad, there is a better alternative: FlipBoard. Most of my news, I read through FlipBoard, and on the retina display, the text is just as crisp, smooth, and black as it would be on a high-quality magazine print. Except that I can poke an image and start a high-resolution video, or ride a hyperlink out in half a second to the host site. It's a lot of fun to flip through my FlipBoard and read disparate articles from the wild range of feeds I subscribe to. I can sit there all day reading and flipping, poking and reading. The retina-ready FlipBoard app is the epitome of mobile media consumption: beautiful, simple, yours. That experience is worth buying the iPad for, let alone the bevy of excellent games, software, and the retina-display.I want to comment on battery life real quick: It's the same as the last iPad. Excellent. Ten hours with heavy usage, but I've gotten a lot more than that out of it already. I ran the thing down once after watching about three and a half hours of video, playing about four hours of games, surfing for five or six hours, and letting it standby for about twenty over two nights. It's a far cry better than the competition, but, here's a bit of a catch: it takes forever to charge. And the battery gets warm while you use it. This might lead to a heating problem in some models, so beware of that, but as far as I know, there haven't been any major complaints about the heating.There have been some complaints about the camera(s), though I don't know why. The camera is gorgeous, a five-megapixel beauty on the back and a decent one megapixel on the front. The two-way deal allows for backwards and forwards video calls, like the Acer tab did, which is a nice touch, especially with Apple's Facetime videoconferencing software. At the bottom, I've included a few sample shots I took with my iPad camera. It's a nice piece of hardware. Not the best, but by all means perfectly acceptable for shooting anything a normal human would be pointing a camera at. If you're a camera dork, the lack of a flash LED might be a turn-off, but deal with it. Light a match or something.I'm going to wrap this up here: if you have the money, indulge yourself. When I was a kid, my father had a big, cream-colored PC with a monitor that weighed as much as I do. When I was in high school, schools and houses started to convert to flat-screen LCDs, and cell phones became common-place. Now I have a computer that is very probably more powerful, with a display twice as clear, and many times more vibrant than the one you're reading on. It's an incredible leap in technology, and a beautiful one, too.

The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 \"disappears\" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.

You'll never look at a laptop in the same way again. The quick power on and the built-in gestures makes it easy to move between apps, search, etc.+ Apple has always had great cameras in their phones and this one is no exection. The camera is great, and although a lot of reviewers make fun of it, or think it is superflous, they are wrong. The big screen makes it fun to take pictures or videos as I recently did at the National Air and Space Museum.+ The moveable & splittable on-screen keyboard makes it useable, but just for simple stuff, see below for more intensive writing.+ The size is perfect for me. i can see some wanting a 7\" screen but I enjoy the space.+ Battery life is excellent!- If I had my choice, I'd have it weigh a few ounces less. If you hold it for long periods, it can be tiring, just like a heavy book.- The screen is too reflective. If you're using it at an angle you often can see the ceiling lights reflected it in it.- The front facing camera has limited resolution, which is limited when making facetime calls to relatives that you haven't seen in a while. It's okay, but not up to the screen's quality.If you really want to write something long like a short story, long email, or leave your laptop at home, get Apple's Pages (similar to MS Word with spreadsheet and presentation versions available) app, and a bluetooth keyboard. Some people recommend iPad cases with a built-in keyboard but the two I have tried have been too bulky reducing the fun of using it. These all in one keyboards are too small causing the keys to be unreliable for typing. Instead get a light bluetooth keyboard that you can use while propped up in bed or on a desk. Apple's keyboard that I got my wife works well but its on/off is clugey and it's too big & heavy. A better alternative is Amazon's Basics bluetooth keyboard for the iPhone and iPad. It works well and is very light, which is great while traveling.I haven't found a case I am crazy about. The challenge is that the case needs to provide protection without interfering with its operation- holding it, taking photos, etc. Make sure you get one with an adjustable angle so that you can use it in bed or on a desk. The Apple flip is nice but I feel it doesn't provide enough protection.Take care.Update 12-09-06: I've gotten Apple's latest case- iPad Smart Case, which is almost perfect, providing good protection.

I was dubious that a 3.5\" screen would \"work\" but the emergence of mobile-optimized websites coupled with \"double tap to perfectly zoom to full column size\" feature made it workable for reading the NY TImes and practically everything else. I read several novels on this during my trips, even though the 3rd gen did NOT have the current high resolution Retina feature.When the \"Retina Display\" 4th generation iPod Touch came out in 2010, it was a revelation in terms of reduced eyestrain. With my contact lenses out, or with high diopter (2.75) reading glasses, I could read comfortably for hours, and the built-in illumination was wonderful, no need for a miners headlamp when going to bed, no screen glare.I wasn't sure about the iPad when it came out, and skipped the first generation. I personally even skipped the second generation (iPad2) but bought one for my wife. She has a specific, limited consumption need - she watches foreign language videos on YouTube and on a foreign language subscription website. For those two purposes, the iPad2 screen was superb, and like the iPhone and iPod Touches it has a wide viewing angle, IPS screen - compared to my laptops and netbooks, viewing angles were a breeze. With my laptops and netbooks, I couldn't shift my head up or down, I had to find the perfect \"tilt\" angle so the bottom and top of the screen were evenly bright and not washed out or black. With i-devices,  viewing angles are superb, colors are great - and this is true for all of them to date (with the latest \"new\" iPad being rated by one monitor-specific site as approaching professional quality for accuracy of colors and illumination levels). My wife could watch her iPad2 from almost any angle.But guess what? I was expecting to start to glom onto her iPad2 until it would be like a fight over the tv remote, but that never happened. I watched large video on my desktop, I read blogs and news and books on my iPod Touch! When I tried reading on the iPad2, I found the resolution was too low - it was like sliding back to a 3rd generation iPod Touch in terms of quality. Not easy on the eyes. Good compared to a netbook screen, but not as good as a Kindle e-reader (not the Fire) or as good as a 4th gen iPod Touch.When the \"new\" iPad came out, I knew it would be game-changing, with a ultra sharp \"type.\" Now that I've had it for several months, I believe it is. But is it essential?I have been switching back and forth between my \"new\" iPad and my wife's iPad2 over the past few months, and undoubtedly the new iPad is a MUCH more pleasant \"reading\" experience. THIS is the best e-reader on the market - do the math - it is in COLOR so highlight colors, chapter headings, book covers, illustrations, all POP, while the text is as easy to read as on an e-ink reader, PLUS illumination is BUILT-IN. THIS is the wave of e-readers of the future.Reading email and Facebook is easier too.All icons are sharper.VIDEO IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. Remember, the iPad2 could already display 720p. Bumping up to 1080p on the new iPad doesn't provide significantly better video. GAMING IS BETTER because the smarter game programmers are using the extra video horsepower for better action and shading NOT for higher resolution per se. The new video chip in the new iPad is simply head and shoulders better than in the prior iPad2 even if the actual processor is the same speed (the cpu vs. the gpu).So why do I find my self using my iPod Touch and desktop MUCH more than the new iPad or the iPad2?Simply, size. 10.1\" is a little heavy to hold. When I am reading a book where the book design is important, the new iPad is terrific. But that is rare. Most of my reading is \"just text\" and the 3.5\" screen of the iPod Touch is more than adequate for that - long ago I got used to frequent page flipping, it doesn't bother me anymore.So what is my shopping recommendation?If you aren't satisfied with your \"smartphone\" (it's too small, but that is in the process of changing, already in the Android market and soon in the iPhone world) you may well be happy with an iPad. If you are mainly watching video, the iPad2, still in production, has much better battery life (they just improved the battery life by moving to a smaller \"die size\" for the processor/gpu - check Anandtech for the details) and fine video. If you mainly read email, blogs, and browse the web, and ESPECIALLY if you plan on reading a lot of books, don't think twice, buy the new iPad.But be forewarned that rumors are flying that Apple is releasing a 7.85\" tablet soon, probably with the same resolution as the iPad2 (which means sharper letters since the screen is smaller), and that may be the \"sweet spot\" in terms of size that a lot of us have been waiting for. Also, rumors are flying that Apple intends to \"upsize\" the iPod Touch and also the iPhone to a 3.95\"/4.01' screen, which will make it easier to read while still being light and comfortable in the hand.Finally, Apple devices have done remarkably well at holding their value, and Amazon has an excellent re-purchase program for small electronics, and pays some of the industries highest prices for used i-devices. There probably isn't a more significant \"game changing\" electronic gizmo in the last decade than the iPhone and iPad. You won't go wrong or regret an iPad purchase, and except for slightly shorter battery life there is no _negative_ to purchasing the latest and greatest - the price didn't even go up this round (although the iPad2 in 16gb only was retained).16gb is enough for photos and books. 32gb or larger is recommended if you intend to load up a lot of games, download movies or a lot of music, or take a lot of videos.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good purchase", "Author": "Ah Pui", "ReviewID": "R3R2O5CP6OICN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as a first time tablet user, I am simply blown away by the new stunning ipad. The screen is simply gorgeous and the clarity and crispness of the text is literally like reading a paper in hand. Can't really describe it as you have to see it to believe it. I feel like I can touch the text itself instead of reading them through a screen. If you use ipad as a book reader, I highly recommend you to get it. The text quality do improve a whole lot. But I think regular gallery pictures and videos will look the same in your regular non-retina devices.I couldn't seem to find too many retina-ipad3 specific apps out there in the wild that I am interested in. I am not a big gamer so I will have to wait to see how other productivity apps will look in this stunning new screen. Flipboard and Pulse do look absolutely amazing and the browsing experience is even more elevated here.After lots of research, I believe the only sure smartcover for ipad that is guaranteed to work is the Apple Smartcover. So I purchased one with it and so far happy with my decision. I did get some minor scratches on the back already so I am rushing to get a Smartcover partner to protect the backcase. I am the kind of guy who aren't usually careful with gadgets but this ipad just have the magic draw to get pamper.Can't comment too much on the battery life, but it still hasn't drained out after days of playing. So it looks good! Wish there is a wireless wifi charger for this baby like the rumored Samsung S3 has. then it would be perfect! Since ipad does not have any usb ports, it comes along with a wall charger. But I didn't find it as a hindrance at all given its long battery life. My overall interaction with my new ipad is an absolute joy as everything is so easy to use and very intuitive. Kudos to Apple for making such a gorgeous, simple and clean, and absolutely intuitive product.Before settling on the new ipad, I have been debating whether to go for android tablet or not. I am a very happy android smartphone user so is not allergic to the android ecosystem. But the android tablet world is a different beast. Most of the android apps seem to tailor more to the smartphone so won't look as good on the tablet. Hard to find Android 4.0 Ice-cream sandwich even on the latest android tablets so the current bunch look dated. Granted there are a lot more hardware options to choose from and specs maybe more powerful, but none match the quality, ease of use and overall look and feel of ipad. The other factor that seal the deal for me is that the resale value of ipad is so overwhelming strong that I can safely buy it now and upgrade it later in the future, knowing that my current device will still fetch a pretty penny.For would be first-time tablet/ipad users, I highly recommend going for it. It is going to be a wonderful experience that you have to own it to believe it. Given the high resale value of the currently existing ipad2 and how the new ipad costs pretty much the same as before, upgrading it is not a bad idea at all. For those people on the fence about getting an ipad or android tablets either existing, or the upcoming Samsung Note or tab tablet, or even the highly anticipated Asus transformer infinity, you own it to yourself to give the new ipad a try.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "3 Generations in and Still No Equal", "Author": "Vincent E.

The tablet has become and extension of my arm!My Apple iPad.  What started out as a nice to have toy, has become the virtually indispensable tool for making sense of my increasingly hectic life.  There isn't a day that goes by when I am not on the device; from checking my e-mail, to sending and receiving text messages; from checking my calendar to playing games with friends and family; from posting to Facebook or Twitter to listening to NPR's morning edition; reading the latest news from the AP, New York Times, Politico, NPR, or The Daily, to listening to music on-line or stored on my hard drive; from logging into my business network via VPN, to talking to me daughter via FaceTime, almost everything I need to get done on my laptop I can now do on my iPad.Now Apple has released the iPad 3 and those of us who use the iPad 2 are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  I was satisfied with the iPad 2, but never wanting to be behind the technology curve I decided to order the newest offering from Apple in the exact same configuration as the last; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi+4G\" version.The iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G FactsOn the surface the iPad 3 is not demonstratively different from the iPad 2.  Featuring an Apple designed Dual-core A5X, low power, high performance processor, the 1.44 pound (1.46 pounds for the Wi-Fi + 4G) iPad 3 is a tad thinner than the iPad 2, though the screen size stays the same.  Other than that, there are no physical changes to the tablet.  Under the skin however, Apple has included a Retina display that offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch.  The other notable change concerns the front and rear facing cameras, which now offer 5MP autofocus resolution and HD video recording.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 4G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.37\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The iPad 3 (available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 4G LTE: UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+/DC -HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 3 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (1080p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.Re-syncing with iTunes or iCloudThe iPad 3 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 3 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 2 showed up on my iPad 3, since the last time I \"physically\" backed up the tablet via iTunes, right before I started using iCloud to perform back-ups.So I finished the restore via iCloud which took close to three hours to complete.  No big deal; I plugged the tablet into A/C, started the restore and went to bed. I did restore all of my music (15GB) via iTunes however, and that took considerably longer than 3 hours to accomplish; again another overnight chore.  I suppose if I purchase more iCloud storage I could back up everything including my music, but I see no need to pay for additional storage; 10GB would set me back $20.00 a year; 20GB = $40.00/year, and; 50GB = $100.00/year.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account; I also have my iPhone 4S and iPod 3rd Generation synced.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"VPN AccessThe iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G VPN can be togged on and off at will.Personal HotspotNew to the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is the Personal Hotspot, which allows you to share the tablets' cellular data connection in order to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  Nice!!!First ImpressionsLike the iPad's that have come before it, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, play a game, post to social networks, log into my business network and access my workstation, read e-mail, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business as well as personal e-mail.Today while typing out this review on my iMac, I fired up my iPad 3 and I played Hanging with Friends with an old friend in Maryland, held a text conversation with a friend visiting Vegas and another in downstate Illinois, read e-mails from 3 separate accounts, posted to Facebook & Twitter, while listening to music via Pandora! Last night while grilling BBQ chicken on the patio I streamed music from my iPad to a portable Bose speaker via Bluetooth!Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I started using the iPad I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 4G and, instance access.Heat & NoiseThere has been much to do about the heat the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G gives off, and while I have noted that the tablet gets a little warmer than its predecessor, the degree of change is in no way uncomfortable.  So, I have to ask what all the fuss is about!?ConclusionsI like the iPad; it is the must have device of the decade, period for anyone who wants to stay connected!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99), or an increasing number of similar applications.  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office, though again via Apps that is changing.  For instance I purchased an App last week that allows me to access our Microsoft SharePoint 2007 environment and manipulate documents contained in Lists and Document Libraries.  This is a big deal as more and more business content is shared and or stored on SharePoint in a number of businesses.  The availability of VPN on the iPad makes this possible.There are also a number of very good RDP applications available in the App Store that will allow me to log into my workstation at the office and manipulate date via VPN. As the number of Apps that mimic , and or reproduce the business environment increase so too with the iPad's usefulness as a business tool!Hands down, the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! The new Retina display has made considerable difference in the reading of text on the tablet.  Whereas before my eyes would start to hurt after just 15 minutes of book reading on the older iPads, not I can read continually without discomfort, the text acuity has improved that much!Yes, the entrance fee ($829.00 for iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great display for text and graphics", "Author": "Stan Gibilisco", "ReviewID": "R2EXRAYX55HXHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this device mainly because of its high-resolution display (2048 x 1536 pixels). To me, clear text and graphics matter more than anything else. I need a device that can do simple Web browsing on Wi-Fi, but I don't need the high-powered features such as 4G LTE or great video (yet). The display lives up to my best expectations. I've never seen anything else like it. It's as clear as the finest printed book pages ever were.I'm conducting experiments in \"dynamic book publishing\" right now, and I want readers to see the text and simple graphics (grayscale technical drawings) clearly. This device is perfect for that application, although at times I feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini at 20 miles an hour because I have not come close to utilizing all the capabilities of the device. The new iPad can play movies just like a TV set, and I'm looking at plain text and line drawings. But oh, what crisp letters and numbers and equations and pictures they are!I've read some complaints in the blogosphere about poor Wi-Fi sensitivity and slow, hot battery charging in the new iPad. I have a Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire, and the new iPad works better on Wi-Fi than either of those devices. I took the iPad to several local establishments and tested it on Wi-Fi, and never got any result other than all three bars lit (strong signal). The new iPad also has better range with my router than an old laptop computer with a PC card wireless modem has. It does take awhile to change the battery, about 6 hours from minimum to a full charge, but I expected this result because the new iPad's battery has greater capacity than the one in previous versions. (It takes longer to fill up a big \"electricity tank\" than it takes to fill a smaller one at the same power level.) I didn't notice excessive heat during the charging process, as some people have complained about.I've heard one limitation that I take quite seriously: Don't drop this thing from shoulder height and expect it to work afterwards. The display will likely shatter.For my purposes, an iPad 2 would have done well enough. But I wanted something that would do better than well enough, and this thing does. It's my first Apple since I had an old \"II Plus\" back in 1982. With this new toy in hand, I'm getting tempted to buy an iMac so I can produce iBooks on it, and in general enjoy Apple's world!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet still, but not better enough than the iPad 2", "Author": "William B. Partridge", "ReviewID": "RUAHDQH0PLB6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, the best tablet on the market. It's what's all other tablets aspire to be, hands down. The problem is that while it's better than the iPad 2, the difference might not be enough.So what's different?  The screen is now 4 times the resolution.  It's the best screen on a tablet, by miles. If you were to display a picture of icecream on the screen you'd be tempted to even lick it. RAM is also now doubled which leads, most notably so far, to less reloading of pages when you use multiple tabs in browsing.  The graphics processor is also better, while the main processor it self remains at the same speeds.  The differences in this, so far, aren't perceivable.  The back camera is also improved but I'm not really sure who's taking pictures with their iPad.  If you go with the LTE option, well that's going to clean the floor with the 3G versions, but that's up to you. On the downside the tablet is now also a little heavier (it is noticeable, but you'll forget about it) and runs warmer with long use (this is also noticeable and you won't be able to ignore it unless you're using a case).  Also Apple changed the polarity of the sleep/wake magnets so now nearly all 3rd party cases that you have from the iPad 2 won't work that way.What's not different? iOS. All the pros and cons are still there. The front camera is also still VGA. While the graphics processor got a nice bump the CPU itself is still the same dual-core.I'm really disappointed Apple didn't improve the front camera.  A VGA camera on a screen this good is just a joke.  The rear camera, a camera I used maybe a dozen times in my ownership of my iPad 2 gets a massive upgrade but the camera I've used for hours of video chat is left where it was (even a year ago the VGA camera was terrible).  I can only assume it was left off to provide some feature for the next iPad.  What this product ultimately highlights now are the shortcomings with iOS. Aside from putting a better front camera in the device and addressing some of the backwards steps with the iPad 3 (temp, weight) there's really nothing else Apple can do with this device.  The main hold over from the iPad 2 was the screen and that's been solved now.  Apple needs to, and appears to be doing (but slowly), work on the OS itself.  It's somewhat troubling that by and large iOS 5.1 looks and operates the same as iOS3 and 4.  The most notable of improvements has been the addition of the multitouch gestures and the addition of the notification system.  All nice additions but they don't really represent 2 years worth of changes.In comparison to the iPad 2 this is a nice upgrade, but ultimately it's not enough.  I'm not sure anything could have been enough to be honest though, but the fact that it runs hotter and is heavier don't help it in comparison.  While the screen is appreciable, the screen on the iPad 2 is still amazing in it's own right. If anything it's not a comment on poor quality of the new iPad but rather just that the iPad 2 was already so good.  The new iPad is a worthwhile upgrade from the original iPad or great for a first time buyer.Pros:++Screen++Extra RAM+iPhone and iPod touch based games now use their retina display apps for upscaling on the iPad (this is a REALLY nice improvement when you do use it).Cons:--Front facing camera is still the same-no new OS version = same old same old (e.g. no Siri)In addition, I'd like to compare this to Android tablets in general as I own both.  Android itself represents a better operating system.  Notifications are better, multitasking is better, and just the general usability of the device is better - especially with regard to the home screen.  What Android tablets fail to deliver, however, is the smoothness and richness that iOS offers.  Scrolling on a webpage in iOS versus in Android is just effortless.  It really shows off the imperfections of Android in general, much like how Android shows off the short comings of iOS.  The other issue is app selection.  Android doesn't have the heavy media hitters.  No Hulu Plus, no Xfinity, no HBO Go, no EA games, and just a general lack of quality applications (Android 2.2/2.3 based tablets and the Kindle Fire are exceptions but I'm focused on iOS 5 versus Honeycomb or ICS).  While the Google apps are hands down better on the Android side, they don't make up for the lack of entertainment on the iPad.  Also to note, a lot of the Android apps really don't feel like they take any advantage of the screen size difference, many of the apps feel just like scaled up phone applications where as iPad apps seem to have more thought put in to them for the extra size.While Android often times offers better and more features in it's core implementation, none of that matters when there's so little in comparison to do.  And nearly none of the things they both do are done as well on Android or as smoothly.  Yes, I miss widgets, GTalk integration, and a variety of other things when I use my iPad, but I ultimately use it a lot more because there's more to do.  If you own an Android phone (I do) there's not much really the tablet can do that my phone can't do already, so ultimately it just feels pointless.And I think that's a good point to consider.  Unless you hate Apple/iTunes, if you own an Android phone you'd probably be better off with an iPad to complement the phone.  Likewise might hold true for people who own an iPhone, an Android tablet might be better than the iPad.In the end, if you're looking for a tablet, get the new iPad.  Android may do more things on the front, but there's just less to do on it in most cases.  If you already own an original iPad or an Android tablet - this is worth the upgrade.  However, if you own an iPad 2, unless you really need LTE (and you won't tether your phone) this is a pass.  I made the change to get more storage space primarily (32GB wasn't cutting it anymore) but if not for that I'd have kept the iPad 2 instead.

By it's overwhelming usability. I'm so impressed by the versatility of the New iPad 4G Verizon LTE. I thought I would only use it to consume media. It does that and much more. In the first few days of ownership, I've used it as a portal into the world. I find it more comfortable than a PC to read Wikipedia, see amazing photos, and watch instructional videos. The display is the first mobile device to use XHD resolution -- much higher resolution and better fidelity than today's desktop monitors. When I travel, I no longer have to pack a wireless router, GPS (via cellular radio), Kindle, iPod, extra rechargers or cables. The iPad becomes a big battery WiFi hotspot via its cellular modem. I've loaded Windows 8 Consumer Preview on several notebooks. With the use of SplashTop server and iPad app called \"Win8 Metro Testbed\", I'm able to use the iPad as a Windows 8 tablet. Works well. This one device has both simplified and amplified my life. The device's primary negative is some screen glare and complete washout in bright sunlight. eInk is much superior in that environment.Update 17-Apr-2012: In Paris, both my New iPad and iPhone are working with Free.fr SIM cards. Free.fr's SIM is 20 Euros per month, prepaid, and includes 3GB data usage. If the device has a phone (iPhone) it includes unlimited voice and SMS. The iPhone needs no special settings. iPhone and iPad both work with Personal Hotspots feature on free.fr. For data use, the iPad requires an APN setting of \"free\" in Cellular Data settings, and again in Personal Hotspot if that feature is desired. Free.fr uses the Orange.fr 3G network -- France's largest. Using Speedtest.net, I usually get > 1Mbps download speeds and as high as 10Mbps sometimes. Data usage requires 3G which is ubiquitous in Paris but voice works fine on 2G (usually found in Metros).", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally worth upgrading from iPad 1st generation or if you have never had an iPad before!", "Author": "C.

I decided to sync the IPad with my ITunes library and that filled up 16.5gigs, but the photos and movies look great on the IPad, and make them easier to share with friends and family, the music, not so much. Anyway, with the extra hard drive space I wont have to worry about running out of space, at least for the next year or two. I'm sure to replace this IPad with a later model by then and hopefully it will have a port for an SD card. I ordered through Amazon for 2nd day delivery, and it got here on time and undamaged. One thing that I liked about my Ipod touch was the weather app, on the IPad the weather app is not included, but if you buy the WeatherBug Elite app, you not only get detailed weather, current and forcast with dangerous weather alerts, but you also can watch the national weather forcast on the WeatherBug.com website!

I travel a lot so I'll be using mostly for watching movies while traveling on a plane & surfing the web on the ground.First - the 4:3 display format is lousy for watching videos - with a 16:9 movie you lose 1/3 of your screen and a 2.35:1 movie you lose 1/2 of your screen to the black bars (doesn't make a difference how good your display is, if half is black). The 4:3 display format is a huge disadvantage compared to the Andoid tablets. My wife has an iPad 2 and for watching movies/videos I don't notice a quality difference between the two iPad's. So if you mostly watch movies save your money and don't bother with this tablet.Second - the lack of a microSD slot is inexcusable. The only way to interface with this device is with a computer & iTunes (it's Apples way or it's the wrong way - I guess they think their customers is too stupid to use this device without iTunes). So if you're like me and travel a lot you have to carry your laptop loaded with iTunes so you can add your media - very frustrating. Yes, I know you can buy a camera connection kit (another $30) and if you set it up correctly (8 character file names in a folder named DCIM) you can transfer your movies and photos (no music or anything else). But the SD Card must be FAT32 formatted which means a 4 gb file size limit - no good if you have lots of HD videos. With an android table, just take an extra microSD card (FAT32 or NTFS) loaded with your content and you're ready to go - no need for a laptop - couldn't be any easier.The new display is much better for surfing the web or reading (reason for giving it 2 stars), but others will follow.I'll be buying the Asus Infinity when ever (if ever) it gets release and then sell my iPad.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "really bad!", "Author": "Shekel D.", "ReviewID": "R7IX104S1LCYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dude....the ipad has so many little scratches on the back....the name and address is engraved on it...and the crack runs along across the edge of the screen not only on the white part.....this purchase was horrible....it was not worth my monay at a;ll.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my iPad 3 - great addition to a solo law practice", "Author": "Steven L.

This review is not so much about the technical abilities of the iPad (which are well covered elsewhere), but more about the difficult-to-define allure of the product.People I know who also own an iPad, or who are considering buying one, often seem to spend some time coming up with justifications for the purchase: it'll help with their work, it will be great to watch movies on the train, it will keep the kids amused. After all, no-one *needs* an iPad; we can all get along quite adequately without one and at the back of our minds we are well aware of this. The iPad is expensive and for most of us it's a lot of money to fork out on what is essentially a luxury item. Deciding what you want to get out of the iPad, and whether there's a cheaper alternative available might be questions worth considering before committing.Having thought through the sensible stuff though, I, like many others was seduced, and parted quite happily with \u00a3500 odd in the expectation of...what exactly? You often see the words \"Apple\" and \"magic\" in the same sentence, and this ability to produce products which go beyond one's expectations are at the core of the company's success. Having bought an iMac a year or so ago, I was confident that I would again have my investment in an Apple product repaid several times over in the sheer enjoyment which goes with an amazement at the uncanny perfection of the product's capabilities.So, there I was in the Apple store, seated at a table, an attendant at the quasi-mystical ceremony at which my own iPad was removed from its packaging and prepared for set up. As this was the first day on sale, various people gathered to watch in awe. I was required to do the unboxing and unveiling, instructed in every move by the assistant. After removing the protective sleeve it was time to flick the button and bring life to the screen. A hush descended. As smooth as silk, the interface appeared in all its cool beauty. This truly was a work of art.Six months on and it's almost always in constant use, whether by me or another member of the family. Interestingly, different aspects seem to appeal to different people.For me it's the mail which is probably the singularly most useful feature. I have my work email as well as private email accounts all in the mail application. The messages are clearly laid out, and writing and responding I find is easy enough on the keyboard, though I know a lot of people don't find it so; it takes a while to adapt your hand shape to the keyboard, but the predictive text ensures that even if you hit the wrong key the word will probably still appear as you intended. Somehow Apple have made even such a mundane program as mail glamorous, and Excel, Word and pdf documents look spectacularly clear and professional on the retina display.Kids love the apps, particularly the gaming ones of course, and there's always a new one coming along in this seemingly inexhaustible supply of the new and extraordinary.Photos look a million dollars on the new screen and iPhoto ensures that albums can be easily organised. The iPad cleverly syncs with your PC so not just photos, but music moves seamlessly between the two.iTunes, YouTube and the BBC app mean you could be entertained for hours, if you should so choose. Whatever you watch you'll be treated to pin-sharp definition. The sound is fine on the basic headphones.All these things, in my opinion, make this a luxury worth having. However, the iPad is somehow more than the sum of its parts, and the robustness of its manufacture (I can attest to this as it's been dropped from a height on more than one occasion) together with the absolute lack of any indication whatsoever that there are actually processors whirring and chips buzzing below that crystalline surface, instil a confidence that this is somehow more than just a mass-market device.

NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps.

(I have no complaints about either iPad - they're very useful devices and deserve 5 stars.)  Because I had talked with Verizon customer service before purchase, I knew I wanted the prepaid option and ability to suspend auto-payments.The rep's advice was to open a separate email account for the iPad (I used a free gmail address).  I was told there have been problems with AOL accounts in particular.  I was also warned NOT to delete the account or phone number when I wanted to stop auto-pay because that would necessitate a replacement of the SIM card.  He said I could uncheck the auto-pay option in the cell account settings on the iPad.  With that information, I found registration was painless and fast.I used the iPad on a long west coast car trip, accessing the Internet in the car for 3-4 hours a day.  As always, Verizon's coverage was good and fast.  I found that 2-gigs of data were enough for web surfing, checking email and GPS work.  I let the plan auto-renew so I'd have enough data for the last few days of the three-week trip.When I returned home, I wanted to suspend the auto-pay so I went searching for the 'turn-off' option on the iPad.  No luck.  I called Verizon and the rep quickly deleted the auto-pay feature from my account.  She also told me about that option on the iPad but when she looked for it on the iPad 3, couldn't find it either.I plan to use the Verizon access intermittently over the next year, so here's what she told me to do to make sure I wasn't receiving unauthorized charges:  Call Verizon to stop auto-pay (800-786-8419), then re-enter credit card information and choose a plan when I want to restart.  She said there was no problem in calling them for cancellation as many times as I wanted.Seems clunky to me and I don't understand why I can't manage the account from the iPad, but at least Verizon is responsive and helpful.  If I was a bit more of a skeptic, I'd theorize that Verizon makes the deactivation a bit murky in the hopes that users will let the plan roll over rather than call.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love My iPad!", "Author": "TechGuy", "ReviewID": "R3416ZM2UUAZMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my first generation iPad so I could take advantage of all that the New iPad has to offer.

My anticipation was excited by the many articles I've read claiming that the new display is everything from your first experience seeing HDTV to a blind man getting sight.Since I had shelled out the cash for the new one and promised a family pass down for the old I was out of pocket about $1200.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I turned it on and saw nothing dramatically different from the IPAD 2.  OK let's get them both out and compare side by side.  More disappointment as there seems to be almost no difference in the visuals.  My first taught was they shipped me an IPAD 2 by mistake.  Weight, thickness, larger camera and a serial number check proved it was definitely a 3rd generation tablet.I have now had it for more than 24 hrs and can positively report I have gone from totally disappointed to thoroughly impressed.Why:Visuals from a distance of about 3 ft. when I made my comparison looked about the same but when you put It on your lap to view it at a more normal distance the display starts to pop and everything from text to pictures to movies look phenomenal.The camera is finally capable of taking excellent photographs and the HD video is with anti shake is very high quality.  Bringing photos up in IPhoto makes them look more like a printed glossy and very 3D like.Internet sites load very quickly and seem more crisp especially when you blow the size up or view a video full screen.  Download speeds tested out about 50% higher than the 2 and so did the links.My favorite racing game \"Real Racing HD\" issued an update to run on the new iPad screen and so I tried it out.  WOW first off the cars in the garage now have a life like appearance.  The game itself played very smooth at very fast speeds and the visuals were outstanding.  Even games that have not been updated yet played and looked much better.I read a lot and it was important to me that the books and online articles would provide a better experience and less eye stain than the iPad 2.  Too early to tell about the eye strain but the text on iBooks was noticeably better and pages turned smoothly.  The kindle app text was also better but pages were jerky and did not turn properly. Checked out flip boards new updated app and again the articles were all eye catching and pictures were outstanding to look at.So now I've gone from very disappointed to thoroughly impressed and glad to hand over my iPad 2.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "More expensive than Apple Hmmm", "Author": "M.

That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "R2ZHC4O6M76E31", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my new ipad through apple.com.

But, this isn't that dissimilar from Google, or any other service you use that tries to integrate all the aspects of your life and/or workflow.  Do I wish that all this data could be stored in such a way where the only person that has access to it is me?  Absolutely.  Do I understand the reality that I'm not going to get this kind of integration unless I give up my privacy and/or anonymity?  Yep.  Would I also be for any other alternative that comes up that can protect my privacy and rights more than it can when using iPad, Google, etc.?  Certainly.The reason I got an iPad is essentially because I knew it would \"just work\".  While I can't say that this has been completely true, it has been mostly true.  As a knowledgeable tech guy, I've been wowed again and again by what this device can do, with relatively little effort on my part.Gripes:- There is no Adobe Flash.  I don't give two flying fish about your business politics;  I want Flash, because so much of the web depends on it.  You can take your stinky business model and send it down a dark alley.- No streaming Amazon video. (EDIT:  Amazon released their iPad app on 2012-08-02, so this is no longer a gripe)I'm able to find apps (and am willing to pay some amount for good ones) that do what I want them to, and do it well.  SSH, RDP, VNC, SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and other acronyms.  That makes the iPad very useful to me, and I can subdue the rage that brews inside about these other things.  I think that it's possible that the iPad could be just as useful to me (if not more) and *not* do (at least some of the evil things) that it does.Steve Jobs was a visionary, and so was Bill Gates.  They both ripped off their ideas from other companies, and proceeded to market them better.  That's kind of the idea behind open source...  except with open source you give credit where credit is due.  So, I'd like to thank Xerox and IBM for the iPad that I've purchased.  It's really slick, but please back off on the evil.  Thanks!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's just a shame!

Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in \"Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem\" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good media device for entertainment", "Author": "prash_142", "ReviewID": "R34K858YVJVGXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I generally dont buy Apple products becuase they are expensive.

I was definitely going to order one of those. I had ABSOLUTELY no intention of even considering an iPad. I have always had Android in my phones and wasn't about to change now.As I played with these two tablets, I noticed the pros/cons as stated by reviewers. My complaint with the Galaxy was the bit of lag, especially in the browser... but it was doable. The Prime just flat out disappointed me with it's non-bright display. I thought that someone put the display settings down but it was on high. I tried another one thinking that maybe this was defective and I got the same dark(er) screen. Also had the same lag time. Was also scared about the wi-fi issues I had heard about. And wi-fi is the main reason I am purchasing a tablet.For the hell of it I looked at the iPad 3 since it was right next to these. I immediately saw a huge difference in resolution. The more I studied it the more I was blown away. I went back and forth comparing the text resolution to the other two and there is NO comparison. The text on the iPad 3 is just crystal clear and as sharp as can be. You can even see the difference between the iPad3 & iPad2. While looking at small text I had to zoom in a little to read it with the Androids but with the Ipad 3 I could leave it at it's smallest text and read it easily.Also there was NO lag at all in the browser. It flowed smoothly with no hiccups or lags. After seeing this I went back to the Galaxy and now I can realllly notice the lag. Scrolling through web pages it was choppy and hesitant (in comparison).When pinching the pages, it would jump a bit and go down a few lines. With the IPad 3, no jumping at all. Pinching was extremely smooth and perfect. I have been converted!!Yes, I would love to have the Android personilization, but better graphics and smoothness are more important to me. The other tablets just can't compare in this department. I am a convert.Note - Give careful consideration as to the storage size you need. I was going to get the 16GB model and although I do not do many games, I was concerned about running out of space. If the iPad allowed you to use an SD card, then the 16GB would have been my choice; but I stepped up to the 32GB model to play it safe. Currently I have only a few games and about 4 apps. I have NO photos or music on here yet and already I have taken up almost 4GB of space. Obviously pre-installed material contributed to this but I would recommend that you consider the size carefully. If you will be saving movies, music and large photos, it may be wised to consider the 32gb model.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pictures Are Sharper.

Other people have provided more extensive reviews, but I wanted to give my two cents on the new Retina Display.Photos definitely look more crisp on the new iPad.  In particular, areas of photos that include fine detail are noticeably cleaner and sharper.  As Apple advertises, if you look closely at, say, someone with a white shirt in a photo on the iPad 2 you can actually see the display pixels, which obviously limits the sharpness of the photo.  If you look at the same white shirt on the new iPad you cannot see the pixels; you just see a smooth area of pure white shirt.I think the difference between the new iPad and the iPad 2 is most dramatic when you view print, whether in a browser article or in an electronic book.  On the new iPad the boundary between fonts and the white page background is much, much cleaner and sharper.

However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about.

I ended up selling all that other stuff to pay for the $499 iPad that I bought at Best Buy. I'm typically an Android guy as I own the Droid Bionic and have only used Android phones since the original Droid. The only experience I had with iOS was with a second generation iPod touch I bought 3 to 4 years back that I enjoyed.My experience with the new iPad has been very positive. The battery life is fantastic, the screen is so enjoyable to read news articles and watch TV shows through Netflix and other streaming software. I've had two tablets before the iPad (Galaxy Tab and HP Touchpad) and iPad is the only device I've actually wanted to watch HD shows on. In almost all cases, anything I watched on my iPad seemed just as sharp and colorful as my HDTV and much sharper than my laptop screen. Top it off the device is quiet with no mechanical fans running in the background so your watching experience is really luxury stuff. I would note the external speaker is nothing special and that any type of TV or movie watching should be accompanied by a nice set of comfy headphones.iOS in many ways doesn't seem all that different at the core from when I had my 2nd gen iPod touch. It seems Apple has taken a more evolutionary approach to iOS while Google has tried to take giant leaps in user interface design. (Ice Cream Sandwich). In many ways however this has boded well for Apple. the A5X processor (pretty much the same as an A5 just optimized for  retina) tears through the menus with elegance and smoothness unlike anything in the market. That type of smoothness in transitions creates an experience where you stop caring about the clockspeeds and dual cores and ram and just concentrate on what you're doing which eases my techy brain into a calm state.I wanted to also note that the heating \"problem\" people seem to have doesnt' bother me. I rarely heats up and when it does it's just a tad warm nothing more. I recently put it in leather-ish case for protection reasons that seems to have reduced the heat on my hands as well. The battery charge time isn't a big deal to me because I charge my devices overnight and the slight change in heft is laughable as my last tablet (HP Touchpad) was a blimp in comparison.Ultimately to sum it up, the screen has made this device superior in many ways to almost every device I have in my apartment. It's THE screen to use when watching video and reading and it's super sharp and clear. The software support on iOS is the best of the best and the slick transitions make this a great device for almost anybody wants a great computing device when in bed, on the couch or on the go.

The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, Great, Wonderful !

I have been the proud parent of many tablets prior (Asus TF 300, Galaxy Tablets, etc) and nothing compares to the silkness of the ipad 3's OS, processor, and retina display. My Asus TF internal chip overheated and my galaxy tablets constantly froze, which frustrated me...As an average consumer who always looks for the most efficient way (money and quality wise) to purchase products, I did tons of research concerning the comparison of the ipad 3 and 4. I realized that shortly after the release of the ipad 4, the ipad 3 was discontinued from being produced and not even sold or offered in stores while the ipad 2 still was. This led me to assume that apple discontinued the ipad 3 in order to make more money selling the ipad 4, since people would just buy the ipad 3 instead since the ipad 4 would be priced a 100-150 more, just for a half-second speed boost over the ipad 3, while they both held the retina screen.So overall, i highly recommend the ipad 3 to the 4, as you can even buy a used ipad 3 for 250. if you want a half-second boost in speed and bragging rights to say \"i have the newest ipad\", go ahead with the 4.

Mauricio", "ReviewID": "R1K16TE210781L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider the iPad 3 to be that one iOS device that hit everything correctly. First off, the display, this thing is freaking gorgeous. It looks like you are looking at magazine print with its retina display. Reading on the thing is a joy you'll not see a single blocky pixel on the device. The third iPad generation also is the last device to be released using the now extinct 30 pin connection plug. Now why is this important, I have a youtube channel ([...] and a lot of the content on my channel is devoted to two iOS games, jubeat plus and Reflec Beat plus. I do line-in recordings for these two games and let me tell you, the iPad 3 can mirror images with very little lag. It is the superior 30 pin connection that allows this with the AV HDMI adapter that is sold separately. The 30 pin connection requires no further processing on the adapter so the image comes out crisp, colorful, and ultra responsive. The new lightning dock connection iPads (even with the more powerful iPad 4) require the AV adapter to further process the video signal leaving you with much lag and poor picture quality. In the end, the iPad 3 is a great device especially for those who are in the business of recording line in images of their iPad. If you like to game on and share what you play professionally with line-in recordings, I can't emphasize it enough that the iPad 3 is the best device for you. The newer devices can do that but lag thanks to their lightning connection docks. The iPad 3 can do everything that the mini and 4 at this point.

Amazon documented this and assured me they would make good on the full warranty. i find all this to be very disturbing as it is obvious that no one wants to come clean about the history of this product. companies just pass the buck. especially disappointing to me was Apples response to me.

The battery life was over-promised from the beginning and only got worse over time.

I've loved the simplicity, feel and genuine intuitiveness of their products, ever since I got my very first \"Mac\"top and iPod.  When the hoopla of the iPad (1st generation) came out a couple years ago, I wasn't necessarily impressed; in fact, I was more confused that people would lay so much money down for what I considered (and so many did too, at first) to be a large iPhone, minus the cell phone function.  However, I I L-O-V-E my iPhone and couldn't imagine having a Blackberry again.  Upon my usage of the new iPad through a significant other, I was able to log some substantial hands on time with the device and I've got to say I was impressed and eventually got one of my own.  The most important feature of the latest iPad is, of course, the Retina display, an amazing feature that deserves the acclaim it's received.  I only had a couple times handling the previous iPad 2, but I can also definitely tell the processor outputs faster than previous generations, if only slightly (and hardly noticeable) - in fact, the only MAJOR draw for upgrading to the latest iPad is the display.  Sure, the iPad 3 is pretty much everything the iPhone is, but reading books (I bought my first - the Steve Jobs biography - recently) is a dream on it, as well as seeing the apps in all their glory blown up to size.  In short, the new iPad is everything you could ask for in a tablet and more, but upgrading isn't pertinent unless you're in a line of work or simply use the iPad 3 for visuals.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing!", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R3VDGPQ2VSC3OA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are plenty of lengthy reviews on here, and on various sites.

Personally, I will not be using the iPad to take pictures as I laugh at people who use their tablets to take pictures, they look ridiculous.Good feel and size - I'm one of the rare few that likes their items to have a good weight to them because it proves that they have value to them, like pick up a Walmart watch then a Michael Kors watch and you'll know what I'm talking aboutDictation - It's nice and accurate, old technology, nothing to see here folks.Elegant looks - Of course it looks breathtaking compared to any tablet out there, it is sleek and simple.Cons:Still no smaller model, this is not a personal concern but yeah for all the whiners out thereStill no headphones - is it that hard to include them apple? Come on...A5X processor - You would think being a 1gb dual core with quad core graphics processor that it would blow the A5 out of the water? It actually got a point lower than the iPad 2 ( 720 vs 721) disappointing.To sum it up really, if you have an iPad 2, do not upgrade, if you have the original PLEASE do.

Hinton", "ReviewID": "R2IKLSS535J07U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reason I decided to write anything here at all is the listed price of the 32Gb model.Wow just wow....  $629 for a $600 item.... Apple iPad MC706LL/A (32GB, Wi-Fi, Black) Price: $629.08 & this item ships for FREE with Super Saver Shipping.I guess Amazon has now come full circle charging more than MSRP for an item that is readily available everywhere for MSRP or lower.Even at the the Apple Store (iPad with Wi-Fi 32GB - Black 3rd generation $599.00 In Stock Free Shipping).What a deal for unsuspecting Amazon shoppers.Since I am here I may as well put some very random thoughts about the machine into the user reviews.We had an iPad2 (16Gb wifi) for about a month, it was bought so my wife could take it on a trip. Since we did not know if she would really like a tablet or not we went with the lowest price model.  Well as it turns out her fingers became permanently glued to the device. The iPad3 came out very shortly after we had bought the iPad2 so we sold the iPad2 to a family member and bought a iPad3 (wifi 64Gb) model.Other than my Galaxy II phone I/we have no other experience with tablets or smart phones.  I have used the iPad a little and the phone a lot.I am pretty middle of the road when it comes to the iOS / Android battle. Each has good points and bad points.  I think the Android will always suffer some of the same type issues as Windows due to the multitude of hardware configurations it is deployed on.The one thing I was greatly concerned about with the iPad was the lack of Flash support, but as it turns out the only website I have noticed the lack of Flash being a problem is here at Amazon.In the music section the Amazon music preview player is Flash based so I cannot listen to the sample clips when browsing CDs.  I am sure there are plenty of other sites that will give errors but we don't visit them so we are not greatly affected by the Flash 'issue'.Of course if the websites you like are Flash driven this will be a major issue you should consider before buying this machine.As far as I can tell the best trick the iPad3 has over the competition is the retina display; the text on the new iPad is considerably sharper than the iPad2 (big deal for me, not so much for my wife) and only a couple of the premium Android tablets are in this fight.Any tablet I decide to get for myself has to have text that is on par with what the retina display produces.  So my list of tablets is pretty short.When it comes to the rest of the hardware the review sites give the A5 processor a slight edge over the Tegra 3 processor, but for my use I am confident either processor is more than adequate.If you like action games I would specifically seek out performance reviews of the particular game you want to play before committing to any specific machine.The iPad3's cameras do a really good job for Facetime and video recording. Picture taking is somewhat lacking and from the reviews I have read this is a common knock I see on all the embedded cameras on phones and tablets. The 8mp camera in my Galaxy SII does not take as good of pictures as my old 4mp Kodak camera so I have good reason to believe the negative reviews of the cameras on the various tablets are accurate.The one thing I really don't understand is Apple's omission of some variety of SD slot (and on a top of the line machine in 2012 it needs to be a SDXC slot) on the iPad.Even the 64Gb model is really limited on storage space if you want to put a music library on it.  I don't even think my music collection is all that big and I have over 60Gb in high quality MP3 files.If the iPad had a SDXC slot I would not hesitate to buy one for myself. As it is if one of the premium Android machines adds it in the next refresh that will probably tip the scale for me to go that route simply for the storage capability.Build quality is outstanding on the iPad3, not sure what more could be asked for.The native apps that Apple has particularly right are Facetime and the music player.Even though I am unsure about the whole iTunes thingy (my wife has it on her computer, but I don't have it on mine) once the music is loaded on the machine it is functionally the best music player I have ever used.Facetime simply works; too bad it is a closed system for Apple only (the rest of my family that I would like to do video chat with use some variety of iPhone, iPad, iTouch, iMac). I have used Skype and it has done the job, but it does not work as good as the Facetime.Since the listed price of this machine is what prompted me to write anything I might as well comment on the price vs the competition, if you want to compare a budget Android tablet to the iPad3 there is nothing anyone can say that will affect you. Apple does not compete in the budget machine market.But if you do a more direct comparison of top of the line machines there is not really that much price difference (yeah I know $100 is $100 but $600 for a ASUS TF700T 64Gb model vs $700 for iPad3 64Gb model seems pretty close to me when any head to head review by an unbiased source gives the overall winning nod to the iPad).", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "OLE LADY MEL", "ReviewID": "R2F67F526IC6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO GAVE ME HOPE WHEN I NEEDED IT.

I find it to be much more useful than any laptop out there for many reasons, including portability, application availability, and ease of use.One reason why the iPad is so fast compared to laptops is due to the fact that it uses flash storage memory, or in other words, there are no moving parts inside the device, like a laptop would have with a typical moving hard drive that would eventually die after X number of years.I am not an Apple fanboy. I do see where they have some flaws. But if you're wondering if the iPad is worth the money, it absolutely is. You get what you pay for, and the iPad is a perfect example of it.I skipped the iPad 2 because they did not come out with the retina display, which makes everything, most notably text, much more sharp then it has been previously. If you do any fair amount of reading on the device, you need to get the third generation iPad, and don't look at the previous models. It will be entirely worth it, and you will not look back or regret your decision.And for the people who are confused why Apple chose not to name this device the iPad 3, I would like to help with a brief explanation. Apple currently has many products where they do not have a numbering system in the official title of the device, like the iPod, iPod touch, MacBook, MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and so on. It's simply labeled just with the title of the device, and the way people distinguish it from previous models is to simply refer to it as the first, second or third generation, etc. Evidently they are going to do this with the iPad now as well, and you can count on the fact that the next iPhone that will be released will not be called the iPhone 5. :-) I partially digress, but for the people who are wondering about this with any possible confusion, I hope this clears some of it up.I could get into all of the features that it has, but if you're looking for an overall device that does everything extremely well and fast, look no more and get this third generation iPad.

Simply easier to carry around.  iPad better for reading magazines but prefer the Tab for almost everything else. Really a matter of preference.Speed - iPad is faster.Heat - I live in a warm climate and find the iPad runs hot at times.  No problem with the Galaxy Tab.Build quality - About the same.  iPad may be a bit better but Galaxy Tab is also well made.Weight - The Tab is feather light, being less than a pound.  The iPad feels like a tank in comparison, a major disadvantage.Apps - Although the iPad has significantly more apps, the Android system is starting to catch up. So far, I have found everything I need on the Android app  stores.Interface - A matter of preference.  I appreciate the tightness of the IOS but prefer the openness and flexibility of the Android operating system.Bottom line.  Most people flock to the iPad because it is the best known and best integrated of the tablets.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 offers some advantages in size, weight and flexibility.

I need a tablet primarily to work with e-mail, read and listen to the news (cnbc and others), watch movies and listen to the music on the go. And if a product is well made and of good quality I'm not going to buy something else just because it is NEW, but actually doesn't offer substantially better experience. Not only new Ipad doesn't offer something that would made it different from previous models (for example possibility of installing  windows , or Adobe Flash etc.), but I have serious doubts about its quality. Based on my previous experience the quality of first Ipad is not that good ( It worked well for almost 2 years, but then one day just died), and I doubt that Ipad 3 quality is any better. I am most certainly not going to be buying a tablet that has 2 years life period (and who knows maybe even less). And it really pisses me off that a lot of times instead of graphics and charts you see empty space or you cannot listen to an interview.

I have saved up all of my xmas money for an ipad, I am one of 4 kids, so we all pitched in to buy one for our family to share. The first thing i noticed was that the web browsing is hilarious. The magnifying glass is so retarted, i hate how it automatically corrects you. The camera is a joke, the apps are a million bucks, updates take a minimal of 3 hours, my imessages dissapear. The facetime is a pain to set up, my screen is green, i cant watch a video on it without it skipping, i dropped it (because my sister thought it would be oh so funny to drop a hot skillet on my foot, but my dropping it is not apples fault. They cant help it shattered) the app store is so stupid, the notes are plain, the email is sometimes not recieved, no flash player, you cant do home work on it, over all......
