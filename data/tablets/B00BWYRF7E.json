[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Author": "Kendall Giles",

what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY DOESNT LAST, AMAZON.COM SENDS REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT", "Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.  I'll update this review, as I learn more.Enjoy!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Pavic", "ReviewID": "R2OIC7C543S2IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Amazon for another wonderful product, it came right on time for me!I'm an avid reader, so when someone stole my Kindle Fire three weeks ago, it was as if a good friend was taken away from me. Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sublime!", "Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle HDX 7\" Wifi 32 GB", "Author": "Rita", "ReviewID": "R1IWS6AOYTRZS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I want to say that I was 4 star happy with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and have been just as happy or happier with past Kindles.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" will be the fifth one for me and my family.I find that the HDX is a good upgrade from the HD.  I haven't found anything yet that would make me want to return it.  There was 60% battery out of the box and for me, setup was a snap.  The HDX connected to my account, downloaded all the info, upgraded and came back up in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was opening the box.I was very happy to see the charger when I opened the box and not just the wire.  I really hate to buy the extra charging plug.  The one that comes in the box is a smaller charger than the square one Amazon sells.  I don't know all the specs, but I assume it charges slower, but has to be faster than charging through the computer.  I haven't had to recharge completely yet so I don't know how long it will take.  But I am assuming it won't be any longer than with the HD.  I found that so far the power usage is about the same at the HD.  I was on it for several hours last night and used about 15% without running video.  That was setup, book downloading and cruising the features and some internet just to see how the screen looks and check out loading times.  The charging wire does stick out from the kindle at greater than 90 degrees, so one will have to be careful when plugging it in and removing the plug.  Also, you wouldn't want to lay the kindle on it's face when charging, the plug will get in the way.The screen resolution is fantastic. The sound is very good for such small speakers and I haven't seen any buffering with the videos.  Although the cloud did have all of my books, the cloud didn't seem to know which books were still on my HD. The only books on the HDX when it arrived were the ones I purchased since I put in my order for the HDX.  When I set up it pulled in the cloud but not the unread books on the HD.  So, I had to run through the HD and download the books I haven't read yet from the cloud to the HDX. The speed is faster than the HD, although not remarkably faster.  It is lighter than the HD which is good for me because I have arthritic hands and can't hold a book. So far the best one from that standpoint was the Touch.Many have complained about the bluish/purple light around the boarder on white pages.  I would not have noticed it if it hadn't been mentioned in the reviews.  It doesn't distract from my reading (and I read a lot), doesn't cause me any eye strain, and I forget it is even there. People complaining because Amazon is trying to put a positive spin on this are na\u00efve.  All companies are going to try and give their products the best spin.  It is up to the customer to like it or not.  Return it if you don't like it.I am happy for the mayday button, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  I don't want to contact someone just to say hi.  But I am sure I would use it in a heartbeat if I needed to.  I have never had a problem with phoning tech help, even if it is in India. The user guide was pretty easy to find and I am going through it tonight to see if there is anything I haven't figured out yet.The origami cover isn't really great and hugely overpriced.  It's a little floppy when opening it but the magnets put it tight when you  flip it to the back for handheld reading.  I do like the way it feels, and the magnets that hold everything together and creates the stand are solid.  The kindle is held in the case securely, although it looks like it might fall right out, it won't.  The cover doesn't block the speakers, but seem to enhance the sound by holding the kindle slightly away from the back cover and aiming the sound at you in landscape.  When I stand the kindle in landscape it wiggles a little when I swipe or tape to change pages and seems as if it wants to fall over.  It hasn't yet, but it doesn't seem very stable. The worst is when I stand it in portrait.  The kindle turns itself off and restarts repeatedly.  I don't know if it is the cover on button thingy hitting the table or if the new location of the on button on the kindle itself is poorly thought out.  The on button isn't in the way no matter which way I hold the kindle, it is only a problem when it stands in portrait.  Maybe another cover would work better.  I am going to wait to see what other hard cover is created by other makers.So, I am happy with my purchase and I am glad I upgraded.  I don't use my kindle for more than reading, email, facebook, twitter, and the internet, but I am looking forward to the software upgrade in November.  I am curious to see what kind of business items will appear.  I wish Amazon would notify kindle owners when a new update is available or make it possible to update software automatically when one connects to Kindle.UPDATE 11/3/13 - I am happier than ever with the HDX.  I am experiencing a weird thing with it though.  It may be the Origami cover that is causing this, but 4 times now in the last week the HDX has decided to just restart all by itself.  When it does, it doesn't save a book where I am reading.  I have to hunt for the page I was on.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "couldn't agree more", "Author": "Debra Ann Fescina", "ReviewID": "R199IHRUR3XORN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Found the following on the 1-star reviews:  \"From somebody that has owned both products, I was never happier to sell my kindle fire on Craigslist. I've had two apple computers and 4 iPhones as well as two iPad's and I couldn't be happier with them. Everything else is just an imitation. Save yourself the trouble and go straight to the apple store.\" Again, I couldn't agree more.I purchased FOUR Kindle fires last year for grandkids for Christmas.  I have two of them in my home right now that will not charge AT ALL.  The other two, I am waiting to hear from my other grandkids to see if they are having any similar issues.  I have spoken with three representatives from Amazon, and I am hearing the same thing from all of them:  They would be happy to sell me 2 replacement Kindles .. it is the best that they can do.Amazon needs to put into place a remedy for people other than what is written in black and white.  The fact that your people, one who is supposedly a supervisor, cannot stray from the rules and make an exception to a customer who purchased FOUR Kindles and now has TWO not charging at not quite 13 months later is amazing.  There SHOULD be some sort of empowerment to Amazon employees, especially supervisors, to make decisions that are fair to Amazon's customers.  I asked if I could get an exception to the 30 days past warranty; and when told \"NO\" I asked if I could get a discount from the normal $79 replacement cost since I would have to purchase TWO refurbished Kindles.  Again, I was told \"NO\".  At a minimum, Amazon should replace the battery at a REASONABLE cost.  However, that offer was not on the table.Apple, Nook, Nintendo, Bose, Dell, HP.  I have them all (I have a hand-held Nintendo that is literally more than 15 years old - it still works!).  I have never had a product quit working at 13 months ... the only thing close to this is an iPod that only works while on the charger but it is FIVE years old AND it does still work while on the charger!

I now prefer using my HDX over my HD model most of the time.  The performance  is way more solid than my HD.  I still use my HD for my missing Weather app  WeatherBug...and the older version of AccuWeather.  The HD and HDX clearly  use different stores.  I got notes back from app developers....no estimate  of when these apps will be in the HDX store.  Does anyone really care?2.  A new minor app issue for my ESPN scoreboard which nobody wants to address.  The standings font for the stats is too large and overlays the city names  such that NFL Won and Loss numbers overlay the city names.  Very annoying.  Does anyone ever test these new/modified HDX apps?3.  Battery life.  As noted below....it is directly proportional to the brightness  setting.  If you want to conserve your battery life...turn the brightness bar  down to 70-80% of the bar length....to get at least 2 more hours out of your  battery.4.  No HD solid black matrix...more dark grey on the HDX.  I guess I am getting use  to this change.  Still like the black LEDs better.  I also don't notice the  blue edges as much on white screens when I am reading.  With time, we can all  get use to just about anything.5.  I did get the HDX Marware screen protectors.....a must accessory...although way  too expensive.  $14.99 + tax on prime for just 2 plastic sheets.**********************************************************************************First, let me say I really like my Kindle(s), but for those who are consideringan upgrade, I will post my quick review to help you decide if now is the timeto make an upgrade or not, and whether to keep your HD around for certain apps.I am still testing out my new HDX and will update this review as I discover moreabout it.  Normally, I wait a few months before I buy an upgrade for any pieceof hardware, but this time I pulled the trigger early on 11/4 to take advantageof the extra 1 day 15% discount which Bezos gave us for the FAA ruling on wireless devices.

Great price performance (Cheaper and Faster)2. Size and weight (Smaller and lighter footprint for jacket pockets)3. Origami case is ok with fixed magnetic angles but not adjustable4. Mayday Help (Excellent) - Fast response but some advisors are still  learning and some are not familiar with HDs and need 2nd level help.5. Apps and movies seem to be running much smoother with fewer freezes than  HD model.HDX vs HD CON:1. Most disappointing:  Screen background matrix is not a black matrix like theHD...more of a very dark grey with lighter gray spotlight in the middle of the display and shadowing of icons and other objects.  HDX screen seem less sharp than HD despite higher resolution when viewed side by side.  I tried all positions of the brightness bar and turned auto feature on and off with no improvement.  There is no contrast control either per my chat with the Mayday folks.2. Others are correct on the white screen blue edge lines on the bottom and rightside of screens.  The HD would probably be a better choice for those who readmore on their Kindles white screens. I did not notice blue line edge problems for movies and pictures. Choice of the blue LEDs for the HDX might explain this problem and the \"dark gray background\" matrix on the carousel screen.  I am surprised there was apparently not more human factors testing on this model before this release.3. The standard font size for the HDX seems 1 or 2 points smaller for more text than the HD. An issue for older reading glasses users.  Portrait viewing will help this a little.4. I don't like the non-carousel device app icons to be half-way visible at the bottom of my HDX.  There is no * (star) feature on this operating system to hide the apps you don't want visible on your carousel.5. Not all HD apps you have now are available on the HDX.  I am not sure if the Kindle \"Store\" is the same store for the HD and the HDX.  If so, they have a problem.  A good example is one of my favorite free Weather Apps, WeatherBug, which has the blue ladybug icon with rain and snow symbols on shell.  The HDX store says it's there and you try to find this icon in the store and all you get are apps the look or are spelled like it but not the real WeatherBug app.  Meantime the HD Kindle \"Store\" has the real one...and I use it on my HD all the time.  When I called the Mayday folks...they said it probably is still not available for the HDX.  If so, then why does the HDX app store search say it is there???  Another free app, AccuWeather, is there in the store, but has a totally different look andfeel, on the HDX. I still like the HD version better.6. Still no .AVI .MOV or .MVI support for movies, only .MP4.  I had to get a desktop converter software for all my Canon camera movies. (ArcSoft Media Converter 2 is a good one)7. Miss the HDMI port on the HDX.  May use the HD for playback of movies on my HDTVs.  Not sure how fast the wireless \"Mirror\" display will be on the HDX...or if I will have \"Miracast\" compatibility. Seems like the hardwire cable would be faster.8. Battery discharge seems to be faster than the HD for same apps...may be underpowered for the higher screen resolution.  Might require lower brightness setting to conserve battery reserves. Requires additional benchmarking.Final Analysis:I'm sure many of the early \"bugs\" will be worked out of the HDX before the holidays and many of the \"missing apps\" will show up at some point.  I will probably keep my HDX to keep testing and benchmarking it against my HD.  I will not get rid of my HD until I see the improvements on the Con side addressed here and I would advise the current HD users to do the same.  Even if this generation proves to be a disappointment, there is still a lot to like about this one for a new tablet owner.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle FIre HDX!", "Author": "Sara Karolina", "ReviewID": "RJELLQHFEYV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Kindle Fire. You can read, surf the net (let me just suggest downloading the Dolphin browser, since the Silk browser it comes with isn't that great). And that blue LED light on the side that everyone is complaining about isn't actually flawed, it was a design decision based on lower LED battery using power. The blue LED lights used less power than the white, so they went with the blue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me and I don't really understand what the big deal about it is. You definitely notice it, but more so if you are reading a book but still, it doesn't even matter. The clarity of the screen is amazing. I highly recommend going with the 64 GB, that's what I got. I already have a ton of apps on there and am watching tv shows and movies and barely have any memory used up. I also got the Amazon origami magnetic case for my Kindle Fire, and it's also really good quality.

Size & weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2.

I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4.

I maxed the Kindle out with 64 gb  so I assume i will have enough room for years to come.7.

LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear & rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border !!!!Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device & Merry Christmas to all !!!!!! ;)ps what is the best screen covers & case to get ???On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker !!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shocked by how bad this Kindle is", "Author": "alana", "ReviewID": "R13VX6O3LRMI2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this tablet.  I love the variety and price of books available in the Kindle store, so I thought I would step out of my Apple cocoon and try a Kindle Fire for an e-reader.  I was so excited, but within 1 HOUR of owning the Kindle HDX, I quickly became really, REALLY bummed with it and decided to return it right away.  For the price, you would think you would get a decent quality tablet, but there were some major red flags right away.I will start with the GOOD news first (and the only reason why I give this item 1 star):- The MayDay feature is amazing.  GREAT job by Amazon on this one!  The tech supporters were friendly, helpful, and excellent with customer service.  I used this feature a couple times, and each time a tech person responded in about 10 seconds.  Obviously, as more Kindle HDXs are sold, and the tech department gets busier, they will be slower in their response time, but that's fine!  It's such a great feature, that it's worth waiting 20 min for.  Even though I was ultimately disappointed with the Kindle HDX, I was really impressed with the tech support available.  This is one major feature missing from Apple.Now, for the BAD news:- Froze 3 times on me in about ONE hour.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't download anything on there except for a couple books, so there's no real reason for the damn device to keep freezing on me.  That's the biggest red flag for me with this device.  One hour in, and the damn thing keeps freezing, so I can imagine how much worse it's going to get as the device gets older and I download more things.- Kept getting error messages when the device would automatically update after turning it on.  First of all, I don't want it to automatically update when I turn it on, but I guess there's no way around it.  And to top it off, brand new and it's not even updating correctly?  C'mon Amazon!- Apps wouldn't come up correctly after it froze and turned back on.  So after the device kept freezing and I turned it back on (3 times), on the main page where you can see the big books, apps, etc... that you can scroll through, the pictures of the apps wouldn't show up.  It just came up as gray boxes with the Amazon \"box\" logo on it.  Again, I shouldn't be having these type of basic loading issues one hour after opening the box.- There is NO WAY to create \"collections\" in your books library.  Say what???  I've been reading my Kindle books on my iPhone through the Kindle App, and I'm able to organize my books into collections.  But the Kindle Fire doesn't allow me to do this?  This is the most asinine thing I've ever come across!  You'd think that you'd get more features through a Kindle Fire than you would on the Kindle App for a different company's device.  Using MayDay, I talked to a tech who confirmed that yes, you can't organize your collection on the Kindle Fire, but that there were other third party apps that let you do this.  She also said that maybe, with the new software update coming in November, the Kindle Fire may include this feature, but it's a \"maybe\".  I'm sorry, but this is a huge no-no for me if a company can't get their s*** together enough to offer basic organization of your library on their own device, when it's a feature already available in an app for a different company's device.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm just so shocked that they can't even get this kind of basic necessity worked out...- THE WORST PART FOR LAST: the BLUE HUE around the edge of the screen.  I read a lot of reviews about how horrible this is, and I thought that I would still give it a try.  I thought that maybe the blue hue isn't visible when you change to the \"sepia\" tone for books.  Um.  Yeah... No, it is still very visible, and it is as annoying as everyone else made it out to be.  I can't concentrate on reading anything bc my eyes kept looking over at the blue hue.  My eyes unconsciously kept floating over to it like a mosquito to a bug zapper.  While I was trying to read, I caught myself thinking, \"wow, that blue hue is ridiculous, it's really visible, how horrible, I can't stop staring at it... so weird...\"  When buying an Amazon Kindle product, I expected a seamless and easy screen to read off of, and this totally FAILED.  So again, when I talked to a tech rep about it, she kept saying that the blue hue is \"completely normal.\"  Um, no.  I spent $250 for the device (without \"special\" promotions) and as the client, I will tell you what I think \"normal\" is.  Trust me when I say that the blue hue is NOT IN ANY WAY \"NORMAL\".  I know this is what she's trained to say, but I felt like Amazon was just trying to CON me. LIKE INSISTING THAT I'M EATING CHICKEN WHEN I HAVE THE SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M EATING CAT.  After looking at countless of different types of computer/device screens, we are intelligent enough consumers to know what is a \"normal\" screen and what isn't.  A blue hue around the edge of a device does not feel \"normal\".  Amazon should seriously listen to all the reviewers' comments about how bad this screen is and just apologize instead of trying to tell us that it's \"NORMAL\".SO - after all these problems within one hour of using the device, I have decided to return to my Apple cocoon and buy an IPad Mini.  Yes, it's much more expensive, but in my opinion, it makes no sense to pay $250 bucks for a device that has so many problems that make it unusable when you can spend an extra $150 more and get SO MUCH MORE that works BEAUTIFULLY.  Sorry Amazon, but you completely failed on this one.  Please listen to your customers' complaints about this device.  We are especially right about the screen - it's HORRIBLE.  Stop telling us that it's \"normal.\"", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Edges and Yellow Tone Very Distracting", "Author": "S.

This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday Saves the Day", "Author": "spark", "ReviewID": "R3SJPD6D5ZZV34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited all day for my new Kindle HDX to arrive, When at 7:00 pm it came, I was already to manage, download and put it to a workout.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Purple Blue Hue Along Edges Very Obvious!", "Author": "Gregory G.", "ReviewID": "R2BB6E6JP37KMQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane. Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.

Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always.

Took 5 seconds to connect. The young lady was helpful and courteous, and answered my question (downloading a prime movie to my HDX for offline viewing) quickly. Turned out that the movie I was looking at was not licensed for that yet, but they were working on improving the selection of these things. Kind of a bummer, but it's day one so I expect the content to grow. For now I have several seasons of kids shows and my tv shows ready for viewing whenever we need them!Mail App:I have had some issues with the mail app, I can't get it to include all of the older messages from different folders other than the inbox. I may be asking mayday again, we'll see.This is my favorite tablet size for most general uses, not a work tablet, but a great play tablet.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine. But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon has outdone themselves!", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "RBJ4GF80COQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third KF - I had the first and second versions of the non HD Fire.This new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is simply amazing. I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle. You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Purchase, Fully Recommend", "Author": "I Shop Too Much", "ReviewID": "R2QJ79PRC99V0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first glance the Kindle Fire HDX is everything I had wanted, not to say that it still is not what I wanted...mostly.The Kindle Fire HDX earns a stable 4/5 stars, if it were out of ten however; it'd be a clear 7/10.*Device & Apps*The device itself is fantastic, the speed of the Linux OS mixed with the 2.2 GHz quad-processor really does make this the fastest 7\" tablet I've seen, there is no doubt about it.  In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.  Just because the one was bad, DOES NOT mean that the tablet itself isn't worth getting.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now Great For Web Browsing!  And Mayday is slick!", "Author": "Jon Jay \"seattlejrj\"", "ReviewID": "R2A4KPKAUHQ2UV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased each generation of the Kindle Fire.  Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.  If I have any future questions about the device, I will not hesitate to use the Mayday feature.All in all, it is amazing to me that you can buy a quad core, high def, touch screen tablet like this for $229.  We live in a remarkable time!", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, this is suiting my purposes well enough", "Author": "ECP", "ReviewID": "R33D9W41XRE3N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE, 11/9: I've decided to mention up front that I bought this to serve primarily as an \"Amazon interface\" because I'm a Prime member and use Amazon frequently for entertainment and business, so I was seeking an \"Amazon-delivery/storage/fun-device\" more than a full-featured 7-inch Android tablet, such as the Nexus 7 2013, Google Nexus 7 Tablet (7-Inch, 32GB, Black) by ASUS (2013), which I had considered seriously also before choosing this. I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

It is just as user-friendly as an iPad.  I know you are comparing to an iPad, and 'you' know you are comparing to an iPad.The things I really like vs an iPad:HARDWARE* The speakers and sound quality are better, you will be amazed at hearing sounds 'over there' from this small device* It has a nice soft feel, the backing feels almost sponge-y* Far more affordable, yet not 'cheap' - this is good hardware* The screen is beautiful, especially for watching video* The power cable is a standard usb cable, & you can charge this tablet almost anywhereSOFTWARE* The interface is faster at switching between apps, & you can find your apps more quickly* Free software everyday - often overlooked, Amazon provides you a free app everyday (just add up the value)* Books are much more thought out and useful on a Kindle, especially when they are so accessible from the carousel* VERY cloud-friendly, everything is saved in the cloud (and easier to manage than an iPad)The things I do not like vs an iPad:HARDWARE* The battery is not great, it's good but not great* The power button at the 'bottom' of the tablet is in the wrong place (by 'feel' you can get lost deciding which side has the volume buttons and which has the power button)* Auto-brightness will drive you insane as it flickers between bright and darkSOFTWARE* The app selection is too limited -- in essence, you are limited to a subset of the google play store* If you use anything other than a Windows computer, you are asked to use the 'Android Transfer App' to transfer files to the tablet - DO NOT USE IT, it will cause problems on this tablet.  I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

This is very disappointing as I love everything else about this device. Everything else. It's fast, light and the screen looks great (except for the bleeding). The backlight bleeding is a deal breaker. I am sending my current one back and hoping that the next one will be perfect, but I am not confident. If the next replacement is also bad, I will give up until Amazon fixes this issue.Follow-up: I recently received an email from Amazon telling me that the blue/purple light is normal and makes the screen nicer. This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges. If Amazon wants to challenge me on this, I will gladly post pictures of my Fire HD and HDX side by side to show just how much this answer makes zero sense. This is a defect not a feature. Own up to it Amazon.Second follow-up: Amazon is now publicly saying that the backlight bleed is not a defect and the fact that my third Fire HDX seems to back this up. Sadly I will be returning mine.

The Nexus 7 (2013) has a slower processor 1.5 GHz Quad Core to the Kindle Fire HDX 2.2 GHz Quad Core. This is the only reason I am rating this product with a 3 star rating.The sound is great but in a side by side comparison to the Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 has a bigger and crisper sound, but in all honesty not much of a difference. It may be a matter of preference.A lot of technology blogs are giving the Kindle Fire HDX a better rating for the screen quality but with the brightness settings set at max. The Nexus 7 (2013) has a much brighter and cooler picture than the Kindle Fire HDX. (Again a matter of preference both 1080p displays).The HDX only has one front facing camera compared to the Nexus 7 which has two. Albeit the front facing camera snaps great images, the Nexus 7 has two equally great cameras in the front and back.The battery life is a better than the Nexus 7 but both lasted around three days with average use.I also find myself fumbling to find the power and volume buttons. The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length.

Apps load faster and wifi connection seems better.  The operating system has been cleaned up and moves things along at a nicer rate as well.  So as for my experience, this years iteration is a good buy, and if you're looking for a tablet, don't pass this one by.For those who post about the lack of Google Play, then they should have bought a stock Android tablet.  It's that simple!  I have both an Asus tablet and HTC phone that can access Play, and yes there are more apps available there, but what are you looking for that you can't get at Amazon or can't live without?  I found that several apps at Play are only available for phones and can't be put on an Android tablet.  Not a deal breaker.One post whined about not having an office suite on their tablet. Go to the app store and get one.  There are several there, and Amazon has the top sellers available for any Android device.  Another post complained about NetFlix not being on his tablet...

I already own an iPad 3, an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro. So it only made sense that I come full circle and buy the mini when I needed a smaller more portable tablet. However, while shopping around, the Kindle Fire HDX won me over.I normally breakdown the good, bad, and the ugly of the products I review. But there's really nothing bad nor ugly about the Kindle Fire HDX. So I've settled for good and not so good...GOOD~ It's affordable. I purchased this using my Amazon store card and received $50 off from their promotion. So for $179, it's $220 cheaper than its rival, the iPad Mini w/ Retina display.~ The images are clear and the colors are vivid. My husband even thinks the screen quality is better than the iPad.~ It's incredibly light. When I unboxed it, I immediately lost myself in a book for a good 3 hours. And there was no hand strain from holding the Kindle up to read for that long.~ I can buy books from Amazon directly from the books section. With the iPad, I had to go Safari, log in to Amazon, buy the book, log back out, then go back to the Kindle app before I can read the book I want.~ I finally get to take advantage of my (1) free book a month for being a Prime member.~ The silk browser is fast and the browsing experience is noticeably smooth.~ I can switch between reading and listening to the book's narration without exiting the books section.~ A ton of apps to choose from. Having used the iOS platform for so long, I was a tad concern that there won't be enough apps for the Kindle. But I was wrong.~ Very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. If my 3-year old can navigate through the HDX with ease, then so can you.~ Decent battery life. My kids and I put the HDX through the paces when I first unboxed it. And after watching a ton of YouTube videos, reading half a book, browsing through several web pages, and listening to an audiobook, the HDX stayed alive for a good 10 hours.~ MAYDAY BUTTON! This sealed the deal for me. A 24-hour customer support rep directly on your Kindle HDX with just a touch of a button. I mean c'mon, this feature blows Siri completely out of the water.NOT SO GOOD:~ The speakers are not as loud as I'm used to. In some cases it even sounded a bit muffled. But when using headphones, the sound is loud and clear.~ The front camera's quality is not so good. It's grainy. But since I won't be using this for video chats or taking pictures, it's not a big deal.~ The app store is not secure. While my daughter was using the HDX, I got an email thanking me for an app I purchased. Good thing she chose a free app. I have yet to figure out if I can set a password every time someone tries to purchase an app. This feature is available on the iPad, not sure if it too is available on the HDX.~ In the first 48 hours that I had the HDX, my wireless connection would automatically disconnect when the HDX is not in use. So every time I tried to use it I had to log back in to the network and establish a connection. After a few times of doing this I finally got tired and hit the Mayday Button. The Amazon rep was so patient and helpful. We finally fixed the issue, I only needed to modify my router's proxy settings.VERDICT:~ BUY IT!

SAD BUT TRUE", "Author": "Marilyn Armstrong", "ReviewID": "R17WEBSQEGQOZ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon launched the new generation of Kindles at the end of September 2013. I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \"That's it, I'm done.\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this.

I read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading.  I don't have that and find that reading a book with this Kindle is easy on the eyes.I haven't used the Mayday button yet but I'm sure it's up to par with Amazon's wonderful customer service.  I'm unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this Kindle.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for my needs!", "Author": "mostlyharmlessx", "ReviewID": "R1XL20NACYX97H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking at tablets for the past few years, trying to justify why I might \"need\" one, I took a good look at the reviews on this one before I purchased it. My expectations were for smooth web browsing, Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming, movie playback (Handbrake encoded), and reading news/books.I have not been disappointed. The Silk browser works well, no issues so far. The screen has excellent picture quality. Netflix and Prime stream perfectly and look sharp. Handbrake encodes are sharp and play with no issues, at either 720 or 1080p. Feedly app works ok, and of course reading books works perfectly. I had seen some reports that there is a blue glow around the edge of the screen that people found distracting. On my particular screen, I can faintly see the blue glow on a white background, but it is very light and hardly noticeable. Certainly nothing that will impede my use of the product.As for the kindle itself, it feels sturdy and well-built; power and volume buttons are in good places, as are the speakers. Battery life is good so far, enough for a day's worth of surfing, movies and games. About 6 hours of mixed use (games, movie playback from kindle and streaming, web-browsing and email) over a twelve-hour period left me at 50 percent. The whole Interface is quick and responsive, no lag at all moving from menu to menu or app to app. The speakers provide a good amount of sound for a tablet, and have more than enough clarity to hear dialogue in movies or tv shows.Learning curve on use of this tablet was very quick; the few questions I had were quickly answered on Google. Everything else on the tablet was easy to figure out; the menu and home page are well-designed for finding the way to what you are looking for, and there is a decent tutorial for the basic functions. There is always the Mayday button; though I don't see myself needing it, I imagine many people will find it useful. The Amazon App Store has many more apps than most reviews would lead you to believe. Every app I use was on there and functional, and I saw most of the other popular apps available as well. You will indeed see a larger number of total apps on google play, but I would be surprised if you couldn't find what you actually use on Amazon's store.I have no complaints at all so far, solid product at a good price!", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wish I could live with the blue haze", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15DX5U97LDR3F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a longtime member of the Amazon/Kindle ecosystem I was excited about the Kindle HDX as a replacement for my Fire.  I have it now and love the great improvements in weight, speed, and wonderful color.  The Mayday button is amazing with a prompt response the 3 times I have used it along with the usual competent and friendly staff.  However, reading books is a major reason I have a Kindle and the blue haze around the pages is a very serious problem. I was aware of it from the reviews and hoped it would not be an issue or that it would not be noticeable.  I was wrong.  I tried the sepia background and even the black background with white letters.  The sepia did not make much of a difference and I can't see myself reading books with a black background and white letters.  So I have to decide whether to live with this major flaw in an otherwise fantastic product or return it and hope Amazon resolves the problem in the future.  I think I will probably return it because the prospect of seeing blue tinged pages on every book I read in the future on this instrument is a depressing thought. It also makes me sad that Amazon apparently decided with their eyes open that the negative impact of the blue LED background on the reading experience was worth the benefits to color etc. For this longtime customer it was the wrong decision.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "Cris", "ReviewID": "R22HEEYU4QVBKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the first generation kindle fire and was happy with it  for a while, but this is in another league.

I have no problem downloading books - they appear immediately.There is a slight blue haze around the edges of the sides of pages which are white but it doesn't bother me at all as this blue haze doesn't extend to the rest of the screen or any words - so for me it is a non-issue.My prime instant videos stream quickly and play perfectly. The sound volume is fine for me - I have never had to put the sound all the way up to hear clearly.I enjoy playing games and have noticed that playing games for a long while does drain the battery rather quickly.

If using the kindle fire for checking mail, web browsing and reading, playing games for a short time, my battery life has been at least 11 hours as advertised.Overall for what I have been doing the Kindle Fire HDX is a pleasure to use and I'm extremely pleased.

Everything is perfect about my device minus that.  It's very annoying and I can't believe Amazon actually is stating it's suppose to be like that. Clearly not if some folks are giving it 5  stars and beautiful screen and picture. I'm disappointed. For luck I Ordered a replacement to see if I can get one that's amazing like others state but if not I might return both. I waited forever to get this and really support Amazon but they should fix the issue and ship us a new one. The haze of course is only there on the web and reading so my two main reasons of buying this device was an epic fail. If anyone hears anything further let me know.10/24/13- EDITWell, I got a replacement in the mail yesterday. I was hoping mine did not have this haze, after opening up my new unit, it again had the blue haze around the border. Very unhappy. Although the haze was not a dark and fuzzy on the new one it still is annoying. I re-read some of the reviews again what concerns me is some people are stating their device is fine and has no blue haze. I want one! I reached out to a customer service rep and made another compliant and the rep was super nice and stated she was sorry. She is going to put in a claim for me and call me back about the issue and about getting me another replacement. I almost don't want to bother because it seems like I won't win. She did tell me this was normal and the blue haze is suppose to be there but it should be very faint and not to noticeable, that the paperwhite has the same thing. She also said it's because they used blue LED lights and not white LED lights. This is suppose to really make the picture look amazing. I agree the picture is awesome and I love it, but while reading this blue light really bugs my eyes out. Is it a defeat or really normal? I don't know what to believe. Why are some devices fine and others not? For spending this kind of money I just want a device that doesn't have this blue haze. I normally don't wine about things, but I really want this tablet to work.10/27/13After a few days with the second kindle, the blue haze is not as bothersome but now I have discovered an odd situation with the battery life. I charged my Kindle overnight, in the AM it was 100% ,I did not power the Kindle all the way off, just hit the power button so the screen went black. Mind you I have owned a Nexus and Ipad and never had the issue I am about to say ... I came home that same night from work got out the Kindle and the battery was at 20%! I did not even use it. I called and the tech told me that the battery did last almost 10 hours so what was the issue, really? No one used it all day, that battery should have been 100%. I looked more into the issue and after talking with another Rep they said that I have to turn the WiFi off every time I am not using it. This seem to be so ridiculous, I have never had to turn WIFI off  with any other tablet. My husband has an Ipad Mini and his charge was at 88% after a few hours of actually using it. This Kindle just has to many issues for me, once they come out with another batch later on I will try it again until then maybe I'll try the HD. Has anyone else have this issue? Is it true you have to turn the WIFI off?", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "11 hour battery yeah right!!

I will never purchase another item from Amazon and every chance I get I will let people know how shabby I have been treated.

Responsive. Runs games, or video streaming, HD TV streaming - with no lags.**DesignThat hardly depends on personal taste. Myself I like it. Easy to hold even with one hand. Not slippy. Light. Good thing is that Power and Audio buttons are well situated. If you hold HDX and watch something, or listening music while reading and wish to adjust volume - easy to find buttons as your fingers are exactly there.**Screen/Reading experienceIt is marvelous for reading. I do have Kindle reader as well and mostly read on it, but sometimes have to use Kindle Fire - for EPUBS f/e and I should say KF HDX screen is amazing step ahead. Of course, for reading not as good as EInk screens, but really better than reading on smartphone  or IPad Mini or Notebook. Do not have Nexus, thus can say nothing about. Can't compare here.Only bad thing with this screen is that it's glossy. Terribly glossy. If you love dark backgrounds and pick that option in apps, or if you read and prefer white letters/black background - forget about. You would see yourself in the screen like in a mirror. But for white (or any light) background/black letter thing - as I have said above reading experience is superb!Of course for movies and games HDX screen is superb as well. Rich and bright,  well calibrated.  Vivid colors. No complains here.I do have some applications for note-taking (handwriting) like 7Notes and HDX is good for that. With a stylus you can take notes or draw something - would not say that's exactly like if you have a pen and paper but quite close.**AudioSpeakers are well situated so you never hold it with your hand. And the audio is good - loud and clear. I do also have bluetooth speakers but no real need to use them. Well, maybe somewhere in a noisy environment.Back, where speakers are located has an angle and that's smart - if you lay HDX on table, speakers are not covered and audio is good.**BatteryHolds about 10-11 hours (Amazon says 11). But when you read, it automatically picks energysave regime, well done! Nice option really and very useful.Charging takes about 6 hours. Bit less.But HDX charger output is 1A, when HDX can be charged at 1.8A - thus, better to use other charger it would be fast. F/e 1st Gen KF charger output is exactly 1.8A.**Web browsingWith double antenna it finds Wi-Fi easily and holds it well.Silk browser is getting better. Works well, quick enough but still below Chrome. Of course Silk is the only browser on Amazon appstore, but sideloading is possible. :)Streaming is smooth. You can watch online TV from some other web-servers, of course watch Youtube, Dailymotion... No lags. If you have access to some HD TV online broadcast services - HDX is good for that as well. Buffering is very quick and after it goes like a charm. HDX great hardware gives you all benefits here.**HDX Keyboard/FontsYou can read books, surf web in any (or almost any? - don't want to make a mistake) language and you can type as well as HDX new keyboard gives an option to download lots of additional languages. And keyboard supports path-tracing like Swype. Works really well. If you love Swype keyboard, HDX one is close to that standard.**EcosystemDepends you are a long-time Amazon customer or new here. Are you a Prime member or not. Myself I am with Amazon for several years now. Buy from e-shop, also reading on Kindle (reader), later when they release KF tablet I got it... thus, HDX integration with Amazon services is an important thing for me. You access all your books. All your documents you store with Amazon. Cloud Drive is integrated. Videos, music streaming. You can now download Prime videos as well.Needless to say, that buying from Amazon e-shop or siblings like Zappos or MyHabit is easy and nice.As for apps - of course Amazon Appstore is way behind it's e-shop. You may not find lots of applications you wish to have. Hope Amazon would work here and call more developers. But again - don't forget, you can find an application somewhere else and sideload to HDX. Of course - that's not an ideal, but still a solution sometimes.And MayDay. 24/7 Online support. Have not used it yet. :) But that may be helpful when you need.**Cons/Things you should consider, while orderingTraditionally: No Google Play (but some Google apps like Calendar, Music or Gmail can be sideloaded and work - pls., see comments for details). But you know, what you buy.No rare camera but for me that was not crucial while making a decision as I do not really gonna to use it having smartphone with better camera.As for blue light around screen edges - lots of people do complain. For my eyes that's barely noticeable and not irritating while reading or browsing.If you refer to \"We want you to know...\" topic on HDX page, Amazon says, that \"All displays have some level of light emission around the edges... Most LCD displays use white LEDs. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"Thus, if you buy HDX, you have to live with blue glow. Future software updates would leave that intact I guess.Fire OS is almost no Android OS. Hard to feel Android here. And native launcher is much different from any other Android launcher. If HDX is not your first KF - than you know it, but if HDX is your first tablet form Amazon, you may feel lost from the beginning.  I felt this way when I received my 1st Gen. KF... finally I ended installing an alternative launcher. Sorry, Amazon. :)But I should say, that for HDX Amazon made some nice changes - f/e option to see apps. in greed view. That's nice.**Special offersYou see Ad ONLY on lock screen, as soon you slide to unlock - ad banner disappears. Not annoying at all IMHO.In conclusion - great hardware, well build and if you are with Amazon ecosystem and do not need Google Play etc. - this is an extremely nice tablet.___Accessories:**CaseJust got Slimline Case from Poetic (which is on sale right now on Amazon). Fits HDX well. Awakes tablet when opened, like Origami case does.

The screen is beautiful. It has 323 pixels per inch as opposed to 216 for the HD. Apparently 107 pixels per inch is enough to bring a device from high definition into extreme high definition.Whatever the numbers really mean doesn't mean a whole lot to most people. This screen is dazzling and it will not disappoint you.StorageA 16 gig HDD isn't too terrible for something that costs $229. The main issue here is that if you intend to use the feature allowing you to store 1080p movies then those 16 gigabytes will fill up rather quickly. It is also apparent that the operating system and support software will also take up a portion of that 16 gigabytes. As with nearly all devices of this type one can assume that it is likely that you will never be able to increase the size of this hard drive.Form FactorKindle Fires have always been build like a tank. They were able to take a beating and are more difficult to crack than other screen-based items. Unfortunately, this comes with the price that the Kindle Fire was rather bulky and clunky. This time around we get a nice slim device that also seems durable. It is comfortable to hold in your hand without feeling cheap. The width went from 0.9 inches to 0.6 inches (33% thinner!) and the weight went from .86 pounds to .66 pounds.New Operating systemRecently, the Kindle Fire operating system has started to become a bit more difficult to use. Things seems to be a little bit less user friendly, though it did have a lot more features. I got to see an older generation in my family struggle when the OS got an upgrade for the Kindle Fire HD.The New Operating System is called Mojito and it is based on androids JellyBean. This feels more iterative than a revamp but some things about it definitely work. You still have the carousel with Mojito, but you can view more apps at once which definitely makes this feature more usable. Silk now feels like something I might actually want to use. I feel that this has has the biggest upgrade with the new operating system. The Keyboard here feels much smoother and pages definitely seem to have loaded faster (though i guess i should thank the increased specs for that one). This is also helped along by the fact that the touch screen is far more accurate. I can't be certain of who to thank but this is definitely a smoother, more pleasurable experience.New FeaturesAs we know there are many things to like about amazons Kindle. People can go back and forth comparing the size, quality, and price of this item to that of an iPad. Here are a few argument winners that will help to sway people into the Amazon ecosystem.Prime Viewing...now watch Prime without internetYou will now be able to download amazon prime content directly to the hard drive of your Kindle. This means you can enjoy a long car trip or a plane ride without using 3G service. This is a great upgrade and truly has this item stand apart.X-RAY just got better (sorta)Now with X-RAY you can bring up imdb.com information on people that have just come into the screen. This is partly and old feature but it will become new again with trivia. This is just the trivia that is already provided on the imdb.com website, but it is a fun addition. There are also instances where you can follow certain lyrics line by line. At the time of the review I have yet to try out this feature.The idea of adding more to X-RAY is nice. Anything that makes watching a movie more immerse is a good thing. Unfortunately, this kinda feels like something that you will forget about very quickly. Though, there is a push for this kind of content nowadays (SmartGlass) so maybe it could become something we all naturally all use, time will tell i supposeMaydayTo me, this is the thing that really drew my attention.  This is definitely something that is meant to be used by my parents but it gives a warm to the product. A savy electronics user may never need to use Mayday in order to find out where the home button is but it would be fantastic if this type of feature is forever integrated into devices by other companies. Hopefully, this free service will be a game-changer for customer service.Why Only Four Stars? (small drawbacks)The new Kindle Fire HDX is a fantastic piece of hardware. It is light, beautiful, and fast. Unfortunately, this device feels as locked down as previous Kindle Fire models.The the entire Kindle Fire line boasts that it is compatible with 80,000 apps. This number looks really high but there are nearly 10x as many apps on the android store that are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. Kindle items are Android devices of sorts, why can't they run every app available?In addition to this there still does not seem to be any way to create your own home screen wallpaper. I have seen with previous devices that even with the ads turned off you still cannot choose your own home screen. The images they have provided are stunning, yet there is no customization. There should at least be a way to set your home screen to reflect the image of the book you have most recently read.Holding the device is wonderful, it is light and the face of the device is beautiful. The back has a rubber touch to it and the side has a nice angle to it. The power button and the volume rocker are on this angled surface which is nice, but it's not entirely impossible to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. One thing that is curious to me is that the speakers have been moved to the back. They have a nicer speaker set this time around but it seems unusual to me to be projecting that backward. In addition to this is seems possible to me that some people might naturally want to hold the device with their fingers covering these speaker holes. Clearly, these are minor issues that may not amount to much once you get accustomed to it.If you have come to this page looking for a way to figure out if you should get the 7\" or the 8.9\" I have one insight for you. I have never held the 8.9\" but one instant difference is that the larger device has a rear facing camera. This wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but i thought it might be important to note this.These few issues are very petty and, in the long run, they are insignificant.

Being a Prime member since 2005, I am totally Amazon oriented...music, books, movies.  The Fire is the perfect tablet for me.  Don't even care about the rest. Comparing brands and models are moot. I've owned all three generations and look forward to next years. I know I'll get one.  (I read on a Paperwhite. Only way to read in my opinion.)Anyway, now the beef. Prime downloading!  Amazon is the ONLY service allowing the DOWNLOADING of none owned content. Amazing! Give me 64GB (53.7GB available to user). Ahhh, now the TRUTH...ONLY TWO MOVIES OR EPISODE at a time. If Amazon had come out and said that...been honest...I wouldn't need 64GB.I know, I'm 65, been around the block a few times. Been fooled even more. The marketing guys got me again.  I just wish Amazon would tell the real truth once in a while.  Like the Lending Library.  One book a month, twelve books a year. I appreciate the 12 free reads but it would have been nice to know the TRUTH in the ad. It just irks me.I love my wife and I love Amazon.  (My wife a lot more, naturally.)  They both keep the truth from me at times.  At least I can get back at my wife!Amazon is striving to be the most customer oriented company and is pretty close to making it.

After a 40 min conversation with amazon, they are sending me a new fire with 2 day shipping.  A little disappointed about them not expediting it with one day...I mean I was seriously like a little kid at Christmas playing with it non-stop, it was/is a great improved experience when comparing to my 1st gen.

Thankfully there's multiple downloading options that could make the great HD 3GB video into a fine 720 experience making this same file at around 1GB.My advise...  1) Wait for another promotion Christmas is around  the bend and I would be surprised if they don't offer  another 15% day.  2) Splurge on the highest storage that you will need (compared to apples storage upgrade cost 599 for a 64GB mini Ipad when after tax mine was 278 with the 15% discount ($356 difference including sales tax)  3) If you have rewards with a Credit card use them (makes me feel better when making purchases like these with \"free money\"  4) Pretty much accept the fact that for the next week or two after you receive your kindle (If its not a dud) your mind will be blown and you will have no life other than with your new fireThat's all for now....and that's my 2 cents...if your on the fence try it...with amazon prime its AMAZINGoh and I forgot #5)...If you cant stop drinking the apple juice why bother buying the hxd and then posting a 1 star review because its not an ipad...its meant to be a media device and really excels at this...seriously if you fit into this category Stop it, its annoying and that's being really kind at bestHave fun, be kind and enjoy life :-)", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Not So Great An E-Reader", "Author": "Makeever \"mackeever\"", "ReviewID": "R15B5Y73FOZHTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In comparing this to my 2012 Kindle Fire HD: it's a much faster and better tablet, but I was disappointed in the e-reader.

This is the first time that I have been unhappy with my purchase.I traded in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 in order to \"upgrade\" to this model only to learn that the key feature that made me love the Kindle Fire so much has been removed by Amazon. Previously, you had the option to enable text to speech within just about any Kindle Book. It was quite convenient to click on the \"play\" button while in a book and hear the device read to you as your eyes move down the page. Quite an immersive experience! To take it a step further, you had the option to purchase the professionally narrated audio book (if available for the title) and take the experience to a whole 'nother level. Now, the only option is to purchase the audiobook to enjoy the same functionality. In the interest of full disclosure, with the HDX, you have the ability to turn on text to speech from the system settings, but then the Kindle reads EVERYTHING that displays on any screen, meaning websites, menu settings, etc. That is extremely annoying!One other thing that really bothered me was the screen issue that many are reporting. The entire edge of the screen was brighter than the rest making for a distracting reading experience when in a book.I ended up returning the HDX and buying another HD 8.9.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "don't buy it", "Author": "Ian Eppard", "ReviewID": "R3HGXQS0IC3YZ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The commercial says all this stuff about how it's better than the iPad air.

Faster, smoother and better than earlier versions", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "RALWCKMXLE1DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Each generation of the Kindle Fire 7\" tablet gets better than the previous iteration, and this one is no exception. It is not revolutionary, the way that the 1st generation Kindle Fire was when it was introduced in September 2011, but it's a great example of good product evolution.Picked up the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" during one of the December promotions after seeing the 'Try Risk Free' sidebars on the product page. Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:\u25c6 Likes:+ Excellent 7\" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10\u00bd ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences\u25c6 On the Fence:\u00b1 Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to\u25c6 Dislikes:- None encountered\u25c6 Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7\" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10\u00bd ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.\u25c6 In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.\u25c6 Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.\u25c6 Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.\u25c6 Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.\u25c6 Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW \u25aa 12/31/2013", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service Experience of My Life", "Author": "Jeffrey hubbard", "ReviewID": "R3DY6GOGW9WK5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After spending the extra money on 2 day shipping and being assured by the customer service rep that the product will arrive in two days I ordered the product... flash forward to five days later the product finally arrived, but that is where my real troubles began. The kindle refused to turn on when I hit the power button so I held the power button nothing. I tapped the power button a couple times not response I held it again, so on and so forth for about 5 minutes until it sprang to life and relief flooded across my body. This relief was short lived through because only 10 minutes into having the product on after going through all of the initial set up the screen went blank. I called up kindle support and was transferred around about 3 times before I found someone remotely competent. They went through some steps and determined that my brand new out of the box Kindle was broken already! they said they were going to express ship the product. When the shipping information appeared on my account it said that it would be shipped in 4 business days, I don't know about you but 4 days is about double what should be considered express shipping. But I patiently waited, on the 4th day when it hadn't arrived I called the shipping company and they explained the estimate was wrong and it will be taking 5 business days to receive the product which just added to my excitement. When the product finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it turned on much more easily. Well pleasantly surprised until I tried to register my device. When I tried it would not let me register it, yet again I wade neck deep into the sea of incompetence that is Amazon customer service to find out that because they do not know how to properly ship a product and it took longer than 2 days to be received they went out and on their own reported it lost or stolen which is essence bricked my kindle. the process of reversing the problem took over an hour and was the worst hassle on the phone I have ever had.

The design, the weight, the very easy and straightforward UI, and the reading experience. When you pick up the device for the first time  it feels really solid and not too heavy like the Kindle fire HD did. The software and user interface is really smooth and doesn't stutter. Unlike android tablets I didn't feel overwhelmed at all and it's just extremely easy to grasp and navigate. Without the official cover, I found the back buttons confusing to use, and even then it wasn't much better because it was annoying to reach behind the flap and press on the button I needed every time. Here are my other thoughts on this device:ReadingThe reading experience is really great, but just keep in mind that the borders of the screen have a light blue hue to it, which is apparently normal and didn't annoy me. Super crisp text, different fonts, different highlighted colors and the text to speech voice along with buying audiobooks to read along is great. As a matter of fact, I put the device to sleep and had it read me a number of books a few times. The text to speech feels really natural and I would imagine this being a selling point for some since the e-ink readers no longer provide this feature. The only issue I have right now is that it doesn't provide collections like the iOS app does, but from what I understand it's coming in a future update.Video/audioThe videos look and sound fantastic, and the stereo speakers are good enough to the point where I don't even need to use my Jambox blueooth speaker like I did for my iPads. Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and even the CW app (I'm addicted to this show called the The Tomorrow People) are all there. Now, if you're a youtube fan DO NOT expect a good experience for this because it's currently only done on the mobile web. The pictures on the Kindle Fire HDX page show an integrated app, so that's either incorrect or I'm guessing it's not complete yet. The mobile web is not a great experience because you can't easily view your favorites and it's just not as good as using a native app. And sideloading (which I'll talk more about later) the app doesn't let you log into youtube because the logon needs to work with a unmodified Android UI device.Web BrowsingIt's very fast and smooth, but i t only lets you have about 5 tabs at once. This is the first Amazon Silk browser that's given me a good experience to the point where I didn't think I needed to sideload a faster browser. I like how you can default it to pick to load either a full webpage or mobile site. This is great for casual browsing but I'm a big tab and web surfer so I really would've preferred using chrome and all my saved bookmarks there.AppsIf you don't have any specific app you need in mind then the selection is pretty good. It has a lot of the major ones out there but some of the ones missing in the amazon app store like dropbox and instagram aren't there. You can however sideload them :) The games run super smooth on this device thanks to the state of the art Snapdragon 800 processor but don't expect any big android game launches to appear on this device right away. The last big one is Dead Trigger 2 which still hasn't appeared in the amazon app store yet.Battery lifeLike my previous generation Kindle Fires, not good at all in my experience. It charges a lot faster than the older generations, but I average about maybe 5ish hours for this device, and that's with either no or occasional video. I never had this issue with my iPads, but I always feel like I'm charging the Kindle Fires more than I'm using them.Final thoughts and opinionsNotice how I mentioned sideload a few times in this review. I honestly think if you want to take full advantage of what the tablet offers (and tinker around with it), then this might not be for you. It's designed (and designed to make money off of) for people who only stick to the amazon ecosystem and do a fair amount of reading. As much as I enjoyed using the device, I realized that the Nexus  7 would be a better fit for my needs. I can do without the text to speech and settle for a 3rd rate Kindle reading experience (it's much better on iOS) where I can't change the text, do X-ray or view popular highlights. I do have a Paperwhite so I'm fine without having this on my tablet. I guess the more I used my HDX, the less I was interesting in reading because it was able to do so much more than that. I returned my HDX today for the Nexus 7 and even though it's a bit more underpowered, I'm happy with owning an Android tablet that gives me full access to android apps via the play store. For everyone else, this is a great purchase anyone who doesn't mind the amazon ecosystem and loves shopping on amazon while taking advantage of their prime membership.

I was bored of Apple (I have an iPhone and MacBook that I love but still...) and I didn't want just a tiny computer. I wanted something that was an entity all on its own. Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at. It has a great design, easy to hold for both adult and child, the sound is clear and great, it's super fast, I enjoy the silk browser, it is easy to use (if you are familiar with modern technology), we have been using it like crazy for a week now and there's isn't a single fault we can find. My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle. Kindle is also a major name so everything already (for the most part) has kindle compatibility. I really can't say it enough: I love our kindle. It's perfect and amazing and just what I wanted.

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional quality and out of the box true plug and play.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.

I read on my device a lot and it is very noticeable (and I feel quite distracting) in both the black-on-white and brown-on-sepia settings.  On my device the bleed is noticeable all the way around and is wider on the long sides (measures about 1/4 of an inch) but thinner (about 1/8 of an inch) on the short sides.  I used the Mayday button (which is a really nifty feature, by the way) and was told that this was normal and that there was nothing I could do about it.  I find this pretty disappointing, but it isn't a deal-breaker for me - I'm not going to reject it and return it for a refund due to the blue haze issue (though if they manage to come up with some sort of update that would fix/improve it, I'd be the first to get that update!).That said, I'd still recommend this tablet to people - particularly if they use it more for non-reading activities.

The new processor is extremely snappy and executes loading and running apps very fast. I have no issue with the blue haze issue on the edge of the display. I understand the reasons for the blue LED use and accept Amazons explanation. It is a non issue, really. I read quite a bit on the Kindle HDX on a plain white screen then a sepia screen and was not distracted. Again, it is on the very edges where no text appears. It is nonexistent on videos, dark backgrounds, etc. I did try the Mayday function with a question and it was promptly answered and frankly, this is a really progressive implementation of customer service/tech support. Very nice job Amazon. The curated appstore is obviously not as complete as Google Play but has anything important and then some. I do not feel the need to sideload apps whatsoever. The essentials are more than covered and then some. For the record I also own the Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen and think these are two great devices. I'm fully invested in the Amazon ecosystem with books, MP3's, apps and videos and like having a dedicated device. The Nexus 7 can do all the same things by running Amazon Apps except there is no App for Amazon Instant Video. The IOS (ipad, iphone) has such an app, but not android. All told I have the best of both worlds and didn't break the bank to do so. If you are on the fence I don't think you can lose either way. The biggest differences are No Google Play on the Fire HDX, and no Amazon Instant Video on the Nexus 7. Faster quad core processor on the Fire HDX and brighter screen on the Nexus 7. There is a sense of community with Amazon that is really an intangible and keeps me loyal to this company.

It came in a cushioned mailing envelope and the kindle was sliding around inside.  I thought that was kind of a cheesy way to ship a $300.00 device, and I was happy to see that yesterday when my new one arrived it came in a very well cushioned sturdy box which I appreciated a lot more than the cheesy cushioned envelope the first one came in.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the issues I was having were due to the kindle being banged around by ups personnel playing football with it.  As usual Amazon was very cooperative and they rushed me another one in a couple of days.  I received the new one yesterday, and I still see the blue haze around the page, but like I said that doesn't bother me.  I usually read with the black backdrop and white letters in any case.  Everything else on this one is running smoothly so far, but it's on probation.  I'm giving it 5 stars because so far everything on it works like it's supposed to.  I used the mayday function on it a couple of times and it only took a few seconds for a live video of the tech to pop up on my screen which I found pretty cool and very helpful.  So far I find it to be a 5 star device, but like I said, I'm going to give it a month and see if I have to come back and change my review or not.  I'm hoping not because I really like it, and hope it stays like it is.  The high definition is amazing, and so far the only thing I haven't tried is the Skype function due to the fact that I don't feel like blowing more money on something I really don't need because you have to purchase time with them like you would with a cell phone company.  Something to consider maybe in the future.  I opted for the one with the ads but they don't bother me in the least, and you only see them when you are turning your device on.  I also have the one with the 64 gbs which is a definite improvement over my first generation kindle which this one is replacing.Overall I think it's a great device, and I've checked out ipads, and I'm glad I've got this instead of one of the overpriced super hyped ipads.  You're on probation kindle HDX until the 22nd of November!  Ok, here it is November 7th, and I've had my new kindle now for a while and I just thought I'd come back and add something I don't like about it.  I thought of subtracting a star because of these two reasons, but the good outweigh the bad (at least in my opinion) and here are the two reasons why I almost subtracted a star:First there is no light indicating when your kindle is fully charged.  You have to turn your kindle on to see if it's finished charging.  Why get rid of the light indicator?  Did it really take up that much space?Second: Why are the speakers in the back and not in the front?  It sounds a hell of a lot better when you turn your kindle backwards and listen to it.  Then you can't see the video.  Come on Amazon!  You've made a killer device and it could have been a lot better by adding a charge indicator light and moving the speakers to where they should be!  I'm leaving it at 5 stars because everything else is awesome!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "OUTSTANDING!!!!", "Author": "golfman", "ReviewID": "R20SXWCGU2L3US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Kindle Fire owner since they were first introduced, and as pleased as I am with my Fire, I thought when I read the introduction email about the HDX that it offered many upgrades that sounded great.

Also by limiting the apps you can install from a lot of developers they limit the use of it; this renders the Kindle useless for the work environment. And there are plenty of fun apps that cannot be installed.

(My first one was noticeable to the people around me though). The second Kindle the battery stopped holding a charge.I have to say I was very excited and looked forward to receiving my first Kindle HDX, but sad to say I was very disappointed as Amazon markets the Kindle as being able to hold it's own in the working environment, but it does not.

I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Front Facing Camera", "Author": "SLC \"SLC\"", "ReviewID": "R3I1VMT9JJ6K45", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would never have thought to check if it had a front facing camera, my ancient flip phone had one.

I wanted to experience Android - and this Kindle is Android with Amazon's \"skin\" on top.  I considered a Nexus 7, but customer feedback worried me about it being possibly too fragile.  Price on the Kindle HDX was hard to beat - and the features -screen, and CPU and memory are front-line.What prompted me to write a review?  I bought the Kindle 16GB, WIFI only version- and have been using it about 4 weeks. Tonight I set my 4G iPhone up as a Personal Hotspot - and hooked up my Kindle to the Internet, using the Apple iPhone's WIFI broadcast.  Speedtest showed the Kindle at 5.79 Mbps download, and 10.57 Mbps upload -I was very surprised at the speed it achieved and that upload measured faster down download!Tonight, I also started Pandora, and synced the Kindle to a little bluetooth wireless speaker, and got some great sound.  The Kindle's internal speakers are good on their own (and 2x better than the Nexus 7 if you listen to them side-by-side).  I've found all of the apps I've wanted (Evernote, myfitnesspal, flipboard, feedly, skydrive, zillow, lastpass, and others in the Amazon store -I also sideloaded a couple of apps, a virus checker and maybe 3 or 4 other apps - can't remember which ones right now).  Tried Google Chrome on the Kindle, and I find that it really isn't any more stable (in my experience) than is Silk.  Synced all of my e-mail contacts in from Google to my Kindle Contacts app, and also synced all of my Google calendar entries (from Google/iOS) to a Kindle app called CalenGoo - which seem to be working to keep everything in sync both ways.  Photos I take with my iPhone are synced into the Kindle and can be viewed or edited, and they even show up in a subdirectory on my PC in the Amazon Cloud Drive. Music uploads into the Amazon Cloud have been difficult - only 1 music directory (artist) at a time (from iTunes) - something I haven't finished struggling with.  I agree there is a very faint, light blue border (mainly on the left and right side) on white pages.  If you look you see it, but it is barely noticeable, and to me at least, not the least bit distracting.  I just don't ever notice it to the extent that I remember it  - I just don't \"see\" it unless I go look for it. Its not a defect, just part of the screen illumination design.This review has been all over the place - but I just wanted to give people a hint of what is possible (and there is a lot more I'm sure). I've had a few small glitches  Sometimes the browser (either Silk or Chrome - seems too sensitive and wants to open any sidebar advertisement that I happen to slightly touch.  Scrolling can be either too fast, or sometimes just right.  I can't find a quick way to jump to the top of the screen as I can in iOS.

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX.

The Ipad has a good track record but I was looking for a small productive powerhouse tablet under $300. It is being debated weather the Apple A7 in the new Ipad mini is faster then the Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330. The price range of the new Ipad mini was a tad to high for me.The Nexus 7 2013 is the Hdx's adversary. Most of the spec's are similar like the screen and battery life. The deal breaker for me was the Hdx had a better processor chipset and build quality. I had the 1st gen Nexus 7 before and loved the power for the price but the Nexus had a defect after a couple of weeks and had broken parts rattle inside the tablet. Later on the screen became unresponsive. I was able to return it for a full refund. I heard from many people that the build quality of Amazon's Fire tablets were good. And so I was swayed.Here is a list of pro and con's the Hdx 7\" has:Pro's:-Fastest tablet on the market (Snapdragon 800 + Adreno 330) (exception. the debated Apple A7 chip)!-High Def screen with high ppi-Acceptable battery life-Excellent build quality!-Simple user interface-Good customer support with Mayday-Aggressive and competitive price point!-I almost forgot, THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING I never heard speakers on a tablet / laptop / phone this good! Amazing, no doubt.Con's:-Amazon's app store is lacking supporters*-Bulky user interface for some, including me**-No Google support-Screen blue haze (not a very large issue)****There is a way to install android app's other then Amazon's App store. By downloading android .apk's with a usb or by downloading it from the web browser then using the file manager to install them. Most apps work, some do not.**I am not a fan of the user interface. It is simple and it works but has little room for customization. As soon as a root and rom comes out, I'm going for it! Then I'll be able to give this review 5 stars!***People report blue haze around the border of the screen, my screen has so little haze it's not noticeable unless I have a white background and the brightness high.

This is a top tier Tablet and I believe the HDX line of tablets sets its place well in the top 3 tablets for 2013!

I  started watching a nature documentary and was transfixed. Movies, tv shows, games, everything looked great on this device.The device was lightweight, had a fast processor and decent memory. I bought the 64GB but they should have made a 128GB since a single 1080p movie with dolby surround took up 9.5-10.3GB when downloaded from my amazon account. You only get 54 GB to start with because of the operating system and whatever else they put on.I could download Prime TV shows to watch offline when travelling, a great feature! The website said you could download Prime movies as well, but I could not find any that gave me the download option.The device came with a charging block (unlike the fire hd I bought last year).It was for these reasons I gave the unit 2 starts and not just 1. Keep reading to find out why!Second, the not so good:When you plug in the charging cord and the headphone, they are not flat and parallel with the unit. They stick up at about a 15 degree angle. Not a big deal, but it made me nervous in case someone accidentally set something on top of it while it was on the counter or desk. I think the damage would be catastrophic to the unit if that happened.The battery life is not great. This unit sucks down the battery faster than my fire hd does.Lastly, the terrible:I received the unit and spent the day loading it with videos and goodies for an upcoming trip. The last thing I did was sit down to watch a movie I bought specifically to watch on this unit's screen. I noticed a static buzz underneath the soundtrack that was annoying. I experimented until I found that the buzz was happening everytime the unit accessed the internet. Since the movie in question was streaming, the buzz was constant. I tried a downloaded movie, no buzz. I tried surfing the web with nothing on and everytime I clicked a new link, the buzz would be there until the new page was done loading. So, I called Amazon and they sent out a new unit (recieved the next day, thank you Amazon!).The new unit did the same thing. I tried some more experiments and found the buzzing happened with all my ear buds (cheap ones and expensive ones) and did NOT happen with my headphones (both cheap and expensive were clear sounding). The rest of the unit was so cool, I figured I could work around this even though the only reason I have expensive ear buds is to travel with my fire hd. So, I spent another day dowloading tv shows and other goodies to prepare for my trip. I was sitting reading a book and downloading a movie when the unit flashed a warning that I had used up 90% of the storage and did I want to delete something. I clicked no and the unit shut off. I knew the battery was a little low so I plugged in the unit for 20-30 minutes. I tried restarting the unit and nothing. I held down the on/off button for 20 seconds like the website said to and got a brief \"Kindle Fire\" screen flash but nothing else. I called tech support and we basically tried the same thing again and the tech said that they could replace the unit, again.So, I am sending this unit back and getting a refund.

The original Kindle fire worked great and did what we wanted. While we have all the \"i\" devices from Apple, the footprint of the kindle was easier to deal with and overall it was a great product.The two HDX however have caused me nothing but frustration. One has FreeTime for my 6 year old, and the other doesn't. Let me go down some of the issues that have annoyed me greatly:#1 - The Kindle for my daughter has issues with staying connected to WiFi. It will drop connection and go into a constant state of searching for an access point. There are a total of 6 access points in my house, overkill yes, but I'm an IT guy... just goes with the territory. Going Airplane mode, Turning on & off WiFi, etc does not work. Only a full powercycle fixes the issue.#2 - FreeTime REQUIRES a password, and the only way to get to some of the kids apps is going into FreeTime. I trust my child, she is very mature for her age, she doesn't NEED a password MANDATED by Amazon. This is simply an annoyance and should be the choice of the parent.#3 - The Kindle with FreeTime also WILL NOT allow applications to be used when outside of WiFi range. It gives an Internal Service Error when trying any application in or out of FreeTime. I've researched the forums and this is a known issue which has not been adequately addressed by Amazon. I have tried every one of the suggestions, flushing the cache on the AppStore service (and one other, can't remember the name), deregistering & reregistering, reloading completely. I'm not sure what they have done to tie every app access to the app store, but this is a huge flaw and only seems to happen on Kindles with FreeTime installed (per review on the forums).#4 - Total Lockout of Google Store/Google Framework - Due to the 'pissing contest' between Amazon and Google, no Google apps can be installed. While the email app will pull your mail from GMail, you cannot load the actual GMail app, Google Maps, YouTube App, etc. You can force a sideload of an app, but it will be massively hindered because the Google Framework cannot be installed.#5 - Relating to number #4 - NO native YouTube app. My children watch a great deal of YouTube because they love MineCraft. However, because YouTube is a Google product now, they don't play nicely together. I've seen several times responses on the forums from Amazon folks saying to load one of the three third party apps which supports YouTube. Two of these are limited to only their selection of videos and have forced ads which my children don't need, and the third which actually allows access to searching (in a horrible non intuitive way) immediately started throwing up ads for ADULT WEBSITES. Great for the kids, eh?#6 - Also relating to #4, lack of access to the VAST number of Android applications which are available due to lockouts. While you can sideload after unlocking one of the settings, it still reduces the effectiveness of the applications due to their tinkering with parts of Android that truly don't need to be tinkered with.#7 - The 'Carousel' (the gigantic scrollable icons on the screen) is nothing but a history of past applications used. There is no way to keep your favorites in place, there is no EASY way to clear it. If the device was mine I would hate it as a privacy issue. Overall it forces you to use the text menus at the top more than anything else, or the search function to find applications you want to use. I personally just hate the interface.We debated long and hard between going with the mini-iPads, Kindle Fire HDX, or the various Android pads. Now that I have all of these for review, I would lean heavily towards something like my Samsung Galaxy Tab or other pure android device of quality. There are simply too many headaches totally caused by the effort to make this device proprietary and denying applications made by the developer of the OS, Google. Overall I've highly disappointed, this could have been a great product.For the Positives : Great screen, great size, better price than apple products.Once again, love Amazon as a whole... but I've tried to make these work for my family and yet my children run and get their 2 year old iPods which have tiny screens just to avoid using these.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely exceeded expectations.", "Author": "Frank L.

Kindle fire uses a modified version of google's android and limits you to Amazon's appstore which is mostly a watered down version of google's play store. I would consider this a con but there are some distinct benefits of the amazon app store. The first benefit is that amazon provides you the ability to use their amazon prime streaming service along with the major apps such as netflix, plex, ETC.Kindle Fire hardware- The kindle fire has top of the line hardware for a budget tablet. The quad core snapdragon 800 has great graphics capability along with great multitasking capability. The HDX technically has a better CPU than the 2013 nexus 7 and a much better CPU than the galaxy series. The screen has great colors and decent brightness with pretty decent viewing angles.Kindle fire battery life- I believe that the kindle fire battery life is subpar when compared to my nexus 7 and my wife's ipad mini. I typically get about 6-7 hours of streaming video whereas I get about 10 hours with my nexus 7 and about 11 with the ipad mini.Kindle fire durability-  The kindle fire is the only tablet that I've ever had a cracked screen with. The screen cracked just towards the edge because I stepped on it. I don't know if this is because I'm a fat bastard or because the screen is abnormally weak. I believe it was a combination of my fat bastard qualities as well as the thinner screen. I have dropped my other tablets and I have stepped on my nexus 7 and slatebook before and they haven't broken yet.Value- No doubt the HDX has great value. The hardware and software are top notch.Which should I choose- If you are a big google supporter then I would recommend a nexus 7 or a samsung tablet. If you are strictly using it for media such as netflix and amazon prime, no doubt you should choose the kindle fire HDX.all in all the tablet is great but there are some limitations which may or may not be the deal breaker. The reason I bought it was to use amazon prime instant streaming so that I didn't have to download flash on my nexus 7.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this tablet!", "Author": "Macy Banton", "ReviewID": "R2UUCOOFX42R5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I should say that I have very limited experience with tablets. Having received an HP Slate (Microsoft based tablet) at work, which I was allowed to keep when they replaced the HP's with Apple iPads (which I used for about a year).I wasn't even in the market for a tablet, but I had purchased a mobile hotspot plan through my wireless carrier (the hotspot was free with a 2 year contract) and was offered $100 off any tablet as a promotion for purchasing the hotspot plan.I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and am certainly glad I did. The Kindle performs flawlessly. It has a great picture - perfect for watching MLB TV games, offers a number of fantastic apps. (I especially enjoy my talking Bible, as well as many Bible trivia/quiz apps, and Hangman).I love the Kindle library choices and also love the fact that my Kindle can read my books to me. The Kindle HDX 7 also features excellent sound, so much so that I have yet had to use my external speaker.I find the HBX 7 the perfect size for carrying around - it is light, compact, and the controls are very intuative. The only thing I was disappointed about is that the Speaktoit Assistant app is not (yet?) available for the Kindle Fire HDX. I have this app on my smartphone and find it very useful.I have on occassion used the MayDay button, and found the customer service reps. & tech support people very helpful.I should mention that my wife has the previous generation Kindle Fire HD 7 which has also performed flawlessly, and my daughter has a Google Nexus 7\" tablet by Asus - which is also a fine tablet, however IMO not quite as well thought-out as the Kindles are. In fact for my needs I prefer the Kindle HDX Fire over the i-Pad, it's that good.I originally was going to use a case with a keyboard for my Kindle, but found that the touch keyboard performs flawlessly & there is no need for an external keyboard. (In comparison the touchpad keyboard on my HP Slate does not perform anywhere near as well as the Kindle's), and with the HP, I use a small external keyboard.I've owned my Kindle Fire HDX 7 for 4 months now and find it does everything I would expect it to do and more. I am surprised at how quick this little dynamo is. Kudos to Amazon for making such a wonderful little tablet. I should also mention that it has excellent battery life compared to the other tablets I have owner and/or used.I'm a completely satisfied customer, and keep Bibles and Bible Handbooks as well as a few other books in my Kindle library, and find it wonderful to be able to store all of  these on such a small tablet.

The mobile data appealed to me.Soon after I bought this device, I had an issue with an invalid SIM card. I worked together with both Amazon and AT&T; (the service provider for my 4G LTE). It was determined that the device's sim card reader was broken and the entire device needed to be replaced. I had to buy another device. I was given a discount on the condition that I send the old device back. I complied, therefore spending about $600 for the device.Now I have the new device. The sim card only works part of the time. I have to frequently reboot the device in order to get the sim card to work. Also, the Wi-Fi also stops working at times as well. I would have sent this device back for a refund, but I would have only gotten part of my money back. Therefore, I am now stuck with a device that does not serve the purpose for which I bought it.I have become accustomed to using the Kindle Fire product line, so I am not familiar with Apple's products and their effectiveness. However, considering the fact that I have now spent well more than anticipated for a device with mediocre network capability (at best), I believe that an iPad would be the better choice.If you are looking to use this device primarily offline, it is wonderful. It has a fairly stable operating system, the appstore has grown exponentially since its launch, and the display is beautiful.

I hope that Skype will change the app for Kindle to allow group calls in the future.I have added the spare phone app which allows me to use the Kindle like a phone. This is only possiblewith having already set up a Google Voice account ahead of time. The calls are very clear and are free to anyplace inthe US and Canada.I added Calibre Companion which links to Calibre on a regular desktop so that you can share books between Calibreand the Kindle. I already had many books on the Calibre so moving them was easy with the Calibre companion.I added Adobe Reader which I prefer over the Kindle reader. I added Kingsoft Office which allows me to create documents,presentations, and spreadsheets.I also added Easy Voice Recorder which works well and is easy to use.In also added ES File Explorer, It was suggested as a way to side load apps thatAmazon doesn't offer.I added Espson print plugin to print from the kindle using a wireless printer.I added Drop box.I wanted the Kindle primarily for the ability to communicate using various means such as gmail, skype, phone, google voice etc. Since communication is my primary use of the the kindle that it has a fast operating system is much appreciated.Second I wanted to store e-books and audio files on the Kindle.

It became my little 7 inch companion everywhere I went. I did everything I asked of it with little complaint. I could work with Gmail, Calendar, Gvoice, and Good docs. Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system. I ported my number to gvoice and found it an excellent decision in this world of constant texting slowly replacing talking on a cell phone. All this and play games, rdp into my servers, check stocks, check bank accounts, and track my daily mileage.

Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine. The real odd thing here is that having access to google services on the HDX would not change my spending habits with Amazon.

I'll try to compare it to my brief experience with the Galaxy and my 4+ years with the iPod Touch 4.1.  Speed.  Kindle rivals the iPod. It's 2.2GHz quad-core processor is a speed king. The Galaxy Tab 3 only has a 1.5GHz dual core. You wouldn't think those little numbers would make such a difference, but they do.2.  Ease of Use. Another way the Kindle is similar to the iPod.  The UI for the Kindle is less cluttered and complicated than the Galaxy (and other Android devices I've seen in the stores). I realize the Kindle runs essentially on an Android platform, but Amazon made it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.(As a side note... the Samsung reps inside the store pushed the Galaxy 3 Tab with the following features that the Kindle does NOT have... rear 5MP camera, microSD expandable storage, multi/split window screen accessibility, and screen-mirroring--which would require a $70 device to control your TV with your device. All I can say is that those amazing features don't mean squat if the user experience with the interface is lousy.)3. Size and Feel. The Kindle HDX has a 7\" screen, It's about the same weight as the 8\" Galaxy I originally bought, but the difference is the FEEL.  The beveled edges and thicker casing make it ergonomically-friendly without feeling too bulky. The back has an almost \"rubberized\" feel, so it doesn't slip around in your hands. Here, it outshines the iPod/iPad and the Galaxy, whose backs are slick (metal or plastic), and both are VERY thin.  I found it difficult to hold the 8\" Galaxy in bed comfortably to read, no matter whether it was oriented for landscape or portrait.4. App Availability and Store Navigation.  Here, the iPad would win. Apple is known for its amazing apps, and Android seems to \"catch up\" at best. Not all the apps in the regular Android (now Google Play) Store are available in Kindle's App Store (which are actually Android apps), but the most popular ones are there. I have read about people \"sideloading\" missing apps into their Kindles from other third-party sites, though. If there were an app that I just couldn't live without, it would be worth a try. Kindle's App Store is very easy to navigate. It reminds me a lot of Apple's.  I will say that I like how there is a video preview of many apps in the Google App Store. But sadly, with the Galaxy, I could never get the preview to work.5. Screen Resolution. The Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad with retina display would be pretty close in comparison. The Kindle's colors are vivid, crisp, and sharp. And while some people would argue that the human eye can only process so much, I can say that my 30-something-year-old eyes which need glasses can notice a sizable difference between the Kindle and the Galaxy. The Galaxy's color was nice, but the resolution was not as good, and even my poor eyes could tell.  I can see the \"blue lines\" many people complain about in the new Kindle Fire HDX, but I only notice it on books with white pages (sepia color or night mode is fine), and it is not distracting to me at all. It's not a deal-breaker, and it only seems to show up on the edges.6. Price. The Kindle is the clear winner here. I purchased mine on sale for $199, and the 8\" Galaxy Tab3 was $269. A more comparable 7-inch, 8GB Galaxy was $139, but all the other specs were sub-par (especially the resolution and processor speed). The iPad Mini with retina display is closer in spec comparison, but totes a $399 price (the regular, non-retina iPad Mini is $299).Above all, remember this: If you go to an electronics store, beware of reps from companies inside the store. The Samsung guys were all over the tablet section of my local store like hounds pushing their products. I should have been smarter from the beginning and gone with a clear winner rather than something I knew little about. If you want a tortoise-slow, buggy tablet that will frustrate you in the first day with its failure to load apps or stream videos in a reasonable time frame, try a Samsung or similar Android device. If you want a winner with a smooth interface and a great price point, go with the Kindle. If your money grows on trees and is no object, by all means, buy the iPad Mini. For now, the Kindle is my choice, and I am so glad I returned the overpriced Samsung I tolerated for less than a day.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much for so little!", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3OJUKKVEKI95B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a powerful tablet, just the right size to carry around with you without being too bulky.

I bought this at best buy for $200 and for the price, this tablet can't really be beat! I am absolutely in love with my new kindle fire hdx.Google Play issue:The main complaint for people is that being an android device, it doesn't have access to google play. Ridiculous right? Well, those people are kind of wrong. You can download them at 1mobile as apks and install them, but make sure that you change the settings to allow the apps(apks) to be installed from a non-amazon source. I installed so many apps from the google store available on 1mobile. You can even google them for apks and install them and they will work because this kindle is running on android. For example, i downloaded and ran dropbox without a problem. You can even sideload or root the device for the actual google play store.Speed:Apps open up quickly and the screen also rotates to landscape almost instantaneously. This baby is extremely fast due to the 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, with Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Although sometimes, the app store does lag. Amazon probably needs to improve that aspect. The Silk browser is pretty amazing. Comparable to google chrome I would say. Runs without a a hitch.Comparison of processors:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryMore ram makes the device fast. The quad core is a huge plus. It's like saying 4 brains vs 2. Using 4 brains is obviously more efficient and faster. The processor is definitely nothing to scoff atAudio:Loud, rich sound with earphones. The sound is loud and clear without earphones too. No problem here.Screen:The screen on the kindle fire hdx 7' is extremely beautiful! Probably the best part about the kindle fire hdx. The HD screen provides a beautiful canvas to watch movies on netflix, play games, read manga, go on social media. When i played with the kindle in the store, the screen was just breathtaking. I haven't experienced the blue/purple edge screen thing people have been talking about though.Body:The curved tablet is actually pretty attractive to me. Many people are saying the device is not the best looking one out there, but i think it's beautiful! especially the back! It's so pretty and soft.Pros-beautiful screen-long battery life(~10 hours without watching videos)-runs smoothly than other devices-comparable to ipad in functionality-has access to apps on google play - you just need to look for apks or root it(it's easy!)-easy to hold/very lightweight- Mayday is pretty cool for those who are not tech savvy- the price is bangingCons-ugly carousel that you can't customize-somewhat confusing interface for those who aren't tech savvy-Can't add more memory if you want to - you're stuck with whatever you buy but you can use wifi to store things-no sd card slot to expand memory-the special offers - seriously amazon? We paid for a device but are subjected to ads? BUT These aren't intrusive though so it's not that bad and some of the offers are amazing-Doesn't have awkward size like Nexus 7OVERALL: BUY IT. BUY IT.

I use it for music, games, checking my email, social media, reading, and watching movies on Netflix.

Why would I pay $15 to lose out on saving money??Cons:-Physical buttons placed in slightly strange places if you use the device primarily in portrait mode (I only switch to landscape if a game I'm playing needs it or I'm watching a movie). I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow, the screen and sound are amazing", "Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.  You can get around this by setting up a separate email and amazon account just for children's kindles. but it is a hassle which still requires a credit card, or prepaid visa credit card if you anticipate using any apps.-  Very popular apps are not always available on kindle and this can cause big drama.  Two of our children got Furby Booms and expected to be able to use the Furby Boom App on their Kindle Fire HDX 7s.  The Furby Boom App is NOT available for Kindle Fire HDX.

Although I enjoy and appreciate such things as HAM radio, smart phone, laptop computer, and all Kindles starting with the original e-reader to now the Fire HDX; I am self taught so there will be no sophisticated analysis here. Two years ago I bought the first Kindle Fire and have enjoyed using it however after reading the many reviews over the past year about the Kindle Fire HDX I decided to upgrade.Primarily I use my Kindle for email, listening to the radio, reading, and having the ability to listen to music at the same time.The personal docs is another feature I enjoy as I send my favorite recipes to my Kindle and can easily share them or do my grocery shopping for the ingredients without having to make a list.  I like the lighter in weight, sharp screen with brilliant colors, longer life battery, and better sound quality.  The screen does have less glare, but not as good as the e-reader.The original Kindle fire allowed me to download music directly from Amazon but haven't figured out how to do that with the Kindle HDX, also I had the drop box on the Kindle Fire but am not able to download the app on the new Kindle HDX from the cloud.  I take pictures on my smartphone and they go directly to my laptop computer, and Kindle Fire, and of course stay on my phone; a real convenience.  I am able to go on line to dropbox.com and view my pictures that way, just not as convenient.  Despite those two negatives the Kindle Fire HDX rates five stars for quality and price.One more item, I debated whether to buy the 16 GB or 32 GB; I chose the 16 and if I could do over would choose the 32 GB. I don't download movies but I do like a choice of books and music that will take the bulk of my storage ability.

I'm writing this on my wife's account, and it's really her Fire, but I'm hearing the input she has and it's nothing but praise.Truthfully, if we didn't have some specific things we do with the tablet, we might have gone with another brand; probably a Nexus 7. It turns out, though, that our needs are very specific and they have a lot to do with doing business with Amazon. Here's our list of deal breaker priorities:1. She wants to simply browse the internet while she's sitting and watching TV. Does the Fire come with the best browser? Probably not, but it comes with a very credible one. I looked into it and found that I could install Chrome if she wanted, but she's very happy with Amazon's silk. No need to change browsers.2.She checks her email using her Fire when we're on the road. I usually hog the laptop so she uses the Fire to check email. I bought the fire having no idea that the newer versions have Bluetooth. I checked the Bluetooth against an old Bluetooth mouse and it seems to work great. Now we're considering buying a Bluetooth keyboard for her to use on the road just to use for returning more detailed emails and maybe some minor editing of some of our writing too. This wasn't on the \"deal breaker\" list, or even on the list at all, but it turns out to be a nice bonus.3. Finally, and this is the primary deal breaker because the above two items could be accomplished by any number of tablets. We have a reasonable investment in digital media purchased from Amazon. We really like the way Amazon has things set up with their Unbox program for PCs and so on. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a player for their movies and TV shows on iPad or even other other Android tablets. So for viewing movies and TV shows from Amazon, especially off line like we like to do when we're away from the internet, it's either a Microsoft Surface (using Windows 8 and the Amazon Unbox player) or a Fire. The Surface looks promising, but it's kind of expensive when we have such a small and specific list of needs.I've found that Amazon seems to consistently  sell their media for a bit cheaper than most other sources. I like (trust) their cloud storage, and already have a sizable investment in their products. Given all these factors, it was looking like the new 7\" Fire HDX was a good choice.We have an old 1st generation Fire that she was using for all the above. The Silk browser was pretty quirky and pretty slow but sort of worked. In our home in Angel fire, New Mexico, where we have only satellite internet and really slow latency (long ping times), the Fire was almost unusable.The new Fire is like night and day. It's leaps and bounds better than the old one, and the old one was a good buy when we got it. My wife is pleased as punch with the new Fire for our needs, which admittedly are very specific. We believe there's no reason to spend more money for stuff we don't need and we should buy our products tailored to fit our specific needs. Given that we each have Kindle Paperwhite readers, hundreds of books plus lots of TV shows and movies, and that we've never had a bad experience with Amazon, we're comfortable adding another Fire to our inventory of readers. It's just a great fit for us.As for the old Fire, it's now mine. I don't use it for browsing or email, or even for watching movies although it worked pretty good for that. What I do is send documents over to read offline, usually technical reading I get on the internet related to Photoshop, Wordpress, and a few other topics. I then send those pages and documents over to the Fire to read off line. The Fire - even the old one - is a great tablet for reading documents that are read indoors and have color illustrations, like Photoshop tutorials and so on.So for us, it couldn't have been a better choiceDonald Finkhiddenmesa.com", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi Connectivity", "Author": "John Oldenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2D4NDXAQYOGTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I do not own this particular unit. I purchased the Kindle 8.9 HDX. The reason I am posting here is to perhaps offer assistance to the folks who have given bad ratings because of poor WiFi connectivity and hopefully help out those who are looking to purchase.Shortly after I purchased the original Kindle 8.9 HD I found that turning on the WiFi by turning off Airplane Mode made it hard to connect to many motels WiFi. What I do now is to leave Airplane Mode on and in the wireless settings, turn WiFi on independent of Airplane Mode. In the upper right of the screen you will see the Airplane icon and the active wireless icon.I don't have to do this when at home connecting to my own wireless router but while on the road working, using various hotspots it seems to be the only way to connect easily and maintain the connection. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the way the various hotspots have their routers set up.Hope this helps some of those having issues with WiFi connectivity.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Device is O.K. - Amazon drive to sell content could be better oriented", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2EESNJRO30RCB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a fan of Amazon for it's good customer service that it was my main driver in selecting the Kindle Fire HDX 7 64 GB as my reading / entertainment tablet.The device works o.k, it does crash from time to time but re starts within so 30 s with no problem.My biggest complaint is Amazon's attempt to force you to buy content from them.E.G.  Since before i bought the device i already had paid digital suscriptions to New York Times and FInnancial times but can not enjoy them thru the Kindle app, in order to have the Kindle app you have to buy the subscription from Amazon.Content that is otherwise free in the web is only available at charge on the Kindle Store.Many applications that are free on Google play store are just not available or only available at a charge from the Kindle Store.In some cases you have a strange shortage of apps, e.g. internet browsers, misteriously there is not a chorme or fire fox app, it's either amazon's silk or amazon's silk.Hope Amazon will right this issues and understand that you get top of the list by understanding and servicing your customers NOT limiting their access to content to FORCE them to buy something, i am sure they can do better than that.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple IPAD Slayer", "Author": "Bradford Page", "ReviewID": "R32PYDP7YMPW7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kindle HDX is the most powerful tablet on the market.

It looks beautiful and has a lot of features I enjoy. The quick menu at the bottom of the screen is great for keeping frequently used apps handy yet keeps the carousel uncluttered. I don't remember being able to set a passcode on the HD, which I've done on the HDX. The Mayday button is worth the Kindle's weight in gold. I was having difficulties getting apps I purchased on my desktop to download to the device. Talking to the techs I was able to deregister the device and reregister and all the apps appeared like magic.The loss of one star is for several reasons. I have noticed buggy issues with connectivity, downloading apps (device or desktop purchases), and connections with the tech during a Mayday call. I made 7 calls to get the app issue mentioned above resolved. it wasn't that the techs didn't know what to do (one had just fixed the problem for someone else so knew exactly what to do), it was that after 2-3 minutes the call would automatically disconnect. I did get very good at summing up the problem in as few words as possible but it was very frustrating to have to do it 7 times. At the end of all the calls it asked if the problem was resolved and I kept clicking no. I later learned that's probably held against the tech and felt horrible because they all were so friendly and helpful for the time I talked to them.Another feature I don't care for is the limited number of recommended items. When you have the focus on an item in the carousel, just below it displays suggested items you may also enjoy. On the HD, the list was 8-10 items and on the HDX it's only 4 with an option to See All. A bit clumsier than the old method.Overall, I would purchase this again and again and, if I could afford it, would buy one for everyone I know to ween them from whatever they're using now. Fix the buggy Mayday calls and the weird downloads and it'll bump back up to 5 stars.UPDATE 1/6/14 - I have changed it from 4 to 5 stars, as promised. It seems with a couple of the software updates (automatically taken care of) the bugs mentioned above concerning the downloads have been resolved.

As I mentioned earlier, the stuff advertised about the HDX are all true - including the amazing display, sound etc - so I won't repeat them. I love the device. However, it loses a star because of the distracting bluish/purple haze on the borders when am reading something - be it a web page / Kindle book.

Touch screen is easy to manipulate and calibrated nicely.  So easy to set up, connect all my accounts, downloading all my books from the cloud and set up only took maybe 5 minutes if that.  Sound is crisp, pretty loud for a small tablet.The Bad: Since only owning Apple products, some of my favorite apps aren't available.  I.E. Had to download a basic app for a calculator.  Screen does have a glare (somewhat expected), does smudge (just like my phone does, also expected).  Wifi issues.  Ill preface by saying I'm honestly not sure exactly where the problem is coming from, I have yet to try mayday to get suggestions.  Things aren't loading properly and I'm having to shut off wifi, restart the kindle, turn the wifi back on for it to work.  I've done this 3x today.  I made sure my phone and other wifi devices were working to double check bandwidth issues.  Seems to be working okay.  This will be a deal breaker for me so hopefully mayday can help me.  Lack of customizing you can do does bug me, Id love to see my sons big smiling face on the wallpaper, that is not possible.  Lack of additional memory options, though I knew about that.Overall I think it's a great product for the money.  It does everything I would like it to do.  Most of the negatives I can live without or deal with.  I'll be contacting amazon soon about the Wifi issue and will update this review.*UPDATE* 10/29/2013Wifi issue was a home issue.  We had to change a router to get better wifi distribution with more channels.  Thankfully this is fixed.  Couple other things I've noticed:  The battery take forever to charge.  Not a deal breaker, I charge it overnight but its a little annoying.  Kids Freetime, as I mentioned before my BIGGEST drawer to the HDX...BUT downloading the same apps as my iphone has (free kid apps), in-app purchasing is still there so when his little finger accidentally clicks an ad or \"buy\" buttons, the kindle buy box still pops up, now with 1-click buying I have noticed he has bought a couple things.  This makes the situation worse than it is with the apple appstore because there I have a password.  I for the life of me can't figure out how to turn off 1-click purchasing so that a password box will at least pop up.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Christine L.

I recall having quite a bit of trouble getting that one to sync with my email, whereas this was instantaneous.

I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014.

They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap. You have to have an internet connection to even use it. Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things. But you now need an internet connection to even use it. So my 3yr old has to use they kindle without free time. She is constantly getting error messages and accidentally buying stuff because she hits wrong buttons. I have to watch my bank account very carefully and call Amazon to reverse everything she buys.

I originally bought my kindle so that I could play my amazon instant videos on the go without having to lug my xbox or laptop around.  I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

The specs are great, and I was really thrilled at first, I could sideload apps and the community WAS even able to root, I even HAD live wallpapers.  However, Amazon updates without warning and there is no way to stop updates without losing internet connectivity.  Ultimately, an update broke my device, and even if I had managed to avoid the updates the tablet becomes nearly worthless without internet.  I'm very sorry that I bought from this company when there is another line of devices that would have worked much better for what I wanted and expected.  I wouldn't buy any other Amazon anything, they are worse than apple.  It's my device, I paid for it.  Amazon uses open source software that they get for no cost GNU, Linux, and Android and then they ruin it intentionally to lock in down and limit functionality.  Forcing people to buy from their appstore, stare at ads, and a dull black background.  Many of the apps available from amazon are old versions of apps that I already have paid for and use on my android phone and other devices.  I'm not going to pay again.  Amazon really stabbed us in the back on this one.  I've never had a device that didn't ask first before changing the software not even windows does that unless you op-in and you can always go turn off automatic updates.

The picture show vibrant color and inky blacks.  Plus the stereo speakers are much better than the others.  I have Amazon Prime and if your sole purpose for owning a tablet is to watch movies and shop online at Amazon, then THIS is the tablet for you.  iPad Mini and the Nexus don't compare to this Kindle for these purpose.However, there are downsides that became dealbreakers for me which led me to make the decision to return it.Dealbreaker #1:  The web experience is very sloppy.  It's not as smooth as the iPad Mini.Dealbreaker #2:  The camera quality sucks.  When using Skype, the picture quality is dark and very grainy. And, there's only one camera.Dealbreaker #3:  Your home movies do play on it.  But there is no easy way to rewind or fast forward smoothly.  Again, very sloppy.In the end, if your primary purpose for owning a tablet is to watch streaming movies and shopping online at Amazon, then you can't find anything better than the Kindle Fire HDX.

I've also wanted to upgrade my Kindle Touch, which seemed very slow to me, response-wise. With iPad being pricey the kindle seemed like a natural choice. I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great. Nothing mind blowing, but I didn't buy this to surf the web. The ease of navigation in the Amazon store (be it through the Amazon app or the Bookstore app) is supreme.

When Kindle Fire came out he bought one of those. Loved it. Bought my daughter the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas when they came out (she's not in the home so I don't count hers as being in our home). My husband then bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". He watches videos on it all of the time. Amazon had a special around Super Bowl time so I bought the Kindle Fire HDX with 4G. Love it. It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down. This doesn't bother me because my iPhone and laptops have frozen also. There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation. I would really love to have Adobe Flash because some sites only use Flash for their videos, and one of those sites I pay $$ yearly to watch videos (yoga) but can't on the HDX, but I can on the Kindle Fire HD. I think that it is not Amazon's fault that Flash is not available on the Kindle, it has something to do with Adobe.When I took my new Kindle to Verizon they told me that the Kindle doesn't have 4G. Had to explain that it did. So then the guy tried to connect it - and it worked. He was VERY excited. He was telling all the other associates that Kindle has a 4G tablet. None of them knew. One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great. I've never used another brand, but I have watched others use theirs and I really don't see much difference, except maybe for the apps. And right now I have the apps I use.There is one negative to this device. It doesn't like to charge on any chargers/cables except the \"Kindle\" brand. It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "good tablet, enjoy reading on it, but always room for improvement", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R3PIYIOQB0BC3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so excited to order this tablet. I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

OVERALL 5 stars- wish I could give more. :) Thanks for making such an awesome product with high quality at an affordable price.

I do not think there have been any disappointments with this tablet, but I am finding out daily how truly amazing this thing is.  I believe the most important asset for me is how all the books I bought between my Kindle keyboard and HD Fire, automatically loaded on my HDX, and they were already placled in collections.  I was dissapointed with the Kindle collections app by M. Gallagher because it was painstaking for me to try to categorize all my books (approx. 1,300+), and after getting a little over 200, the Collections app. crashed and had to start from scratch!  Now, I do not have to worry, because I have no backlog and can find my books quickly.I have my Direct TV app on the HDX and I watch TV right from my tablet.  I am legally blind, so this is important to me.  I love TCM Classic Movies, and since many times the words are dubbed, I do not have to jump up and sit right in front of the TV set to read the lines.  Text to speech is improved, and I can go on and on.  The price is amazingly low for what this tablet can do and I have barely scratached the surface.  I understand that I can get a braille keyboard and even more features for those of us who are optically impaired.  The HDX is the fourth (4th) Kindle I have had--2 Keyboards (l was a gift to my sister) 1 Kindle Fire HD, and 1 Kindle HDX.  Each time I received/bought a new Kindle, I have donated the used Kindle to someone who will expand their education and love of reading.I have to add and huge pat on the back to Amazon!

I only mention this because a lot of people don't know they can read Kindle books on their laptop or desktop computer or Android or other devices. ___My favorite feature of the Kindle is the ability to get online and check on stuff such as email, facebook, Google+, various websites and even read USA Today if you want to check on the leading stories.Its size and portability give it an edge over a laptop.  So much easier and handier to carry.Its screen size give it an edge over a smart phone.  Everything is easier to see plus you can enlarge the view by dragging diagonally outwards on the screen.The reason I got the 4G LTE version is that I spend a lot of time where Wi Fi isn't available.  You need the ability to get online when you are out in the field and not at a wi-fi hotspot.-- My personal recommendation is to go with Verizon.  When it comes to 4G  I have found ATT just doesn't cut it in a lot of places. I found this out years ago when I made the mistake of getting a laptop modem that plugged into the USB outlet on the side of my computer.  I had been very happy with a Verizon 3G but thought I would upgrade to an ATT 4G.The ATT laptop modem was very slow...  almost as slow as dial up when it was out in rural areas.  It did OK hooked up to a Wi-Fi hotspot but wasn't worth much when it came to using the ATT wireless network.

(I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.  It\u2019s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.  You must use it the way they want you to and accept their terms or don\u2019t use it.  Imagine buying a TV and not being able to watch certain channels, having automatic ads or commercials come on when you turn the TV on and finally, in order to use the TV you have to accept the fact that they will share the information you watch with certain advertisers.

At first I didn't really like it and felt completely lost on using a lot of functions on it.  I thought seriously about returning it.  I thought I would work with it and if I still hated it when Jan. 31st drew close I would return.Now that I've had time to use it and learn how to use functions on this device I wouldn't want to give it up.  The clarity of the pictures on this is amazing.  It's almost like watching a movie on BluRay.  That is how fantastic I think the picture is.  I am a Prime Member and  I like being able to download Prime movies and taking this with me and watching it at any time.  I can download a kids movie(s) and take it along for the kids to watch while traveling in the car.  I have the WIFI version and I don't have to worry when I am out of range of my WIFI connection.  I couldn't do this with my iPad when using Netflix.  A big  \"Thank You\" to  Amazon Prime & Kindle Fire HDX.I do a lot of reading on my Kindle Paperwhite and I like being able to sync it with this device and I can pick up where I left off on the other device.I did download a free Kindle book that also had Whispersync voice available for free.  Because it was an opportunity to try it for free, I activated the Whispersync Voice.  I was amazed at how easy it was to switch from text to audio and back to text.  Kindle  Fire HDX  keeps perfect track of the furtherest point you have read no matter which function you are using, text or audio.  I can listen to audio on the Kindle Fire HDX and pick up at the point I left off with text on my Kindle Paperwhite.  I think Whispersync Voice is one of the best features there is on this device.As I continue learning how to  use more and more functions on this, the more I love it.Bottom line, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX over any other device I have used.

The rubbery frame is easy to hold, and doesn't feel cheap. The viewing area (reportedly Gorilla glass) is generous and fairly smudge free.Integration with Google apps like gmail, calendar, etc is very easy. My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

My only problem now is finding more great books to read! (For the record I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed these books on my kindle: Night Film (Marisha Pessl), World War Z (Max Brooks), Zone One (Colson Whitehead). I also read an advance copy of my sister's book, which I had read before but enjoyed even more on second reading on the kindle (another excellent tool -- your kindle can convert a PDF into a Kindle doc! So Cool! All you need to do is email the PDF to your kindle email with the word \"CONVERT\" in the subject, and voila! It shows up in your \"Docs\" as a Kindle-version of the PDF which is much easier read and navigated than a PDF). So, in short WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS THING NOW!***I was a little hesitant buying this having been a tried and true Apple fan. First though, I should explain that you REALLY want to buy this without the special offers. It's a little more money, but if you DON'T pay the extra, you see ads on the home screen every time you open up the device. So yeah, pay the extra to get rid of thes ads.As for the device itself, it is FAST. Like, the fastest operating system of anything in our house including my MacBook Pro, iPad or any of our iPhones. I LOVE reading on it too. The screen doesn't make your eyes ache like the iPad, and the text is really easy and clear to read. It is also super duper light weight.The only downside I've seen so far is there is no integration with Chromecast, which would be awesome.Overall though, really impressed with this little device, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps.

I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member.

But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

However, you need to go into buying a kindle HDX with eyes wide open: it is NOT a traditional tablet.  You are signing up for the Amazon ecosystem and the straightjacketing that involves.On the pro side: great price, brutally fast performance, great graphics, excellent selection of apps, books, and content in general.On the con side: no customizing the wallpapers or lock screens, and generally a black box system (short of rooting your system and voiding your warranty, there is little freedom to customize).  The biggest issue I have is no Google play store access.

If you want something n even as versatile as most smartphones, don't buy this.If you're looking for a great value with just about any apps you could reasonably want with fantastic library/ebook features teamed with excellent media player features tied to a nice browser and basic productivity tools, buy this now.Frankly, while I might miss the power user festures of having live wallpapers and custom lock screens - it's not why I got the kindle.  I got it to take advantage of the lending library, Amazon prime (eventually when I feel like taking the $79 annual hit), and the features it does offer.  The HDX isn't a camera or phone or \"I want to be everything\" device like an iPhone or iPad - it's more of an \"I want to be almost everything while remaining useful and not overwhelming\" device.While I've had some disappointing realizations about what the kindle does, I'm rather pleased overall...", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded expectations", "Author": "Paul T.", "ReviewID": "R1HUIWPVQ8ML9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased three HDX for my teen girls and they absolutly love them.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.

Videos loading off of Amazon Prime loaded extremely fast and the ability to download videos from the Amazon Prime Video service for consumption offline is an amazing feature.Despite the slightly angled back this is rather easy to hold onto with one hand comfortably thanks to the smaller overall size (when compared to full size tablets) and it's light weight. The power and volume button being placed on the back is an odd design choice but one that you can get used to rather easily.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.

You can also change the text background in your books for example. you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away. However, I received my kindle today and its already being shipped back. I don't think its a great buy for the price, yes the specs are great however the new Google nexus tablet is the same price for 32gb a frontal and back camera along with HD viewing capabilities. Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things.

Even more than I expected to be.  It is SO easy to purchase and download books, borrow books, etc.  I have owned this for about 6 weeks and am delighted with my purchase.

In my mind this is a major flaw of the Kindle Fires.  I do not want to do a monthly data plan and going to the Verizon/ATT sites showed no such plans for Kindle Fire. Amazon did not think this out or coordinate with these companies before launch. Fortunately life is moving towards more free WiFi spots so this may improve-Settings button no longer in upper right of screen.

The volume is a bit louder (when NOT using earphones) on the HD. The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement. Instead of placing the USB port on the bottom of the HDX (like it is on the HD) it is placed at the top left side which helps when using the carrying case. The HDX is also thinner and lighter than the Fire and HD which make handling easier. The user interface is an improvement also because one now have \"home\" and \"carousel\". Now one can remove an item from the carousel but it still will show up on the bottom of the screen in the \"home\" section.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars. I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks deciding whether I'll become accustomed enough to the blue border to no longer notice it (this is already happening to some extent).", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot borrow audible books from your public library with this kindle. Shame on kindle.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HBMKNEADWKAP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon continues to attempt to make sure you have to buy audible books through their audible store by failing to write the code in this new kindle that would make it compatible with oneclick digital which is the app the public library system uses to provide audible books for free (lends them just like a library book).Now they could include in their description that the app will not work with this particular kindle version but than people might not buy the tablet.  After an hour of being shuffled, disconnected and otherwisw aggravated with \"customer service\" I was told that the app writers would have to change their app to make it compatible.  Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.  It does not take a genius to figure out why  the new hdx was made incompatible.  Shame on you for effectively eliminating many peoples ability to obtain audible content.  As there are many children's books available to lend out this is particularly disgusting.  As a parent would I prefer my kids listen to someome reading a good book or playing games or movies with zero educational benefit?  I wish I hadn't traded in my old kindle which did have the software to work with the app.As I could not return this until Monday I decided to try the tablets other features.  The charging cord and plug that came with the device occasionally says it is the incorrect device to charge rapidly.The picture is nice but the 7 inch is so little that watching movies is not pleasant on the eyes, it gave me a headache holding the device close enough to see.The tablet frequently could not access the internet even though it showed I was connected in the settings.I guess they have to put out a new version yearly but truely unless there is significant technical improvement they should wait.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great performance and value", "Author": "FreeSpirit", "ReviewID": "R30LUQNCS0J30Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY - So far I think the Kindle Fire HDX is a great device given its performance, price point, and some really nice features though it is missing some features that would have been nice to have.1. FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a secure device", "Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.

It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.  I received it as a birthday present ~3 years ago, and sold it last year back to Apple as part of their buyback program.  I liked the iPad, but found it slightly too heavy, wide, and slow (after upgrading iOS).  The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

I was really looking for a smaller tablet that I could carry around in my purse  for email, calendar, facebook, internet etc. and the HDX has surpassed my expectations.  The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.  For the first time I have enjoyed reading books on the HDX, but still prefer my Kindle Paperwhite as my main reading device.  The display is gorgeous and I have enjoyed watching and listening (those little speakers sound awesome and an improvement over the original Fire) to missed episodes of my favorite shows.  I have to admit I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to retrieve my emails or google calendar after reading some of the reviews, but I didn't need to worry because it has worked great!  My kindle calendar, google calendar and the calendar app I use on my iphone have all synced beautifully and no matter what device I schedule on I know that all my devices are updated with the information.  I have had no issues with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivty etc. that I read in previous reviews.I love my Apple products and this is not a comparison between the ipad and Kindle.  I love my ipad, but it was to big and heavy to be transported and for a smaller tablet the Kindle HDX met my needs without breaking the bank (turned out to be bigger bargain with the $50 off deal on Cyber Monday).

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.  At this point I would really like to just return this Kindle HDX and wait until they work all of the bugs out of it and try buying it in about 6 months, but once again, they won't take it back for a refund.

I have to look for it to see it but it's very minor.  To be fair I do not read a lot on this, I use it for movies mostly, so I don't see the haze at all on anything but a stark white background.The buttons on the angled part of the rear are PERFECT for me.  Another thing that seemed to annoy others but it's a vast improvement from the way the buttons were hidden on the HD.  I had to hunt on my old HD for the buttons constantly and it was very frustrating.  The HDX buttons are concave so as to not push them by accident, the placement is perfect for easy use while holding the device.  I have never once turned it off by accident and I hold it from the back all the time.  I can see if you have a case that covers the back of the device that might block access to the buttons but this is not the fault of the Kindle, more of the case designer imo.The screen is beautiful, a definite step up from the HD when viewing them side by side.The audio quality is great with headphones and external speakers.  About the same as the HD.The battery lasts a LONG time (but also takes a while to charge up, even with the 9w charger)The speed of the device is excellent with the new quad core cpu.I had some issues with wifi dropping out from time to time but with the recent update to OS v3.1 that seems to be fixed.  fingers crossed.  I am very happy with the upgrade.  I got the 64G version (coming from the 16G HD) and it's so much nicer having all that space to download movies.  All in all, I was really on the fence about upgrading from the HD but am very happy I did.

There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down. This tablet should honestly be $329 starting like the iPad mini, but Amazon is pricing the tablet to acquire market share and make back money from app, video, book, and Amazon purchases. Even if your not a prime member, you should buy this tablet and become a prime member because it is very worth it. With all the new kindle fire hdx owners, the Amazon prime showcase should expand significantly too as Amazon brings more content to customers.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "flawed devices", "Author": "AmyE \"revuer\"", "ReviewID": "R1IE56NZ6YTA1K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got the Kindle hd  to upgrade/replace the kindle fire that has problems with the charger port..

If I hadn't been a satisfied Amazon customer for the past 15 years I would have returned my tablet and demanded my money back. But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. (It would be extremely helpful if the help files could be downloaded as a PDF) After many calls to Amazon, I was finally transferred to a very unpleasant technician who determined my tablet was defective and sent me a brand new replacement tablet exactly like the one I had. When I asked about all the books and apps I had downloaded into the device he told me they would be in the new tablet when I got it. He lied.......the tablet was empty just like the original, but it was a new replacement so I didn't complain. It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier).  I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite.  Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite \"seems\" to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver.  The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX.  It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening  and occasional viewing needs.  The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch.  So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't \"see\" an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated \"point and shoot\" camera).  But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses.  I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini).  My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops.  Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general.  The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite #1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010).  Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon.  And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line \"User's Manual,\"  for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and \"free\" User's Guide.  Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source.

The HDX does its primary role, that of consuming Amazon prime media (I'm a Prime member) very well.  It's screen is sharp and the color rendering is very good so reading books and watching movies you rent, buy or get free as an Amazon prime member is a very good experience.  Thus, if you can live within that construct I think you will be happy.My problem was I wanted it to do more, and there's where it gets smoked by the admittedly far more expensive but also admittedly far more capable iPad min retina and also the similarly priced Nexus 7.  I found I needed my tablet to do some serious internet surfing, but folks, let's be honest, Silk may have improved over time but it's still arguably the worst browser out there.  It is slow, clunky, and struggles to render accurately many websites I visit.  And yes I did install the Dolphin bowser-not as straight forward a task as I'd hoped-and it's better than Silk but still weak compared to surfing on an iPad mini or a Nexus 7.Then there is the Amazon app market, or lack thereof more accurately.  The apps are poor in their number and often horrendous in their quality when compared to the Apple app store or Google play.  Yes, yes I know you can root the HDX and access Google Play, but if you're going to go to all that trouble why not just buy an equally affordable and very more capable Nexus 7 running stock Android?Finally, I have to say the stability of the Fire OS based on archaic the Android Jelly Bean version the HDX uses is bug ridden and ineptly designed and almost forces you to root it just so you can install an updated Android OS and dump the pitiful carrousel launcher for something far better.So, if you can live within the HDX's limited role of consuming Amazon media I think you will be happy, but the moment you try to go beyond that I think you'll envy anyone with an iPad mini or Nexus 7.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Australian (international version) lacking", "Author": "Vinny", "ReviewID": "R16X1M58ZS7AM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are expecting the Mayday button: Prime: Movies: Share your screen: print functionality (for now) to name a few for Kindles bought through the .au Amazon store then you won't get them.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

It's not flat like the Kindle Fire HD.  The back of it is angled on the sides.  I've had almost every Kindle since the first one came out.  I got this one just to read books, but I find myself using it more than my laptop.  I like the size of it because it's not too big and fits in my purse.  The camera takes pretty good photos.  The on/off button is on the back as well as the volume, so the case I had for my Fire HD doesn't work with it.  The charging port seems to be in a little better location now so the chances of it breaking seem minimal (that's what happened to my Fire)  Although, had I foreseen that I'd use it for more than reading, I would have got the one with 32 gigs instead of 16.

I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device. In contrast, watching the exact same program/movie on Netflix with my iPad - I need head phones unless it's perfectly quiet in the room. With the Kindle HDX whatever I've watched so far, I haven't needed headphones/ear buds.I am also still totally flumuxed by the people who whine and complain about the blue screen edge thing. Seriously, maybe it's like migraine sufferers who see a certain blinking light that affects them because I have absolutely no problem with this \"blue edge\" and never would have even noticed it had not people here complained. You have to really, really look, I have to put my face almost on the screen - take off my glasses - and then I see a very, very faint maybe 1 milimeter sized super light blue rim. I don't get the fuss.The screen is absolutely amazing - it is now my go-to tablet - I carry it around with me all day long in the house or whereever I go. I am currently at my condo in Florida and I can't think of another tablet or device that allows you to read in the Florida sun! If I'm in direct sunlight I just change the background to black and the letters pop.I can't say enough positive things about this device. Below is my earlier review.First let me say I had a Kindle HD prior to this and was hesitant to upgrade because of the reviews specifically about the \"blue hue\" people found while reading (what I have, up to this point, primarily used my Kindle for). Either the Kindle HDX 7 inch 32 Gig, no special offers, WiFi has this problem fixed, or those who complained have some sort of odd sensitivity to blue light. I'm writing this review April 2014 having used my new Kindle HDX for almost a week now and I see barely anything noticeable with regard to this blue hue reading with a white or sepia screen. I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well. I even showed my grown daughter the \"offending\" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen. She said, \"All I see is a page.\" Exactly. That's all I see too. The screen for all other uses is crystal clear, amazingly sharp and one of the reasons I decided to upgrade is because even with an i-BLASON case:  http://www.amazon.com/i-BLASON-Leather-Automatically-Compatible-Warranty/dp/B00EA1PMBW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1397744874&sr;=8-2&keywords;=iblason+case+Kindle+HDX+7+inch  the difference in weight between the HD and HDX is very noticeable. I'm 56 and have arthritic hands and the HDX in the case feels feather-light to me. I can read for hours with little discomfort. Also the light weight is important for me when traveling. I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices. During take-off of a flight - I used to read without a problem because no one knew what it was. Then the airlines went to the \"shut off all electronic devices\" to \"now you may leave your electronic devices on during take-off\" recently. So I have had over a 1/2 dozen Kindles and given over another 1/2 dozen as gifts. This Kindle is the best one so far.I also noticed negative reviews about battery life. I can only use my experience - not sure what the others are using their Kindle for - but I played three back-to-back games of Monopoly - read for twenty minutes, went on-line to check a few things for about another twenty and the battery was at 23%. If you've ever played Monopoly - the games take forever (some games can take at least a few hours), with many animations during each game. I do not find that type of batter drain a problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and the battery drain on that device is much faster than the Kindle Fire HDX. I can only read for an hour or two - do nothing else on the Samsung no less play any games with high graphics and the battery would be at the same level . Compared to the iPad 3rd generation which I also own, I think the battery life of the new Kindle HDX is as good if not better.Amazon had their special offer for Prime Time users so I thought I'd give it a try despite the nay-sayers and I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase and haven't put it down since registering my new device. It is now my new, go-to tablet with the Galaxy taking a back seat to both the Kindle (in 1st place) and iPad.

Not in any way a big deal. As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great. Honestly I would rather view most pictures and videos on my Kindle than my computer or even my TV (well, the TV does have size going for it).  Performance is very quick and smooth most of the time. Silk (the browser) can stumble from time to time but gets going again quickly. No issues with games hanging (and they look beautiful). Wi-fi is good - nothing great but pretty reliable and good range. Battery life is solid. It doesn't last all day with heavy use, but it will keep you entertained for a while. I get 5-6 hours of pretty constant use before I start thinking I need to find the charger (drop below 30% and better safe than sorry). Camera is fine for Skype chats but it's not going to win any awards.  Apps definitely are limited, but if there's something I really need, that's what my phone is for.Overall I think this is a great product, especially for the price (but since Amazon puts them on sale a lot wait for the sales). The specs are top notch on paper and actually match expectations. It's not 100% as smooth as running iOS, but let's face it, tablets are not hard to get the hang of. Only used Mayday once (to test it) but neat service to have available if you really need help. They may not be able to answer down to every detail, but honestly if you're using Mayday you're someone who just needs help with the basics.If you want every single latest app, this isn't for you.

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.

I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy for anyone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CA70OZ41J0W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome holds a great charge for battery easy and simple to use anyone can use it lightweight and fun great buy", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!", "Author": "JASON", "ReviewID": "R24B4JZZ8Y9HRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wife and I both agree way worth our money kindle fire hdx is packed with so much and then some and being a kindle owner and prime member gives 3x more to having a kindle fire hdx and WOW! cant beat the price so glade we didnt go out and get ripped off from another brand of tablet and if you have kids like we do Very kid friendly the speed and graphics and playback  are AWESOME!!!Great Job Amazon!!!!!!", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great display!", "Author": "Allen Weber", "ReviewID": "R216GY6RCJP7GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything works well -- the display and the battery life are exceptional.The only caution I would advise is about the Amazon featured Origami case.

The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.  Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.  I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.  The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary. The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

Also, when I want a book to read, I scan the titles and click on the ones that look interesting to me, but when I go back to the previous page of the list of books, it doesn't take me back to where I was and I have to start scrolling through them again starting at the first one.

This tablet compares favorably to both, but is primarily useful if you are a significant consumer of Amazon products, and particularly if you are an Amazon prime member.\\In terms of design, it is a small, light unit.  It is not quite as thin in the hand as the Nexus 7 (2013) is, but it nevertheless feels very slim and light.  The shape of the device is less oblong than the Nexus, and seems more designed to approximate the Kindle size for book and other text reading, while flipping it to landscape mode provides a more than satisfactory width for movies and other videos.  The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.  The screen is bright and the high resolution is basically the same as that of the Nexus (less than the iPad Air, but that has a bigger screen).The operating system is based on Android but is essentially Amazon's modified version of it.  It is very fast and responsive, and everything is easily accessible with responsive swipes.  Unlike other Android-based tablets, however, you do not have access (directly) to Google Play.  This is because the Kindle is a device that is designed to be used primarily with Amazon-provided content.  If you are a big user of Amazon, and especially a Prime member (and therefore have access to the free prime movies and book lending and so on), this is ideal.  If, however, you are tied heavily into one of the other ecosystems (Apple or Google), then you may find yourself frustrated in terms of having your content (e.g., music) tied to another system.  Note that if you have that music downloaded to a computer, you can upload it into Amazon's cloud and listen to it through the Kindle as well, but that's a few extra steps you may not need to deal with if using a different tablet.The bottom line for me when comparing this tablet to others is that the potential buyer needs to understand (1) what am I going to be looking to use a tablet for and (2) what ecosystem am I tied into already, and to what extent?In my opinion, tablets aren't great for productivity as compared with laptops, but if you are looking for a productivity tablet you're likely best served with something like a Galaxy Note 10 or a Surface.  If, like most people, you use tablets mainly to consume media -- either movies or websites or books/magazines, etc., then it really comes down to what content provider you are most tied in with, because there are limits in terms of being able to access the content of the other providers from each device to some degree.  This applies in particular to people with significant music libraries that may be tied to iTunes at this point (music seems to be where many people stockpile more media than movies which tend to be rented).  Similarly, if you are heavily tied into Google's services (not just Google Play, but the rest of them as well), the Nexus may be more appealing because it directly links into all of them seamlessly.  However, if you are an Amazon content person, and especially an Amazon Prime member, this Kindle is a great device because it similarly links into the Amazon system seamlessly, and is a joy to use with prime movies, books and similar types of content.From my personal perspective, I find this my go-to tablet for content consumption at this point.  I am also tied into the Google ecosystem, but I mostly use my Android phone (or laptop) to interface with that, and view this device as my primary interface with my Amazon content.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "love this game,very addicting", "ReviewID": "R3PC9ALVKW82HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

Normand", "ReviewID": "R2G2ACMRUQ81W8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" with 32GB as a replacement for my old Kindle, which had made its way into my son's bedroom, never to reappear (he is an avid reader). I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking to read books and also watch movies or tv, play a few games, and run a few apps, then the Kindle Fire is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome!!!", "Author": "shannon", "ReviewID": "R2GS8O4UYL1GLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it today and I love it!

The Kindle Fire HDX is the perfect device for me. The screen is clear, the device is beautiful, the device is light, and the processing is super fast. Purchasing my Kindle was a perfect holiday treat because I had time to read and play games. The Kindle fire HDX made traveling home for Christmas so much fun (the free TV viewing did not work on my device while on the plane, which was problematic. But I read, listened to music, and played angry birds).The amount of time I now use my laptop has dropped down to only 25%, because this device has everything I need leisure-wise, especially for emails and Facebook. In fact, I prefer to deal with my emails only on my Kindle device. I only go to my laptop if I need to type documents or prepare documents for school and work.The Kindle is great too because it has a voice dictation software already installed which cuts my typing down significantly. This feature is important because with my physical disability, typing can be difficult on any device.I really enjoy this device, and I am glad I got it, instead of an iPad.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not That Intuitive", "Author": "John T.

I ave it a few months now and the any glitches resemble that of a smartphone so any trouble shooting is resolved but powering off (pressing down for 20 seconds) , waiting 45 seconds and then powering on. So far the device has froze (no response to screen at all) and there was an issue with the volume not responding and no sound came from the device from any option such as music or video.

My bank app isn't available (capital one).  No YouTube app. No podcast player app. My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle. No decent weather apps are available. Second, you are stuck with the kindle browser, Silk. No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari. Silk is an ok browser but it doesn't handle embedded video very well. Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs. Bookmarks are awkward. Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad. The cursor jumps around randomly. Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime. Finally, some of my favorite websites are slow and glitchy with the silk browser (like slate).

Hockenbarger", "ReviewID": "R2QWZOMX7VK7Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  I love this tablet.  I've got multiple other tablets in the house for use by the 7 kids who have all but abandoned television to watch YouTube and other streaming media technologies, so I'm not new to tablet technology by any stretch of the imagination.The hardware is great. I wasn't sure about the 7\" size, but have found that I love it.  I certainly think larger tablets have their place, but the convenience of the 7\" form factor is really nice for media consumption (reading books and magazines, watching streaming video, etc.).  It fits in the hand easily, and for smaller kids the lighter weight and smaller size makes it easier for them to use when I want to loan it to one of the littler ones.  Battery life is okay, I went from full charge to around 60% after watching three TV show episodes back to back.  The display is crisp, colors bright; blacks could be a little deeper, but it's a 7\" tablet not a 4K TV!  Sound is good, but I still question why the only vendor on the planet that gets that you should put speakers on the front of the device is HTC.  This is SUCH a no-brainer and if you want the strongest possible device for media consumption, put the speakers on the front!  That aside, the back-side speakers are pretty effective and sound is crisp with a pretty good range.I like the fact the system has 5GHz WiFi, my other tablets are all 2.4GHz, so bumping up out of that spectrum was nice, especially for streaming performance.The skin on top of Android is one of the better ones I've seen, certainly better than Asus or Samsung's skins (but I haven't gotten an opportunity to play with the MagazineUX yet, which is similar to Windows tiles which I really like).  I'd like to see more configurability for the carousel.  I haven't quite figured out the logic behind how things get added to or removed from it.  For example I view a Prime Instant Video and it shows up in the carousel, but after I pause it and look at something else, it pulls it out.  I'd like to pin Prime IV to the carousel permanently, and I don't see a way to do that.Of course having access to all the ebooks I've been reading via the Kindle app on my phone is awesome, and my wife loves the Newsstand feature.One nit about the software is that it doesn't interface properly to my Prime Instant Video, particularly my Watchlist.  For some reason it isn't reading that properly, so it doesn't see that I've got all the seasons of Doctor Who, for example queued up for viewing in my Watchlist like it does if I log into the website.  Again, a nit.The main reason this doesn't get 5 stars is actually a huge issue to me.  Not having Google Play access is almost a show-stopper.  The refusal of Amazon to work with Google and play in the ecosystem relegates the Fire to a media interface device, and it cannot become my primary tablet device.  So instead of going into my backpack when I travel on business, it sits on my bedside table for media viewing and reading at night, because my larger Samsung tablet can do everything the Kindle does and more, albeit in a larger and heavier device.  The Amazon app store is simply deficient and weak compared to Google Play, and there are a LOT of apps I use that are not available, particularly around system administration.  Of course not having the native Google apps is a big kludge, especially for a person who has carried an Android phone for years, has multiple Android tablets, and is a big fan of that ecosystem.  Even Samsung understands that not allowing the native Android apps is a bad thing, and while they push their custom versions of things, still allow you to use Google Play.  If Amazon decided to go 10\" or so on a tablet, I wouldn't buy it for this reason alone.  Since I'm a geek, I don't mind having multiple devices, but for friends and family that want a single device for things beyond media consumption, I cannot recommend the Fire.  For non-technical users who want nothing BUT media consumption, the device rocks.And yes, I know I can sideload or I could root, but I don't want to have to go to that effort across multiple devices just to get proper Android access.Overall a very nice tablet implementation.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best on The Market", "Author": "Cindy Clark", "ReviewID": "R1ZA72FAD48COE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning several tablets,cheap to rated the best.

So everything should be good, but no. The new kindle will still go offline here and there saying invalid sim. Since I bought it for my girlfriend and she says she can live with it, I'm not going to go though the trouble of having to return it again.

I want both, who are three apart, to have different settings.  They are continuously asking me to log them off to allow them to switch users.  Kindle needs to fix this.  I am about to buy a Asus tablet. My Asus tablet has a similar children's app to allow them each to have an account wit their own password.  This will allow them to log off each and allow the other to log in to their own account.  Second, you can't add memory.  Kindle solution is to have cloud storage.  wrong ideal.  Some apps like Real Racing is 4 gb.  After one month, I am out of memory without any videos downloaded from Amazon Prime.  We only downloaded six games.  Most other tablets can add a SD card to increase memory.  I own a Asus Transformer and love it. I just wish I bought them one.

Its fast, lightweight & portable, has an ever-growing selection of apps, and a BEAUTIFUL 7\" display. To show what this tablet is like, I will be comparing the HDX to the iPad Air(NOTE: these opinions come from a hardcore Apple user who is trying out Android-based tablets. I'm not being biased)\u00bb\u00bb Contrary to what most people believe, the HDX is actually better than the Air. For starters, the iPad air base model is $499... the HDX on the other hand, is $229. Its $270 for a tablet that isn't as powerful.\u00bb\u00bbSpeaking of power, let's take a look at the specs of the devices. The HDX has a 2.2 GHZ quad core Snapdragon processor + 2 GB of RAM. Thats more power and speed than most tablets on the market. The iPad Air has a dual core 1.3 GHz processor with only 1 GB of RAM. So clearly the HDX is way faster\u00bb\u00bbThe display on the HDX isn't as big as the iPad Air, despite being \"HD\". The HDX has a 1920x1200 display, and the iPad has a 1536x2048 display. HOWEVER, the pixel density isn't as high on the Air. The Air has about 264ppi and the HDX has 323ppi. So, although the display on the HDX isn't as HD, higher pixel density means sharper & clearer images. In terms of which is better, this one is really a toss-up.\u00bb\u00bbThe camera on the HDX is absolutely terrible compared to the one on the iPad air... at least on the 7\" model. The 7\" HDX lacks a rear-facing camera, and the front facing camera isn't too spectacular. Bump up to the 8.9\" HDX and you have an 8 MP rear camera that rivals the Air's 5 MP camera. If you're going for the 7\" tablet and the camera is the deciding factor, go with the Air. It has a better camera.\u00bb\u00bbBattery life is HUGE when comparing the tablets. The HDX is really good at conserving power. Amazon claims the HDX has up to 11 hours of battery life, and that really holds true. I myself have gotten even more than 11 hours of battery life. The iPad Air is a different story. Although Apple claims to have up to 10 hours of battery life, iOS 7 is a huge battery killer. I would be lucky to get half that amount with average use. I have a feeling that if iOS 7 was fixed to be less battery consuming, the Air would win this battle. So this is yet another win for the HDX\u00bbAesthetics & looks: Apple is known for its amazing product build quality and sleek look. The iPad wins this one hands down. It has a finished aluminum case that comes in two colors: Gray and Silver. The Air is also really thin & lightweight + it has small bezels allowing for more room for your content. It overall feels really solid. The HDX, though has a fairly sturdy build, is made with materials that look rather cheap. It has a rubbery-material back + is made with plastic... not aluminum. Although the HDX is also really thin & light, the iPad wins this one, simply because it looks nice.\u00bb\u00bbApp selection & software: The Amazon Appstore continues to grow, and certainly has thousands of more apps than it did when it first opened. But nothing can beat Apple in this category. The Amazon AS is rather limited. Its different from Google Play, which has much more to select from. Apple's AS has a huge variety of apps... overall a great selection. Amazon is just way too limited at this point in time. Also, iOS 7 is much nicer & has way more features than Fire OS 3. Fire OS takes the stock Android and modifies it to the point that it just looks terrible. You can't change backgrounds, you have very little customization, and the gray, drab colorless home screen & menus really don't help. Another hands down win for Apple.Overall, the HDX beats the Air in terms of speed, power, price & battery life. However, if you want a tablet that has more app selection, a nicer-looking OS, a good camera, and a really solid build that is aesthetically appealing, get the iPad Air.

I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Melissa Kay Krause", "ReviewID": "R15G94MN9Y8O2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.

I didn't need a high end laptop or a desktop with an i7 processor or any kind of powerhouse. I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something. The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal.

Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\".

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

This is one of the highest quality tablets I have ever used.  I argue that this is just as nice as my mother's iPad.  The device is fast.  The OS has major improvements.  That was always my issue with past kindle fires.  The OS was slow and buggy and the browser was awful and you couldn't organize apps very well.This is all changed.  You can organize apps beautifully.  The amazon app store finally has enough apps where I am satisfied (even though it is still lower than google play and the apple app store, it has everything I need).  The silk browser is awesome on this device.  Even if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't switch to another browser.I have not used the mayday button because I am pretty tech savvy, but I am considering getting my grandfather one solely for this reason.If you have any doubts about purchasing this, do it.  Especially if you are a college student.  Textbooks are so cheap on the kindle store, you can highlight and make notes in them, and it syncs to all of your other kindle devices.This device is light. and when I say light, I argue that it weighs about the same as my smartphone.  I can hold it in one hand with ease all day.The battery is not as good as past kindle fires, but I can't complain because of the performance increase.  I can still get a full days use out of it as long as I am not constantly watching videos.  Also - being able to download prime videos to the device is awesome.Overall, I would highly recommend this device to anyone and everyone.  You won't be disappointed.

So it was purchased with the thought that I would use it (primarily to read library ebooks, check email and facebook, and play some games).After about 2 weeks of use I was contemplating returning it as we really weren't using it to warrant the purchase, and we discovered that we would soon have access to 2 more iPads (the Airs).Then I realized that FreeTime wasn't just a thing to restrict access, that for only $2.99 (Prime members) a month my daughter would have access to a lot of her favorite apps and tons and tons of great books and videos.  Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.  FreeTime completely eliminates that, which is amazing!!I still wish many things available for the iPad were available on the Kindle and I still use the iPad more when browsing the Internet or playing games on the Internet.

The Wi-Fi is very speedy and the quad core processor allows the tablet to run without a hitch.  Everything looks amazing on the screen.  It is beautiful.  One thing different from most android tablets is the main screen.  There is no personalizing like the Samsung my wife uses such as changing desktops and widgets.  But I do not miss this at all.  The \"Special Offers\" only shows on the un-lock screen and are usually for items that I have looked at.  Often it is for books at lower prices which we like.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is a high quality tablet that everyone will enjoy using.  The size is perfect for home of travel.  The screen is a pleasure to look at.  No jerky motion.  Just smooth.  The free month of Prime was so nice I think we will by it for the year.

With the release of the Kindle Fire HDX i felt it was time to take the jump into the hand held multimedia world and I haven't been disappointed with my decision.This tablet has a beautiful display, everything is sharp and I haven't found a video I haven't been able to play. The sound quality is amazing especially for such little speakers and is much better than other competing tablets. The battery life is pretty good, though not quite as good as my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I put this tablet through a lot in a day, watching movies the battery lasts a long time. However if you play intensive online games on it, (yes they are out there) the battery will need a charge every night. Still, all day long is pretty impressive!There have been some reviews of people having issues with the wifi connections on their kindle fire hdx dropping randomly. I have had 0 problems with this. Maybe they have a previous release or theirs came from a bad batch.There are only 2 drawbacks: The apps that aren't available (no Play Store access) and the lack of an SD Card for storage expansion. I can live with it though, this snappy little tablet is worth it. The processor is one of the best for tablets of this size and the price is right.The special offers are only on the lock screen so they aren't a bother at all.

I've updated my firmware on both routers and assigned manual DHCP for both routers and both Kindle Fire HDX's will not stay connected for a long period of time.After reading the Kindle forums, this is not a minor issue as many people are experiencing this with no fix in sight.

I've had the device for a couple of weeks now, and have used it primarily for streaming videos via Netflix, reading books, and browsing the web.  On the positive side, the HD screen is beautiful, and delivers excellent quality for videos or browsing.  Likewise, the fast processor helps ensure that media is delivered more or less flawlessly (subject to the connectivity issue discussed below).  This is consistent with the Kindle's other strength, which is facilitating the consumption of Amazon content.Those positive things said, there are several issues that I have experienced that should give prospective purchasers pause.  And if the point of the ratings system is to help users assess whether to purchase the product, I would suggest passing on the Kindle and sticking with another Android-based device.First, the network connectivity is horrendously unreliable.  When connected to a wi-fi router that provides fast, reliable service to a variety of other devices (tested with an iPhone, an iPad, a Droid Razr Maxx, and a Windows PC), the Kindle for some reason cannot load any webpages or other internet content, even though it indicates having a strong wi-fi connection.  Occasionlly, if I restart the Kindle, the problem will temporarily resolve itself; however, even that step should be unecessary.In addition, the battery life is mediocre, even when the screen brightness is dimmed and the wi-fi turned off.  This tends to diminish the Kindle's value as a media consumption device, because the battery drains, sometimes at the right of 1% per minute or two.Finally, the Amazon app store remains a laggard - far behind the Google- and Apple-based offerings.  (Yes, you can side-load Android apps; however, once again, that's not a hassle that users should need to tolerate.)If you don't need to stream movies via Amazon (for which you need an Amazon device), go with another Apple- or Android-based device and just install the Kindle app.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not impressed", "Author": "Jesica", "ReviewID": "R3MFXPSZBP4R14", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are just going to just use it as an E-reader then that's fine.

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE it!!", "Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

I also have saved pdf docs of patterns and tutorials on it. My HDX works beautifully, in the standing case, on my jewelers bench for various metalworking guides and for offline use.In my kitchen, the HDX is  a recipe book,  with recipes from the internet via wifi as well as files saved offline.Basic Pros -- The images & sounds are  crisp and clear,  which is a significant improvement over the original Kindle Fire.- Easy to use & navigate for the slightly less tech savvy (I'm an art geek not a techno geek and comfortable with Apple products.)- Kid friendly, my 2 yr old niece and 8 yr old nephew enjoyed an interactive story on it as well as the usual kid games and apps.- A lot (1000's) of free Kindle books, lower priced reads, samples, and the Prime lending library for a monthly freebie.Basic Cons --My 64gb 7\" model doesn't  have  a rear facing camera but it's not enough of a con to knock a star off. I use a DSLR for my art pics and my iPhone 5s for my out-and-about snapshots, so using the HDX for an occasional selfie or web chat is  great.-The battery life isn't as good as it was on the old original Kindle Fire. Since this version does a lot more, it makes sense, and because I charge it daily.  I don't have issues with it dying on me in the middle of activity.- Overall this Amazon addict is pleased! -My  new lightweight Kindle goes everywhere with me.

Totman", "ReviewID": "R37ZZZ2FQNQK00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My sister has the original Kindle Fire. I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away. I was using it for travel when working (looking stuff up in the field) but not when going to visit family or anything. I took my iPad but now will take the HDX to work and to visit family, etc.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet, welcomes you into the Amazon ecosystem with open arms.", "Author": "Mike L", "ReviewID": "RZMI8BQJVSODZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to preface this by saying I am not generally a review writer. I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole.

Although I heard goodreviews of the iPad the cost was prohibitive although the store was top notched.  Likewise, I heard good reviews about the Nexus but I was concerned with the store.  The Kindle HDX 7 delivers both as promised: inexpensive and also linked to the largest store in the world.I have had it for about a month now and it has been worth every cent I spent on it.  I love toggling it on and instantly watching movies from either NetFlix or from Amazon Prime.  Its fast and pretty.  I did once have a problem with Netflix -- it kept telling me I had no internet when obviously I did.  I reinstalled the app and never had a problem again.Reading books is great.  Clear and crips lettering and easy page turning.  Magazines I find with a mixed bag.  Essentially the composition of digital magazines has a lot to be desired about, but that has nothing to do with the Kindle.  I configured one email to its mail application and it works well, with no real complaints.  Typing on any soft key keyboard is a chore and I am thinking of getting a pen (although most I have seen are outrageously priced for a plastic stick).Not overly impressed with web surfing on this or any tablet.  I certainly dislike the mobile versions of Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter.  Some you can convert over to the normal desktop experience, others you can't (pointing at your Twitter!!).  I love to surf the web and just jump from one site to the next -- this is awkward and difficult with the Kindle.I have had no real trouble with the device and I have not tried their special help feature where I talk to someone.

It is  so light weight. One handed usage is a breeze. The only negative which I had not realized was that I have no access to the Play Store . While the amazon appstore has tons of apps there are still some I could not get for this one. I had spent months making progress in games that I have to access on my 10\" tablet which I was planning on giving to someone else. Also there are a number of apps that say for the Kindle Fire but they do not work on the HDX. It is so new they say that I need to have patience for them to be developed for the HDX. I find this unacceptable. There are too many of these apps. Why are they not available for this fire but only the others. I am still learning some of the features so hence only 4 stars.

I like the Cloud features for storing pictures which I was able to upload from my smartphone.  Have not uploaded from home computer as I have years worth of pictures and do not want to have that many on the tablet for now.

I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

I got this and have fallen in love with the improvements that have been done to the Kindle Fire. It is lighter than the original fire and works much better in my opinion. It fits the needs I require which are reading, movies, games, and browsing the web. I don't care for all the fancy technical stuff or connecting to TV at really, I'm happy as long as it does what I need it to do.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great device but lacking output/apps for external devices (TV, Receiver)", "Author": "someone", "ReviewID": "R359D4Z06Q4KMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many reviews for this device, but not much information about how to output the device display content to external TV/monitor. So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

There is no way I could afford a new iPad and after using this, I don't think I would want one anyway. I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality. I would definitely recommend a kindle tablet to anyone who is looking for a tablet for entertainment purposes but is hesitant to shell out the cash for one of the more expensive brands.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was  a Christmas present to myself, and it was a great price to boot.  I found the setup to be ridiculously simple (already having an amazon account and another kindle), but I think that even first time owners will be pleased.  The videos on HD are very crisp (using a high speed router and Xfinity), and optional \"Amazon Prime\" for $79 a year provides the owner not only with free 2 day shipping on all \"Prime\" items purchased, but thousands of movies and shows are included.  There are a good number of \"apps\" available (many are free), and hundreds of free games.  For the price, this tablet certainly provides a quality interface with the internet and is more convenient that sitting at a desk or carrying a laptop.  I have also found many books and guides (borrow from Prime or purchase) that will help users to get the most out of their Kindle.  If you love videos or reading, playing games, \"Skyping\", or even phone calls (yes, there is a way to do that), I believe that you love this tablet.  Your only decision is whether to spend more for the \"HDX\" version, which adds capacity and speed, or for additional memory.

As a 5th year student I really didn't want to (nor could I afford) a new laptop that will be replaced by a professional computer in a year or so. So, I thought on black Friday why not try for $180. I own the 2012 kindle fire and thought it was this seemed to be a good choice. I got a Bluetooth keyboard for this to make it a \"real laptop\", because I mainly write essays and it does well. I like this new kindle so far. I can type with a Bluetooth keyboard on word apps which helps a lot for the normal college student. I am not a tech geek or anything, just needed something to get me by for the last school year. I had a normal 15\" laptop then a netbook that both died out in college so I really didn't want another expensive computer and this is a good replacement. I don't plan on this being a forever replacement and I don't think other people should either. I use it to type and play games on it. The kindle is really thin which I love. At first I was hesitant because I was fine with the 2012 fire but I needed something better to write essays on. Now I think this is new one is fine. Overall, if your looking for a basic tablet that can do things like write in polaris app (or in king soft, whatever) and play app games this does very well. If your looking for a tablet that is more photo sharing, personal details, bigger screen, etc this may not be for you. I haven't had a problem with it and advise a person to get Prime with it, you can download movies and watch them without internet (great feature).Down sides:Yes it's a kindle, you can't have a screen photo and they're adds but for the normal person thats not much a bothersome.The power button and a volume button are on the back of it. I find it a hard transition coming from old fire to the new one. It beats me why they'd put them on the back. I find the power button on back a little bit of an annoyance but new fire users may not. This also makes it an issue because if you have an old kindle fire you'll need to buy a whole new case and NO OTHER KINDLE FIRE CASES WILL FIT IT! (You have to specifically buy an HDX one). I bought one thinking they would but nope. Normal CASES cover the power button on back; I still use the non-fitting case because I don't want to spend more money on a case.It is only 7\", no surprise there. But it is on the tiny side for tablets. I didn't mind in on the 2012 kindle fire and I don't now. If you have a giant cell phone it may seem odd because they're close in size but I don't have a high tech phone so this really doesn't bother me.This version does have a front facing camera, I don't know how many MP. I can't seem to find that info (but I haven't searched that hard).

Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.  Due to the friendliness of the agent that responded, I found out I was only like the 10th person to use it that morning, as it's still a new feature, and the agents are new to this too!  She was EXTREMELY helpful and kind and informed me it could take a couple hours to receive this promotional credit.Last but not least...the power cable.  It is at a FUNKY angle on the tablet in order to keep with the contoured angle of the tablet edge.  It angles upward while plugged in properly.  If not careful, I can see this charging port or cable becoming damaged easily.Beyond those few issues, this is an excellent tablet, it's perfectly sized, fits well in the hand, the screen is bright (I see none of the blue tint as others are describing), and the support is phenomenal!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Christmas Gift She Loves", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "R2Z48UY20WV9ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife already had a Kindle.  I cannot remember whether I bought it at a Brick and Mortar place or through the Wonderful World of Amazon(tm).  It was an older, very lightweight model, in black and white and all shades in between.  She needs lightweight because of severe Rheumatoid Arthritis.  Anyway, it was time for an upgrade.  Since I have the Kindle Fire HD 7\", HD Display, Wi-Fi and love it, the fact that the HDX was lighter and did more was a selling point.Although she's not used it much at this point, everything is what she wants.

Since we are long-time Amazon Prime customers, I wanted a tablet that would play Amazon Prime video as well as Hulu+ and Netflix.  And, of course, a good Kindle experience.  That narrowed the field to either iPad or Kindle Fire.  After the Fire HDX came out it was clear that Amazon had some serious hardware.  The latest Kindle OS helped sell me too.I do miss the Google apps that I have on my droid phone but fortunately some of them can be side-loaded if you find the apk file on the web.Reading books and graphic novels is a great experience.Watching videos (both streaming and saved to the kindle) is great.Sound quality is very good.I'm still getting to know the Free Time feature for my young kids but it looks promising.Bottom line...if you like to read (on a tablet) and watch video then you will have a hard time beating the Fire HDX and when you consider the price, there's no contest.

One of my daughters is very disappointed and I don't blame her.2)  The mayday button has come in handy for me already in the first couple of days of use.

I bought the Kindle because of all the above and the features were great too. The display was very good, the price was right and the on-demand help feature was nice too.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

This is not an ipad or other kind of tablet. For a kindle this is a very good tablet. The kindle was originally made to read books and even though now it is more centered around internet usage, it is still for reading. No you will not find the same features and capabilities on this kindle as you will on another higher level tablet. For the price paid for this kindle it is truly worth it. The color is beautiful and the processor is very responsive and clear. It really is a great upgrade for the kindle. It may not be up to the same level as an ipad but for the price and the fact that it's a kindle makes it amazing. This product is for amazon lovers and those who are dedicated to amazon. I have a prime membership and I have already tested out some of the videos which are great. I also love the sound and how the volume buttons are on the back. I understand that some of you actually have received a defective tablet and that would be a good reason to give it a low rating but it is a new piece of technology so there are going to be some defective ones.

It is definitely not a big deal. There are too many people comparing the kindle to an ipad. No it will not have all the same apps because kindle has its own browser called silk. There however is still a lot of apps available and I assume the popular ones wouldn't be hard to find. There is also a way to sideload apps and all it takes is some research on youtube to figure out how. I am very impressed with this kindle and I understand its greatness. For those of you that hated it because you did not do your research, you should be looking in to this stuff before you buy it. Again, the kindle is for amazon lovers and those who mainly enjoy reading and surfing the web.

It works amazingly well for me,  It was worth the upgrade all by itself. I spent in excess of $100.00 for a program for my PC, and have been disappointed with it. It is difficult to use, requiring many key strokes to get it going, not to mention the necessary use of a headset. The Kindle is very accurate in getting down what I say, not 100% yet, but closer than I can do with my fingers on the PC. Now, all I have to do is learn to speak in commas and periods.

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

Since this tablet cannot yet be purchased in The Netherlands in a store, this was the only chance for me to pick it up and feel and explore it. I loved the design, the feel, the incredible clarity and mega-fast processor.Back home, I tested a lot of tablets at a Dutch local megastore. Google Nexus seemed appealing, then Samsung tab 3.0, but I disliked the shapes, too long/narrow screen proportions. LG Gpad 8.3 was another temptation, but again: that weird long narrow screen? I jumped on to Apple's Ipad Mini 2. Bigger screen than the average 7\" and just perfectly proportioned. Simply not being an Apple's type of guy, I hesitated. What held me back at Ipad Mini 2, were the limitations of dropping audio and video files on it. You would have to use Itunes for almost everything and convert many movie files.With Kindle, I wasn't sure about its Amazon-tunnel-vision strategy. But I also read there were a lot of ways to sideload apps outside the Amazon app-convent.From the day I received it (3 days after purchase, this gets UPS delivered to your doorstep and yes, they do ask your neighbours to receive it on your behalf in case you're not at home), I have not regretted this purchase for one second.I like Amazon products a lot. I do read Kindle books. But I like Kobo also. No problem, on youtube there's a perfectly clear instruction video on how to bring Kobo to your Kindle, and the two do peacefully co-exist.Magazines: lovely, cheap and easy to order, a delight to page through on this tablet.PDF files, Word documents: perfect viewing.For more extensive typing, I purchased the Perixx Periboard-805L, which works like a charm as a bluetooth wireless foldable keyboard for my Kindle tablet.Kindle Fire HDX 7 had my first attention, and remained my ultimate choice.

The Surface too can also double as a tablet (but because of the weight) not for long period of time.

After reading reviews and doing product comparing on tablets, I decided on a Kindle Fire HDX.First impressions:I loved the look and feel but since this was my first tablet, I wish Amazon would of included more information and instructions.  It took me a few minutes just to unlock the screen.The plugin came with an adapter and I was thrilled because I didn't want to have to use my computer to charge.  The angled way that the cord goes in is a nice feature but made me uneasy the first time I inserted the power cord.Setup was very easy once I remembered all my login and password information.Charging time was about 6 hours which isn't too bad but I was quite impatient waiting.The first app that I downloaded was Candy Crush.  That process was easy and only took a few minutes.After a month of use...I love it.  The picture quality is excellent.  The sound quality is better than you'd expect.  I play a few games, browse Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest with ease.  You'd think you were on a computer with as fast as things load.  I've watched a few things and was really surprised by how good it looked.  I've also visited websites that aren't \"made for mobile\" and was thrilled that they work perfectly.Although I love my HDX there's a few things that I wish were better, improved, etc....Battery life.  I mainly just play a few games and browse a few places but the battery seems to drain kind of fast.  Just doing a few simple things each evening and I have to charge it every other day.  I couldn't imagine how often it would need to charge if I used it throughout the day.Availability of apps.  There's so many apps and games that are only available for Apple and Google so I wish there was more compatibility with Amazon and the Kindle Fire.Ability to watch YouTube videos without an app would be nice.Ability to play Java or Adobe Flash games or videos would be wonderful.Some questions...Care and maintenance.  What's the best way to ensure overall battery life?  Should I let the battery drain completely sometimes?  I have a case.  Do I need a screen protector?  What's the best way to clean the screen?With winter now here, how does the HDX do in cool or cold weather?  Should I keep it at a certain temperature for use or let it warm up before using?  What about summer heat?Like with computers do I need to clear the cache sometimes?  How do I maintain it?  Is there maintenance like on computers that should be done?  Are Kindle Fires at risk for trojans, virus', malware, adware, etc?  Is there a firewall?  What can I do to protect my HDX?Overall, I am VERY happy with my HDX and I'm glad I chose it.  I would recommend it to anyone that was wanting a tablet.  There's many things it can do and it is good for almost anything and anyone.

The blue backlight in the device allows less power consumption and it provides the screen with a vibrant crisp image.The bottom line is, If you are getting a tablet as a gift this season, right now at this price, it doesn't get any better.

I bought the Fire and made the right choice.  I've had this for a day now and am impressed by:1.Clarity and richness of the screen.  This is a perfectly good book reader; easy on the eyes2.Speed of processor, network access...it's very noticable (I have a Cisco E2500 router which takes advantage of MIMO and dual band)3.User Interface (users seem to prefer the native Android of the Nexus, but I actually like Kindle's simplicity)4.The Silk Browser does seem to be faster (x2-x3) than browsers on my Mac Air, or 4th Gen iPad5.Amazon's Prime video, etc. content ... I would download these anyway from another tablet, so why not AmazonThe biggest gripe of other reviewers seems to be Amazon's aggressive advertising and link to their ecosystem.  I have the special offers (cheaper) version, and don't really find the ads annoying (if I did $20 would fix that).  And I like the direct link to Amazon's content.  Nor does Amazon try to prevent you from sideloading APKs (they actually give you an installer on the device) nor from rooting (you can relatively easily install CyanogenMod I've heard).  In truth, I think rooting would be a big mistake, as you would lose out on Amazon's ecosystem without gaining anything.  The better route is to sideload the Nova Launcher (or there are several other launchers that do just as well) as they more or less remove any advertising, and give you a more conventional Android interface.  I make sure that I have links on the Nova Launcer dock to Amazon store and to Silk.  It's the best of both worlds.Update...I've had my HDX for two weeks now, and am pleased that Amazon has such a light hand in controlling their UI.  I've loaded the Nova Launcher on my HDX, with docked icons for Kindle Store, and Silk Browser.  The result is a better UI than IOS or Nexus 7.  Almost everything I want is sideloadable.  I tried sideloading GooglePlay (*HaHa*) but that didn't work for a fairly obvious reason -- Amazon did not want to be responsible for an App that collects payments outside their own ecosystem (it opens up a host of headaches for them).I purchased the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working.  For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations.  It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc.  The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.I even used the Mayday button once trying to set up the Netgear Push2TV ... it works as advertised and Amazon staff are great!In my opinion for a variety of reasons which I would classify under the general rubric of Amazon's \"ecosystem\" the HDX is better than Nexus 7 and iPad Mini-Retina (which is ridiculously overpriced), which makes it the best 7\" tablet available.Oh... and be sure to buy the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Polyurethane Origami Case (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7\"), Mineral Black ... this is (if you  look at product reviews) an unloved and misunderstood accessory.  I was not impressed when I first got it, but now that I own it, I think it is the best case out there (though too expensive in my opinion).  The stand and magnetic cover work as advertised.  The tray that the Kindle sits in is magnetic and holds the HDX well, but allows it easily to be removed and reinserted.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding with a couple of short comings!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TAV0UJT1DPQX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great screen, but needs GPS CHIP.

This is just the beginning!  I can't imagine how much greater it probably is!  I can't wait to get the time to play with it more!  Thank you Amazon for another GREAT Kindle!A follow up!!!  Since my original review, I've had to return not only the original, but TWO more!!!  The first two would not hold a charge when in sleep mode.  The third one was charging for NINE hours and only made it up to 58% charged!  To make matters worse it came with no original box, which worried me as to if it was refurbished.  Amazon admitted it was a mistake and I was sent refurbished.  This has been a HUGE frustration dealing with having to call each time, packing them up and then making the 25-30 minute drive one way to our local UPS store!  I have no doubt I will love this device if I ever get one that works the way it is supposed to work!To date I have yet to receive an HDX that will hold a charge.  I am now on the 5th unit.  I cannot keep the internet on or will will drain within a few hours to dead.  In fact just downloading my latest books will drain at least 25% of my power that I had before turning on the internet to download the books.  Out of frustration I have kept this 5th one and just don't turn the internet on.  Now after just a month of using it, the screen keeps flashing like it is going to die/go blank.  This is the WORST problem I've ever had with any electronic device I've had!

I talked with two Mayday operators since buying this new Kindle - both were easy to understand and knowledgeable.The sound and HD screen is very impressive, a big improvement over my Fire from 2012.  The processor is also impressively fast.  I have to say that battery life is not great, but adequate.  I have yet to try using the device with the WiFi off, which likely would improve battery life.

I love reading and the pages are so easy to see in any light...regular room light, dark room, and outside. Playing games that I had previously played on my old tablet is a whole new experience. The games are more vibrant, and no hesitation.I haven't used the Kindle for music yet, but based on what other have said, I am sure it will be great.I do like that they are now including the rapid charger with the Kindle, rather than having to purchase one separately.

As my first pseudo-Android tablet, I found it to be a very limited tablet based on Apps available and limitations on installing true Android apps, including a real internet browser.Battery life for active use seems to be as-advertised; however I do not expect the batteries to fully drain while in sleep mode - this is the case with my unit.Screen quality is superb for a 7\" tablet - the blue-haze issue on the borders is somewhat annoying when reading books.  Sound quality is second to none when compared to my other tablets.  Mayday is a cool feature - in a couple of instances I received great support and help; in others, it was anything but helpful.I am not a Prime subscriber - even that has limitations over other alternative media providers. This further convinced me not to subscribe.Overall, my disappointment stems from the limitation enforced with the Android apps available (c'mon, no YouTube or real Browser?), the questionable battery life when not in use, and the blue haze of this otherwise great display.Finally, I saw a recent TV ad comparing the HDX to an iPad...

Screen quality is stunning and video amazing. With the origami case there is some heft to the device and over time a unsupported hand holding it would tire. The origami case is a creative solution that works fairly well as a functional case btw. The help capability to instantly video chat with a tech is a positive experience. My Kindle arrived with special offers enabled, though I'd ordered without them. An email to customer support resulted in a reply within a couple hours, on Christmas Eve no less, with the sponsored ads removed, no charge. Incidentally, I think it would be useful if there was a way to opt back in for that content in order to receive the special offers in an unobtrusive manner. If this was controllable by the user that might be useful.I rate the poor marketing due to the following information in the product description: \"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in OfficeSuite, and updated e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more\"There is no built-in OfficeSuite. There is a built-in VIEWER.  A viewer is a very different product from an office suite. One can read documents but not be very productive if unable to produce documents, spreadsheets or presentations. This in my mind is just false and misleading advertising. A deciding factor in purchasing this product was the presence of a built-in office suite tool. You won't even know this either, unless you go looking on the product forum, as I and others have done, posting \"where is the built-in OfficeSuite? That should tell Amazon something - consumers are expecting a true suite of office tools. Either include one or more accurately portray what is on board.I chose this device after one too many crashes with my first gen iPad. So far, I'm happy with the technology. It's intuitive, easy to use and the images on the screen are exceedingly clear and sharp. Set-up was easy and fast. The very simple on board customer service is in strong contrast to getting help from Apple, which is no where near as easy. That's a definite positive factor for this product.

Its lighter and the battery lasts longer than the new nexus 7 and I personally think the screen has better color reproduction and contrast.  I had both and compared side by side, the Kindle was just all around better.  HOWEVER, no access to google voice, hangouts, maps, Music, keep, gmail, docs, google calendar, and chrome makes this tablet limited in its awesomeness.  I use a laptop for most of my internet and \"productivity\" related tasks so no integration with the google ecosystem isn't a deal breaker for me.  But it sure would be nice to be able to have hangouts, keep, maps, and voice.  Almost 100% of my IMing happens in hangouts or facebook chat, neither of which are in the Amazon market, and I would love to check my texts with google voice on the tablet.  No gmail, chrome, docs, or calendar isn't a big deal because the substitutes they have are good enough, and no music is understandable because Amazon has their own music app BUT for light social applications and looking at Maps I really wish amazon would make a deal with Google or create  decent native apps that integrates with them.With that being said, I still like the HDX 7\" better than the nexus 7 tablet because of the seamless integration with the amazon ecosystem and amazing access to content through prime. Its so easy to watch movies, play games, read comics, and read books that what little leisure time I have is spent within the amazon ecosystem.  Movie/television integration is easier and more convenient than netflix on android and books look as good as they can on a tablet.
