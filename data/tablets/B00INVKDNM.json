The Simbans Tablet PC is a pleasure to use.  I am a casual user.  I don't do gaming.  I like to surf and do email and read ebooks.  The Simbans is perfect for me.SCREENI would like to take a minute to go over something that is almost never mentioned in reviews.  Oleophobic screens are so ubiquitous, we think every screen is like that.  Let me tell you, I've used other generic Android tablets.  Inexpensive tablets don't always have the oleophobic screen.  What's that mean?  Touch your iPhone or Kindle and you will feel a slick sensation.  Rub that screen on your shirt and the fingerprints come off.  Cheap tablets that don't have that type of screen will grab fingerprints like you wouldn't ever believe possible, and they don't come off so easily.The Simbans screen is oleophobic.  Now that I know it's possible to get an oleophobic screens on an inexpensive tablet, I'm not going to accept anything less.WIRELESSThe Simbans Tablet PC supports Wi-Fi but not Bluetooth.  The Wi-Fi connection is quick and very good.  I don't have any issues with it.  I have it set to be on during sleep so that when I wake it up, I have instant internet access.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is good.  It doesn't last more than a day (waking hours) through moderate usage, but it's long enough that I don't feel like I'm constantly recharging.WEB BROWSINGI find web browsing to be a pleasant experience.  I use the pre-installed Chrome browser almost exclusively, not the native browser.  It's simply smoother.Video reviews on Amazon don't stream (the native browser is slow and stutters, and Chrome can't stream them at all), but video reviews don't stream on the Fire or iPhone, either.  YouTube videos play without problems.CAMERAThere are front and rear cameras on this tablet.  The rear camera has higher quality images and videos than the front-facing camera.  In fact, the front camera seems to point at an angle to my right, so that I have to angle the tablet to get my face centered on screen.I do like the rear camera a lot.  As someone who doesn't Skype or take selfies, it's the one I'd use most.  The Simbans rear camera is the best of all my generic Android tablets.BOOTING UPI normally have the tablet on sleep mode.  Occasionally, I'll power it off.  Turning it on, it sometimes hangs on the splash screen.  I solve that by doing a soft reset (holding the power button down until the screen turns off).  This isn't a problem waking up from sleep mode.PROS:+ Wi-Fi capable+ HDMI port+ Micro SD card support+ Front and rear cameras+ Oleophobic screenCONS:- No Bluetooth- Front camera at an angle, isn't as good quality as rear camera- Boot up sometimes hangs on splash screenOVERALL IMPRESSIONThis is a very good introductory tablet, or for the casual user or children.  Heavy users may want something more, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up to read a book or check my email or surf the web.  It's a great little tablet.This product was provided for review by Simbans Electronics.__________________UPDATE 3/1/14: You may see two video reviews for this product from me on one listing.  Pay attention to the color.  One is for the blue tablet, the other for the pink tablet.  These product listings were merged by Amazon, but they are very different tablets.  It's not just the color and the physical placement of the ports and camera.  You will also see a difference in sound, video and photo capabilities.__________________UPDATE 3/3/14: I do not know what is going on with the listings.  At first, the colors were separate.  I wrote reviews for the pink and blue tablets.  The two tablets are different tablets.  They have different port and camera placements and the quality of sound and cameras are different.  The listings for the blue and pink were merged so that all colors were on one page.  Now, they are separated and my blue tablet review is stuck on the pink tablet page.Please, folks, this is a review for the BLUE tablet.  It was originally posted on the BLUE tablet page.  Now, it's stuck on the pink tablet page, but even as I edit this review, I am editing on the BLUE tablet page.  I don't know how to get it on the proper page.  Maybe Amazon will move it back again.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Prince Williams", "ReviewID": "R42P260PCMEJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son's birthday and he just loves it.
