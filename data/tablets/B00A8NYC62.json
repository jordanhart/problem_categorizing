Tablet overall is awesome for less than a $100. More than what you expect, more than what you have paid for. It tends to be sluggish once in a while, but it is not a factor. Wifi is pretty steady (it doesn't drop) and resolution is great (not as great as the ipad and samsung though). The only problem I have encountered so far are netflix and tunein radio not working at all (for an android 4.0, not likely). Battery is well enough for the entire day used. Touch screen is above average, but not as responsive as the other tablets out there. You just have to get use to it. Speed is also above average, but I do not think it is a 1.2 GHZ as advertised. It could be between 800 to 900 MHZ, but it still gives you a good speed. I still gave this tablet a 5 star.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "I was a little worried being a generic low priced tablet Yet I've been very happy with the product!!", "Author": "Travis Mier", "ReviewID": "R1ZQGAXAOJUWA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It came in Portuguese language setting..
