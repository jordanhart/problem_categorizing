It's nothing but trouble!  It constantly goes \"back\" as if the back button is being hit.  I've found a very temporary fix for it....by re-setting the touch screen calibration & accelerometer calibration.  This \"fix\" doesn't even last a day!  IF, I can even get to the settings page to re-set those.  Camera is horrible, & the tablet will reboot itself often.  I've never left a bad review, but this one deserves it.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money!", "Author": "carioca", "ReviewID": "RDXO5ZZ9BFUFU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet in December 2011. Six months later I started experiencing lots of problems; freezing at least 2 to 3x during use, overheating, flashing screen, keyboard not working properly. I contacted Archos and they asked me to return the tablet to them which cost me $25! Archos was very efficient by sending me a second tablet in good time. Guess what? 3 weeks later the freezing was back! Am I so out of luck that I got 2 lemons in 8 months? or is the product a bad product? I strong believe that the Archos 101G8 is a TERRIBLE! machine! it is receiving more and more bad reviews. I called Archos to explain my situation and ask for a refund by returning the 2nd defective tablet. They turned me down even though the tablet was brand new and of course under the 1 year Archos warranty. This time I was able to negotiate with them to send me a COD label. They accepted and now I'm waiting for the 3 tablet! My advice is DO NOT BUY this machine! Save your money to get something by a better manufacter and better built. Small IPads are going to be here soon for affordable prices.  My Archos now cost me $390!! and I don't have it with me again! Now, I immensely regret for not having purchased the new IPad. I want to thanks Amazon for their wonderful customer service. They are real professionals that care about their customers. It's also fair to say that Archos CS wasn't bad. They did by the book. We shall see what's coming for me ahead. Will I finally be able to enjoy my tablet?

It feels kind of odd to say that I'm glad that I wasn't the only one.  I purchased my Archos on woot.com, and got what I thought was a pretty reasonable deal.  Immediately upon opening it, the problems began.The first issue was the accelerometer, and screen positioning--it didn't work at all.  As someone said previously, I received some of the worst tech support/ customer support since the Dell customer service in India some years ago.  Although the help was delivered poorly, and in a lackluster way, a device reset worked.  I did lose everything I had ownloaded/personalized of course.Issue numbers two, and three were equally frustrating, and led to my requesting an RMA for the unit.  While every other wireless device in our household worked swimmingly with our WPA-2 router, I had to practically sit on top of the router for the 101 G9 to even register the WiFi connection.  Lastly, the device became unresponsive REGULARLY, and would reboot itself.  Whether I was attempting to use Netflix, or simply the NY Times app..I really wanted this to be a winner.  It looked good on paper, but Archos is now on the list of products I simply will not deal with.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE", "Author": "YungT93", "ReviewID": "R1ZXN7UXKTYF2I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I brought this tablet for the cost, but its true you get what you pay for. The ICS update makes the touch screen stop working at times, the device won't turn, and it restarts and freezes, oh and also the wifi cuts on and off. Then the screen sucks, I leaned on it in the leather case for a second by mistake and didn't put any pressure on it and half of the screen turned black, and it costs 200 to fix the screen.
