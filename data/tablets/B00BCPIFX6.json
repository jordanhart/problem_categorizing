Everything was working well until she noticed the power button wasn't working all the time. I called Asus to get a RMA number and shipped it out to them. It has been 3 weeks with no update so I called them. They stated that there was physical damage to it and they would offer me a quote to fix it. There was NO physical damage to it at all. It was in perfect shape. I informed the \"customer service\" agent that I did not agree to it and all she would do is keep repeating \"I apologize for the inconvenience\" over..and..over..Such terrible customer service. I have built hundreds of computers based on their motherboards, bought a few of their tablets, and have always been a supporter of their products.

When I first purchased this tablet the battery seemed to last very well, a couple of days later I noticed that the battery seemed to be a bit less. For instance, after the first charge I managed almost 8 hours of use before needing a charge, then a few days later I felt lucky to get 2-3 hours of normal use such as reading my e- mail and the like. As a matter of fact, the first day I spent mostly on you tube and the battery life was outstanding. I was also a little upset that I couldn't use swipe on the keyboard, but after upgrading Jellybean, I found swipe was now on my tablet and that it functioned well. I would definitely say this was (or is) a great bargain b for the money.

On top of that I ordered 2 screen protectors and I never received them. Low and behold this week the screen cracked without the tablet dropping or someone pressing on the screen by mistake, I contacted the seller and they told me that I passed the 30 day return policy when I contacted Amazon and filed the a to z claim that was also a total Failure. In future if I buy anything from Amazon it has to be shipped and sold by. The 1st Asus I bought was on the 13th August 2013 and the 2nd on the 26th August 2013.

That's pretty much it. Except that it does not get the pure Google Android experience. Thankfully Asus unlike other Android device makers do not fill this tablet with bloatware. So it is still pretty lean.Our Memo Pad Smart updated immediately to 4.2.1 JB via OTA. For some reason it didn't get the 4.2 excellent keyboard that allowed one to swipe around keys. =( I really like that in my GNex.Like most reviewers below, I am quite impressed with what it can do considering the low price. I did a bunch of research comparing it to the older TF300 and premium TF700. While it may not look like much on paper spec wise (same as TF300 but lower spec than TF700), Asus improved upon the useability of the MeMo Pad. Most importantly, the I/O side of things. It no longer lags! Yay! In that respect under real life use the MeMo Pad felt more responsive than previous Asus Tablets. I think they learned a thing or two while producing the Nexus 7.{The Bad}The screen resolution was OK. I prefer higher res. But for normal day to day use, it is fine except. Some small text are a bit garbled. Else photos are fine. Watching HD movies is fine too.The plastic backing while ok, it did exhibit some minute creak. No biggie. I am anal that way.{The Good}This outweighs the above easily. Speakers blew me away. For such a small thing, it produces big sound.Lots of non-proprietary ports (Apple needs to learn here!). HDMI, USB, microSD expandable....One of the lightest 10\" I ever used. In contrast the iPad was a heavy beast.Really like that it is thin.Very little bloatware.In conclusion, I feel this tablet seems to punch above its weight class. The screen resolution is what holds it back else it would be one very very popular tablet.

First I could not even get the lock screen off. After repeated tries and resets, I managed to get the lock screen off. Touch response was awful. Then it took me about a hour and many force shutdowns and resets to get the WiFi setup and the Google Account setup. Then I started to get system downloads and Apps from my other tablets backed up on Google. I looked for the Operating Manual that the tiny book said was on the tablet and could not find it. I went to the ASUS website to download it. I could not make the tablet browser find the manual for download and gave up for the night. I was going to return it in the morning.Next morning as I was getting ready to pack it up, I saw that a system update was ready to run. So I ran it and watched the update scroll by and noticed one of the items was \"touch screen firmware update\". WOW! New tablet!After the update and another you have Android 4.2.1 and a very good tablet.It is thin and light, has three operating speeds (Power Saving, Balanced, and Performance). These give Quadrant scores of 2150, 3350, and 3550 respectively. You can choose to use the 4.1 or 4.2 launcher.

The tablet now runs Android 4.2.1 which is quite smooth and comprehensive. I usually use custom launchers (the program that manages the look of the tablet) but the stock launcher is full of tweaks and features and is very fast. One can buy this tablet cheaper through Walmart than through Amazon, which is kind of weird.The sound quality is pretty good for such a slim device and this tablet has stereo sound; many Androids only have a single speaker. The device runs all of the streaming services like Netflix, Hulu plus, and Flixter. And ASUS provides a small online cloud to which you can save files. But their cloud is lacking in flexibility, and much smaller than Dropbox or the Google Drive clouds whichare also free.ASUS also has provided several firmware updates since I purchased the tablet. The performance seemed better after the second one. The updates all occur automatically.One can get amazing battery life out of this device. I manage close to 11 hours of continuous wifi video streaming. I put the tablet in \"balanced mode\" which saves power compared to \"performance mode\" and saw very little hinderance to speed and smoothness. Also, one can turn off the automatic scren brightness and set the brightness a bit lower than average. This not only saves battery life but makes the black values much darker and the colors more true.With a $4 adapter I can plug a normal computer usb keyboard into the tablet for efficient typing. With one of the free office suites, this lets me create Microsoft compatible documents. The use of a usb keyboard does drain the battery a bit. I average about 8 hours of office typing. Nice to get my work done without using a laptop or resorting to a full desktop. I even managed to edit a website, saving the file to html for upload.Flash does not come installed, due to some weird licensing thing with Adobe, but it is easy to install the flash plugin and Adobe's website walks you through it well.I am very satisfied with this device. I received a document from my real estate agent that needed to be signed. I downloaded it, printed it via wifi (free HP app), signed it, scanned it using the camera (via cam-scanner, also free), made a pdf out of it, and emailed it back ALL WITH THE TABLET. Try doing that with an ipad.So it is certainly a device for productivity as well as entertainment. Sure the screen resolution could be better, but the same resolution is common to 17\" monitors and is compressed on a 10\" screen on this tablet so I find it quite sufficient. The power of the quad-core processor makes games run very smoothly and is overkill for most other tasks. For $300 ithas the same specs as a Nexus 7 but gives you a 10\" screen. Well worth the extra $100 as 7\" screens are really too small to be handy for business tasks.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Tablet very good quality", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R279MCOPMBEIRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm getting used to the tablet, very user friendly.

Metz", "ReviewID": "R16JPS5P6UIULW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research to find a decent-quality tablet for around $250, and this one delivers.  The size and form factor (very thin) is what I would expect and want from a 10\" tablet.  It feels sleek and is very light.  The build quality seems quite good for a device housed in a plastic shell.  The screen is great -- extremely clear and vivid, with an easy-to-access brightness slider control, which you'll want to use, because I've found that screen brightness has a lot to do with how long the battery lasts.  You can turn off the \"auto\" brightness and extend the battery life quite a bit.  Keeping the wireless feature \"on\" will also drain the battery quickly, so I only turn on wireless when I need it, and otherwise turn it off.  Overall, I feel the battery life is good, albeit a bit shorter than I might have expected.  It will last the better part of a full day, even with heavy use.The processor is quick; I've had no issues with download speeds and my kids have had fun playing games on it with no issues.  It hasn't crashed or stalled at all in nearly 4 weeks of fairly regular daily use.The only knock on this tablet is that its wireless antenna seems a bit weak -- my phone can pick up a stable and strong wireless signal throughout my house, on every floor.  This device struggles to find a usable signal if I go to another floor, or if I get more than about 20 feet from our wireless router -- and I have a fairly high-end router.  So, I can't give it 5 stars.But, overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and can give it a strong recommendation.UPDATE, 9/11/13Not thrilled with the wireless reception I had been getting on the ASUS, I switched to the other \"band\" (frequency) of my wireless router (I have a dual-band Netgear 4300 that uses both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz standards) and was pleased to see that the signal strength improved noticeably on the ASUS tablet.  I had been using the 5G signal, but the antenna seems to do better with the 2.4GHz signal, and I can get a usable wireless signal throughout my house now.

There are higher rez (and higher priced) tablets but I was delighted by how responsive and adaptable this IPS unit is for being under $300. I have played with other tablets, even the Ipad and the Fire, but this one has size without weight and bells and whistles without a high price tag.

There was no problem (thank you AMAZON) with the return and replace and though I rarely use it for movies (having larger screens available) I have and it worked great... on this small a screen the native reslution is plenty and I don't hook it up to the HDTVs because I have an internet tv and a laptop to use in that way. Photos and videos taken with it are clear and natural and I love that I can carry a small library with me anywhere. Complaints? Only two and they aren't ASUS's fault... Flash does not run on it so I have to wait to get on my laptop to see flash videos that arent set up for YouTube (which it handles just fine). And I can't get it to play Amazon Prime movies! Only the FIRE and the ipad can! Grrr.!!! However no problem with Netflix etc... The battery does several hours of web before needing a boost and sound is excellent for a tablet... better than the ipadIV my house mate has!

This case is a must have for the tablet! It fits perfectly and offers a lot of protection. You must have a case for your tablet. I also purchased a 32GB SD card for additional storage. I intend to move a lot of my music, photos & videos to the tablet and will store them there.The speakers are really good and sound great. I get about 5 hours on a charge and it recharges quickly in about 3 hours. I never let it run down below 30%. The camera works well and the pictures are sharp & well focused. The microphone is sensitive and the voice recognition works just great. The WIFI is sensitive and connects very well with my wireless router. The apps load fast and run quickly. The display is clear & sharp for most uses. It would have been nice to have higher resolution, but it is fine for most uses. Over all I really like this tablet and feel it is worth the price. I have had none of the problems reported by others regarding lockups, failure to boot, screen scratches and speaker or battery problems. I feel that it is a good choice over the Kindle, if only for the rear facing camera plus a webcam on the front.There are however a few glitches I have experienced which take away from a perfect experience. Some may be related to the fact that I am using my SD card for extra storage and some are probably just Android glitches.I don't like the fact that the tablet turns on when you plug it into the charger. You then have to turn it off so that it will charge faster.The Asus Weather/Time widget has stopped connecting with Accuweather and will not update anymore. It worked for a couple of days. Haven't been able to get it to work again. A Google search reveals that others have had this problem tooI want to be able to copy files (music, photos, videos) from my desktop PC (Windows XP) to the tablet. I am able to copy music (MP3), photos (JPG), but Windows won't let me copy videos (MP4) to the tablet. It says the file type is not supported by the device. It will, for some reason, let me copy WMV video files, but WMV files won't play on the Android tablet. I have to work around this by changing the file type extension on my MP4 files to WMV and then copy them. The Android tablet then doesn't seem to care what the file extension is and plays them just fine once I get them there! I worked with Asus support on this and they were unable to provide any solution. I had hoped they would have updated USB drivers for their tablet, but they don't. They have drivers for their \"Transformer\" tablet only. Maybe updated Android USB drivers would have allowed Windows to properly recognize the deviceWhen I connect the tablet to my PC via USB, the Windows file manager shows duplicate entries for the folders on the tablet's SD card. Also, whenever I connect it to my PC without even copying files or doing anything, all of the files in my folders on the SD card are suddenly duplicated! The tablet file manager doesn't show them duplicated, just the Asus player/viewers. The only way I can eliminate the duplicate files is to (using the tablet file manager) create a new folder under a different name, cut & paste all the files to the new folder, then delete the old folder. This duplicate file problem also occurs when an update is applied to one of the apps.Doing a Google search on these problems I have found others have experienced these problms with other devices, including smart phones. It seems that the Android OS has some glitches. No one reported the Windows file copying problem however.I don't have experience with other brand tablets, so I don't know how they compare.

Adjusting the volume is a little involved if you don't have the keyboard. You have to go  into setting to change the volume. If there is a more direct way, I haven't come across it yet. I think it would be nice to have some volume buttons along the side.Overall a good purchase. I would do it again. If you're looking for an inexpensive (not cheap) tablet, go for it.There is one small issue. The product is solid, but it could be a little more \"solid\" IMO. You don't have to handle it gingerly or anything like that. It just could be a little more sturdy.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, great value!", "Author": "Nathaniel Newman \"xmguy\"", "ReviewID": "R221MY4ZIUYYOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy! For less than $150 I got a HD res screen (720p or 1280x800), Quad Core CPU (1.2 GHz), 1 GB of RAM (a bit limited on RAM, would have liked atleast 2. But for a device that is almost a total \"Google\" experience so 1 GB is doable as long as not many apps are running/background). The tablet is also very light weight. Again coming from a 10 \" Viewsonic G TAB that weighed as much as a notebook PC this tablet (Asus) is a relief. This \"might\" be better too than the the \"higher end\" FHD model since it only has a Intel Dual Core processor.So to sum it up I would recommend this tablet to others. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a VGA or 1.3 MP Front camera.Now some negitives....The body did creak a bit on mine, the sides. So I removed the back cover and added some tiny tape strips to the body where the back meets the front and it cleared it right up.

Ash \"krash56\"", "ReviewID": "R11JFKFYSE2G8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet. I have owned a few tablets at this point and this has been the BEST so far. I have researched endlessly for a few weeks now looking for the right price and technical specs for a tablet. I started with a Pandigital Novel and got my feet wet, then went to a Pandigital Planet, decided to go big time and got a Samsung Galaxy P7510 with a very big price tag and finally went to a Barnes and Noble Nook HD+ when the screen cracked on my Galaxy. This is my experience and things I have learned. First, if you are complaining that the Asus MeMo screen resolution is outdated for a 10 inch tablet, let me just say that after using the Nook HD+ with 1920x1280 and after the Galaxy's 1280 x 800, I happy to be back to 1280x800. If you are younger and have really good eye sight I say go for a higher resolution, if you are older like me stick to a lower resolution. Higher is simply too hard to read and games that I use like Hardwood Backgammon is just too small. You have to jump through hoops to get larger fonts that can actually be read, especially when reading ebooks. The display on this tablet if amazing. I haven't tried it on HDMI yet because I need an adapter but in my opinion you can't get any better than this. Second, this tablet is lightning fast with it's quadcore processor. You barely have to touch the screen to get it to respond. The default keyboard that comes with it is beautiful, it has a blue background with white buttons and black fonts on the keys. It comes with some of the greatest animated wallpaper I have seen so far. It gives you two choices as to which launcher to use, the original JB 4.1 style and the new JB 4.2 style. Haven't made up my mind as to which one to use yet. It only comes with a few bloat-ware apps but does come with some nice ones as well, like App Backup, App Locker and Audio Wizard, plus it has some really nice Asus widgets. It is sleek looking and is very easy to hold in one hand. The micro sdcard pops in and out very well. All the ports are streamlined to a perfect fit and look. I have also used custom roms on all of my devices until now, this tablet doesn't need it in my opinion. So, in conclusion, if you are looking for a tablet with a nice smaller price tag, that is quadcore, can be setup up in minutes, isn't still running Honeycomb 3.0 or Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0, and looks nice, buy one of these tablets. You can't go wrong with Asus because they rock!Just wanted to add how amazing the battery life is also on this tablet. I ran it constantly off and on for about 18 hours and the battery was at 60%, with wifi on the whole time. I did have it connected to the computer off and on which I'm sure help it stay charged but still that is amazing to me.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS built the MeMO tablet with the right balence of performance vs cost.", "Author": "bill", "ReviewID": "R36JMCOO8EABK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good performance, excellent touch screen response, fantastic speakers but we wish they faced forward.

I've had this for over 5 months and I love this. Here's the reason why:1) I am maxed (full 16 gb internal and 16gb Sd card) and still runs efficient. I have movies, music, books, and a lot of apps but it doesn't seem to bother it.2) google play market compatible - great variety of free apps, low cost music and movies before coming out on DVD3) take great rear camera pictures. Quality compared to my iPhone 4 pictures is better. 5megapixels may seem low but perfect for up to 5x7 prints and doesn't take up too much memory.  Front facing not bad when there is a lot of light but grainy when lighting is bad. No flash on rear but doesn't require too much lighting.4) easy to link to wifi first time and automatic if saved. Unlike some electronics, it may say it's locating wifi signal when saved and trying to link. I go from house to house and linking to wifi is seemless that I forget I have to do some work when I go somewhere new.5) even for 10 inches, compact and light. I carry tablet everywhere. So convenient.6) accessories made specific to this tablet. Not mainstream like a samsung galaxy or iPad so not as expensive but not generic where you gamble when you buy accessories. The accessories bought fit perfect. The case and the screen protector do not block any of the buttons, camera or \"outlets\" (charger, headphones, etc)I will review the accessories separately.7) doesn't take an expert to use. I taught my mom how to use and she doesn't even know how to answer a phone call on a smartphone. My 3 year old twin nephews are also able to use no problem.8) able to watch movies from Flixster, Netflix, SD card and Google play. No internet needed, except for Netflix.9) can transfer music from iTunes to this tab with no problems. Also vice versa.10) asus specific apps are interesting.  I don't use the webstorage since I already have google drive, but I like how the asus album and art.I haven't found a negative worth mentioning yet and unless you are a brand name shopper, you will be happy with this purchase. Best 10.1 inch tablet out there for the price. I know a samsung galaxy 10 owner and he said that the tablet is comparable. Only major difference is Hd and the appearance of some icons other than that, he said it actually runs better. I know iPad owners and they were impressed. Just some image differences and iPad did run a lil faster, but other than that, they definitely said they would purchase this instead of a samsung if they wanted an android tab.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent replacement for my netbook", "Author": "mschowell \"mschowell\"", "ReviewID": "R6Y2MLS11GZDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my little ASUS netbook had slowed down to the point I felt like I was on a dial-up line, I purchased this tablet and a keyboard cover as a replacement. I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I'm delighted that this new ASUS product lives up to and actually exceeds my expectations. The tablet is primarily used when I travel, or as an emergency back-up when my middle-aged desktop is having problems. The response time is plenty fast, and the battery life has exceeded 8 hours with life to spare. It's a bit heavier than my netbook was, but I won't quibble over a few ounces. And the keyboard is a definite improvement over the netbook, as it seems to be close to full size.  My only significant complaint is the miserable documentation that comes with the tablet and with the keyboard. Downloading the manual was pretty much a waste of time. However, information available on the Web and from the reviewers at Amazon filled in most of the blanks, and general information on the care and feeding of Android tablets took care of the rest. For a newbie to this non-Windows world, research time was fairly extensive, but the payoff was worth it. A second complaint is the lack of USB ports on the device, but the purchase of an inexpensive OTG cable to convert the micro USB to a regular sized USB took care of most of my needs. And also, I bought an inexpensive 6 foot cable to use with the charger as the one supplied was too short for many situations. Last complaint is that the light that displays when charging the tablet is obscured when the tablet is in the keyboard case, so I cannot get a quick view of whether the device is yet fully charged.

In a nutshell, I hated Windows 8. I've been using Android phones for a few years now & I thought the OS has come far enough that if I put in a little effort, I could completely replace the PC. I took the laptop back & bought the MemoPad. I also got the matching KB/case, an OTG cable & a \"Plugable\" USB powered hub. I'm typing this review using the BT keyboard right now. I have my Logitech USB mouse plugged into the hub & am streaming music from my external USB HDD via BT to my home theater receiver. If I can accomplish all that simultaneously on a tablet, I can definitely live without a PC. All I have to do is pick up a Wifi printer & I'll be set. Sure, it won't play CD's, but I haven't used those in a long time anyway. The best part is I can unplug the OTG cable, close it up & take it with me, as easily as my phone. I don't have to carry the charger or any accessories with me, so it's not cumbersome like my old laptop was. Android hasn't been around as long as the competition, so it still has it's quirks & bugs, but considering the cost & overall convenience, it's worth it for me. So far, mission accomplished. I am living a completely Microsoft & Apple free lifestyle & my total investment was less than half of what the returned laptop was. The next step will be to root it & start checking out the alternative ROM's for it.
