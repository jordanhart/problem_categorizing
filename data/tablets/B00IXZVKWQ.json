For $125 it's an outstanding value. I had no problems with set up, with installing 90% of what I wanted to put on it. But there are a few things that keep me from making this a 5 star review.The first issue is major power consumption. This is my 3rd tablet, my first 10\" one. So I'm not a total novice at configuration. No matter what I disable or what I run this tablet eats power like crazy. Just reading a book with a minimal reader wifi etc disabled etc, I can't get more than 3 hours without having to plug it back in. With a battery conservation application I can stretch it to 4 sometimes. But play a game, watch a movie or listen to music and it goes even faster than that. The battery for this tablet is very weak.I'm constantly charging this tablet or using it on the AC charger which kind of defeats the purpose of a tablet. Taking this on a trip I'd definitely have to have a backup charging system, some way of charging it via car battery, battery pack, on a plane, whatever because otherwise I'd run out of juice half way through the flight, train ride, or drive. Probably more than once. FYI, it came with a usb cable but I could not get it to charge via USB until I swapped out that cable for one I had for my other tablet. I bought the keyboard case too. That's nice, but the included stylus was really crappy. Tiny and just junk really. It's a freebie though so whatever. Just toss it and get a decent one for $10...The other thing I don't like is that there does not appear to be any driver for Windows that can make Win 7 see this tablet like it would a USB drive. So the data/charging cable is not only useless for charging it's useless for that too. I can plug it in and Windows will start to install it as a USB drive but lacking that specific driver the install fails, and yes, I checked ALL over the place. People are asking around about it, a lot, but that driver is hard as heck to actually find from what I can tell. (I really would have appreciated a CD with that driver included if it's that hard to come by. Also a manual I can download because the one that comes with is so tiny in terms of type it's just nearly unreadable.) I got around the cable thing by getting a 32 GB card and loading that directly so it's not an insurmountable issue but it was a bit annoying.The last really big negative was a screen shot glitch I found. I'm very glad I bought the keyboard case because without it my table ends up taking screen shots CONSTANTLY. I haven't figured out if it's the placement of the screen shot icon on the bar or if it's something motion sensitive on the actual tablet but something causes this to happen constantly every time I remove the tablet from the case and attempt to use it by itself in my hands. Put in the case, it stops. I don't like alternative android launchers but I'm actually considering trying that to see if it helps. I'd like to be able to use the tablet sans the case while reading but I just can't so far as it is.Yes, I did try to reboot the tablet via that function. It made no difference. It was somewhat random but it happens a lot sans case. Hardly at all with it. Yes, I did email the seller. I don't think they know what causes it either. All they did was suggest I send it back and swap it. Fair enough, but I just really don't think it's a hardware issue, more of a software issue and I don't think that getting a new tablet for this one would help. I'm going to continue to mess with it, maybe try a new launcher sans a snap icon, and see what happens. If that doesn't do it then I may have to swap it, but I'm hoping not. I'm all set up again. done that twice now, and I just don't want to have to reload it again if I don't have to. Get rid of that snap icon and it might be fine, who knows?On the plus side the screen is great, the sound is very nice, and the cameras aren't bad. It actually comes with the basics to use even out of the box I was able to read a book, watch a video, and listen to music, even FLAC music, which I wasn't expecting to be able to do sans a new media player for that. No problem with the major video formats either. The touch sensitivity is pretty good until the battery is down to about a 1/3 but then it tanks a little. That's pretty typical from what I've seen though of all my tablets. Most touch screens seem to work better with full juice, so I won't consider that a flaw.It is a definite step up from my Blackberry 7\" tablet, loads a lot faster and runs far more, that's for sure, but I really wish that the battery was a lot more powerful and that it could be connected via cable to my PC like my Blackberry was so I could just transfer files via cable instead of having to take a card out every time I want to go there. I have a really hard time with Micro SD card slots. I can use one but I really prefer the cable/PC method to constantly popping out a card to add or delete anything.The \"flaws\" they aren't fatal and for the money it's still a no brainer. Yeah, I'd still say \"Save yourself some serious money and buy it!\" I'm not sorry I bought it, but there are apparently a few kinks I have to figure out before I'll be 100% pleased. I don't know that a person brand new to tablets would be as keen to, but I'm into giving it a fair shot. It's a good machine, could be a GREAT machine if I can just get those few things working like I want them to...", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet and solid seller", "Author": "rogerw", "ReviewID": "R2MKFVYQDVQQO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply put, this tablet is out perforing another tablet that cost several times as much.

It's the first tablet I've purchased, I was looking for an Android tablet that I could check email, video chat with my family, play games and use for internet access.  This definitely suits our needs and the larger screen is a plus.  It was very simple to get up and running and install apps.  Some reviewers commented on the short (3 hour) battery life and the camera could be better with only 2 MP.  This doesn't really impact our use and wasn't a deterrent for buying the tablets.  The camera took good close up pictures for posting, etc. so I would use my digital camera for any other purpose.  After using the tablet, I've left it on all day and still had power available.

I guess they are gaining market share. However I ran Quadrant test and it is better than all of the rest. It is light and well assembled. No squeaking, buttons are solid and responsive. The screen is very responsive also. I am huge fan of the gorilla glass products, this one has outdoor type screen that is little less polished. I have not tested the screen scratch and hit resistance, but seems good.Overall good tablet, no drawbacks. I am not aware how Allwiner do quad core semiconductor products that cheap, but Yes this is a quad core 10.1 inch fully functional tablet with Kitkat 4.4.3!!! Enjoy it :)Shamo's are great dealer as well I am very happy with them. I had an issue with my Allwiner, it was probably overfill with glass cleaner fluid and its on button malfunctioned. They were extremely responsive, offered me both to get my money back or to replace it. I asked for another tablet. Send them this one and I received new one in 3 days. You will have no issues with them. This is straight contact with their main office, no customer service fulling you around department and filing a claim. Straight to the point and flash response.

First, I don't if it is the screen protector that comes installed, but the the colors seen on the screen are not crisp but run together and bland.  The blues and purples are very hard to tell apart.  If you tilt the screen ever so slightly up or down or left to right the screen goes white to veiwing.  Poor viewing angles.  It is easy to set-up and operate.  The battery is weak after a couple hours it must be recharged.  I purchased a Samsung for $319 prior to this unit and I wasn't getting the value for my use, and I returned it.  So I decided to buy the Shamo.  For $120 plus shipping for my use and value this unit meets my needs.  When on vacation I take my 12 inch laptop, also, for checking e-mail and account, but use the Shamo for other things and the value is there for keeping this unit.  I just hope it last the test for time.  My wife has an I Pad the Shamo is not even close to comparision.  I had an HP $99 touchpad prior that finally gave out when I dropped it, and this unit is well below that unit also.

Wanted a 10\" tab as opposed to the smaller 7\".This tablet is awesome! Looks good(I got the black/has white back) and performs like an exspensive tablet! The only problem that I've had is because of the 10.1\" size it was hard to find a cover to protect it(most are 10\");however amazon has one specifically for this tab.. Problem solved. If you are looking for a great inexpensive tab I would highly recommend the Shamo's 10.1\" quad core. At 119.99 plus 9.99 shipping you won't be sorry! Cover was about $20 with shipping. Case with keyboard also available for this tablet; but unless you have a problem with a built in keyboard there is no reason to purchase this one.
