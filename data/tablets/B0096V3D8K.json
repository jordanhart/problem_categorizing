{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hits all the right marks", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2HSE7HGNPDSHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit hesitant to spend $300+ on a non-HD tablet, seeing as the Nexus 7 is only $199, but I'm very glad that I did. I am by no means an apple fanatic, I traded my iPhone 4 for a Galaxy Nexus and never looked back. However, the tablet ecosystem is much different than smartphones right now. I find myself using the iPad mini almost always over my phone now, aside from texting and calling. Here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:Fantastically smooth- seriously. You really don't need to compare android tablet specs with iPad's. The iPad will always have a lower clock speed and less ram, yet somehow perform beautifully and rarely have a hiccup. This has a dual core 1ghz, and my phone has a dual 1.2ghz. Yet, the iPad rarely skips a beat, while I have to occasionally kill apps or reboot my phone to keep its performance smooth.Battery is fantastic- I use this thing a LOT. Like, a few hours throughout the day. I blast music on the speakers, surf the web, tumblr, facebook, flipboard. Yet I only have to charge it maybe once every other day. I've played a half hour of music from the (also fantastic) speakers, and the battery moved 1%. It's great.The speakers are rich and loud as hell- I often used my roomie's laptop before I bought the ipad, and it worked. Now I have to use my ipad to listen to music, simply because it's louder and richer than the laptop speakers. And it's not a netbook, it's a standard 15.4 incher. The iPad mini is LOUD, in stereo. The bass even rocks. It's not extremely prominent, but it's a step up from the tinny wannabe bass from this laptop or my phone.Extremely easy to jailbreak- for the tinkerers out there. I love to tinker, thus the android phone I own. But with evasi0n jailbreak, you literally plug the iPad into the computer, hit a button, 5 minutes later, jailbroken.Slim, sleek, and light- This thing is a feat of technology, reminiscent of the first iPod nano. It just makes you think, how the hell did they fit all that into this tiny case? Holding the ipad mini for extended periods proves to be comfortable and painless, and it literally just slides into my backpack effortlessly when I'm traveling. I never wanted an iPad before, simply because they were too big, and 7 inch tablets were too narrow and small. This ipad gets it right.iPad specific apps- This is a big point in the android vs iPad wars. Android tablets are generally cheaper than iPads, with faster and higher capacity internals. On paper, they win over the iPad in every way. But where the iPad really outshines them is the apps. Many 7 inch android tablet apps are just scaled-up versions of their phone counterparts. But the iPad, being popular as it is, has developers writing entirely new versions of their apps specifically for the larger tab. And they look great. They're functional, convenient, and reliable. Apps like flipboard, youtube, and tumblr come to mind. Whereas on a Nexus 7, these apps are just scaled up (10 inch tabs get a tablet version of youtube, which is actually pretty cool though).UI (user interface)- Apple is known for taking simplicity and perfecting it for the masses. The iPad's UI is the pinnacle of their design. It just works, and it works well. Apps are organized in a 4x5 grid, with room for 6 on the dock at the bottom. The notification bar pulls down from the top just as it has since iOS5, and holding the home buttom gives you a nice greeting from siri. But the multitouch gestures are really where it shines. 4 fingers swiped up opens the multitasking bar. While in an app, 4 fingers swiped side to side switches between other open apps. And my favorite, 5 fingers pinched in at any point takes you back to the home screen. I had always griped about having to hit the physical home button, and this solves that issue. Also, swiping to the left of the multitasking bar gets you to quick settings, such as music control, brightness, volume, and orientation lock. Nifty.Cons:The non-retina display- Honestly, I think the only reason this bothers me is because my phone has a 720p HD display, which is becoming the norm these days, with high end phones getting 1080p this year. The screen isn't bad, it's bright and colorful. It's just not extremely crisp. It's especially noticeable when reading smaller text. I'm sure later this year Apple will find a way to cram a retina display in, and maybe I'll upgrade. But probably not, because it's honestly not that big of a deal in everyday use. The device is still an extreme pleasure to use. And this is my only con.Overall, I'd highly recommend the mini. It's a great tweener for the iPhone and full sized iPad. It's become my go-to device, and I really enjoy using it everyday. If you have the extra capital and are in the market for a reliable, responsive tablet, go for the iPad mini.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet I've used so far...comes with a few cons though", "Author": "casper", "ReviewID": "R106Y8MK1Q0AUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everyone else already covered the essential characteristics, features and functions of the ipad mini, so instead, I'd approach this review on a practicality basis to let you know how it works for me.Things I'd like to touch on are non retina, slower A5 processor, screen size, and physical build qualityLACK OF RETINA DISPLAYI've seen countless reviews of people complaining that the non retina display on the ipad mini is a pain to use and the fuzziness of texts is unbearable to read ...well...it's not!!!!! Yes the ipad mini screen display could've been a lot better and sharper than it currently is but to be honest, I think users of iPhone 4/4s/5, ipad3/4, and all other iDevices that currently use retina screens are just spoiled by being accustom to apple having retina that they have a state of mind that they won't accept anything less than retina quality from apple.A lot of other mobile companies have screens a lot worse than retina but yet still people accept it mainly because their expectations for the other brands aren't as high as what they'd expect from apple...people love the non retina MacBook Pros...and reading texts on that machine isn't a pain or unbearable right?I'd love to see retina on the next releases of the new ipad minis schedules for later this year but in the mean while, I'm pretty satisfied with the existing display...it's not great, but it's also far from being bad.A5 PROCESSORThis is the reason I took away 1 star from making this product earn a 5 star review....the major blow to me of this device is that it has an A5 processor and not that it lacks a retina display...for those who are unaware, the A5 chip comes with built in RAM which only has the capacity of 512mb...doing basic things on the ipad mini doesn't require an A5x or aA6 chip but with the more intense apps like Waze, graphic intense games, and even Facebook, you'd begin to experience some slow downs on your device...again, not unbearable, but definitely not a smooth experience as one would like.Is it a dealbreaker? If I'm relying on just specs on paper, then YES....however, if I'm basing my purchase of an ipad mini on actual use of the device forgetting specs and just seeing how the device works in real life situations...then NO...although the ipad mini only has 512mb of RAM it's not a slouch. iOS is very hardware efficient and you won't feel the lack of 1gb RAM on iOS as much as you would on an android device running jelly bean for example.SCREEN SIZEthis is honestly the best screen size I've experienced on any tablet thus far. You can easily type with both thumbs while holding the ipad mini in portrait mode (something that wasn't possible with the classic sized iPads unless you split the keyboard).A 7.9\" screen is a joy to carry around as its not too large and not too small neither. My sentiments are that 7\" is a little too small for a tablet as they're phones already close to that size such as the galaxy note series. At first I wasn't too sure how I'd feel about the extra .9 of an inch thinking to myself that it's not a significant amount of extra real estate to satisfy me seeing as I previously owned an ipad 3, but to my suprise, it's just the right size for my personal taste.I know you probably heard this countless times before but I too think that this should've been the size of the iPads all along as now that I own a mini, I'd never go back to that 9.7\" of the classic iPads...I find myself carrying around and using my ipad mini a lot more than I did with my ipad 3 even though it was faster and had a better display....this ipad mini simply is what a tablet is supposed to be....PORTABLE!!!PHYSICAL BUILD QUALITYThe ipad mini is a wonderful piece of hardware. Detail given by apple in the production of this machine is simply amazing. From the moment you hold it in your hands you'd feel the love and great R&D; they put into this device. It does come with a few drawbacks but the pros by far outnumbers the cons.It is the nicest lookin ipad yet, best screen size in my opinion, best with regards to portability and it does everything it's bigger brothers do, a bit slower, but in real time it's only a few milliseconds slower though which to me is not substantial.Next gen ipad mini with a faster processor and retina screen WILL be the best ipad you can possibly get, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with the ipad mini and can safely recommend this device to anyone looking for an excellent, lightweight and portable tablet", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Mini was advertised as new but it was used and defective", "Author": "Kym", "ReviewID": "R1OZFVNHQMAS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I placed an order for the iPad Mini 64 GB WIFI.

However, to my surprise, when I went to register the device to qualify for Apple's free one year warranty, I was informed that the device had already been registered by another user in 2012 and that I only had 119 days remaining in the warranty.

I paid $519 for a device that was advertised as new but it was not.  I didn't have a way to contact the shipper so I contacted Amazon.  They instructed me to return the item for a refund.

I'm in love with the size and design of Apple's new version of the iPad.I'm in the Marines and when we're deployed, a light pack is a must and we face a lot of down-time. I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2.

It is on the road to extinction as I am and I wanted a device to store my library of video documentaries. I would watch these videos while waiting on my wife while visiting her many doctors.

I use it everyday mostly for reading. I've tried many games on it and found the game experience to be wanting.iPad mini changes everything.Before taking the Mini home, there were things I obviously liked, and some things I was a little worried about. For instance, although you can hold the Mini with no effort because of how light it is, I heard talk that comic books were harder to read because of the smaller size.i haven't found this to be true. After reading several comics, I am very pleased with the experience.And games - all those games I couldn't quite get into because of the size of the larger iPads have now been opened up to me. The lightness of the mini, combined with the positioning of your hands on it's smaller frame have changed the experience. The thin bezel at the sides has proven to be plenty wide enough for me. The same games I tried on the larger iPad 2 are now much more enjoyable on the iPad mini. A big enough screen to enjoy the action, but not so big as to introduce awkwardness.Oh, also the speakers on the Mini are great. You will not be straining to hear what's going on in the videos you watch and games you play, unlike the iPad 2 experience.Throw in Siri and a respectable camera, and the iPad mini is the defining iPad experience in my opinion. I don't even miss not having retina, as some theorized would be the case.Do yourself a favor and get at least the 32 gb size. You don't want to continuously have to delete stuff in order to make room. Also, iPads slow down when they start getting low on memory. 32 gb will give you plenty of room for lots of stuff to enjoy, while leaving enough room so your iPad doesn't get bogged down.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet: And Notes About the EcoSystem", "Author": "W. Zimmerman", "ReviewID": "R1VWIDDX9QNDOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ABOUT THIS REVIEWERI'm a Prime Amazon customer. In this household we use Amazon to shop for all sorts of things.  I am an early adopter and love tech, but as we have come to rely on technology more and more, it has become less of a toy and something that simply has to work all the time, whether for an online web conference or for the kid's homework.ABOUT THE iPAD MINIConstruction: I was getting ready to write this review and managed to set my iPad mini on a bar-height kitchen counter top precariously, and it fell to the floor.  Hitting a wood floor no less.  Happy to report nothing happened. No scratches, no dings, operating just fine.  Didn't plan to start by writing about the construction of the iPad mini, but this is a device you'll move around a lot, take in the car, stuff in airplane seat pockets, cram into backpacks.  This thing is amazingly light, but built like a tank.  It can take it.Use: It is a joy to use.  Clear screen, easy operation, all the features work all the time... And of course you can find an application for just about anything.  Here is the best part, if you have more than one Tablet around (we have a couple iPads in the household), everything works the same way on the regular and the mini sized iPads.  Even better, using one account shared on these devices means that we only have to purchase an App once and we can use it on a couple different iPads.Choices: My wife prefers the larger iPad for email and my teens like the larger one for movies and drawing, but I love this mini size for travel.  It's just personal preference.  You can argue specs all you want, but basically the mini and the regular sized iPads are identical in function, battery life, apparent resolution, and so forth. The only question is your own preference as to size and weight. (And the Mini is less expensive than the full size.)Apps: Email is a breeze, web browsing is simple and quick, and if you are into photography, this little gem offers an amazing still shot and video camera. And with all those apps it can be just about anything from a network diagnostic tool to a book collection, from a banking tool to a game pad, or a weather forecaster to a music player...COST OF OWNERSHIPWhen it comes to picking a Tablet, think about the purchase price over time. I have PC netbooks in the house that lasted less than a year.  Most of the PC laptops lasted 2 years or so.  But the Apple products simply don't quit.  We have an original iPad that is as good as new, and Apple desktops and laptops that keep getting handed down from one family member to another because they don't stop.  Yes, they are more expensive to purchase at first, but we save a huge amount of money because they keep working for years and years.  We don't have money to waste, that's for sure.TOTAL ECOSYSTEMAnd here is the real decision point, at least for this household.  It's all about the ecosystem, or the suite of hardware and software that work together.  I'm no longer content to have a cool laptop, or a great Tablet.. I want it all working together, and this is where Apple products shine. We have personal and family calendars that update on our phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.  We do the same with email and magazine subscriptions and so much more.  We can share photos and music on all of these devices and on the TV as well (hooked to an Apple TV box). We can save files \"in the cloud\" and access them from anywhere, anytime, on any device.  This is how it is supposed to work.  My son is into programming and finds the Unix-based environment of the Mac to be the best place to work.  My daughter is into photography and has professional-level tools at the ready.  My wife is doing genealogy research and helping the kids with school (and life in general), and I have a company to run.  It's all on this integrated, connected, suite that works all the time, without nearly any effort from me to keep it running. And backups?  All automatic and all in the cloud, and yes, I've had to recover from backups before and it worked like it was supposed to.As I said at the start, we use Amazon Prime all the time. Love it. But I want the technology in our household to be what we want it to be, not a constant reminder to buy more.  Really disappointed that Amazon created their Kindle Fires as a way to sell more stuff. And yes, you can turn off the adds (by paying to do so), but not the recommendations. Beyond that, though, the Kindles and Kindle Fire are not part of an overall solution that can work together.SAFE and STABLEWe used to be a PC household, but that required 10 to 15 hours of month of \"tech support\" time from me to keep the computers and laptops and network operating.  No longer. It just works.  I also appreciate that the UNIX backbone of the Mac OS is less susceptible to viruses and the like. I don't have time to worry about the problems that Android phones are having now with viruses or hackers either.  True, all platforms can be attacked, but we are dealing with orders of magnitude here; the Apple world is more locked down, but in return I get more stability and we spend less time making it all work.CUSTOMER SUPPORTBack to this theme of saving time.  I love the fact that I can open up my iPad or my laptop and reserve an appointment at my local Apple Store with a few clicks.  Walk in the store, have the person up front confirm my arrival and be working with a decent tech person in just a few minutes.  I've had nothing but great service, and several times they went well beyond: as with older machines that were way past warranty but fixed at no charge, or the time I had an iPhone with a scratched camera lens. Replaced on the spot, no charge. If you are honest with them, they will be with you.So, that's our story.

Despite my being a huge Apple fan, I wasn't sure I'd put this to good use. In the past month I've really come to love this thing.First off, while this does not have the advanced retina display of the iPad3, it produces a very clear and crisp image. It makes this the perfect device to use as an ereader because it can be held in one hand, yet it has the full functionality of a full size iPad minus advanced retina display.The speedy processor makes this lightening fast and unbelievably responsive and zippy. I use this just as I use my iPad2 and that means I can use it not just recreationally but also for some vital business functions. Like my iPhone, it keeps me in touch with my mail as well as the net while being easier to manipulate. If an app works on the iPad it will work on the Mini..I like the screen size which is just about perfect for a portable device that can fit in my hand and in a smaller purse. In fact, one of the reasons my husband popped for this is because it is comparable in size to a Kindle and is really portable and does not require a special carrying case, etc.The iSight camera, at 5 megapixels, is great. Produces clear and vivid pictures without any distortion.The all aluminum body is solid and the mini's construction is flawless. It is razor thin and weighs in well under a pound.I like the Lightening connector, but that does have a downside in that this is not interchangeable with the 30 prong connector that powers all of my other devices except the iPad4.Another new feature I like is SIRI. All you have to do is depress the screen button to activate SIRI which functions as a personal assistant. I'm still learning how to use it, but it is great to be able to access information with verbal commands.My only real complaint re: the mini is its price. It seems about $50 to $75 too high for what it is and how it compares to other tablets out there. Still, if you are a happy Apple user you'll pay the asking price.Ideally, this is best utilized by people on the go. It really suits my lifestyle since I am usually all over the place. Since there are hot spots everywhere I go, it is never a problem to find free wi-fi.I am updating my review nearly three months later. I really love this baby iPad. I'd be hard pressed to say whether I'd toss my iPad4 or my mini if I had to make a choice. I also have come to view the mini's price as fair given its quality and ease of operation. Of late, my Mini has gone everywhere with me. It is so compact, convenient, and discrete that it adds no appreciable weight to my purse and I can even carry a smaller purse now.  I love this thing.

With the exception of a shiny white iMac computer, and older 30 gig iPod  we are a Windows centric business. I have access to an older Pandigital android tablet, Kindle Fire, Asus RT, Acer W500 running WIndows 8.1 pro and WIndows 8 phone.Yes, the iPad was easy to learn but I have been working with computer technologies since 1977. The build quality good but not any more impressive than that of my Asus RT tablet and the Dell Venue Pro 8 I worked with for a few days. My hat off to Apple for getting folks to accept a consumption device that does not support flash or something as simple as downloading MP3 files from sites other than iTunes. I spent $4.95 for a browser app that supports flash. In all my years of using computers, this is the first time I have felt compelled to buy a browser!If I want to view and hear a YouTube video posted in the Facebook app, I must display it in Safari. The Apps store and iTunes take an exceptionally long time to load. I had to add an app just to be able to download our MP3 files! Speech commands and dictation require you be on line for Siri to connect with Apple servers (shades of Chromebook dependency on a Wi-Fi connection.) We all know how \"secure\" our internet data is so why not? (cough, cough) In Windows 8 tablets,the free built-in Microsoft Speech to text and control software is designed for off line as well as on line use.Even after adjusting font size options, screen print is often too small to read comfortably and zoom does not always work. Wi-Fi is slower than any other portable device I own. I can't argue against success but am dumbfounded such a limited device with an equally impressive high price has become the tablet standard. I am spoiled by tablets that allow full access to flash sites, true off line accessibility and file downloads.

I couldn't believe what I'd been missing! Since them I've owned an iPhone 4s, Nano, iPad 2 (which I wouldn't be caught without) and most recently, after replacing the screen on my 4s twice already( it's broken again)- a new iPhone 3G to tide me over until my upgrade.Id rather have an old Apple device than consider the competitors.My daughter recently stepped on and cracked my iPad 2 so I decided to go with the mini as replacement. But only after considering a Microsoft Surface. I'm a student.I couldn't have picked a better Christmas present for myself.It's is larger than I expected and honestly, I prefer the smaller- than- iPad size. I don't long for a bigger screen like I had expected to.The image quality is also much better than I expected given that it doesn't have the retina. It SEEMS crisper than my old iPad. Is it my imagination?In Apples defense, I have yet to behold the retina display everyone raves about. But you can't missed what you've never had is my moto. The only reason I even considered the Retina is for the extra ram...This iPad isn't as snappy as as my iPad 2, but I expected that because I read the reviews...don't hate me...it's true!It's much like the difference in the 3G and 4S. Even my downloaded games lag.It is NOT just a wifi issue.Its smaller thus less powerful. It's not the iPad fault. You appreciate it for what it is. And I do.I was pleasantly surprised to have Siri back as I'd forgotten that the newer iPads support her. Nice!I can't go over the technical specs because I'm not THAT savvy. But as an iPad user, someone who considered my iPad 2 a necessity, I feel I have insight. It's a wonderful device to own and I came back to it in the end after considering others.I love my new iPad mini.

What's great is the fact that Apple makes it so easy to download and manage all your media between their various products. I proceeded to sync all my music, movies and games/apps onto it and then came the fun part: testing everything out. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the speakers especially for a tablet. The sound was loud and crystal clear. Movies look absolutely gorgeous even on this model which DOES NOT have the retina display. Since I stream movies through Netflix and Amazon I felt it wasn't worth spending more money on extra hard drive space that wasn't going to get used. Games that I usually play on my iPhone work awesome on the Mini mostly due to the larger display. While some might like the bigger screen on the iPad, this one is just a tad smaller (1.8 inches to be exact) which in all honesty is plenty big in my opinion. When holding the Mini, which you can do with one hand by the way, it definitely feels more like a tablet vs. holding a clipboard like it's larger sibling.

After all, do I really need a third iPad?  There was a decent sale at the time and I decided to go for it and I have not regretted the purchase for one minute.Overall, the features, speed, front and rear camera, etc. are very comparable to its larger counterparts, however it is available in this smaller, more lightweight, compact and easier to carry mini form.  I find that taking this with me on a business or personal trip makes the bag much lighter and for equivalent features.  Taking photos with this product is much less awkward looking too than when i see people posing for the full size iPads (I still can't bring myself to do this).  I would say size wise, it is about 70% of the full size iPad but this has no great impact on the ability to read emails or type any differently than the larger iPad.  The full size iPads almost seem too large now that I am accustomed to the compact mini.I don't want to get into all the features of the iPad overall as I have not noticed any differences between this and my other iPads.  I have heard the RAM is less on the mini, but I have not noticed any difference as previously indicated.  It is well integrated with other Apple products, which I love about the iPads.

I compare them side by side. The screen & resolution of Mini ipad is the worst as compared to others. After seeing the text on Dell & Samsung tab 8\" (1280x800 resolution), I don't want to read any thing on Mini Ipad ANY MORE. 1280x800 should be the minimal resolution for reading. The text looks nicer, sharper, much easier to read, and importantly, puts much less strain on your eyes. Text on Ipad Mini appears blurry as compared to Dell & Samsung, therefore, is hard to read on such small device.Web searching & emailing & reading experience is best on Dell window tablet b/c it is a regular computer. Android & Ipad can not compare to it. There are many webpages that I can not zoom in & out, & text is too small to read w/o zooming on Ipad Mini. Also, Dell is faster opening the webpages.. Longer screen of Dell & Samsung is better for reading b/c it could include more text in landscape view. But, Ipad Mini is better (to me) to watch video b/c its wider 4:3 screen size produces larger screen view for movie viewing.Pictures & games look good on ALL these three devices.All these 3 devices are beautiful in their own ways and all are light & are comfy to hold. BUT, Mini Ipad is very slippery b/c of its very smooth back side. However, one needs to buy a jacket for it any way. Ipad Mini is wider, so, is harder to hold in one hand (in portray view) AS COMPARED to slimmer Dell & Samsung tablets.No SD card to expand is a HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad.No USB port is another HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad (one got to pay extra $$$ for a USB adapter).Many basic, common functions for daily use are lacking or are very difficult to use in Ipad Mini, & so, are HUGE disadvantages, i.e: files transfer, video transfer, or documents (words/PDF) transferring & reading/editing .... Even if you pay for doc/Word editing apps, those edited files will not appear like what you make them when you open them on your regular computer/laptop. You don't want to go through few hundreds edited pages to proof read again. How can it be used for school works as people have claimed ?? I'm wondering !!!. I recently found few free apps that allow users to easily perform some of the above functions (transferring & viewing mostly) - this is one of big reasons why I bought Mini Ipad for my kids JUST NOW. Ipad forums show that ALL Ipad users have been suffering this limit for decades ...... . BUT, despite of these facts, & even though after many years, many Ipad fans still SHAMELESSLY deny its limitation, or lie about it, or still blindly defend it - many of them are probably on Apple pay roll, trying to push the sale by lying.One thing that Ipad Mini wins over others is its apps & games. But, Android device is not far behind, and reality is you don't see much difference between them when you look for apps for your daily needs, your daily uses.Also, The cost for Mini Ipad is high for its value at this current time, and is higher than other devices which have many better features. Ipad Mini should be around $200 or less.My kids' relatives have Ipads, and kids like to play games together. Therefore, I have to buy Ipad for them instead of other devices. I buy Dell device for myself.

You will only realize how big a problem this is when you discover how many apps won't work unless they are connected to a cellular network.  Sprint is a big mistake. Should have done more homework because their cheaper data plans don't make up for their network architecture shortcomings.  True enough, the iPad works fine when connected with WiFi, but outside the U.S. WiFi networks remind me of 300 baud modems -- \"you are now connected to the world wide wait\".Another problem with the iPad is the inability to import photos using an Apple supplied SD card reader that plugs into the mini's Lightning port.  Turns out, Apple has got the iPad software so locked down that the card reader won't function with an SD card from anything other than the simplest point and shoot camera.

I will not go too much into technical aspects, overall functionality, and capabilities of the ipad mini.  There's a great apple website for that.  I will however tell you why I like the mini for my 3 year old son over the ipad 2.To give full disclosure, we love apple products.  Our family pretty much owns every single iThing that apple makes.  My son's been using an ipod touch practically ever since he was born.  So...a little over a year ago, we upgraded him to an ipad 2, which he absolutely loved.  With apps like Tozzle, Teach me Toddler, and the Toca Boca apps, which kid wouldn't?  My son has learned so much from using the educational apps on a daily basis.  Here's a question for you though...What are 2, 3 and even some year 4 year olds better at than being sponges and quickly learning things?BREAKING THINGSAn ipad is most definitely something most of us can not afford to be broken.  So to protect mine, I bought a OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Black.  Once on, this case is just awesome and protects your ipad like a tank.  But to a 2 year old with slippery fingers, it might as well weigh 50 pounds at that point.  Now that my son is 3, he's gotten used to it and knows to carry it with both hands, but it's still a little heavy and bulky for him.This is where the ipad mini comes into play.  I was a little hesitant at first to pre-order one since it didn't come with a retina display like the 2.  I went ahead and convinced myself that we needed a an upgrade in gigs.  Who knew that 16 gigs on an ipad 2 would not be enough?  I got the 32gig mini in white and setup was a breeze.  I was able to just plug it in and choose the last back up of the ipad 2 for configuration.  It immediately loaded all our favorite apps, songs, pictures, and movies to the mini without hassle.  The look on his face when I handed it to him was just priceless.  He had the biggest smile on his face and his exact wordswere, \"it's a baby ipad.\"He absolutely loves this thing even more.  He's been using it solely for about a week now and has not dropped it once.  We got him the i-Blason ArmorBox Series 2 Layer Hybrid Protection Case For Apple New iPad Mini 7.9 Inch with Kick Stand Kids Friendly (Multi Color) - Blue / White and Ionic Screen Protector Film MATTE (Anti-Glare) for New Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch / the iPad Mini 7 Inch / built-in Stand for Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch Latest Generation 4G LTE (3-pack) just in case though.  Even with this case, it's still far lighter than the ipad 2 with the otterbox.  He can now easily carry the \"baby ipad\" from room to room.All in all, the ipad mini is basically an ipad 2 that went on a diet and exercised.  It's smaller, lighter, and faster.  Perfect for your little one at home who's curious about everything.  The Ipod touch was too little for our son, the regular Ipad was too big, the mini...Is just right =) We still kept the ipad 2, cause that is perfect for mommy and daddy.

Unfortunately, this unit was lost during a recent trip to Central Asia, so I decided to upgrade and get one with retina display and 1Gb of memory.

For example, the galaxy tab note has a ton of better features than mini. The mini is very simple very basic. It's almost like a big version of iPhone or phablet. I have had the experience of using mini and when I compared it to my old nexus 7 and galaxy note for me I could see the big difference in the operation system, features, and the overall quality of all the three devices and basically decided that I prefer android tablets (namely Samsung or nexus) rather than apple ipad generation of tablets. Maybe in the future when there's better features integrated and operating system improves for apple products or IOS than I will consider apple products but for now I enjoy android operation system and their way cooler than apple so I'll stay with android for the the time being.

After reading a previous review about receiving a used IPad Mini instead of a NEW one, I made sure to check it out completely by taking it out of the packing before giving it as a present.  I definitely think I got a refurbished IPad Mini and here are my thoughts on why:I watched a YouTube video on unboxing a new IPad Mini to see how an IPad Mini came packaged.  At first I noticed the box had a few dents but thought this was due to shipping.  Also the serial number on the back and all the bar codes seemed to be rubbed off and not easily visible to read (I still have my Ipad box after 2 years and the bar codes never smudged).  Next I noticed a lot of particles on the surface of the screen which is odd and the back of the IPad looked a little worn (not so silvery in a few spots).  When watching the YouTube video, I saw that there should be three papers included in the box, a card with all the buttons, an apple sticker, and some other information.  My box had no apple sticker and only one card.I turned the IPad one and it worked and was fully charged (Ipad\u2019s and Iphone\u2019s usually never come fully charged).  When I eventually gave it as the gift I set it up for my mom and it was not linked to anyone\u2019s account and turned on like new.To double check I searched the serial number on Apple\u2019s website and the Ipad Mini only had about 3 days left of phone support when it should have either 60 or 90 days (I forget the exact amount).I decided to keep the Ipad Mini and give it as a gift anyway as I don\u2019t think it would have been worth contacting the vendor and filing a claim however I am disappointed that it most likely was not a new Ipad Mini.

Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "RX3FK3E02GAZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every edition of iPad. Each one has had 64GB storage plus Wi-Fi. Each \"old\" iPad has been passed down to lawyers in my office where it has been an essential tool in our practice. In our office all of our computers, save one for very specific software reasons, are Macs. One of my associates has even bought his own Apple MacBook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION). Our phones are Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (White) - AT&T; and my own Apple iPhone 4S 64GB (Black) - AT&T;The effect of all of these iPads and OSX computers has been to take full advantage of iCloud and numerous critical apps such as Square, RocketMatter, Lexis Advantage, WD2Go, Dropbox, TrialPad and Sign My Pad. Our Mac office is essentially a model for Apple products as high end business tools in the legal profession.For the past several months I been constantly asked if I was ever going to acquire an iPad Mini. Until this past week, when I began to reconsider, my answer was emphatic-NO!A smaller iPad was not likely ever to serve as an everyday tool, one that could replace a laptop in many (but not all) situations. I have been critical of WiFi only iPads believing that by maintaining access to the Internet is critical when traveling, in WiFi free courthouses and opponents' law offices. I have also insisted on 64GB iPads believing that storage should never be an issue, particularly as we move into an era where FaceTime promises to reinvent video testimony.So what am I doing buying the lowest end iPad Apple sells? The answer is that not all users are created equal. Our office manager is uniquely involved in all aspects of the practice. She monitors my emails (and I might add she is my wife so this isn't as dangerous as it sounds), reviews accounting issues including billing and time keeping. At times she has simply taken my Apple iPad MD371LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, White) 3rd Generation when I get home for these uses instead of sitting with her Apple iMac MD093LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop (NEWEST VERSION) that is our home computer.The reality is she is primarily monitoring the life of our firm, not creating pleadings and doing trial prep. When this occurred to me, I realized that the smallest iPad mini was the best way to provide her with the same 24/7 access to the file server at the office (using WD2Go) that we all enjoy and need. On the other hand, she is unlikely to need a 4G LTE connection since most of her work is done either in the office or at home. That said, as I considered this, her Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (White) - AT&T; is a personal hotspot, a capacity which is useful for those moments Internet access is necessary but unavailable on with tablets or laptops. 16GBs is in fact a massive amount of storage for most purposes and users.The iPad mini is light and while offering less \"display real estate\" is as fully functional as its big brothers. I loaded it from my App Store account with the essential apps for her needs. If you are wondering about cost, the additional cost is zero at least for the number of iOS devices-four-now on my App Store account. For those who would consider buying a cheaper non-iOS tablet, the costs of apps can be significantly more than the price differential between the iPad mini and smaller Droid tablets.While the iPad mini does not offer Retina Display like my new iPad, none of the older iPads my associates use do either. The look, feel and functionality of this tablet is pure iPad.Simply put under the right circumstances the iPad mini is a reasonable and economical choice for a Mac heavy law practice.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "The IPAD MINI is everything Apple promised it to be!!!", "Author": "Bir66", "ReviewID": "R3EJU5QE9HX5EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mini is as light and handy as Apple advertised it to be!

However, when I went to Best Buy (who has to realize they are the show room for people to play with stuff before they buy here on Amazon, right?) to handle small tablets, I was not very impressed with the Samsung. It was nice and all, but came away feeling like it was an oversized phone. I reluctantly looked at the iPad Mini since it was the same price and came away impressed. It truly is the best small tablet out there. I took away one star because there are a few things I still prefer in the Android system to iOS, but really, if you want a small tablet, for now, get the iPad Mini.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "FerrariHunter13", "ReviewID": "RMF2NOJFTTBDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It sounds crazy, but my wife and I bought our 18 month old daughter a Nabi for Christmas and she hated it.

I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Seller and Product!!!", "Author": "L", "ReviewID": "R1E24CE4HMD80V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This seller is trusted and highly recommended!!!

The mini is super easy to connect to the free wi-fi connections at my favorite coffee haunts. I have an Ipod touch but it is just too small to read books on for long periods of time. It is fine to quickly check web pages but not for prolonged browsing. (Aging eyes) I debated about waiting for the predicted \"retina display\" on the Mini 2. On comparing the retina display Ipad to its non retina-display counter part I decided that the difference was not THAT great. The only time I could tell was on video playback. On that I could see a substantial difference.The retina display Ipad was MUCH better. Since what I want to use the Mini for will be #1: Reading my Kindle books and #2: Web browsing, I did not feel it was worth a possible 6 month wait for a retina display mini. I bought a keyboard case so that I can type emails easier on it. Will I regret not waiting for the retina display mini? Maybe, time will tell.

I loved it mainly because I could download all these wonderful syntheziers, and music applications. I would occassionally use it at a restaurant when eating dinner, or while waiting at the DMV or soemthing like that. Sometimes it came in handy at home if I didn't want to turn on my computer and watch youtube videos. But this is not an iPad 2 review, sorry. But I was not using that much because it was heavy, and bulky. I would put it in my backpack, and after awhile that would get old. So I wanted to get this smaller tablet, which is really what I wanted to begin with.Immediately after trying it, I realised I had made a good move of selling my iPad 2. It was a joy to use, and I found myself enjoying configuring it, and downloading apps just like the old days when I would configure my old computers. I have at least tripled the amount of time using it, because it's so handy.Now there are some slight compatibility issues with apps designed for iPad. Mainly they have to do with not being able to read the really fine print on some of the synthesizer apps. Once I figure out what those virtual knobs and buttons are for it's not a problem. Sometimes it will be difficult to tap on a really small button. Hopefully developers will quickly adopt and come up with iPad mini optimized apps, but that's not really a big deal, I just need glasses, and a stylus. I think it would be a good idea for Apple to sell a stylus with it at a discount to make up for this slight inconvenience.The display looks nicer, because I believe it's more pixels per square inch, so scrunching all those images down makes it look like a high end 7\" tablet. Also I'm glad they made it this size, that's well thought out. If it were a smaller 7\" tablet it would be too difficult to use. At 7.8 inches or so it's perfect. I would not recommend everyone going out and selling your iPad 2 to get this, but if you don't have an iPad yet, and are looking for something more affordable, or more compact than an iPad 2, or iPad 3 etc, then this is a great option to have. I'm not sure how many of these have sold, but I would not be surprised if it were a hit, and a retina version came out. As far as improvements that they could make, I am mainly interested in a faster CPU, and a MicroSD slot.  Also, I had some accessories like the Line 6 Mobilekeys 25 keyboard that used the old 30 pin cord. So I will have to buy an adapter.

I edited it a bit:  First of all I would like to thank all of those people who wrote the reviews that guided me to find the perfect tablet:) I had changed my mind many a times, first from android then to Apple's iPad 2,etc... But finally, I was sold on an Android. Asus Tf300. It was perfect, it had a big screen, fluid and responsive. It would be perfect for my note taking as a student. It was light, and had a secure rubbery back. Wonderful! But then......  (Insert dramatic Phantom of the Opera piano playing. Horrified gasps! Scream! Get the smelling salts! Faint! Oh no!) Well, here is where my review gets useful, hopefully. My mom suggested that I reconsider the iPad mini. She felt it was the best size for me to be transporting to my classes.  First of all, I bought it direct from Apple with engraving. When we purchased it right before Christmas, Apple seemed to have the lowest price at $329 for the most basic model. I got a white, 16gb iPad mini. I also bought it with the smart cover, which is overly priced. However,it really is ingenious and it folds into a stand that I use while reading an e-book. I absolutely loved the device at first sight! It is fluid, I love the screen etc...! I know I have no experience on Retina anything, but the screen really is pretty good!(but you might notice some pixilation on white screens or when you're reading, but it really doesn't bother me.) I really like reading on it on the NOOK reader/app.(I know some of you like the Kindle. I just got the NOOK app because for Christmas I recieved a $25 Barns&Noble; gift card.)Over all, I absolutely love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love it!!!!!!! I am sorry if this did not help you at all.I see you going \"wack-o\"! Don't deny it.[Mother's note: The screen is large enough to comfortably view/edit photos and videos. The screen is the size of a paper back book page. The photo quality is better than expected. It feels and looks like a high quality product. Our elderly,yet hip, neighbor is so impressed, she's going to buy one instead of getting a laptop. If you have an iPhone you will easily know how to opperate this device.

I wouldn't want the larger retina iPad, this is so portable and easy to carry around-it's as light as a feather. It is super fast, super easy to set up (you literally turn it on, Apple walks you through an extremely brief, simple set up, and are ready to go) and then are free to use it for whatever your purpose. I let some of my family play around with it and they each had their own preferences! Some liked to take pictures, others liked to watch YouTube videos in gorgeous HD, and others liked downloading games. I may never play a game on my iPhone again--the screen on this is stunning.Apps open almost instantly, and there is never a lag. I highly recommend this product to anyone.

I will not go too much into technical aspects, overall functionality, and capabilities of the ipad mini.  There's a great apple website for that.  I will however tell you why I like the mini for my 3 year old son over the ipad 2.To give full disclosure, we love apple products.  Our family pretty much owns every single iThing that apple makes.  My son's been using an ipod touch practically ever since he was born.  So...a little over a year ago, we upgraded him to an ipad 2, which he absolutely loved.  With apps like Tozzle, Teach me Toddler, and the Toca Boca apps, which kid wouldn't?  My son has learned so much from using the educational apps on a daily basis.  Here's a question for you though...What are 2, 3 and even some year 4 year olds better at than being sponges and quickly learning things?BREAKING THINGSAn ipad is most definitely something most of us can not afford to be broken.  So to protect mine, I bought a OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Black.  Once on, this case is just awesome and protects your ipad like a tank.  But to a 2 year old with slippery fingers, it might as well weigh 50 pounds at that point.  Now that my son is 3, he's gotten used to it and knows to carry it with both hands, but it's still a little heavy and bulky for him.This is where the ipad mini comes into play.  I was a little hesitant at first to pre-order one since it didn't come with a retina display like the 2.  I went ahead and convinced myself that we needed a an upgrade in gigs.  Who knew that 16 gigs on an ipad 2 would not be enough?  I got the 32gig mini in white and setup was a breeze.  I was able to just plug it in and choose the last back up of the ipad 2 for configuration.  It immediately loaded all our favorite apps, songs, pictures, and movies to the mini without hassle.  The look on his face when I handed it to him was just priceless.  He had the biggest smile on his face and his exact wordswere, \"it's a baby ipad.\"He absolutely loves this thing even more.  He's been using it solely for about a week now and has not dropped it once.  We got him the i-Blason ArmorBox Series 2 Layer Hybrid Protection Case For Apple New iPad Mini 7.9 Inch with Kick Stand Kids Friendly (Multi Color) - Blue / White and Ionic Screen Protector Film MATTE (Anti-Glare) for New Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch / the iPad Mini 7 Inch / built-in Stand for Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch Latest Generation 4G LTE (3-pack) just in case though.  Even with this case, it's still far lighter than the ipad 2 with the otterbox.  He can now easily carry the \"baby ipad\" from room to room.All in all, the ipad mini is basically an ipad 2 that went on a diet and exercised.  It's smaller, lighter, and faster.  Perfect for your little one at home who's curious about everything.  The Ipod touch was too little for our son, the regular Ipad was too big, the mini...Is just right =) We still kept the ipad 2, cause that is perfect for mommy and daddy.  Hopefully this was helpful for parents.  Please feel free to ask a question or post a comment on this review.

I saw it as inferior to the 10\" iPad. Why spend the money on lower end hardware?Once I got to spend some time with it in person, I changed my mind.The iPad may not have the latest A6 processor, or a retina display, but it offers two very appealing things. 1. Lower price point, 2. An appealing form factor.The latter being the most significant. I've owned 10\" iPads in the past, but I always lost interest after the first month and sold them. For me, they were a bit too big and heavy, and it discouraged me from taking it with me when I left the house. It is by no means unwieldily, but I used it for movies and gaming, and holding it up for hours at a time wasn't that comfortable, and I hate using stands.The smaller size and lighter weight of the iPad mini makes a HUGE difference. The new form factor makes it more portable, which is when the device really shines, and it makes it more inviting to use, and that makes all the difference. For example, I can comfortably hold the mini in one hand and watch a youtube video, while sipping a drink in the other hand. Or I will be lying on my back, on my couch, and can comfortably hold the mini in front of my face while I watch Netflix, and can do so for extended periods of time. And now I can easily hold it with one hand in portrait position, for my apps that are viewed that way.Despite the smaller form factor, the screen size is still good, and more than large enough to make it a formidable device for movies and games, thanks to the slim bezel.Now I have had the iPad 3, and the 4th and 5th gen iPod Touch, so I am no stranger to the Retina display. I know how crisp and gorgeous it is. And while I do miss it, this omission is by no means a deal breaker. The display is still good. If you are using the device for reading, this would be a more significant factor. Personally, I can't stand reading books on an LCD screen, and I do all my serious reading on an e-ink device.And then there's the fact that it has the A5 processor, and not the latest A6. But right now, most apps don't utilize the A6, so it's not a big deal. And the A5 is still a very capable CPU. I have had no performance issues running the most demanding apps and games like Modern Combat 5, Vice City, and Infinity Blade II, both run very smoothly.The lower price point is just what the iPad line needed. I believe all tablet users should try both an Apple, and Android tablet, and stick to what they like the most. But a lot of people haven't tried the iPad due to the cost. Now they have an affordable option. And for people who use the iPad on the go, they have a device that's easier to carry around. It will fit nicely in almost any handbag, and even some coat pockets.So before you go knocking the device because of it's hardware specs VS the iPad 4, remember, that the mini is all about form factor, and an affordable price point. I could have purchased the iPad 4, but I feel like the 7.9\" is the sweet spot. I think the iPad needed to be sized down and made more portable. Check it out in person.

The response was that the item had to be returned in it's original packaging, obviously with an unbroken seal to get a full refund. Well, in order to use the item, you have to take it out of the original packaging (duh) and was offered an amount that was a third of what I paid for it; obviously I declined to return the item and downloaded a users guide online for $0. This is the problem: when you order something online you open it and try whatever item you ordered to make sure it works or it fits you or whatever only to find out that the item isn't right and you want to return it - sometimes as in this case it's just not worth it.

You previously stated that \"Customer satisfaction is very important to you\"; well, I am a customer and I AM NOT satisfied with the product or the way your company conducts business with it's customers. It appears to me that all you seem to care about is a negative review which clearly states the facts. I also noticed a couple of other reviews of dissatisfied customers with similar complaints. It is an insult to offer me a bribe of 10% of the $312.00 I paid in good faith to your company for a product for which I am stuck with because your company refuses to refund my money, unlike many other companies I have dealt with on Amazon.

I have two options - return it to Amazon and purchase another device directly from Apple (this specific model has been discontinued by Apple and is no longer available from them) or I can just give it to my grandkid, along with a really good protective case - and HOPE that my two year old doesn't break it.

Since then, it's worked wonders.  I love this thing and take it with me to work everyday.  Oh, if you're concerned about battery life, don't be.  I let it run for over two weeks with facebook and other apps on in the background while I had it in sleep mode.  It took that entire time to drain the battery down.

I'm currently using it right now to write this review. I really like my iPad mini because it has Siri and all the new updates with the iPhone c an iPhone s. If you have an iPhone 4 or 4s, the chargers are different then the 5. If you have your updated iPhone to iOS 7 you can if you don't have it connected to your phone plan you can turn on your hotspot and it has a password and it's just like using data on your phone. Beware that you are using data so you don't want to be on your iPad mini too much but when you using your hotspot it's just like having Wi-Fi and you put in your password for your hotspot and you can basically be on your iPad mini anywhere and have Internet and be able to look at emails and whatever else you want to do. On the iPhone that Apple Pages cost money but on your iPad mini it won't cost anything. I recommend it for someone who doesn't want a full-size tablet or iPad and wanted something just you can put in your purse or backpack really easily. I also recommend it for anyone who may be doing schoolwork you can get cheaper words and it could be just like a little computer or laptop. Also when I say like a computer or laptop it won't have all the functions as a computer or laptop I don't want to get anyone confused. Things that you can do on your laptop you won't be able to do on your iPad mini but having the keyboard makes it easier to type things if you are typing anything such as emails. Only thing I really don't like about Apple products are the brightness I don't know if I'm only person who feels like their products are too bright at night. When reading the book on your iPad or iPhone it's really annoying to have such a bright screen and I have to invert the colors because the brightness is to bright at night and not bright enough in the day.

I.O.S 7 is fast, it's completely changed Apple's look. It's got new backgrounds that move. The only problem is it takes 3.1 GB.  Next the Ipad Mini (I think) is better than the Ipad 3 and 4 gen. Because it's small enough to fit in a teenagers' pocket, but it's not to small.  The Ipad Mini is altogether good, except I would get 32 GB instead, because I have used all the memory.

I had the iPad before and when I saw the iPad mini come out I had to give it a shot.I purchased the Apple iPad mini 32GB WIFI + cellular while in Afghanistan and it has been a perfect addition to my pack. It's light weight, I can fit it in my cargo pocket and 32 GB of space is plenty for my favorite TV shows and movies as well as all of my iBooks (20+) and days upon days of music to listen to while on the go.It's capable of everything the iPad was but it fits in one hand comfortably and typing on it is a breeze compared to stretching those thumbs across the screen like on the original iPad. I'd recommend this product to those looking to purchase their first tablet or those with an iPad looking to upgrade.**UPDATE**Cons:1. There isn't a retina version of the iPad mini, it shares the same characteristics of the normal size iPads other than the design and the power connector.2.

This device, even though it's small,  can do everything a computer can do. It has bright colors and the graphics are really nice so when my brother is playing minecraft , the screen is super clear and the buttons are easy to use {unlike a real phone it is hard to text}. When I listen to itunes or Pandora, the music sounds super clear without the headphones{unlike the iPod}. Also the iPad mini is super light so I can hold it in one hand and my hand won't get tired. When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load. There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception.

I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage.  The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle.  Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad. after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD. and sold it to get the asus transformer prime. I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory. I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time.  But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS. I guess google needs to work on improving their \"photocopier\".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper. I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5). The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD. Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car.  Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now. Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory. But I did find a fix for that.  I use a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black. It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad.  It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal.

I was very hesitant at first, thinking that by buying the iPad mini, I was only getting exactly the same specs as my iPad 2 and missing out on the speed and image quality of the iPad with retina display. However, after using it, I have changed my mind. The size is what truly changed my mind. The fact that it's smaller seemed cute at first, and then extremely useful once I started carrying it around. I used to carry my iPad 2 in my purse and it made it extremely bulky. I can't even tell that the iPad Mini is in my purse. Holding it is not as \"cumbersome\" as a full sized iPad. It feels very nice in your hand, though I can't fully use it with one hand as Apple advertised. But, I can hold it much easier than the iPad 2. The image quality is not that of the iPad with Retina Display. But I don't really need a retina display on my iPad, and I can't imagine that everyone else does.I use my iPad primarily for graduate school, and I can see this coming in extremely handy. I keep all of my textbooks on the iPad and take notes on it as well. I watch lectures on it, write papers on it, among other things.

I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shameless cash grab device from Apple", "Author": "Irish-Mike", "ReviewID": "RLPYS4SUKDXP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, \"Apple doesn't force you to do anything.\"  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a \"walled garden\" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "High price for two year old shrunken down iPad2 specs", "Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "R3K8TNK6XWSSUN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Demo'd this in person and my conclusion is Apple is charging a premium for nearly two year old iPad2 specs with a low-end low-resolution display.

The display looks really good. Using the Kindle app- the graphic novels look great. I don't actually recommend it for serious reading because it is back lit which can be wearying to read for extended lengths.Battery time is pretty good with this too.

I returned mine after a few days of use as there are too many limitations with tablets (especially of this expense) and I'd rather have a laptop or just use my smartphone. Things I enjoyed about the iPad mini: perfect size in my opinion, easy to set up and use, wide availability of apps and accessories, Amazon app available, nice email interface, bluetooth capable, clear high quality display. The things I didn't like about this device:1. Moving files from a computer to the iPad mini has to be done via iTunes, you can't just copy over a folder of music or videos which is do-able just not as easy as on Android based devices2. Price is quite a bit more than other 7\" tablets, but the screen is actually 8\" and for an Apple product, I'd say a pretty good value3. Keyboard has no tracing or 'swype' like abilities which makes typing cumbersome without a keyboard.4. App store makes you give a password for every single app you download (even the free ones)5. As an e-reader, I'd chose one of the paper-white options over this, but it works fine for reading.6. Its not a laptopThe last reason is my primary justification for returning the device. For a tablet it does what it is suppose to do. But I found myself still preferring to use my small laptop as multitasking is so much easier. I'd say if you really like using apps or playing games or simple web browsing, a tablet is the way to go. I personally found that for me the full computing power of a laptop is worth the extra weight/size, especially given the cost of this device (i.e., you can buy a small laptop for the cost of the iPad mini). However, if you like tablets, you will find this one a good option. And since Amazon app is available now you can save money over the over-priced content of the iTunes store where the same music/videos cost about 20-30% more.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple needs to fix this", "Author": "Vonivate,Balenagasau", "ReviewID": "R1LCSLGFZVIYPD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Keeps cutting off in wireless bug has to be fixed by apple.My friend fixed the bug but still getting cut off every now and then", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Rudy Canosa \"LA LA\"", "ReviewID": "R3HQ7JQPRRF7FZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Device performed very slow.

To be clear I am writing this review on a fourth generation iPad, so I'm not a hater, but I do think Apples prices aren't justified with their hardware.  I am an AT&T; rep who has ample time to use the mini and formulate an opinion about it.  Simply put the screen is garbage.  \"Every inch an iPad,\" is Apples tag line for the device and I must say, no, it's not.  The iPad I'm using has a truly beautiful screen, that only until recently has been able to compete with.  The mini does not.  Now this is what's true about Apple.  They do not care about the end user.  They don't.  Or else ere would be A RETINA DISPLAY ON THE IPAD MINI.  If they can put it Retina on their phone and their full size iPad then seriously. The second generation will have it for sure, by why make their very loyal and sometimes crazy customer base go through with this?  I guess it's because they can.  I would never buy an iPad mini in its current state, and if you have any buying sense you'd wait to.  It's a waste, and will make you feel real bad you purchased one very, very, soon.

There are so many tablets to pick from. There are tablets by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Nexus, Windows, etc. There are so many different choices, so many different brands. Every single tablet is different. But what tablet is better? How do you know which one to buy? Some like Window products other like Apple products more. Each and every single person is different but there is one iPad that fits all. I believe the iPad Mini is probably the best choice of all, it perfect for everyone. Why should you buy the Apple iPad mini? Well Apple is a very well known company all across the globe. They have created some of the best computers, laptops, created the iPod and the iPhone. Who does not love Apple products? They have the best and most advanced technology. Apple does not let you down, it meets all the expectations, and you will be surprised with what you can do with their products. Mostly everyone has an Apple product these days; personally in my family we own eight Apple products, in which the iPad mini is one. We are very happy with all our Apple products from our laptop and PC to our iPods and iPad. We can say that Apple has not let us down with any of their products we have bought and I know probably many out there agree with us. Why is the iPad mini perfect? First of all the iPad mini is the perfect size, it is not bulky at all. It is only 5.28 inches by 7.87 inches and it is 0.28 inches thick. It can easily be carried in your purse or in you backpack and it won't weigh anything at all. It is also perfect for all college students out there, you can easily take notes with the iPad mini and will never have to worry about forgetting or buying a notebook, so the iPad mini helps you save trees. The iPad mini is also perfect for your children; you can download games, TV shows, or movies. Its perfect for them to use any day, and very perfect for when going on a road trip you can play a movie, give them headphones and make it a peaceful ride where your child wont be bored and start bothering you. The iPad mini is perfect for anyone out there, no matter what it needs to be used for. The iPad mini also has a great camera, which takes very nice pictures. And iPad minis are also starting to be used in schools, which as you can see iPad minis are starting to be used mostly everywhere, why not have one of your own. The iPad mini will make you happier. You can download movies, books, its also can have Wi-Fi. Having an iPad mini will make you very happy, you don't have to carry around bulky books anymore, and you can easily download more then one book on your mini iPad. The iPad mini changes your life, it makes you more modern, and you become more technological. The whole world is becoming more technological, might as well buy an iPad mini and keep up. In conclusion, I believe the iPad mini is the best choice of table. Its produced by a very well known company all around the world. It has the latest technology and it fits all your needs and your families. The iPad mini is very family oriented its perfect for your toddlers to your college students. It perfect for everyday use, for school, and for work. Everyone should have an iPad mini its perfect", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Over priced", "Author": "Donald Paladin \"Sunergos\"", "ReviewID": "RCASEDPHKZOYB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Apple does it AGAIN!

This is an amazing device and I use it almost continuously at home.  It's more expensive then the Nexus 7 with less features, but because of the wider screen size I think the price is still worth it.  Also, the top tablets out right now come with 2 GB RAM but the IPad mini only has 1 GB and this noticibly slows Internet browsing and video loading times as compared with most other tablets.  With that said, this is my first tablet and the speeds have amazed me.  Everything this device does generally runs 100% smoothly and feels so natural to operate.  For the most part everything is intuitive and friendly.However, Apple controls all apps very tightly and because of this there are some things you can't do.  For example there is no flash suppport so if you decide to go to southparkstudios.com and try to watch the latest episode you will not be able to play it.  Also for things like video editing you'll be required to put up $5 for the software (IMovie is worth the price though).In the end my personal preference would go to one of the new ASUS tablets.  ASUS gives you much more power for the money and it works on the google operating system which comes with the full google suite of software which IMO is amazing.In closing, if you like apple and use ITunes a lot then this is a great mid range tablet computer that I highly recommend.  If however you want to get the most for your money then go with the cheaper Nexus 7 or the incredibly powerful 10\" ASUS tablets that you find available through Amazon.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "For those on the fence about getting an iPad mini", "Author": "Rene Franco", "ReviewID": "R3US977Z9V75KD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's better than video to illustrate just how well the iPad mini performs against the competition.*and for some reason amazon is removing my link so on youtube just search out  \"LockerGnome iPad mini vs Nexus 7\"[...]", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Dissatisfied!", "Author": "Reyna", "ReviewID": "RWVTLBDHPALUX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I opened the package on 12/24 to wrap it for my son and when I looked at the iPad, it did not look new.

I bought the \"fire\" at the beginning of the year after comparing it and the mini.  The Amazon deal was too good to pass up.  The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the \"fire\". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the \"fire\", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.  The price point is affordable and the tablet is great!!!!

However, the deluge of icons is really confusing and it's very hard to navigate to what I was last doing upon turning the device on. It requires remembering, finding and usually quite a few clicks and typing. Very unintuitive. The iOS 7 is a complete disaster, it is very hard to tell what is a link, what is button, what I can click and what I can't. I am often confused. When I watch photos, it feels like I am in an email. It was very hard to find the url box in the Safari browser. I often can't recognize what is the selected object or link or button. Well there are no buttons or links, only blue text. It is minimalist style to the point of uselessness. It feels like the work of a European preoccupied with style over usability. Very unamerican and very unapple-like. In addition, reading magazines is very unpleasant, requires monthly subscriptions. It is very hard to buy a Bloomberg Markets for $5 like I can on the street. Also each magazine has its own app with different scrolling motions. Some scroll to the right, some scroll down. It is extremely confusing and frustrating. I just want to read magazines and flip from page to page and I kind of like checking out the ads as I browse.Also the content on the iPad is very expensive - movie rentals are north of $5-$6 and some hot titles can fetch $10 per rental. Also the 24 hour rental period is too short. I can rarely watch a movie in one night after coming home tired from work. Especially if the movie is 3 hours. I only got the iPad mini because the app ecosystem is so deep and there are games on it that my daughter wants to play that are unavailable on the Kindle Fire HDX.

They foolishly (IMO) said theyonly support Apple. DUH.,.there was an error message...and all that was needed (I think) was to deletea file in the folder the error message gave. YOU would THINK Apple tech support could have helped.Not to worry Hewlett Packard Tech support got me up and running. Thank goodness I have a new PC and under warranty.The ONE star is for a COMPANY that WILL not support their product on a PC.I just spent $659 on an apple product and smart cover with Houston slaes tax.THAT is the very last dime APPLE will see from me. As a new customer to APPLE I was appalled.NOW the reason to use Itunes is A) to buy them online...and B) to be able to backup your device.You do not have to be able to use the software on another device (like a pc or mac)..it is a safety feature.Also be careful syncing..because you can wipe out all IPAD data. Make sure the IPAD controls the data.I love my new ipad mini...I got the smart cover and highly recommend.The camera feature was great.I installed dropbox so I can access my travel documents.Things I learned:When buying these IPADs..first of all if you want one asap..you need to go with 32 MB or LARGER.The 16MPB go quickly.Then you have to DECIDE which IPAD to buy the unit configured with A data plan provider or none (wifi only).That can be AT&T;, Sprint, Verison. AGAIN...check the data plans offered because you can buy them separately from regular plan.AND you are stuck with the data plan provider.I got AT&T...and; wanted to use it for my trip this week to Mexico.AT&T; refused to sell me international data service until I had a data planfor three months. I am not a happy camper.AHA..not to worry.THAT restriction is ONLY if you call AT&T; and prebill contract for two years.If you buy the service yourslef month to month you CAN add international immediately.At least right now!You can buy from ipad mini...or online<...>you first MUST buy a data plan..and THEN you can immediately purchase an international plan.AND you can start the international plan any date up to one year in advance.It starts midnight eatsern time on day you select.I just picked the day before to be sure I had service AND you can log in and change the international date.And if you CANCEL att domestic plan..if you do they charge domestic data to international data or something. Read the terms and conditions.The att ipad domestic plans are month to month...you have to cancel 7 days in advance. They say they bill two hours in advance.RIGHT NOW...if you exceed your data..they do not bill you for more..your plans just stops until the next autorenew date. That is awesome!. Phew. However you can go online and add more time. Thischanges to a new 30 day period. Data does not roll (bummer).They allegedly have a non-autobill option for doesmetic. I could not figure it out.They give your device a cell data number for billing.International does NOT autobill.Use this address to view your iPad Data Account.<...>If you already have data you can use the email address / password on the right side to log in.If you don't have data you can use the Sign Up For Service button.There is not a lot of information on the page, so not sure if it will fit your needs or not.You can show the credit card information used on the account under the Edit User & Payment information page.I got the Ipad mini unit asap in person..on BLACK Friday...so I could get the unit immediately...and buy one with a data provider.Be careful in your choice of data provider.Love the ipad mini. It is much better than the Kindle Fire for travel/web access and photos.It has a camera and with dropbox, it automatically backs up pictures online, etc.I can share folders with friends using dropbox.The unit is small enough to take with.Battery lasts fine (8 hours) and the smart cover shuts it on and (sleep mode).I did have problems because I oops kept failing to fully plug it in. Make sure the usb is fully engaged.You do not have to turn unit off...just put it in sleep mode..uses very little battery.However it charges BEST when the unit is off.FYI-It does NOT use a jump drive.  Mini has the tiny \"lightening\" port.I suggest dropbox on a big pc rather than hacking it...and reformatting the jump drive.Someone said they got jump drive to work using a camera attachment.I just wanted a small device for traveling, taking pictures of my rental car, checking in online to get boarding passes.However...I can  use it at home and sit out by pool or in the living room...and it is kind of cool.I'm new to these devices...I love it. Not so much Apple support.And AT&T; is very very very hard to find IPAD info. Use links above.YOu can set up plan from your device....but I had trouble and had to go through a live person.Using the links I gave you can check your usage online.Once they make international sims with the NANO chip, of course you can get your own international data plan through them.Be very careful with your ipad mini sim.In summary:check to see if you can load latest itunes on a pc or mac first. (optional)check to see what data provider you want. (optional)you may need to get a larger unit 32 or 64 if you want one right away.for att...go to att.com.ipadlanding to see data pllans for ipad.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hoped, waited, never came", "Author": "Pam", "ReviewID": "RYCPZCL4O8RUS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wouldn't know cause I haven't gotten it yet but I'm sure it's amazing!
