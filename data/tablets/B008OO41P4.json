This tablet is real good I would go as far to say its better then the first gen kindle fire. Also its lighter thinner and has a camera and supports gps. The design is a close to a down right knock off of the google nexus 7 without the matted back and different camera position. It feels great in the hands. HDMI out and upgradeable memory not to forget the mic that works very well. The battery is one of the real stars of the show... out of the box at about 75% I'm still using it after at least 8 app downloads, some trial gameplay, browsing and all while wi-fi, sync and gps are on and I have not dimmed the screen and oh yea I'm using it now to write this and I'm still in the blue battery wise. So many tablets are popping up for cheap prices and a lot of them are bad. But just like vizio hdtv every now and then a company just makes a great product for a low price and this is just that. Don't wana shell out 200.00 just yet? Then at 80-90 bucks you will not be sorry with this dual core tablet you may even find yourseld content. And android gamers I'm talking to you too this tablet is slim with a good looking tft screen and strong battery and the dual core has no problem with any game you may want to throw at it. Downsides are I don't like the speaker position nore how much the power and volume bottons stick out. And the blue agptek logo on the back is ugly. I can't say it beats out the GN7 or the new I pad but it damn sure holds its own.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Theo", "ReviewID": "ROG9HVU1Z6YYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this 4 days ago, and i really am surprised with how fast it runs.

Philippides \"philico\"", "ReviewID": "R1K1O7PMJS6QUC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The worst part on this device is the battery. Do not underestimate this little detail even if the device seems cheap to you. Better avoid buying it since the battery only lasts 30-40 minutes when new and after 2 years it dies completely. Mine only lasts for 25 seconds away from the charger and it then shuts down. Yes, the lifetime of the battery is only 2 years!!! And since it is a non-brand product unlike Samsung, HTC, Apple, Toshiba there are no third-party replacement batteries for AGPTek. So buyer beware. In 2 years you will be out shopping for a new tablet.The second worst part is the single processor and the third, the small RAM (512MB). Yes, they tell you that you have 4GB of internal memory but this is misleading since this memory is for storage and not for loading applications. Bottom line, the single processor and the limiting RAM makes a sloth look like a sprinter next to this device. So make yourselves a favor and get a brand tablet with a dual core processor and a 1GB DDR2 or DDR3 RAM that you know that it will be supported by third parties for the years to come.The irony is that the company that makes this tablet also makes replacement batteries for laptops. So if they cannot pull their act together in making a tablet free of battery issues how can I trust them with replacing the aging battery of my Eeepc with one of their own?", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice little tablet", "Author": "Lady Ketenge", "ReviewID": "RUUGPSXL1ZIGZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The charger port for 1.) is not USB 2.) it tends to wear down for some reason.

Based on previous reviews, I knew I wasn't getting a Nexus or an iPad, but they seemed to be durable and would meet basic needs.I loaded them both up with some great apps for the kids and they were having a great time with them. Then, after only a few days of use, one of them slid off of the couch (a 1 foot drop or so) and landed on the soft carpet. That little fall caused the touchscreen to become completely unresponsive. I followed a bunch of troubleshooting steps that I found online, but still luck. So with my info now stuck on the tablet, I had to return it. I would have done an exchange, but...The 2nd tablet, although working and being gently used by my oldest child, is experiencing issues with the charging port. The short battery life requires constant charging. We were fine with this and figured we'd just have to plug it in during use. However, something is wrong with the charging port so we seem to only have luck when  its laying flat on the table. We hoped it was just the charger itself, but we tried both before returning the broken one. Its the port on the tablet itself.My son loves his and I'm happy about that.

Since they both have access to computers at the house, the tablet was purchased for watching Netflix movies, YouTube videos, light gaming apps such as Angry Birds, and music. This was one of the very few tablets I could find with Google Play for under $100. Although I read many mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance and purchase this tablet.This tablet has exceeded my expectations. I was able to power-up and install apps through Google Play with no issues whatsoever. Connectivity was a breeze with almost instant wireless network recognition. I was able to connect to my home network in well under a minute.I found there to be no lag time when playing games like Angry Birds, nor any buffering/lag time issues with Netflix and YouTube videos. My oldest son is able to easily and log into and post in his favorite online forums, and my youngest son uses the Facebook app with no issues whatsoever.Additionally, there are some 3D games that my sons enjoy playing that I expected to be choppy, but they play just fine. The instruction manual is a bit on the sparse side, but because I've had android phones in the past, and currently have a phone/tablet hybred, navigation was very easy. Those who are not familiar with the Google/android interface may benefit from watching instructional videos on YouTube.Physically, the tablet is lightweight, but still feels like \"quality\". The touch screen is responsive without being overly sensitive, and the graphics are crisp and clear. The battery life is surprisingly long for a typical portable device, and I was pleasantly surprised at how long the device holds a charge.My youngest son received an HP netbook on the day before he received his tablet. I wondered if my present would be cast aside. But since he's opened the tablet, he's not touched the netbook.I've never used an IPad. But I know that the quality of this tablet is probably far less than an IPad. However, for a device costing less than $100, this little tablet packs a serious punch!

Its a great \"entry level\" tablet for those who are just entering the tablet market and dont want to spend hundreds on the big boys.With a 1.2 Ghz processor, you can run all your favorite apps smoothly. 512 Mb of Ram to give it its driving force and you got a tablet that can do almost anything. Youtube runs great with amazing quality. Netflix too. And since you have Google Play, you can find almost any app you would want. Ive played Minecraft Pocket Edition on it and, its a 3-D, Processor and Ram heavy game, it ran super smoothly, even while running the Google Music player in the background.Although 2 Gb doesnt sound like a lot of storage, which it really isnt, you can add up to 32 Gb of extra storage using a micro SD card. You end up with a total of 34 Gb of storage space. Amazing! I have over 7 thousand songs on my tablet and with plenty of room for games and videos to throw in.Some problems though would have to be the front facing camera, which is decent, but dont expect \u00fcber HD quality. Also, for some reason, when I enable WiFi, it overrides the acess ability of other devices and only alows the tablet to have acess, but maybe its just my unit. Apart from those things, its a very solid, high quality build, fast and economical entry tablet. Runnig Androids 4.0 U.I. (user interface) Ice cream sandwich, almost anyone can use it.

All we wanted was something that would show online Youtube videos, enable us to read e-mail, surf the web, and listen to a few songs. Nothing major or incredibly computing-intensive. What we got was the most nonsatiable pile of crap and the worst customer service I have ever seen.The unit seemed to work out fine the first day, but on the second day it took greater effort to power the thing on and off, and accessing menus was very slow. Additionally, the battery was not charging completely for some reason. It would only charge to about 80%.Then we dropped the tablet and cracked the display (which is completely my fault, not trying to blame this on anyone else). We contacted AGPtek to see if we could get it repaired under the one-year warranty or just pay extra to get it repaired. After dealing with several rude people who didn't speak any English, we finally found out that we needed to contact Brainy Trade for assistance. After contacting Brainy Trade, we were told that we could send it in and it would be replaced under the warranty. Two weeks passed, and we heard nothing so we filled out a contact form that was supposedly going to have someone get back to us in 24 hours. Still, nothing. I called Brainy Trade and they informed us that they had never heard of my name, had no record of the object being sent back, had never heard of the order number or serial number.I asked for three different people, including the manager and was informed that there was no supervisor on duty that was able to assist me. After very patiently going through several people who couldn't understand my English and who's English I couldn't understand in return (mind you, I come from a bilingual family myself and have no problem with people who have accents, but when they are both rude and cannot communicate effectively with customers, then I start to get frustrated), we were finally informed that the only way to solve the issue is to contact Amazon.Hooray for Amazon! They had it on record that the item was shipped to Brainy Trade and received under their UPS tracking record and refunded our money. I highly recommend Amazon in every way, shape, and form.

If your giving it to children or your a lil rough on inserting power cords, it could pose a problem in the future.

I went and looked at the 'settings' 'apps' 'running' page and below the app list is a read out of the RAM used and available.. the highest i could get either was 170/60, did some research, on the matter to confirm... then loaded 2 apps to test the CPU & RAM....256 was reported************** I Did not receive the item listed, I am sending the unit back... beware of Brainytrade!", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Customer Service!!!!!", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "R2C6EIPX3WNUSU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Found this tablet to be a good tablet especially for the price.

I ordered a keyboard folder for it, it is great protection against dropping it, & I can type with much greater ease. Much less frustration for emails. You  need a Mini USB keyboard if you want to get a keyboard folder, adapters don't work, they need converters to power the adapter. The tablet folder that works, is advertised on Amazon as for the wm8850 model. It may cost a few dollars more than the other regular USB tablets, but this one works & comes with the mini USB plug. Now The dual processor is like the difference of night & day. The Dual processor has almost twice the processing speed, even though the processor runs a little slower than my other one. As far as, u-tube, right off of the internet, it plays flawlessly small u-tube movies & music videos. The sound is better from the internet than with on board files. I downloaded WPS known as Kingsoft office, its free, & works great, the files are not compatible with MS word, but you can download office reader programs to solve that problem. It also says that you can plug the USB into your computer to download, but i just stick the memory chip into an adapter, download what I want from the computer, & then put the chip back into the tablet. I like the power plug separate from the USB mini, that way at home, I can be on the tablet for hours without the power going down. Especially on a long letter email.It is best not to charge too much. Mine locked up a few times during overcharge, but otherwise it always works perfect. A great note pad with calendar is ColorNote, But for reminder notices, I like the Jorte calendar. Google has so many free programs, so I get all that I want, & uninstall anything that I don't like. I got a wonders media tablet once before, I broke the screen when I dropped it, but I could plug in a mouse, & it still works, but I like this one better.  I also downloaded a spanish bible & a KJV english one, they are free , why not. I can continuing learning spanish, the word of God, & play games in between. It came with angry bird & slicing fruit, I think they are cool, but I don't get into them much. Have fun, I finally got a good enough tablet, that now I am in no hurry to get another one. I tried netflix from google play, it played the first movie perfect, but i guess there was some program problem with netflix download, so I uninstalled Netflix, but If I need it again, I will download it again.  I see that there are new tablets that are faster for the same price, like Dual core + cuad core GPC I have no idea what it means, but mine works fine, & this basic dual core is good with the internet. I like the front screen, it shows the weather report, & displays similar weather on the animated screen. It forecasts a rainy day & the screen has a rainy appearance as if it is raining against the window. On a clear day it shows clouds, with moving clouds above them, something you would see, as if you were on an airline flight, looking down below.  The screen is sensitive, you need to learn to drag your finger lightly, it works best that way. I has a great calculator, & though it looks like a normal one, it will do scientific functions. I also downloaded convert pad, if you need to convert math figures of weights & measures.  After a month of play, I discovered that the tablet is a little voltage sensitive. If you are charging more than 50% while using it, It could lock up, & you may have to wait as much as four hours for the battery to completely drain down. The solution is to charge it at low levels when using it, but the best is to charge it before you power it up. It takes one & one half hours to fully charge. Then you can turn it on, & it should be ok.  After 6 months, i feel it is a little slower than the dual core model, but the sound is good, so I use it as my notepad, alarm clock, & calendar.  It will do email, but the games are stable, & fun to play. It is always better to turn it off when charging, but you can also charge while surfing.  The keyboard & Charger are mini usb, so you can charge or type but not both, if using the keyboard tablet, the on screen keyboard is ok for surfing, but for notes or anything else the tablet keyboard is better .", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not so good after all.", "Author": "M. Shane Luttrell \"Shane Luttrell\"", "ReviewID": "R3VEDFN2DJ2ROW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my 9 year old son for Christmas.  He's noticed that every member of our family has some sort of tablet or laptop, and he doesn't see the fairness in that. :)  So I went on a hunt for a reasonably priced tablet and came across this one.I'd say that for the price, it's really good.  I have no experience with the first Kindle Fire, so I can't compare it with this, but I've heard it's similar.  My wife has a Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet.  If you compare that to this tablet, the AGPtek takes a pretty harsh beating.  You're not going to get the same display quality or quick processing with the AGPtek.  However, I have no doubt that my son will love it.I've downloaded several apps on it and it runs them all so far, with the exception of Netflix (disappointing, but reading the reviews of the Netflix app, I think it may be the app's fault.  However, the Netflix app works fine on my wife's Galaxy, so I have to wonder.  The other apps I've tried worked fine, including Angry Pigs, Angry Birds Star Wars, YouVersion Bible, Google Music Player, Carnivores:Dinosaur Hunt, Hill Climb Racing, Glow Hockey, Office Jerk, Rope Escape, Temple Run, and many others.The display is not the best.  I ran an Antutu benchmark test, and the resolution scored at about 740x500.  That's a far cry from the Samsung, Kindle Fire HD, or just about any other of the current tablets.  So if the highest -resolution screen is important to you, better pass this by.  The games look decent, just not great.  I also noticed that the screen has a definite \"sweet-spot\".  If you look at the screen from any angle other than pretty much straight-ahead, you're going to notice a definite dimming.This is how I'd sum this up: This is not the tablet to get a discriminating person.  However, if you have someone who's a little less discriminating, say a child or someone who's not up on all the latest and greatest gadgetry, this might well be the tablet for you.*Update Jan 15 2013*It appears I was a little optimistic in my earlier review.  I ended up sending this back to for a full refund (thanks Amazon!).  The battery life was a real problem... we were constantly charging the tablet.  And to make that matter worse, within two weeks the flimsy charger pin had broken off, and it was pretty much impossible to find a replacement.  We tried chargers that SHOULD have worked, but nothing did.  So rather than keep searching for a charger, and based on the various problems (short battery life, no Netflix or other streaming services, overall sluggishness, and low resolution), we sent it back.  We got a Samsung Galaxy II instead.
