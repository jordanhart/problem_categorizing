{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A review for those new to tablets AND Android", "Author": "Kilgore Gagarin \"Those who believe in telekin...", "ReviewID": "R1OT2WGKIPSW7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 26 NOV 2012: Please note that the following review was for the Le Pan I and NOT the Le Pan II. Due to circumstances not under my control this review may actually appear under the latest Le Pan II which appears to be a good upgrade but I've never used it - I am still happily using the first version tablet (Le Pan I) acquired in June, 2011 (so durability is good).IMPORTANT UPDATE 11/30/2011: Please read B. Brinton's Amazon review (can't give the URL but it's one of the two star reviews here) regarding inability to update to new operating system. I stand by my original review as to the quality of the tablet, but recommend that you check out Brinton's review before actually buying.Before I even start, I absolutely LOVE my Le Pan tablet. It's a blast to use, has a lot of upside for the things I want to do with it, and has a definite \"wow\" factor with bystanders. Typical quotes are, \"wow,\" and \"I want one\" and \"that is so cool!\" This could be said about a lot of the better tablets (e.g., iPad) that have nice, high def, shiny screens showing video, but I appreciated the coveting looks (and I let people play with it extensively and had trouble getting it back a couple times).I have never used a tablet (well, 10 minutes goofing with an iPad in the Apple Store a year ago) and have never used anything with the Android operating system.A lot of my \"cons\" are probably pertinent to a lot of similar pieces of hardware, as well as shortcomings of the Android OS as it is currently implemented, rather than unique to the Le Pan.I would NOT recommend this for someone looking for a turnkey, works perfectly out of the box solution. You will need either some experience, or a strong nerd compulsion (or a little of both). You'll have to overcome quirks of the hardware and software.First, the \"bad.\"The power button sucks. After four days I STILL fumble with that sucker.The fingerprints on the screen drive me nuts. I think it's worse in a tablet with a large screen than on an Android or Iphone with smaller screens. I'm already carrying around a microfiber cleaning cloth. A definite hazard of this entire class of machine. You might want to invest in some wet-dry LCD screen wipes for when you want to get it in pristine condition before you show off in front of the boss (e.g., Audiovox Surface SURF402 Wet/Dry Screen Wipes). Think of it as detailing your tablet.Saying the speakers are \"tinny\" might be generous and there is absolutely no recognizable bass component. I'm ready to get a bluetooth headphone for this immediately.Can't run Hulu to watch TV (yet) - the hardware is probably perfectly capable, but Hulu sees \"Android mobile device\" and just serves up an annoying message. However YouTube (included app) looks and works better than I have ever seen it.It's heavier than I thought, but not that bad. It's about the same weight as an iPad. I found that holding it in one hand I would cramp up after a couple of minutes. It is light enough to cradle, and propping it up on an ample paunch while in bed was ok. Sitting down with tablet on lap, no problem.Next, the \"weird.\"The onboard camera only shoots pictures in a mirror mode (i.e., titles of books are reversed like in a mirror). In using Skype I found that for this version of Android, video calling is not supported. Otherwise, Skype works quite nicely on this platform.In certain network environments (I'm on a University network half the time) you can easily purchase apps via the included Android Market, but downloading wouldn't commence - probably some security feature of our network. Using my home wifi connection (DSL via AT&T;) I had no problems downloading and installing Skype and some other navigation based stuff.The included browser can't handle Ebsco databases (if that means anything to you). The browser handles most websites well, and the large screen means you don't need to access the specially configured mobile sites, which are still a lot cleaner. I ran this on our library catalog and most of our databases with no problem, but the Ebsco ones didn't allow any search entry. Weird. (NOTE ADDED June 2, 2011: Just installed the Opera Mobile Web Browser ver. 11 from the Apps for Android store on Amazon and the Ebsco databases work just fine).Finally, the \"good.\"The screen is awesome (except in daylight where it is useless). Use this indoors, not at the beach.The response time is lightning fast. Apps come up fast and operate fast. Scrolling, screen switching, etc. is ultra-smooth.In the right network environment, getting, installing, and using apps is trivial.The integration with web based Google apps is seamless. I didn't even notice my calendar and contacts were downloaded and synchronized (and continue to be synchronized). A very cool thing I discovered this morning was that when I was out of wifi range (on my bus and train commute) I could still do my Gmail offline. The Gmail app downloads and caches your email so you can use it offline, including replying to messages. The next time you get a wifi connection, synchronization will send all pending messages, and download new ones - this was all done while sitting in my backback.The GPS is useful, but not yet a substitute for a good stand-alone unit (I'm a TomTom user). But the connection to Google Maps is very cool. You have to wrestle to find it, but once you get into street view, it's obvious that high def simulated 3d is designed for tablets with big shiny screens. I'm still struggling with the interface (I think the GPS keeps wanting to tether me to Missouri), but I've taken friends to Florence and Rome on this tablet, and the fast and seamless \"look around\" on a tablet is very, very, nice.Photos and video on this screen are gorgeous, without question. I haven't read anything yet that contests that - I vouch for the visual impressiveness as well. Again, the screen WILL get covered in finger smudges, and if you're in any kind of daylight you're out of luck seeing anything.So, take this review in stride. Think of my comments as caveats and warnings, and whether or not they're deal breakers is up to you and what you need. I'm not sure there is any tablet that can satisfy all the myriad details wanted by end users. I give this four stars for being an impressive work with some upside potential with upgrades (video calling with Skype, Hulu compatibility). Read the specs and decide if things like not having video output is important, or not.ADDED June 2, 2011: To watch movies you might have to convert them to an appropriate format (and/or download some other video software). I've been able to take video and using VLC (free and available on PCs and Macs) and convert to MP4 format then view with no problem. Also, because of movie sizes, you're likely going to need to buy a bigger micro SD chip (or two). I have some DVDs from Orlando (wife and kids swimming with the dolphins) and was able to extract the unprotected \"VOB\" files. I converted to a couple of formats but the MP4 format seemed to universally work. Again, this is one of those areas you need a bit of a nerd compulsion to work out.Regarding using wet/dry pads to clean the screen. Almost all of the standard pads should work fine, but in most cases you're going to waste a lot of pad. I've taken to opening the pouches and cutting the wet AND dry pads in half. Then I stuff them back in the pouches and fold it over to preserve the dampness. You can probably clean the screen 3 to 4 times with one set of pads (experiment on your own).UPDATE AFTER SIX WEEKS (added July 15, 2011): I'm hooked. Durable, dependable, and now I've modded it with all sorts of useful and fun apps (hint: Amazon apps store gives a free app a day SUCH A DEAL!!!). I've been using for six weeks without a hitch and this has become my \"go to\" device for browsing the net and wasting time (playing games). Power button still sucks, but I've gotten used to the fingerprints.UPDATE AFTER SEVEN MONTHS (added January 11, 2012): Le Pan has now come out with a successor, the Le Pan II, so this will be my final update. I received my Le Pan in early June, 2011. As of this date my TC970 is still running strong with no quirks or hardware faults whatsoever. Anecdote is not evidence, but my personal experience continues to be positive with this tablet. I even loaned it to my son for a couple of weeks as he took it to Budapest, Prague, and Vienna. Toting it around Europe in a backpack for two  weeks, and it's back home, still humming along perfectly. This is still one fine machine.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet that exceeds expectations", "Author": "Ernest S Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R1O5BV6UYDSWJG", "Overall": "5.0",

Mine still works perfectly.  I have had it physically powered off for only about 2 weeks during this 2 year period, I literally just set it to sleep mode when not in direct use by myself.  Even with that constant use my battery life is still nearly what it was when I bought it.  When the tablet gets to about 35% battery I charge it up (usually to full if time allows).  I have a bit of an issue with bringing it out of sleep.  I press the power button and sometimes get no response.  I simply hold the power button and it wakes up asking if I want to power down.  I select \"no\" and log in just fine.  I do not use my tablet non-stop like I did initially, but it is always working and still does everything it did before.  My parent's Le Pan I's are still working fine for them.  I also convinced my roommate and another friend to get Le Pan II's earlier this year.  My roommate loves his and has found it invaluable for using recipes, watching youtube videos, and a few other purposes.  He has had his with constant use for about 3 months now and no problems.  My other friend got hers earlier this week.  I shall update when I can about her response to it, but thus far it is working just like mine and she loves it.Update 4 August 2012:  ICS has been released and it is working very well.  Flash support on chrome is giving me some trouble, but Dolphin browser still has it working fine.  ICS is nice and runs a bit smoother.  I cannot get the HDMI mirroring to work (and now have the official Le Pan cable for it) so if that is important wait on the upgrade.  I am really enjoying ICS far more than I thought I would.  I remade the attached video in a streamlined format with ICS and it is on youtube, just search \"le pan ice cream sandwich\" and I think it comes up.  Since I think they still ship with Honeycomb I am leaving the old video up for now.Update 23 May 2012:  I am still very pleased with my tablet.  I have had almost no problems, and the few I have had were fixed with a reset.  I leave my tablet on all the time.  All the time.  The total time it has spent physically off since I got in Jan is less than 3 days.  I still have good battery life and things are great.  Quick note since this generation of tablets is being replaced by newer models(transformer prime, Ipad 3, etc).  You can now find comparable tablets with good options in the ballpark of this price.  Part of my emphatic nature of recommending this tablet originally was that all comparable tablets at the time were $400 or more.  Le Pan II is still certainly a contender.  One advantage this tablet still has is being nearly the only Android tablet of 4:3 ratio.  I find that very comfortable for web browsing.  If that is not a big deal you could probably get a Xoom or some such that is comparable and possibly better depending on the price, though most are refurbs versus Le Pan being for a new unit.  I still recommend this tablet, but the progression of technology marches on.  Also if you have a Roku and get an android device check out Gregg Reno's apps for Roku; Juice for Roku is the app I use second most.  It is only beaten out by the browser on my tablet.  I have a surround sound system and now my tablet is graphical radio control; it is awesome for anyone with a lot of mp3s.Video:In my video I show basic functions, google applications, amazon applications, built in camera, music and video demos.  Much of the bullet list of pros and cons are still best seen in the review below.  It ran kind of long, so I cut it back for amazon's requirements.  Sorry again for the length of it and my written review, but there is so much to say about this tablet.  I very much hope it helps people make informed decisions.**Also the tablet accesses Google Play (my video was before the switch when it was Android Market, but it still allows access to all the Google apps and markets).Original review:Let me start by saying that I purchased the TC970 (previous model) back in October, and after 2 months was excited about the Le Pan II.  I have had the Le Pan II for a few hours and am really enjoying it already.  Originally I was wary about the unknown company, but took a chance.  It was the best move I have ever made since I got a reliable Ipad quality device at a fraction of the price.  I shall comment more on that in the company section.Basics:**Pros:It has a nice professional build and feels solid, no cheap plastic feel here.  All quality.Fast processor, boots in about 30 seconds, quick start on apps, and can run many with no problems.It has a 4:3 aspect ratio like the Ipad, which I find more comfortable for web browsing than the 16:9 tablets.Fully functioning android market.Youtube app works great.Syncs with Gmail just fine.Beautiful high definition screen.Full Flash support.Sensitive screen with good response on keyboard, I can type about 30 words per minute on the tablet (~90 on a real keyboard) and it keeps up just fine (my speed is going up as I get used to the onscreen keyboard).No problems with Wifi, good signal.Good accelerometer, can use it to play games easily and works well with google sky map.Decent microphone with wide pick up (I use a frequency analyzing program).**Cons:Proprietary 30 pin connector, but it comes with a USB connection and charger (so only kind of annoying).No USB ports, do not get keyboards that connect through USB (it does support Bluetooth so you can get accessories, but only with Bluetooth).No rear camera (no big deal to me, I have a digital camera anyway), and front facing camera is only 2MP.**Notes:The speakers are above average for portable devices (almost no portable devices have good speakers since good bass usually needs larger speakers).  These are pretty good overall, but for audio excellence in any portable device you need a good pair of headphones.I have not tried to connect this tablet to my TV with HDMI, I still need to get the adapter, but will update after I try.  It does not come with the connector initially (at this time anyway).I expect it will function similar to the TC970, so the battery life should hold for about 7 hours even with constant video use.  I almost never turned my old one off, just sleep mode.  It can run for days easily in sleep mode.  With intermittent use I would only charge every 3 days or so and expect the Le Pan II to perform about the same.Cases:  I use an off-brand case designed for the HP touchpad (HHI HP TouchPad Folio Flip Case with Muti-Function Stand - Purple (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen)), and it works well.  I had to cut it a little to use the camera and access volume, and I have to remove it from the case to charge it.  However, I got the Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) for my mother and this will fit the Le Pan II (identical size to the TC970) perfectly and allow easy access to all ports.  In general you can use any case designed for Ipad or Touchpad, but may need to cut a little free for all the ports to be open.Interface:**Pros:Latest OS (honeycomb with possible upgrade to ICS)Runs all online video well.  My main problem with the last version was that I could not watch amazon prime videos on it.  Partly it was the hardware, and partly android 2.2.  This tablet runs amazon streaming just fine, as well as Blip.tv, and comedy central's videos (just the few I have tested).  I do not have Netflix, but the reviews of the last tablet (TC970) said that it worked fine with the Netflix app and I expect this one will too.**Cons:None really.  I got used to the simplicity of Froyo, so Honeycomb is proving challenging to adapt to, but I still figured everything I wanted to do out within an hour or so of playing with it.Tying into the last point, the previous version the TC970 may be a little easier for the non-technical people to use.  My parents can use Android 2.2 with little trouble, but I think it would be tougher for them to use Honeycomb.  I got this one to try amazon streaming (which worked) but the TC970 was easy to use and could do almost everything.  If ease of use is a priority, you might consider the 970.  I might change my mind as I get more used to Honeycomb though, it might just seem more confusing having gotten used to one and having to switch.**The Company Le Pan:Like I said above, I have had the TC970 for over 2 months.  I take it everywhere and love it.  The new Le Pan II is replacing it, and my mom is getting my old one.  In the months of using the TC970 I can count the number of resets I had to do on one hand.  I had one booting issue over Christmas weekend.  Tech support for Le Pan opened again on Tuesday morning.  By 9am on Tuesday I got a response to my email for tech support and opened a ticket.  By the end of the day I had my tablet up and running again.  I was impressed with the professional and attentive support I got from Le Pan.  My father's and brother's tablets (also TC970s) have had no tech problems at all.tl,dr:  This is an excellent tablet with top end specs and abilities.  It has played every online video I can throw at it well (including Amazon Prime streaming).  Do not be frightened of the unknown company, I was at first, but the products are great and I have first hand experience with tech support and it was more than adequate.  I cannot recommend this or the previous TC970 enough, especially at the price.The battery life on the original 970 is better than this one (expected since this has twice the processor power), but this one is still what they quote.  Good 7 hours of straight use off of a single charge.  It loses about 1% per hour while asleep.Finally, on the video.  I can run every video I have tried, except Hulu.  Hulu identifies the device as mobile and will not let you play anything (I think this is something on Hulu's end).  I was able to watch Hulu on my old 970 indirectly with Playon, but it requires you to have a computer running the software nearby.  It worked fine though, and I could watch regular Hulu (I do not have Plus to test).  Trying on the 979 it seems to crash when I start the video, I expect it is an issue in Playon's app though, and will follow up with them.  Thus far Hulu is the only online video I can not get to work on the Le Pan II, and that is because it just blocks any mobile device it seems.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing for such a low priced tablet!", "Author": "Kristofer Brozio", "ReviewID": "R3423BTJILGGJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Le Pan TC970 is an excellent Android tablet, I am honestly thrilled with it. It's extremely responsive, never once did I have an issue with it slowing down no matter how many other things were going on. I'm thoroughly enjoying the TC970, and I think you will as well.Aesthetically the TC970 is very pleasing and stylish looking, it's also thin and lightweight. The build quality is excellent, it's a solidly made tablet on par with those much more expensive.I've had the pleasure of testing both the Motorola Xoom and the Samsung Galaxy Tab, and I have to say I like the Le Pan TC970 much better overall. The TC970 doesn't have a Tegra in it but from what I've seen it doesn't need it, it's more than capable a handling anything you can throw at it in terms of apps, games or videos or anything else. I was truly surprised that the 1Ghz CPU could handle everything I threw at it.The most surprising or actually amazing thing is the battery life, no joke here I got over eight hours use while doing a mixture of playing games and browsing the web. I even left I on just sitting and overnight and still had battery left to use it.The TC970 isn't without its problems though, but they're small and not deal breakers. I don't care for the Apple-like USB connection at all, I would have rather seen a standard micro-USB or even mini-USB connector.  The screen is very glossy causing reflections in the correct light and after a few hours of use you'll find the accumulated fingerprints very annoying.The built-in memory is rather small, yes you can put a larger microSD card in it but I would also like to see more built-in memory.The build quality is excellent, but the back is rather slippery honestly, I would have liked it to be more rubberized of textured for a better grip.The other small issue the limited video support, it can't play basic WMV or Divx files.Yes it's running Android 2.2, some people might think that's old and ask why not Gingerbread or Honeycomb. I thought the same thing so I asked them and they told me to expect an update last quarter of 2011 with Ice Cream Sandwich, they told me they decided to skip Gingerbread and Honeycomb and wait until the next major Android release.The camera shows things mirrored or backwards, a major update is supposed to be released any day now to fix it. I got no real explanation as to why the camera was that way in the first place though.The pros and cons are listed below and it might look like a lot of cons but they're small, and not exactly bad things really.Lastly I should mention the price, it's very low for a tablet of this caliber and quality. It's nice to see something this nice at a low price.Pros:+Amazing battery life+Very responsive touch screen+Does work in bright light+Fast and responsive overall+Low price compared to other tablets+Simple to use+Excellent design and construction+Aesthetically pleasing+Viewing from most any angleCons:-Proprietary connector-Screen attracts fingerprints-Glossy screen-Small built-in memory-Back is rather slippery-Can't use in direct sunlight-Limited video formats-Camera is backwards", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "**WON'T BE ABLE TO UPGRADE TO NEW ANDROID OS (ICS - 4.0)**", "Author": "B. Brinton", "ReviewID": "RBJKI1ZJG2707", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this tablet back in September and was initially fairly impressed. It looked pretty good, seemed to have a good build quality, had fairly fluid graphics and ran on Android. Plus, even though it was inexpensive, its memory was expandable to 32GB through the micro SD. I talked with their customer service folks before buying, and they explained that although the camera wouldn't actually work with video chat for the time-being, when the new Android OS (4.0) came out it would be able to [Note: I've since been corrected that there is other software and other ways of doing video chat]. As I started to use it I realized that Android 2.2 (aka froyo) is really mainly designed for cell-phones rather than tablets. It doesn't use the screen space very well, doesn't support split pane gmail, and is incompatible with a number of apps you'd would hope to be able to use on your tablet (although I managed to find others that still did most of what I was looking for, it was a pain--particularly given that it was a new product). I also noticed that although my wifi connection was fairly stable at home, it was extremely unstable with my school's enterprise wifi network--a big deal for me since I had bought it mainly for school use. Still, I figured that as soon as I would be able to upgrade to Android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), the rest of its functionality would be restored.Google released the source code for Android 4.0 (ICS) 2 days ago (Monday 11/14/11). I called Le Pan about the wifi issue today and confirmed that it was probably because of the old OS. I asked when I'd be able to upgrade the OS, and they said that their engineering folks were now saying it would be impossible to upgrade, but that they'd be coming out with a new tablet next year that would support it. I would be stuck with my current OS. I explained how limited the functionality was and how I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't reassured me that it would soon have the fully functioning OS and asked for a refund. They said they couldn't offer a refund unless it was broken in some way (as opposed to intrinsically broken). Fortunately, after talking with the folks at Amazon they are refunding it (way to pull through, Amazon!).I realize that for some of you this wouldn't be a deal-breaker and am giving it two-stars because it does work for some things. But for those hoping for a cheaper (slightly slower) iPad alternative, I'd say this isn't the android you're looking for.[Note: I realize that I could root it and install a slightly newer OS, but that would void the warranty, and it would ultimately be a dead-end--it would never get to 4.0 or beyond.]", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "First impressions -- beyond my expectations", "Author": "Coffee Infusion \"coffeeinfusion\"", "ReviewID": "R3X4IR6CE1HVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Update as of 2012-04-01 below]I'm in a rush and will hopefully write a more in depth review over time. First impressions:Let it be clear: I'm a first time Android user, and first time tablet owner. I've used an iPhone 3Gs for years and have a number of laptops and desktop workstations. I would say that in computing I'm an advanced user, but not an expert user. I do front-end Web development including coding, so I can figure out most things, but I don't have a degree in networking and usually figure stuff out thanks to our friends at Google. So perhaps don't know too much about computers, but I follow directions reasonably well when things start getting buggy.Why I wanted a Tablet:I like to read PDFs at night and my iPhone screen is just too tiny. Moreover, I like to practice my guitar using online or PDF tab and instruction and well as video instruction. Not only does the laptop create too much distance with the keyboard, but it only allows me to view documents in landscape mode. I felt that an eReader would be best, but I was very unimpressed with the performance of those I tested. I do prefer e-Ink for reading, but the slow processors just killed it for me. I eventually settled on a tablet as it was more versatile. I knew I wanted a monitor that was at least 9\", as most of my documents are in PDF format.Why I didn't buy an iPadAs an iPhone user I was committed to purchasing an iPad after doing a lot of tablet research. I figured that it was the best performer and I already owned many of the apps that would be iPad friendly. However, two things stopped me from taking the plunge. First of all, the iPads are what I consider prohibitively expensive for such a portable device (which I suspect I will eventually sit on, drop, or leave at a cafe by accident). Second, I really, really hate iTunes. It was mostly the iTunes headaches that solidified my decision to go with Android. I'm pretty good with computers and sometimes can't figure out how so many regular computer users seem to get by with iTunes. Don't get me wrong. I think Apple hit a home run with the iPhone. It is ingenious and I love mine -- but it's hard to believe the very same company that created a device so intuitive that it doesn't need a manual -- also created what could be the worst piece of software I've ever used. That would be iTunes. Fortunately, I found an ample iTunes substitute, but it was only after purchasing my Le Pan II.Why I settled on the Le Pan II.I did a lot of research before taking a chance on this one. Read hundreds of reviews and had actually given up on Android (as mentioned -- concluded that Apple was the only player in town) until I found the first version of the Le Pan. I was actually going to pull the trigger on that first model, but I felt the limitation of the OS would eventually become an issue in the app market. The Le Pan II is far more versatile unless you root the old one; something I just don't have time to deal with. I spend a good chunk of my time trying to troubleshoot PC and network errors and don't need another headache.Build Quality: 5 stars.LP II is quite heavy, but the heft has a very solid feel to it; no creaking or cheap feeling parts. Not prohibitively heavy, but it's definitely got some weight.Ease of use: 4 stars.My first real go at Android, and surprisingly it was a no-brainer. Very intuitive. The only reason it doesn't earn 5 stars is because I feel that the app organization is a bit confusing. You can choose to pull the apps onto the carousel sliding start pages, but I don't quite understand why that's necessary. With iOS, all the apps are in your carousel sliding start pages, and you can simply group them together using the drag and drop folder conversion concept -- much more elegant. I also experience some minor bugs when dragging apps to different carousel pages -- sometimes they skip over the destination page, and do other odd things. Not a big deal -- just not as polished as Apple.App installation simplicity: 5 stars.I was a bit concerned about app installation issues with Android, but all of my usual apps such as Evernote, Roboform, Skype, Google Apps and others loaded without a hitch.Speed: 5 stars.I recall testing out a few different tablets months ago at a local Best Buy. This Le Pan II strikes me as being on equal ground with the iPad in terms of response time. It's very responsive.Connectivity: 5 stars.Very simple. Connected to my wi-fi network sans events.Quick first impressions:So far my expectations have been exceeded by this high quality, bang for the buck. I haven't tested everything yet, but it organizes my PDFs and MP4 guitar lessons perfectly -- and so this purchase has been worthwhile. The PDF viewing is a little limited in terms of zoom factor, but I may have overlooked a setting that defines the percentage of zoom, etc. It may also be app related. I have only used Acrobat thus far, but have installed a number of readers.I love the fact that it uses a micro SD. The elastic door that covers the MicroSD is perhaps the only quality control issue -- it doesn't seem to seat flush with the unit, but this does not impact me in any way as long as it doesn't pop open.The keyboard layout takes a little getting used to. Not sure how enamored I am -- only time will tell. I may purchase a small Bluetooth keyboard and give that a whirl for business tasks where I need to do a lot of writing. Haven't found a way to turn off the vibration when I touch the keys -- despite disabling that function in settings. This concerns me because I need to do stealth reading and writing while my wife sleeps.The size is good, but not what I would call perfect. Ideally I would like a larger screen by at least 2 diagonal inches and a thinner, lighter body. That would really make it perfect for reading and reading music. But so far, this is adequate--a world better than both my laptop and iPhone. In time I hope to give long-term user impressions for those of you who want tablets for e-reading. Haven't tried it yet in sunlight but imagine it will make things pretty tough to see. I spend most of my time indoors in a poorly lit computing man-cave.I took the advice of one of the early reviewers and purchased the Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) that serves a dual function as a tablet stand. What a great suggestion. First of all, perfect fit, not buttons covered up. The case is so sturdy while supporting the tablet in various angles that I think it's a must-have item.Night readers: take note! If you hold the tablet in Document view, you can use the HP book-like cover as a shield to prevent light spillage from bothering your spouse while reading in bed at night. That right there is a home-run. I know that at least one of you out there is concerned about this issue, and it was hard to find sympathizers on Google. Brilliant solution.Last but not least, the cover of the case is stiff enough that you have ample support for viewing the Le Pan in Document View (whatever the opposite of landscape view is called). Get it.I just can't see paying $500 for a tablet when you can get such a marvelous piece of hardware for this price. I don't think tablets will really hit the mass market until they reach the $200-$300 price point. Le Pan II seems to be ahead of its time.-----------------------------------EDIT: 2012-04-01Despite the date this is serious feedback. No April Fools antics. Just wanted to take a moment and write that I'm still very satisfied with the Le Pan II. It has been a joy to own. That being said, I still believe that iOS is far easier to navigate and the fastest point from A-B. So if money were no object -- now that I have CopyTrans to replace iTunes, I might go with the iPad. But the total upside of the LePan is that Flash video compatibility is ubiquitous, and for my needs that's an important feature. I can access sites with integrated Flash applications, like Songsterr. It's amazing. iOS would be useless for any Web-based Flash apart from Youtube.I did have quite a scare with the Le Pan where I thought it was bricked. I had installed an app from the Android App Store that is a customized app launcher. The Le Pan went into a continuous reboot cycle for two days. I methodically addressed all the variables. Tried the hard reset with Cables in, cables out, etc. Finally performed the reset with the volume button held down, and that did the trick. Immense relief, because it was my last option. I think this is more indicative of Android OS, and nothing to do with Le Pan as a product or brand.One annoyance of the Le Pan II that I have not been able to resolve is another thing that is related to Android OS and not Le Pan itself. This is the hepatic vibration feedback when you push the navigation keys. It's a great feature in general, but when I want to do some stealth reading at night next to my sleeping wife, it's very annoying. Very stupid of Android to make this feature uncustomizable. There is no hack short of rooting the OS that addresses this.Another annoyance that I have fortunately solved is that the screen luminosity could only be reduced by a small amount for night reading. I went through a number of apps and finally came upon one which I will highly recommend to all of you night readers. What makes it great is that you can access it from any screen so if you accidentally disable it and your Le Pan is glowing like a torch while you spazz out to cover it up with the sheets, this app allows you to make a simple swipe gesture with your finger and you're back in dark screen mode.I will warn you that Android allows you to nearly brick your OS by adjusting the screen brightness to zero. So how on earth are you supposed to get your screen visible again if you can't see anything? I had this happen once accidentally while playing with the slider and thankfully I pressed the right place on the screen to get things visible again. Fortunately this app allows you to set a minimum of, say, 3% which gives you enough rendering to see everything you need. Therefore, You can never accidentally make the screen go black.App is called Display Brightness. Free if I recall from the Android store. Once you install the app, just add the widget to your home screen. Now keep this in mind since the widget isn't the most intuitive thing in the world. You need to set your default swiping area. Make sure you give yourself enough adequate area. It's in the form of a vertical strip. You can make that strip thinner or thicker. That attribute is controlled in the app setup screen by the top slider bar called the \"Select Size.\" Once that is enabled and you've tweaked everything perfectly after some trial and error, enable the app by pushing the \"Enable Indicator button on the lower left.\" Now, in whatever screen you may be, you just need to swipe your finger down to reduce the light and up to increase. One word of caution -- there may be a small, innocuous bug. Sometimes you will have apps with menu buttons on the top left of your screen. When you touch them, this disables the Display Brightness, so suddenly you have a glowing torch in the dead of night. Easy fix of course is to just swipe your finger down the left side of the screen again to go back into dark screen mode. This app is the most useful I've found. You will thank me :)If you would like to know about other useful widgets I've found just let me know.Other small annoyances of the Le Pan II. The volume buttons are so integrated into the profile of the Le Pan that I cannot find them with tactile fiddling. This becomes annoying, because in a dark environment you just cannot see them. Once you learn where they are, however, it's not that big a deal.Other than the one Brick scare I had, no other problems. My battery was being consumed like crazy at first until I learned how to manage apps and power consumption. Apple is far more intuitive in this department as well.My original use for this product was instructional guitar videos and guitar tab, and it's been perfect for that application.

The new cable is designed better and I feel it should last for years. Customer service is beyond compare. And here is the real deal that makes this the best tablet you can buy. I came home a while back and my tablet screen was shattered. I dreaded what that meant for my family. Hey we lost our pride and joy here. I contacted the manufacturer in the hopes of purchasing a replacement screen and be able to afford the cost. I feared the cost would be near as much as a new tablet. The company never even asked me what happened or offered me options for repair service. They just said \" no problem\"  \"send it back\" \"we'll send you a new one\" and they did rather super fast and I will be forever loyal to this manufacturer. Any other product they produce will become a member of my household. Now imagine any other tablet pc competitor when you call and tell them you have a cracked screen? Better have your cedit card ready huh?My opinion is based upon daily heavy use of this tablet pc. When I say heavy use, I mean many different users of all ages & experience for many hours at a time. And in all types of environments. This tablet has been stepped on, dropped, rained on, and even jumped on by the family pet. It has been operated at high & low temperatures.Now my initial reaction, not ever having much experience with a full touchscreen tablet pc (only my phone) was amazing. The thing that amazed me the most, (and still does) is the ability to have the whole world in the palm of your hands or fingertips with GoogleEarth. It was the best app I downloaded. Even my aged relatives who have been technilogically impaired or scared of computers took right to this thing and didn't want to give it back. There was no need for dexterity with a mouse since their fingers controlled the action.As for battery life, I realized with more use the battery seemed to drain more and more quickly after the first 2 weeks. But now at 6 weeks the battery seems to have found some new life and is holding up better than when first used. Although I must say I do not like the heat generated by the charger. It gets too warm for my tatse so I continually have to keep a check on the plug while charging.Also, I realized as an added bonus that my Motorola Karma pc cord fit perfectly in the charger base and allowed me to charge my phone with no issues.As stated by another user there was a ghost light up in the upper top left corner of my screen upon initial use. This light has spread somewhat and a new ghost light has showed up in the opposite corner after 4 weeks of use. It has to be quality control issue when the screen was sealed since I also have 2 tiny black specks sealed into my screen from the factory. Maybe they made these things too fast or for whatever reason, it's internal operating system makes up for the blemishes.It opens, streams, and downloads movies, webpages etc FASTER than my Sony Vaio PC. I have never experienced such instant speed while surfing the net. I noticed I was continually losing wi-fi connection but determined it not related to the tablet since all tests from other wi-fi sources in the house lost connection at the same time.Applications install & unistall instantly with no effort or trouble. I love how you open your fingers to make pages, words, or photos larger or squeeze them together to make smaller. And that you can have more than one home screen. Even though it's not actually a phone you can make calls via google talk and even video calls which we tested. Awesome!I found a case Lucky Brand Ipad Silicone & Flip book Style that fit this perfectly. The silicone case has a notch I cut out for the charger port and it made my day!I agree the power button is too small and very annoying and hard to operate. But now that I have this, I wouldn't trade it for nothing! I don't think I have been interested in the desktop or laptop since this arrived. Actually I never thought about using anything else to connect once I used this thing. It's brilliantly designed, inexpensive compared to other tablets, user friendly, loveable, and so much fun!Maybe if it was an official ipad the kids wouldn't have been allowed to carry it around so much or it wouldn't have been left in the middle of the floor. But then it would have been put high on a hog, and always been taboo for our family. This thing becasue of it's price was treated differently and in so doing allowed us to realize it full potential and worth! So when it was stepped on we cringed, but didn't get hysterical. When it was left in the rain we gasped but didn't lose our breath. When it was dropped on the concrete time stood still but we didn't seem to notice. And when the dog jumped on it and tried to dig a hole in the screen we just laughed and patted him on the head! Honestly, it has held up well and suffered no visible damage. So when the kids come in from their mud fight and want to use the tablet to take a pic of themselves I'll be sure to wash it off along with children afterwards!", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Gift For The Holidays", "Author": "Ted Rosauro", "ReviewID": "RCY4HIADC0PD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With specs close to the Ipad, the LePan TC970 is an excellent buy for half the price. And now that Walmart has a price rollback, I made the decision to compliment my smartphone with a tablet. The biggest difference between these two gadgets is the screen size and resolution, everything looks bigger and more visible on the tablet. But that comes at a price of portability, it is meant to be used indoors and sunlight will make the screen totally unviewable. But other than some minor complaints, this table is worth every penny.Here's a list or pros and cons that I've managed to collect in the short period of usage, I've spent most of it downloading apps and enjoying the new features and capabilities of my new toy. One reason I bought this is to install the Skype software which provides for voice and video conversations throughout the world. So with that said, let's go on with the list:Pros, The Good:Price - Amazon's price beats everyone.Quality - Much, much better than the cheap competition.Size - Just right and very slick, the dust cloth comes in handy.Ipad Screen - The 9.7 screen and 1024x768 res is a standard for tablets.Fast Wifi - Wireless connection and speed are both easy and fast.Working GPS - No antenna cables here, the built in chip works like the phones.Working Bluetooth - Great for pairing headphones and file transfers.512mb memory - Not the stingy 256mb found on other models.2g internal memory - More apps to load, no more out of memory messages.32g SD card max - You want more storage, just buy a 32g micro sdhc and you're set.AccelerometerAmbient light sensorFront facing camera and microphone for video call/chat.Settings behind status bar dropdown, very convenient.2g internal storage expands non-SD apps capacity. A big plus for apps that cannot move to SD.Ambient light sensor controls screen brightness. Saves the battery.Screen is very sensitive to the touch, a fly could probably land on it and cause unpredictable results.Most apps designed for the Ipad will probably feel at home on the LePan because of the same screen and resolution.Cons, The Bad:No manual, learn by trial and error. I haven't checked the [..] website yet.Very narrow handles cause fingers to touch sensitive screen.Accidental hit of back button very annoying. Wish those handles would extend out for better grip.Comand button lights not controlled by ambient light sensor, hard to see in the dark.SDHC chip slot location very awkward, huge closure tab gets in the way. Bad design.Hardware buttons are not labeled, must grope to locate.Back button should not be too sensitive to the touch, it will exit the app in progress. Extremely annoying.Still lack compatibility with some tablet apps due to hardware and software differences. Mostly video games that demand faster graphics chips like the Nvidia Tegra.

It is a very nice unit, I especially like the microphone button built into the virtual keyboard.  I bought this for my son, I have an iPad2.  This does everything the iPad2 does except perform well on the network.  As a senior engineer of XXX, I am well schooled in WiFi and understand the technology.  I have tested the throughput on 4 different Access points.  What I notice is that when connected, the connection speed rarely matches the actual connection speed ( not a problem with other devices). As an example it will show 1Mbs when in fact my iPad2, my 2 lenovo laptops and my HP laptop all connect at 54Mps.  Even when it does connect at 54Mbps, the actual throughput using several tools and test sites ( speedtest.com / speakeasy.com / Vudu speedtest...) rarely exceeds 1 MBps.  In fact, the upload speed is normally faster.  I read through the FAQs, spoke to LePan tech support, this is not an issue on my end.  I have tried WEP, WPA ( I would not reccomend this- the Le Pan does not see a constant signal vis WiFi alalyzer available from amazon marketplace) LEAP and open.  All exhibit the same on both my home and work networks.  I have on occasion seen it spike to 5-6MPs, but it is rare and I cannot pin point what it is that allows it to occasionally ( 1-25 maybe connects) to download at the capability of the access point and network allow.  I spent 10 hours changing settings, routers, turning off GPS, encryption, channels, downloading updates, stood next to the Access point, you name it, I tried it.  I sure hope they fix this as its is a clear winner for the price ( I did not but it through Amazon as they are on backorder).If you don't care about streaming high quality video and connection speed is unimportant- you cannot go wrong with this.  As another person pointed out, the CaseCrown case fits perfect and is on sale now.  I cannot give this the 5 stars it deserves becuase of this poor download speed issue, it is a deal breaker for me.  IF Le Pan does not come through before my 30 day window is up, I will be returning this for another brand.

I'm soo thankful for all the reviewers here on Amazon for their wonderful reviews...you guys rock!!!  I see NO reason to spend a couple hundred more bucks on any other tablet and this one will do it all.My le pan came in yesterday and I did what lots of peeps suggested...let it charge completely before trying it out.  I never would have thought this tablet would be so resonpsive.  I touch something and instantly it does it.  The touch screen is right on.  I'm using it now to write this review...even on Amazons small search box, tapped it one time and it hit it right on.  The keyboard has no lag time, I type it does it.Switching between websites is just as fast as with my laptops.  Every web page I've thrown at it, it loads it right up.  I'm not having any of the WiFi issues that others are talking about.

Lots of free games/ apps on there.  They all downloaded as as fast as my iPod does apps with iTunes.  I tried a few YouTube vids myself on this and only one of them stopped to buffer one time...not a problem...press pause wait a bit then resume...no biggie!!Used the connector that came with it to hook it up to my laptop to see about adding some music...no problems there..loaded right up.  Haven't tried any loading any movies onto it yet though..not really sure what format they should be in??  Is it mp4??  If someone knows, please leave me a comment to let me know.I really don't see why people are complaining about the finger prints on this tablet...I mean, really...it IS a touch screen...it's going to get your prints all over it.

I am actually contemplating returning the unit, it has a bright spot of light about 1/4\" wide on the screen in the left center of screen like the tft screen is worn away there, so starting off with a defect. I come pre-biassed because I bought a Asus EEE Transformer Honeycomb tablet and ordered the base laptop for it. I was online and saw this, because I could not justify spending almost $600 on a tablet + base so I was going to return the ASUS. However after comparing the 2 I have to say the ASUS wins hands down. The ASUS is only $399 (without base), this one is $349. I do not like Honeycomb and thought I would get a tablet with Froyo but the ASUS screen is SO MUCH MORE CRISP. I will say the screen is very crisp and has VERY wide viewing angles on the Le Pan, but any video I play I see pixilation and bluryness as the processor is not a dual core. The quality of the resolution on the Le Pan is not as good. I do have a fast N connection and get better video on other tablets. The ASUS pad has it's own issues with video and I hate Honeycomb so far, but I cannot justify spending $50 less and getting a tablet (Le Pan) that is NOT widescreen (9.7) 4:3 ratio and so far has no real history or support. I dont want to be stuck with a tablet that 6 months down the road, the company will not exist or support updates. I will say the unit does play Angry Birds well, so other games should not be a issue. As others have said Netflix does not play out of the box. The few things this tablet has going for it, is long battery life, GREAT viewing angles, it DOES fit most generic ipad cases very well and it is fairly light with good build quality. I dont know why they chose to put the charger port at the top of the unit though. Overall the unit is good if you just want something that works and fairly good quality that mimics the ipad shape.

I purchased my tablet on Feb 3rd and received it around the 10th. I decided to wait a little while before making any comment to see if the tablet might produce some glitches after regular use. So far there have been no glitches noticed.I originally owned the Samsung 7 inch G-tab. The Samsung had all the bells a whistles but the reduced screen size was a major disadvantage for me because I wanted to use my tablet to read from during sermons and speeches. My first experience with the Android tablets revealed that the tablet functions were basically the same as my android cell phone. They basically will not do anymore than your phone is capable of doing (just a larger screen). The tablet really doesn't work well (for me) when trying to produce projects like papers, art, video editing, spread sheets, or Power Points. You can do some manipulations on projects, but nothing serious. The biggest advantage of the tablet for me is portability, screen size verses a phone, gaming, reading, videos, and making presentations. Armed with this knowledge I sat out to find the best tablet for the money.After hours of research (in my humble opinion) the La Pad tablet is by far the best for my wants. The picture quality is above reproach. The processing speed outstanding. The screen resolution... fantastic. The 4.3 screen layout is preferred over the 16.9 aspect ratio, unless you are looking at a movie. Basically, what I am trying to say is that this tablet will serve you just as well if not better than any other at twice the cost.Last words...I would advised you to educate your self before making any purchase.

Initially that worried me too until I started looking at the Android marketplace and found that most Android apps and games will run on Android version 1.x .  I had to think to myself that by the time Android 2.2 becomes outdated, I'll be able to buy another more current tablet again for around $200 or so bucks and still have paid less than $600+ today for a 32gb iPad 2 which will also be obsolete by the time my Le Pan is...hmmm...makes sense to me to own this tablet with an upgraded 32GB mini SD card for under $250 than to pay over double that price for an iPad or any of the other 32 GB Android tablets currently on the market that are priced much higher.This tablet easily handles email, video, music , android games, and microsoft office applications with an office app.  I'm even writing this review by speaking it into the android speak to text application.  I do not know of another tablet that can do everything this one can for this low of price and I searched everywhere.By the way, it's awesome to have a tablet in standby mode (It can go a couple days in standby before needing recharged) that you can quickly turn on to jump online or check email!  For the money it really is a no-brainer.  If you want to switch out the micro SD card for a larger one,(comes with a small 2GB card)just copy the contents of the 2GB card onto one that is up to 32Gb in size and voilla you're ready to go.Also the Targus Truss Leather Carrying Case for Apple iPad works well with the Le Pan if you're looking for a cover that fits well, plus it has a built in stand.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dead after 1 year and 6 months", "Author": "David P.

(And it does have them) this device is very prone to Freezing. There is a reset button on the back of the device under power that will get you running again.Sometimes you might run into an issue with it freezing if you connect it to your pc (Also Your PC will not charge your device it must be from the 2.0A wall charger an ipad charger outputs about the same and a ipad cable can work if you shave down alittle of the plastic sides ON THE END OF THE CABLE not the device alternatively inside the power jack on the lepan there is a tiny metal tab that you can bend back and the normal ipad cable will fit without shaving anything.) If you go under settings/application/development and check mark (Stay Awake) that should stop it from freezing from usb to pc hookup.Some users have had the device go to sleep and not want to turn back on (Sometimes the lepan needs you to press and hold the power button the hit the reset before releasing the power) under settings/display/screen timeout set it to 30 minutes and put it to sleep manually.For those of you who now have a paper weight (Device won't turn on no matter what and you're out of warranty) this device seems to have a weak battery jack. My lepan was second hand and I was having all sorts of issues (Device was freezing it would not charge fast/right had problems turning on etc.) I decided just to check the battery. So I got a little Philips head and flat head screw driver (Under the micro sd tab THERE ARE TWO SCREWS THAT MUST BE REMOVED carefully disconnect the back cover from the lepan I find the far end (Away from the power button) to be the easiest place for me to start (The hold switch and volume key can come out so be careful) the battery jack is located on the side the power button is. Mine must have come loose in transit it was a full quarter inch out of the socket after pushing it back in and putting a small piece of electrical tape over it my Lepan worked much better did not freeze as much charged and power on like it was suppose to.I don't know why this device freezes so much. It does seem related to the wifi in some way, does not freeze nearly as much with wifi turned off.

However, price is not all that matters with these things and it really depends on what you use it for and overall quality.I don't regret the purchase, but people who are used to consumer ready products and don't like to hack, figure things out, etc should stick with Galaxy or iPad.Advantages:- Great price- Solid qualityDisadvantage:- Lack of accessories. Even basic ones such as USB OTG or HDMI connector.- Touchscreen sometimes has trouble with pattern unlock (this may be more my product or my fingers though)- Lacks back camera (I didn't think this would be a problem, but it's something I would like to see). I knew this buying it though and it's negated with the price.General:This is very well built. I'm pleased with the way it feels and it works as I expected (if you have an android phone, it's basically a big giant phone). I had no problems installing Android Applications. Any disadvantages with the software are inherent with the software and not with the tablet.The manufacturer's website is very sparse with information. If you want any significant information you have to search for it and find what others have to say about it.Performance:I use it mostly for PDF reading. It's pretty slow for large files on any number of reading devices. However, it displays small files very well. I use it for double column journal articles and it's big enough (for me) to read it in \"fit screen mode.\" This is true of both Adobe Reader, Aldiko, and one other reader I forgot the name of and have since uninstalled.I installed an unofficial version of VLC player (noneon version) and it works great. No complaints there.Software:It's pretty bare... but that's how I like it. Unlike my Samsung Epic 4G, it's not filled with bloatware and I can install many of them.This is a big plus for me and I've installed all the applications I normally like without any bugs.Applications (known) that I use that work great: Google Voice, Skype, Kindle Reader, Aldiko, Facebook, Firefox, eBay, VLC, Tivo, Wikipedia.The Adobe Reader does strange things when you change stretch/zoom in view settings. For me, if I change it while reading a PDF it escapes out and goes back to the main adobe file selection screen. This may be software though.Networking:It doesn't accept ad hoc connection (unless you root it). I found out this is common to most mobile devices not just Le Pan. The device doesn't seem to have a problem finding my network at home but it does seem to have a hard time finding new networks when I go to Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, etc (or other restaurant with free Wifi). It's not a huge problem, but it takes a while to find new networks.Bluetooth is slow... It's slower transferring files than my Samsung Epic 4G and a Treo. However, I don't do much with Bluetooth anyway and the mouse I installed works fine and was easy to install.Accessories:Horrible support. This is a relatively new product and it's not from one of the big manufacturers, but it misses some of the basic accessories that they should have made pre-launch. I can say this because I'm an electrical engineer and I've checked their the circuit diagram they submitted to FCC,... there should be no reason they shouldn't have had their HDMI adapter ready at launch.Does not have a 30-pin connector to USB connector. I would have liked to see them come outAlso, regarding accessories, they are difficult to find. You have to send an e-mail to customer support and pay $10 shipping to receive a cable.Their products aren't compatible with any other tablet device. Some iPod chargers work if you shave a piece of plastic off though.Summary:Overall, if you can do without the HDMI or connecting to external USB devices this is an excellent product.

The overall speed, ease of use, memory utilization and general operation is outstanding. There are, of course, some down sides, but these are minor compared to the overall operation.  The quick start instructions fail to tell you that you have to push the power button twice, holding it the second time until it buzzes, to start the tab when the charger is plugged in, this is not true under battery operation. The WIFI tends to be intermittent but this improves with on time. Like all computers, it freezes at times, but defrosts itself with patience, one trick I found to speed this is to flip pages. The included apps, while pretty basic, work well. As is true of most touch screens, fingerprints seem to appear out of nowhere, but are easily removed with the provided dry cloth. The camera being only on the front side is great for video phone calls or video messaging, but not for taking pictures or video, although no worse than the cell phone I have that has the camera only on the outside making video calls a pain.

Well, I actually have a love/hate relationship with it. When it works properly, I love it for all sorts of reasons. The design is nice with a solid brushed aluminum body. Impressive. There are many things I love about it but if it's not going to be reliable, it's useless. It freezes many times a day now. I do everything I can to maintain it but it just isn't agreeable. A few months ago, the pitifully designed power button broke. LePan fixed it and had great customer service, but it took over a month to get it back because they were so backed up. Hmmmm. . . .maybe this is a design flaw. I have tried to contact LePan about the freezing problem and they sent out a generic e-mail, rather than answered my problem.

Purchased this for my wife.  Received on January 21st.  Charged it up, turned it on and it immediately recognized my network.  Typed in the access code and was off and running.  Brought the Le Pan II to my sons house and it immediately recognized his network, also.  It worked flawlessly on both networks.  My son was blown away by this unit and now wants one.  And, he is a long time Android user.  My wife brought it in to work.  One of her colleagues has already ordered one and another is seriously thinking of doing the same.Response time is as good as her Pentium dual core notebook.  Videos from Youtube, Netflix, Crackle, games, etc. all stream smoothly with no hesitation.  I have not experienced poor network connection, jerky or buffering video issues that a couple of posters have mentioned.  And, I'm pretty fussy.  Any issues I have experienced were application specific and had nothing to do with the Le Pan II.  There is a minute amount of bleeding in the corners from the LEDs used to backlight the screen.  But it is not noticeable when playing any video content.  I have the same effect on a 22 inch Samsung LCD TV.  This is truly not even worth mentioning.  But someone raised this point in a previous post.  Placed a video call using Tango.  Video and audio synced well.  The video coming from my sons end was not great, but he has a low res camera and he was in a dimly lit room at the time.  Will have to try again under better conditions.  As others have stated, this unit has a quality feel and the screen is incredible.  Nice touch sensitivity across the entire screen.  The fact that it has GPS capability without the need for 3G network connection is a nice bonus.  It's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capable.  Battery life is great!!!  We are new to the Tablet and Android OS world.  The Le Pan II compares favorably to my wife's laptop, in many ways, and I can't imagine anyone not being thrilled with this unit.Purchased the Targus Truss case for the HP touchpad and everyone has been as impressed with the case as with the Le Pan II.

The tablet showed up from Amazon, and it seemed to do okay for about two months (30-days after the 30-day Amazon warranty expired). I took a chance on this tablet, know this device could be unstable, but I knew I wasn't going to use it very often. As it turns out, I did begin to depend upon it greatly, 6-months after my purchase, it just stopped working. I called Amazon and they referred me to the manufacturer.First things first, let's get the tablet review out of the way. As I said, it seemed to do okay the first 2-months, and then it became unstable. I understood that this operating system was not upgradable to Gingerbread, and I was okay with that.When I say it was unstable, I mean it lost internet connection frequently, forced closing apps, browser issues, etc. I understand that apps can be unstable on any device, but the most annoying was how it would lose internet connection from my Wi-Fi every time I used it. I would have to go through an 8-step series of steps to get back to where I was on the internet after losing connection. My daughter who also has an Android tablet (EVO view) did not suffer the same issues while using her tablet at the very same time. During the time I have owned this device, I have had to perform over five factory reboots.Let's say you were okay with the fact it is a low quality device, maybe you think \"well, it's less than $200, you get what you pay for\", you would be right! The only problem with this is that the customer service for LePan, which is who Amazon referred me to after explaining that there was a manufacturer alert for this product, is equally as unstable as the device they manufacture! I am still not sure why Amazon does not send out alerts on the products you purchase from them, after all, they send you everything else under the that have nothing to do and sometimes everything to do with products you purchase from them.Anyway, Amazon gave me the customer service number to contact LePan, and it took several phones to get through the first time. It was an automated voice recording (not a touch-system), and either it would re-loop the recording over and over again an insane number of times (in English, as well as Spanish), and the finally putting you out of misery by hanging up on you. You should know that during my time dealing with them for three weeks now, I have had repeated situations like this occur.At first, when getting a hold of a human, I explained what was transpiring and they referred me to their web site to fill out a claim form. The only problem with this is that my tablet no longer worked and I did not have access to the internet anymore! The representative explained that the device would have to be replaced, and that I would have to arrange and pay for the return of this device. Just so you are aware and you do not heed the advice in this post, it was over $26 to ship.The first night of making contact with them, my daughter came by with her laptop so I could set up a case to begin the process or the line of communication so I thought. It has been three weeks now, and I still do not have a replacement tablet. I found out through UPS (who are just as bad as LePan), that they had in fact delivered the defective tablet to LePan on the 10th, and still no tablet or sign of a tablet. I have written numerous times within their case system. So far, my inquiries have been met with either silence or silly questions like, \"what is your shipping address\", and in todays phone message \"we have some more questions\". You should know that when I filled out a case, I put in my shipping address, when I shipped the device back; it was tied to an RMA, which included my shipping address. When I shipped the device back, I included a manifest that contained my RMA, the Case # and my (drum roll please) .... Shipping Address!Your take away from this should be: Do not purchase this product because it is poorly manufactured and the vendor is irresponsible and unreliable.You should know that I do not have a negative view against everyone and everything. I am a little baised towards UPS and prefer Fed-Ex or USPS. I purchased from Amazon because of their liberal return policy. DO NOT COUNT ON THAT FOR THIS PRODUCT. I will still purchase from Amazon, but I will try to purchase the more expensive products in person, locally. I have recently purchased and IPad 2 that I am really loving now.

We did not have any issue with Wi-Fi and speed, as reported by some. One star subtracted because of battery (it drains quicker than I expected, and it takes way too long to re-charge).  Camera is also not so good (using it with Skype), but I did not expect anything special.Other than that, Honeycomb is still not as robust operating system and some applications can crash from time to time, but that does not have anything to do with tablet itself.Overall, this is very good alternative for more expensive tablets. For those that are still researching, I can definitely recommend (and by the way, 7 inch tablets are just not big enough, even for casual users).Update (June 14th 2012):Many had problem with this tablet not powering up. I would like to share work-around for that issue, since I experienced it too.Likely cause: It looks that if you leave battery to drain completely, tablet will not be able to charge properly.Effect: As a result of above, tablet appears as dead, even if plugged in chargerWork-around: Use reset button (you will need to use something sharp to press it) to reset tablet while plugged in charger. If needed, unplug and plug charger again.Above works for me, and I can always recover from this issue. Of course, this is kind of annoying, but if you make sure to regularly charge tablet, and not letting it drain completely, it will work just fine.

I've had it about a week now and it's so easy and great fun! I've had absolutely no issues with my wireless (Verizon) which I found to be very fast - surprisingly so.

YouTube videos (at 1/3 of the screen size) buffer and play great. I downloaded some games for the heck of it and enjoyed them so much I was playing for hours.  I got over 6 hours on my 1st battery charge and that was downloading, playing movies and games and I even had a some windows open in the background.

It is decently powerful, and though it's a bit smaller than most of the 10.1\" tablets out there, you don't miss the extra real estate. My only complaint is that the 32 pin connector is proprietary, so if I ever lose it I'm out of luck - unless I can modify an iPad connector to fit. Some notes:- The GPS is surprisingly accurate. I had this thing tethered to my HTC Incredible (rooted, installed Cyanogenmod 7 - highly recommend doing this), and when I fired it up while sitting in a parking space at my local Home Depot, the blue arrow was over the exact space I was sitting in. I tried it in a few other spots and it was within a couple of meters every time.- The honeycomb interface is slick. Most apps designed for handsets will scale nicely on honeycomb,and a few seem to know they're on a table and adjust their layout accordingly.- You might as well order the HP slate case that everyone else is getting. You won't find a decent quality case at your local big box stores that fits this unit. Get the screen protector too.- Update 3/5/2012 - Yes, you can use an iPad/iPod connector. On the tablets receptacle for the adapter, there is a small metal tab. You can carefully bend this back. it will only very slightly protrude above the openning, and won't interfere with the connector. You can get data and charge all on the same cord. Android coexisting with iOS technology?- Update 4/6/2012 - After using this tablet for a few months, I am still completely satisfied. It is equally adept at work or play. One quirk I discovered: You can't see certain apps in the android market. This is because while it comes with a Market (or \"Play\" as it's now called), the makers of the Tablet haven't registered with the open handset alliance. Therefore, they're blocked from downloading apps. The fix for this? You can \"side load\" apps - eg download them as an APK file, move them onto the tablet and install them that way. You won't be able to get updates from the market for side loaded apps. You'll need to root your tablet, then edit the build.prop file to change the fingerprint of the tablet to something else. This will only affect your market apps, and won't bother anything else. However, you may wind up loading incompatible apps, which can be inconvenient of they cause your tablet to malfunction.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Productive and Fun", "Author": "B.

I am the \"techie\" in the family and saw how much enjoyment my kids were getting from their iPod Touches that I decided I wanted one myself - just to play around with.  Then reality sank in and I remembered how expensive they were and how I hated typing on them and viewing things on them with my 47 year old eyes.  I quickly vetoed that idea and then ran across this tablet one day.  It was something I thought was the best option for me.While it is not as slick as the Apple products, it is slick enough for me.  I have been able to make use of free apps that I use on a daily basis that help me be more productive both at home and work (I work from home).  I use dropbox, goodle docs, open office viewer, documents to go, springpad, evernote, skitch, mint, youtube, facebook, pandora, sugarsync,flixster, astrid tasks, remind me, assistant, kitchen timer, stopwatch, voice recorder, alarm clock plus, the weather channel, habit streak, gmail, mobo task killer, chore checklist, angry birds, jewels, word search, words with friends, lose it, workout trainer, food planner, adobe reader ,etc.  I am finding I am using this tablet more for productivity reasons (work & reminders) that it probably has already paid for itself in the many little ways it has helped me out.Using the Mobo Task Killer frequently after opening a lot of apps, helps me keep freezing issues at bay for the most part.I wake up with alarm clock plus which lets me customize how I want to be awaken.  I prefer a gentler way of waking up as opposed to standard alarm clocks that wake you up by scaring you to death with their loud buzzing.  Upon waking, I can quickly check the weather with the weather channel app so everyone in the family immediately knows how to dress.  No more turning on the tv and waiting for the weather report to come up.  Time for work, it is a great complement to my pc because I can reference pdf documents on the tablet as I do my work on the PC (thanks to dropbox and adobe reader), and I can check email quickly and easily as well.  Dinner time, I can reference a recipe on the tablet as it stands it the Targus case I got for it (for the HP Touch-fits well), and cook up something new for the family.  After dinner, relax and do some light surfing, reading, video watching, or game playing all while sitting comfortably on the couch.  I've even used the navigation app once just to see how it worked and it works just fine in one direction anyways.  I still print out instructions from my pc, but it's nice to hear a play by play as well.So I got this tablet thinking I would probably never use it all that much, but now that I have it I am using it every single day and for so many reasons.

My only gripe about this tablet, is sometimes you need to reset the tablet because of some software hiccups, like a system freeze and being directed back to the main screen (meaning the load screen when first turning on the device), but it only happens once in a while, plus it's only happened to me twice.

You can easily plug in bigger external speakers like people do with mp3 players via the headphone jack or even bluetooth.Pros: Bright screen, excellent resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio (perfect for web surfing), micro SD card slot for expanded storage up to 32GB (buy one with a a full-size SD adapter or a USB plug that reads micro SD for file transfers) Kingston Flash Card Reader MobileLite G2 USB 2.0 Multi-card Reader FCR-MLG2, not too heavy, Android 3.2 upgradable to 4.0, bluetooth. Plays videos smoothly. Half the price of an ipad.Cons: No USB slot or jack to read thumbdrives, 30-pin connector with no dongles that Le Pan advertises that'll will work for devices such as USB, HDMI & so on (maybe that will change with firmware? Le Pan???) minus 1 star. Fingerprint magnet, a little slippery to hold without a case. Sound not very loud in speakers (there are EQ apps for that though). I have a dead pixel that creates a faint line across the top of the screen. Hoping that won't bother me any worse. A slight bit of light bleeding in the corners on black screens...not very noticeable...but at least it didn't cost $600+!I highly recommend this tablet. If only they would start stocking it again!***UPDATE 1/27/12***I've decided the dead pixel creating the faint line across the screen bothered me enough to do an RMA exchange with where I bought it. So, I'll be tabletless for a while...hope I can handle it :PAlso hoping the new tablet won't have any wi-fi issues like some here are having.***UPDATE 3/01/12***Got the replacement tablet a few weeks ago.Works perfect so far (no dead pixels, wifi works great). I still highly recommend this tablet.

It was a birthday present for my husband. I had done a lot of research on tablets before I purchased and the Le Pan seemed like the best performer for the price (I couldn't afford to buy any of the higher range tablets).The tablet that arrived from Walmart was a complete disaster. It was missing the SD card, there was no manual/instructions included and the tablet had obviously been previously handled because it was covered in fingerprints. It performed horribly - constantly needing to be reset. I was very disappointed and returned the tablet to Walmart with the intention of purchasing a different tablet. My husband however had since read Le Pan reviews and was confident that if we tried another one from somewhere else it might be different.So I bought a Le Pan from Amazon and it was like a completely different product. Everything that should be included was there and there have been absolutely no problems with it a month later.My husband is a techie nerd and he loves the Le Pan. Every evening after dinner he settles down on the couch with his tablet and is like a kid with a favourite toy!I have a feeling the tablet I purchased from Walmart was a refurbished model, or perhaps a returned faulty one.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost Awesome", "Author": "Joseph Duncan \"JWD\"", "ReviewID": "R1ECAFFZRZONBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love gadgets, so I decided to give the Le Pan TC 970 a shot. For a bargain basement tablet, it is so close to awesome that it kind of makes its failings more obvious. On the plus side, you have a gorgeous 9.7 inch screen, very snappy multi-touch controls and a solidly built casing. On the negative side, it is running Android 2.2 and takes quite a bit of fiddling to get a good collection of apps. Seems like half the stuff I download thought I was using a phone and wouldn't display full screen or was in low resolution mode. Battery for me drains pretty quick. I don't know why because everyone else seems to think this thing has an awesome battery. I have to say, however, that I am satisfied with this purchase so far. I have netflix for movies, pandora for music, comicat to read my comic books, dolphin hd browser for surfing, and kindle for reading. All work great and in high resolution. For news I have Huffington Post, Techcrunch, Pulse, and CNET. They work great, too. Youtube works. The only thing I found lacking was the games. Bejeweled 2, Angry Birds, Cardshark, Peggle, Where's My Water and Cut the Rope worked fine. Other games like Scrabble, Fruit Ninja etc would crash, display half-screen in cell phone mode or in low resolution. Unfortunate, because the screen is so nice and touch is so responsive. For what I need it to do, read books, magazines and comics and maybe listen to some music and watch a video every now and then, I give it four stars. I deduct one star for the limited game capabilities.

It's for the CaseCrown Hard Case (Black) for the Apple iPad 2 Wifi / 3G Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB.It got lots of great reviews from the iPad users so I ordered it last week for the Le Pan II I had on order from Amazon but they couldn't deliver my Le Pan before Jan. 31st to Feb. 9th so i canceled there and ordered it from Best Buy... it arrived today and it looks fantastic  I haven't tried it yet because I read the manual for the 970 and it says FULLY charge the battery for at-least 8hrs. before the first use and after thet you can use the tablet while charging but only after the first charge so i called Le Pan support and they say yes its the same rules for the Le Pan II then he e-mailed me the user manual for the Le Pan II because some units shipped before the manual was ready. But the case arrived yesterday and this case is a perfect fit for the Le Pan it doesn't block any ports or controls, you can even connect the charger with it in the case It's a hard case with soft padding inside. What the pictures on amazon do not show is that if you rotate it so that the case top is on your lap you can then adjust it for better typing angles. I saw a YouTube video of a guy testing this case by throwing his iPad on a rock. I don't recommend doing that but it is a very good case that offers great protection for your tablet, much better than those silicone sleeves I see everywhere. The only thing I see wrong is I might need to cut 2 small speaker holes in the inner pad that holds the tablet... but I'll wait to see how it sounds in the case first.I got mine for $3.21 but it looks like when they started getting lots of orders from Le Pan owners they raised their price to $15.21But even at the higher price I still think it's better protection then those folios because it zips closed all the way around.

We were looking for a tablet for my 87 year old mother.. Basic needs were, large easy to see screen, ability to do email, web surfing, and skype.  Did not want to spend $500 on an iPad II ... Good product but just too expensive for this situation.  Originally had what we thought was a great deal on demo model Motorola Zoom at a local retailer but when the time came, the price was higher than we agreed, etc, etc...So we walked and then had to find a solution quickly... 72 hours to be precise!  Started searching online... what did we do before Amazon, eBay, etc.?..Found the Le Pan TC970 ... Met our criteria with a good sized screen.  Limited to Android 2.2 Froyo but I'm reasonably confident my Mother wouldn't know Froyo from Frodo so no worries there... Older simpler interface is actually a good thing in this situation.  Got it online with rush delivery for around $225 and was really impressed.  Is it bleeding edge tech? .. No.  Does it do everything the low to mid range tech level user wants?...YES!  Nice screen and touch sensitivity is good.  Sound is O.K. ... I have a HP Touchpad which has the \"Beats\" sound system and is IMHO the best sound but wait .. It's a tablet not a boom box!  Plug in some ear buds and it sounds as good as a $500+ tablet.  Connected to WiFI out of the box with no issues.  E-mail setup easy.  Latest version of Skype works .. Minor glitch with video on the Le Pan end only for the first 5 seconds, then works great.  Browser is great.  All other functions work as described.  Power connector is a Apple iPad connector and plugs into any USB power source.  All the apps I downloaded from the marketplace worked great.  My 87 year old mother has mastered receiving and sending e-mail, browsing so she can find an listen to Andrea Bocelli singing, and even got Skype vodeo chat working though she keep covering the camera with her thumb :-)For the price, this is a great product.  I don't understand why this product and manufacturer doesn't get more media coverage .. IMHO this is the iPad rival .. Only slightly heavier than my wife's iPad II, great fit and finish with nice sturdy feel (not plastic), does almost as much (and plays flash!), and is half the price!I beleive the new Le Pan II is now out and there are some other models in the pipe from this manufacturer...

I was a bit worried about it feeling outdated and about some things I had read that you had to fiddle with it to get Netflix working and about launchers not showing up in the android market for some reason.  Another reason I was hesitant is some of the reviews have indicated bad wifi strength and problems getting/staying connected to their wifi.  Lastly I was worried (and still am a bit) about the reviews stating their tablets had freezing/dying problems.Well so far, NONE of these have been issues with my unit.  I updated using the steps on the Le Pan website (lepantab(dot)com).  I logged into the android market and Amazon Appstore without issue.  I haven't found an app yet that won't run.  Netflix works perfectly. My wifi signal (using WPA2 encryption) is great and stays connected. Running froyo hasn't been an issue for me other than looking a bit dated in the menues/notification bar.  I got ADW launcher running as a home replacement so I could fit more icons on one screen (the default looks kinda goofy with the icons so spread out in my opinion).Most of all, the screen is BEAUTIFUL and very responsive/sensitive.  I have had several people ask how much it costs and get a  surpised look when I tell them I got it for such a low price.  The screen and overall build quality does not look \"budget\" at all.This tablet easily gets a 5/5 so far from me.My only complaints about it so far are 1. the proprietary usb/charging cable.  I hate proprietary connectors and wish this could just have a micro or mini usb port.  2. An upgrade to honeycomb would be nice but I knew about it not getting updated before I ordered mine so I can't complain too much.

I considered the fact that it was a tablet, and a brand name I had never heard of, so I bought the extended warranty for it as well. I am a Tech, so I figured I could fix it if it broke, but the $60 price of the warranty was a no brainer.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of it so far. It's fast, the screen is great, and it's internal memory is expandible up to 32gb. The build quality is solid and I like the aluminum back.

I should of sent it back right then and there but I chose to ignore it because it would work fine again. My wife enjoyed using the tablet for the Kindel  books and Pinterest. No games were ever played on it. It was well taken care of. Well fast forward to 6/25/2012 6:44 PM. My wife hands me the tablet and says it is falling apart. I look at it and the screen is popping up and on the bottom edge the seam is coming apart. I first attempted to call the warranty hotline and was told that all operators were busy and to file a claim online. Well I did that at the e-mail that was provided on their warranty page. I sent a picture in with the email and was referred to open a ticket through the website. I did that and was given a response that the sent my case was being sent to their corporate office. Here is all that transpired. This was copied and pasted from their support page. I did not edit it. I even left my spelling errors.Case History (10 Comments)John L. Collins on 6/29/2012 8:48 PMI doubt you truly care. It is sad that based on 1 picture you decided that I destroyed my tablet. That I had to be the one to do it. You didn't even try to help. The only thing you did try was to get me to spend another $150 on the same piece of junk. I would of probably spent the money if you would of at least looked at what would cause it to come apart. If I would of never sent the picture of the tablet then it would be in the mail today with no problems. Instead I tried to do the right thing and trust in your company's warrenty. I would of prefered to have spoken to a operater and discussed this. I made repeated attemps to call with only answering machine to telling to file though here. I should of listened to the reviews of other dissatisfied customers but instead I was being cheap. Lesson learned. I promise that my review of your product will be posted on every place that will let me. I am copying and pasting everything that was emailed back and forth. My review may not stop everyone from buying your products but it will stop some. I am looking into my states lemon laws. I may or may not find anything to help my case but if I do find something you can bet that I will post it everywhere your product is sold. You have a good day.LePan Support on 6/29/2012 9:58 AMJohn,Again, our sincerest apologies that you are so unsatisfied. We have appealed to our superiors again, and they are adamant that we cannot proceed with a normal warranty replacement.John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 4:09 PMOkay the damage to my tablet is due to faulty equipment. It has never been misused. So how is it not covered by the warrenty? I would like to talk to someone in person so one of your operators can explain to me why you will not honor your warrenty. This is stated on your website.1. WHAT DOES THIS WARRANTY COVER?This warranty covers any defects or malfunctions in your new Le Pan tablet PC or accessories. 2. HOW LONG IS THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE?This warranty is valid for service as follows: one (1) year no charge for parts and labor from the date of purchase.3. WHAT WILL LE PAN DO?LABOR: If the product is determined to be defective within one (1) year of the date of purchase, Le Pan will repair or replace it at no charge.

Le Pan will not repair or replace defective parts unless the work is performed by a La Pan technician. Proof of purchase in the form of a bill of sale, receipt or an invoice must be provided at the time the service is requested in order to receive warranty service.our website.I am not trying to scam, lie or cheat you. All I want is for you to help fix this problem under your warrenty. I can take close up pictures of every inch it. I do not know why the center of it started to come apart. If I or anyone in my house hold broke it by accident or on purpose I would not even try to have this fixed. I am asking for help with your product.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 3:38 PMHello Customer,Unfortunately the kind of damage to your tablet is not covered under our one year limited warranty.This damage that has occurred to the tablet can be fixed for the fee of $150 USD, plus the shipping costs. If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.Thank you John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 2:09 PMOkay in the picture you have please indicate where you see pry marks. In the thousands of cases you handled if someone prys apart the case made of plastice there would be pry marks. The only place on the case that is coming apart is shown in the picture. As I have indicated before there is no damage done to the case. The screen came popped up because of.the buldge at the bottom of the tablet. I am smart enough not to pry open a 4 month old tablet. Heck even my 5 year is smart enough not to do that. please tell me of any other way I could have done this and not show ANY damage.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 1:08 PMJohn,Our apologies that you feel this is unjust. Having issued thousands of units, fielded thousands of support cases, and replaced a number of damaged units, none of the previous cases have ever fallen apart as your tablet has. This decision was not made lightly, and we consulted the highest of possible authorities within the company. Their determination was that your tablet appears to have been mishandled, and someone likely attempted to pry the unit open. We can reach no other conclusion based on the picture that you have sent. Once again, our apologies that this is not covered. We can offer you a replacement for a fee of $150. We do appreciate your business, and apologize for not being able to offer anything further. John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 12:58 PMPlease tell me your definition of accidental damage. My definition is that some type of accident has to occur. The tablet has not been mishandled, dropped, thrown, kicked, or any other kind of action that would damage it. There are no scratches, scrapes, chips, or any other damage marks on yje tablet. No games are played on it. It is kept next to my bed where only my wife uses for reading and Facebook. I will not spend $150.00 to repair this when it should be covered by your warrenty. If you will not stand by your workmanship then the only accident on my part is trusting your products and your company. Please decide if you want to keep me as a valued customer and honor you warranty or that you are happy with taking my money this time and the review I will write on Amazon about this product amd your company.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 10:30 AMHello Customer,unfortunately the kind of damage that you've described is not covered under our one year limited warranty, which does not extend to accidental damage. We offer only a manufacture warranty good for 1 year from the date of purchase (this cannot be extended or enhanced in any way).This damage that has occurred to the tablet can be fixed for the fee of $150 USD, plus the shipping costs. If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.Thank youLePan Support on 6/27/2012 4:18 PMJohn,Because we are unable to determine whether or not this is manufacturing error or user error, we are forwarding your case to the corporate office. They will let us know how to proceed. Our apologies for the delay. John L. Collins on 6/25/2012 6:44 PMHello. Myname is John Collins. I bought the LePan tc970 back on February 8, 2012. Everything was fine (except that it charged very slow) until it started falling apart. There is a bulge at the bottom seam and it will not close back. That caused the screen to start coming up on the bottom left. Now it won't even turn on.Please help with this problem.  _______________________________________________________________________________Please everyone be very careful when buying this tablet or any other  Le Pan product because you will be going through the same problem  I just went  through.

Below is a link someone posted on Amazon for a great case that fits the Le Pan tablets. It's for the CaseCrown Hard Case (Black) for the Apple iPad 2 Wifi / 3G Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB.It got lots of great reviews from the iPad users so I ordered it last week for the Le Pan II I had on order from Amazon but they couldn't deliver my Le Pan before Jan. 31st to Feb. 9th so i canceled there and ordered it from Best Buy... it arrived today and it looks fantastic  I haven't tried it yet because I read the manual for the 970 and it says FULLY charge the battery for at-least 8hrs. before the first use and after thet you can use the tablet while charging but only after the first charge so i called Le Pan support and they say yes its the same rules for the Le Pan II then he e-mailed me the user manual for the Le Pan II because some units shipped before the manual was ready. But the case arrived yesterday and this case is a perfect fit for the Le Pan it doesn't block any ports or controls, you can even connect the charger with it in the case It's a hard case with soft padding inside. What the pictures on amazon do not show is that if you rotate it so that the case top is on your lap you can then adjust it for better typing angles. I saw a YouTube video of a guy testing this case by throwing his iPad on a rock. I don't recommend doing that but it is a very good case that offers great protection for your tablet, much better than those silicone sleeves I see everywhere. The only thing I see wrong is I might need to cut 2 small speaker holes in the inner pad that holds the tablet... but I'll wait to see how it sounds in the case first.I got mine for $3.21 but it looks like when they started getting lots of orders from Le Pan owners they raised their price to $15.21But even at the higher price I still think it's better protection then those folios because it zips closed all the way around.

After 2 days of playing on LePan, as well as sharing it with coworkers, I am packing it up and returning it.  The tablet regularly freezes up and requires \"resetting\".  Really?  This is necessary in 2013? I can't diagnose the cause, other than this product is garbage.In addition to not working, it has a terrible design.  The on/off buttons and the volume buttons have such a minimal profile on the edge, that it is difficult to turn the tablet on/off, and nearly impossible to change the volume.  You have to turn up the lights, turn the tablet on its side, and search for the buttons. The volume control in particular is just plain stupid (invisible buttons are never a good idea in my opinion).

This wasn't going to be for average use, I installed it in my car as a music player, GPS, and on occasion digital gauge display for MPH/fuel economy/engine temp/etc. I have it connected to a generic 2A USB charge that is triggered with the key. I use Tasker to control the system by telling it when to sleep/wake up and when the screen should remain on/off. It is subject to severe hot and cold weather, vibration, and is often left for days (sometimes well over a week) in a sleep state with literally no problems at all. It refuses to die or malfunction in any way whatsoever, even without being reset or turned off for months at a time.The pluses: GPS works great even in bad weather and inside the car. Bluetooth is very stable and connects to my OBDII dongle every time if need be (I have another tablet that handles the gauges 99% of the time, but this serves as a backup). Screen is excellent even in direct sunlight. Even after days on standby the battery never drops below 50%, and quickly charges up even with the screen on full-time and max brightness. Refuses to malfunction or shut-off without my prompting.The negatives: No Android updates from the manufacturer. Limited aftermarket ROMs. No USB hosting (that I'm aware of). The processor is considered dated, and I have run into stuttering audio while trying to run intensive programs in tandem, although I've only had this happen while trying to run Co-Pilot as my navigation. I switched to Sygic and the problem stopped completely. The camera is rough at best, and the built-in speakers are headache inducing at anything but low volume, although these are common problems with any tablet in this price range and of this age.I've used several different tablets in my car (Nook Color running various flavors of CM, MID a81e, Lenovo a2107), and because they've all been on the \"budget\" side of things none of them except for the Le Pan have performed very well.

Decided to give it a try. I am very pleased. It does everything that her Galaxy Tab does. Just as quickly and flawlessly, I might add. Her and I sat side by side and loaded the same videos and programs at exactly the same time.. There was little to no difference in the speed. Other than small very small differences in picture quality, I find this tablet very comparable to the Galaxy Tab 2. The picture quality is excellent and HD. Just when comparing it to the Galaxy Tab, side by side, The Galaxy picture is a little sharper, but I think I only noticed because I had them side by side with the exact same video playing. It loads youtube, netflix, HBO Go and any other video from any other site that I have tried flawlessly without lag. The battery life is great and the tablet speed is great. This tablet is easily comparable to tablets well out of its price range. I know that many of the reviews on here talk of issues upgrading the software.

I cracked my screen, and  contacted lepan via their website on two  occasions, inquiring about the cost of a screen replacement. It has been about a month since I first emailed them, and I have yet to receive a reply.bottom line? this tablet might be cheaper than many others, but apparently the lower price prevents lepan from hiring customer service staff.

This was my 1st tablet. My 17yr old wanted one for Christmas and I thought, 'I am not getting her one without getting myself one'. Like others on here, I researched, read and decided on the one to get. She wanted a 7 inch ( so I purchased another brand for her AGPTek) but I thought I would try this one and see the difference in the 2 and I got me the LePan II.Out of the box, it was nice and it worked. I have 2 jobs and I like having my smartphone or laptop handy to work when necessary. The Lepan II did that... I was comfortable in my purchase. My daughter AGPTek came and it was ok but not as good as my LePan so I got her a Samsung (which is great by the way), bought anohter AGPTek and gave them to my sisters for Christmas.Everything was great until mine (the more expensive of them all) just stopped powering on. I was sick for a few days after Christmas and I just laid in the bed and used no type device to do anything. I didn't purchase a case for the tablet so I kept it in the plastic and in the box ( out of fear). I set up for about 1 week, no use at all. I am getting ready to return to work after the holidays and I wanted to begin checking emails and getting up to date... It would not power on. I thought ' it's dead, put it on the charger'. It sat on the charger for 5 hours, and it never came on. I read the suggestions from LePan on their website and other LePan forums and did all they suggested (hit reset, hit pwr for 30 sec,  reset + pwr, reset+ volume up, reset+ volume dwn, reset+ pwr and volume) nothing worked. I then saw someone that said they returned it to Amazon. So I contacted the seller (marketplace), who even gave me something to do (they said, that is the ICS for you), still nothing. I contacted LePan and I was on hold for over an hour, at work! I sent then an email, filled out the form..I contacted the seler again saying I want a refund.. they told me it was past their 14-15 day policy and that I needed to contact LePan. Well, that policy was not listed, they reference Amazon's policy so Amazon has put in a claim to get me refunded from the seller. The seller and I have gone back and forth as they do not believe that I am telling the truth (first they said, I was past the return point, then they said I probably broke it, then after they received they said it was heavily used and I switched the machine and sent them another one). So on top of this tablet not working, I am being called a crook by the seller.I am still waiting on that refund, but it hasn't been the 5 business days.Nonetheless, I wanted so bad to like this tablet. I loved the size and I love Androids but after less than 10 days of use, the power shouldn't be the issue. Furthermore, there shouldn't be this many people talking about this same issue. The thing just stopped coming on.I am an Amazon shopper. I don't like shopping and I hate large crowds, so sitting at my computer and shopping has been my thing. For the past 2 years, I have gone to the store at most 2 times during the Holidays. This experience, with the machine and especially with the seller had me in tears on Monday. I believe in shopping around and getting the best for the best price but my sanity was challenged with this purchase. It is already fearful purchasing online and especially electronic, but to feel hopeless like I have felt for the past 2 weeks with the seller and this machine will push me away.

I have had NO PROBLEMS with it other than some of my dislikes from my ealier post.Since writing my initial post, my son (3 years old) watched movies which we transfered over from our computer for much of our 10 hour trip to Ireland (waiting in airports and flights) and it still had about 30% battery life with no additional charging needed. I am sure running wifi and bluetooth would significantly reduce this. Looking for a cheap tablet for entertainment and that you don't mind your kids using, this is one way to go.I have found the apps in the android market for word processing are a little clunky and unfortunatley as a teacher in a school that uses Microsoft Word, the interchange is not so smooth all the time. I can work much quicker (editing, creating, inserting tables, diagrams, etc) using my Lenovo ThinkPad and therefore have not actually used the tablet for work.Initial Reivew (First Few Weeks):Picked this up as a Cyber Monday Week deal from Amazon ($150). Purchased this for more of an entertainment tablet, but still to do a little work email/word processing, etc. Price went back up to $250. I would imagine price will keep dropping after December.Pros:- Cost- Netflix, Facebook, and other apps work great- Came with ICS installed- Easy work around to download and install Adobe Flash Player- Solid build for a cheap tablet- Bluetooth and wifi works as good if not better than my iphone 4, no problems so far as others report.- Easy connection to computer through bluetooth direct connect and also through supplied transfer cable.-Not good/Not Bad:- Battery Life (not the same as other tablets, but I adjusted the setting and can get 6 hours or so of heavy use -- wifi, websurfing, bluetooth (keyboard), netflix and email no problem. But for my needs, I can't imagine needing 6 hours of heavy use very often with out being able to plug in and charge.Cons:- No USB port for plugging in keyboard, USB flash drive, etc. (This was big for me, but have quickly gotten use to the fact that I need to use work arounds).- Tablet WON'T charge connected to USB port in computer.- Hard to find case (see below) and the cases I could find were more expensive compared to same brand for ipad.- Costly replacement cable, planning on being very careful of mine.Note: BEWARE of keyboard/case combinations that Amazon links with the LePan. I read many reviews before buying and many of them either do not work or need modifications. I purchased the Kensington Universal Pro Keyfolio (bluetooth) case and keyboard. A little costly but I have been very happy with this addition. Had it set up in minutes and my tablet works great with all ports/buttons open while fitting snug in the tabs. Maybe not as snug as other brands, but I have not had any slippage or felt uncomfortable with it. It is also easy to pop out when you want just the tablet.

I did have to reinstall Skype once because the video did not work first time around.I added a 32 gb sd card (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G60AD6/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) which works out fine for adding movies, music and pictures. The LePan 2 does not allow apps to be loaded on the extra sd card however, or maybe I just have not figured out how to do this yet.I bought the Targus case (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNE1Q/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) which works great, but is a little thick and heavy. I use it around the house, but when traveling I use a very simple neoprene Ipad sleeve I got on Ebay for 4 bucks.As a screen protector I use this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D8GAA0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00. It comes with three protectors that do need some trimming. The protector does apply very easily without bubbles as long as you clean the screen very well with the cleaning cloth that comes with the Lepan. The protector is quite thick but I have not noticed any delays on the touch screen after adding this.All in all I have thoroughly enjoyed the LePan 2 tablet so far to browse the internet, watch movies and TV shows online, stream Netflix, Pandora and play some games I found on the Google Marketplace. If you are in doubt, give it a chance. It's a great tablet for the price.Update July 5, 2012:I just returned from a two and a half week vacation in Germany and France with the Le Pan 2. The LP2 worked on all wifi routers I tried with no problems. I was able to keep up on emails, FB, etc without a problem.

I downloaded Skype and tried video calling my brother's iPod touch via Skype but you can only call them like you would on a cell phone and even then the mic sucks. The camera also isn't very good. The only solution I can think of to getting my LePan tablet to work again is pushing the tiny reset button on the back and restoring it to the original settings but even then I might run into this problem again and I would rather just send it back than dealing with the hassle of resetting it all the time.

For example, after activating from standby and reaching the unlock screen with a pattern, I tried numerous times trying to swipe the correct pattern.  However, for some reason, the touchscreen would never \"maintain\" the line I tried drawing while swiping over the circles.  The line would always \"breakup\" before I could finish the pattern for 4 circles.  It seemed to be skipping from one circle to the next without any continuous connection.  This happened for about 5 minutes, until it finally read my finger swipe correctly and unlocked.  Frustrated, I decided to try a password lock instead of a pattern.  So I put the tablet on standby for a while, reactivated it, and tried putting in my password via the keyboard.  However, whenever I pressed a key, it would read it as double, sometimes even triple (e.g. pressing the 'd' key once, would result in 'dd' or 'ddd' being entered into the password field).  This happened with all the other keys I pressed, and continued for several minutes, until it stopped doing it all of a sudden and was finally able to put in my password.  Frustrated again, I turned off any lock.However, not being able to control the unlock screen with finger swipes wasn't the only issue after returning from standby.  Whenever I tried to use pdfs after returning from a long standby, I could not control scrolling or zooming.  Anytime I tried scrolling, it would zoom in and out.  This would continue for several minutes until it would finally function normally.So it's pretty clear that with my tablet, something happens to the touchscreen functionality after it's been in standby for a while.  I always had to wait several minutes after activating from standby for the touchscreen to work properly.  The touchscreen keyboard must be \"reloading\" during that time, or something.  But yea, this is unacceptable for me.  I tried doing a factory reset as well as downloading the new firmware, but it still kept giving me the same problem.  I really wanted to enjoy this tablet since everything else works decently, but this one major flaw with the touchscreen has led me to return this tablet.I've been anti-Apple for the longest time, but after trying out the ipad 3 and its retina display, I think I may take the plunge and get it.  I had narrowed my tablet choices to only 4:3 format because my main uses are reading pdfs, textbooks, and magazines, and it looks like the ipad is the only other option out there.  Also, that retina display makes pdfs look amazing, especially small font on documents.  I had considered the Coby Kyros Android 4.0 with the 9.7 inch screen, but the negative reviews turned me off to it.It's possible that it was just my Le Pan 2 touchscreen that was defective, so hopefully you future purchasers of this tablet don't run into the same problem.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good as a first tablet PC", "Author": "Lana", "ReviewID": "R21AIYJ33MQ1WR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's quite  a nice device and it became even better after I managed to make it work with bluetooth keyboard :)", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good and Bad", "Author": "Constant Researcher", "ReviewID": "RVCP7WRS9M5DA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched this tablet and suggested \"we\" buy this tablet for my niece's children for Christmas. We all pitched in and made it a nice Santa gift.  She bought two and liked them for a time.  In January, I purchased one myself and like it very much.  The problem is that this item freezes quite regularly and I don't know why, which means constant resetting.  My nephew's tablet had to be returned to LePan for service last month, after 3 months of use. A month later, it is still not back from the manufacturer.  Calling this company is very hard to get through to -- actually almost impossible.  The times that we did get through we were told they were totally backed up.  I'm not sure I like the sounds of that.  We now have a total of 3 of these units in our family and we did purchase the Square Trade warranty, but they only kick in after the LePan warranty expires.  For the money, I still like my unit, but am unhappy with the repair service my nephew received, and since I am the one who  did the research and suggested this, I feel badly about it.  He is a 12-year-old boy who really missed his tablet for a month.  My review would have been higher had I not had this experience with inability to contact the company after needing service shortly after purchase. I think most of us know that customer service can make or break a company no matter how good a product is.  More accessability to this company would have helped my rating immensely.

As noted,  we have 3 in the family and they have all been sent back once and need to go back again at the cost of $15 in postage everytime.

(Gingerbread). By contrast, the stock ROM comes with Android 2.2 (Froyo), which is still acceptable but obviously suboptimal for a tablet that can run something better. A brief Google search will get you started. I was able to switch everything over in about an hour.Second, the battery life for this thing is amazing. I charge it so infrequently that I'm often taken aback by how much power it's not using in between charges. I can't even remember the last time I had to plug it in, though I tend to charge it up anyway just in case the zombie apocalypse happens while I'm at work and I need to locate safe houses on my way to the capitol or something. Anyway, if you're looking for a tablet that can do better than \"maybe 6 hours on a single charge if you're lucky\", this is the way to go.Other pros include surprisingly powerful speakers, good Wi-fi reception even with a low signal, an acceptable screen for the price, and so on. Although I wouldn't say it's designed specifically to be ergonomic, it's still comfortable to hold. Pretend it's a Dualshock for maximum grip comfort.Not much to say when it comes to negatives. Since it's not Honeycomb, actual made-for-tablet-app support is somewhat spotty. About half of my apps notice it's a tablet anyway. The other half just run in regular mode. I've yet to have this be a big issue, but I do wish I could use all the new tablet apps out there.

I've used IPad's and I've used this Le Pan and I can honestly say that I'm struggling to see how anyone can equate paying the premium for an Apple product now.  Yeah, sure there's a few reviewers with defective TC 970's, but do you honestly think you're immune to getting a lemon if you go with an iPad?  The way I see it, you can purchase three of these to everyone iPad and that's a huge price difference.In conclusion, if you're an everyday user, you'll never know what you're missing on an updated operating system-sure tech people could distinguish the nuances (the kindle fire/nook tablet uses a much more restricted OS to put it in prospective.)  And it's CHEAP!

Out of over 100 reviews only 7 at the time were rated 1 or 2 stars so we thought the odds of getting a defective tablet was low. We were wrong. The day we received it we turned it on and was able to look around in for a little bit and before we even got the chance to plug it in and let it charge it froze up. I contacted their tech support who advised to let it charge overnight and even gave us directions on how to reset it or do a system reboot. After a week of constantly rebooting every day we decided to return it. I was sad that it didn't work out for us but even if there were no defects I felt the tablet was just a larger version of my android phone and was too practical in my every day life.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet Ever!!!", "Author": "luvelle911", "ReviewID": "R2UDG1ODCVSIZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PC now for a while now. I wanted to wait until I had a chance to play with it and see how it works before I wrote a review.The Le Pan came with everything as promised. It shipped and arrived fairly quickly via USPS with amazon free shipping. Upon opening the box, I found everything inside that was promised- tablet, charger, and manual. Of course it needed charging and I plugged it in overnight.When I started to use the tablet I found it was pretty similar to my IPhone, but it was Android instead of Apple. It took me little time to get familiar with the tablet because of my past experience. The Google Marketplace was installed and it was easy to browse and install various apps that I wanted.I have been able to upload many of the apps that I use on my phone as well as an \"office\" suite for all my docs I want to have with me. I was able to find an internet browser that supports most of the movie formats and that is a great addition. I have been using the USB plugs to bring many items from my desktop into the pad and the fact that it has memory card slots- micro sd- i am able to change it our with all my other device that i have with me, makes its memory grow. It come with a 2G micro SD but i change it out a 8G card cause all my other device like my camera and my the HTC phone both use the same type of SD card, so this made it fairly easy to upload and switch out files for me. The camera works well and overall, I have had no problems with the unit.I think my experience with the Iphone has helped in knowing how the tablet works and give me a guide line and a better understanding on how the Le Pan Tablet work. It is no different than when you go from Windows to Windows 7- it takes a little time to get used to something new.This is one slick little gadget that I am finding it very useful- at $200-300 less than an i-Pad and with more standard features- it is a great buy!", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Display is not bright enough", "Author": "seulater", "ReviewID": "R6D8HYJBNBTR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this tablet.Though it is fast and works well i have no troubles using it at all.I have owned over 10 tables over the last 3 years, so i have much to compare against.I liked everything about it, but the golden test for me is how well videos play.I was very disappointed that in playing videos the screen brightness is just not there.

I know it's common to see a bit of light leakage but my tablet had significant light leaking from 3 sides.  I obviously never noticed it before since I could hardly do anything without a stable wifi connection but last night i tried watching a movie and it is very distracting especially on a black background.to make things worse there is a 15% restocking fee at online retailer i bought the tablet from.  now i'm stuck on whether to send the tablet in to Le Pan under warranty and likely wait forever to get it back or just get rid of it and deal with the 15% fee. :::::::::::::::::UPDATEFirst of all I really wanted to keep the Le Pan II based on the features you get at a great price.  Like others, I also work in IT and have tested the tablet on numerous Wifi networks and settings.  My main problem is the slow and inconsistent data speeds.  The wifi connection is strong and will stay connected but the data speeds are terrible.  So you can imagine anything from web browsing, youtube, facebook, or anything that requires data is painfully slow.For testing purposes I was lucky enough to have two (2) Le Pan II tablets on hand.  I also tested and compared the Le Pan's with a Nook Color (rooted), Ipad and a HP Touchpad (Rooted, running android).  I basically ran simple speed tests and comparisons on Web Browsing, Streaming Videos, etc.  Unfortunately the Le Pan's almost always came in last.  It would either hang, buffer or keep you waiting and waiting.  Even the Nook Color had a better browsing experience (speed wise).Don't get me wrong, the Le Pan II has alot going for itself especially considering the features at an awesome price.  But what's the point of owning a tablet if you can't get anything done online?As a side note, I've also tried dealing with Le Pan's customer support.  I tried calling numerous times and could never get a \"live\" person.  I tried e-mailing both the customer service and and support e-mails found on their website to no avail.  I've also opened \"tickets\" via their website and am yet to receive a response or reply.I'm pretty sure a simple firmware update can fix the WiFi issues but since customer support is almost non-existant, who knows when?", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "St. Mark Lion Rock", "ReviewID": "RP7LZNL2C4RRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great hardware and performance.

I had an Acer Iconia that I wound up giving to my father in law.  I purchased a Nook Tablet and returned it after a week.  This?  It's actually replaced the numerous laptops and Kindles around the domicile as my primary information consumption device.  It's not perfect.  Sometimes Flash buffering is quirky, and there are a number of apps that just plain don't work, usually obscure games I don't care about.  I really miss having Swype, which is apparently incompatible due to the screen form factor.  I think in the end, why I like it so much is because of the form factor.  9.7 inches is just right for holding in one hand while having easy readability and UI spacing, and it's all without Apple's suffocating user experience.  The biggest advantage over the 7\" form factor?  PDFs.  I go to a lot of conferences with materials in PDF format, and seven inches is not going to cut it.  I move documents and e-books into my Dropbox on any PC and it opens with zero fuss seconds later.  Try that with iOS.

Save a digital tree - ABSOLUTELY NO MANUAL -PRINTED, NOR PDF, NOR by website. 1. Lose ability to use Google Chrome for Android - restricted by Gmail / Google from using their full features.  (highly recommend Firefox *and* Opera browsers) 2. Have no option to ever upgrade - see manufacturer's email below saying they plan to replace/obsolete this item 3. Experience \"phone errors\" - giving strong indication the Operating System is cloned from a phone 4. If a student of Japanese or other Asian languages, will have have difficulty installing alternate keyboard.  You can change the entire keyboard easily, but to switch to second entry method, more difficult than any competitor I've seen. (Certainly LePan's OEM, having a Chinese website and Japanese name, should be experts at this.) 5A. Gain a reliable email collection / response tool for public WiFi hotspots like Panera, Starbucks, Peet's, Whole Foods, and McDonald's - It is SO VERY PLEASANT to be able to type on a full keyboard instead of the tiny iphone keyboard 5B. Become a WiFi troubleshooting expert: this reviewer could ONLY connect with WEP key - the oldest, and simplest WiFi security / encryption method. It would recognize the more robust AES and TKIP methods but alternately connect/disconnect every 10-15 seconds.

The tablet is running Android 2.2 \"Froyo\" that is the best it will ever do... period.2. Nothing is optimized for a tablet. It thinks it is a large phone with no service. apps are streched out or run in a small window...3. The volume down button broke about 9 months into owning it. (there is a volume slider in the settings so that isn't much of a hassle, however you have to use the volume buttons if you ever need to do a factory reset or upgrading firmware... I cannot do that anymore because i cant press \"down\" to select factory reset.4. For some reason after an extended time, the date/time goes out of sync and web pages and youtube and netflix stop working for \"security certificate validation\".

I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.

I really don't know how I got it to sync, but I went into the gallery and saw that my picasa albums were synced.

After that it was much better, but the Wifi still didnt work right and there were a number of other bugs.  Le Pan released a firmware fix for these problems.  The firmware fix was poorly identified and it was unclear whether or not it was for this tablet. It turns out that it was for the Le Pan II as well as the Le Pan S, but I was unable to update my tablet because the recovery was broken.I tried to call Le Pan support, but was cut off mid call twice and after that there was no answer.  I opened a trouble ticket from the Le Pan support website and recieved an immediate response stating that they would replace my tablet and asking for my address.  I responded with my address and then heard nothing.  I tried to go back to the Le Pan support site, but the link to it no longer worked.  Le Pan support was simply gone.After two weeks of this crap, I contacted Amazon and told them that Le Pan was not supporting the warranty on my tablet. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return of the tablet even though it was well outside the Le Pan return policy. Amazon applies a restocking fee to all returned items after the thirty day window.  I only needed to contact Amazon and remind them that the item was defective and the restocking fee was also refunded.What have I learned from all this? Never buy a Le Pan product.  Since all this I discovered that there are a number of inexpensive Chinese tablets that being made in the same manufacturing facilities as the well known brands. Many of these brands are well known Chinese brands that have an excellent reputation. I have preordered an Ainol-Novo Captain for $220. It should be shipped in March. The specifications blow away most of the tablets available in the US.  Outside of a few tech weenies, people seem very happy with these less expensive Chinese tablets, and many are buying them for kids to do their homework.

Helgeson", "ReviewID": "RP8MWZKFKWTD5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Late 2012 UPDATE:  Looks like the new price isn't coming down anytime soon.  Dropping from four stars to three, because once you get near the $200 price point, there are probably better options...-----Ok, so a couple of weeks back I picked one of these up for a buck thirty, right here.  A few days later, it listed for a buck fifty!  And now, a buck eighty?!  I mean, yeah, the tablet's actually pretty good (for a second-tier FroYo unit), but with its current price volatility, you might want to consider either other models or other vendors.As for specs, this one is a PDF reader's dream.  Well, ok, a 15\" borderless unit would be perfect, but realistically, this is quite a solid runner-up, and a bargain (at least at its former price).  Yeah, it'll play video games, but remember, it runs FroYo (Android 2.2), so the OS is old, and I have no inclination to try upgrading it.  Frankly, I don't even see a need to root it.  If you just consider it a giant Kindle with the Google Play store installed, you'll be pleased as punch with it.  With the current incarnation of Adobe's PDF reader app, if you set the page-view to \"Continuous,\" there's no need to reflow anything.Other than the occasional freeze or lockup, which frankly happens to all 2nd-tier units at some time or another, the only real issue I've encountered (and I think this may be the issue in some of the negative reviews here) is that you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO charge the battery fully before using it.  It comes a bit precharged, and the battery life is great (which probably explains the heaviness), but if you let the power run all the way down, the thing won't power up enough to even start a proper recharge cycle for like an hour.  It's a PITA, but the fix is easy--just don't ever let the battery level drop below ~15%.  And speaking of charging, it takes quite a while, and the socket's proprietary, but rumor has it you can use a standard 15-pin iPod charging cable, if you shave off a bit of plastic from the sides.  I've never tried, but honestly, LePan sells replacement cords for so cheap, why bother?Other things:  Remember, it's running FroYo, so NO EQUALIZER.  (Sux if you're an audiophile.)  Also, it'll fit an iPad case just fine, but the I/O holes and button spaces won't line up, so be prepared to use a scissors on the case if you go this way.So in a nutshell, for a buck-thirty, LePan's TC-970 is a great PDF reader.  At its buck-eighty inflated price, though, you might as well check out some 1st-tier tabs that run 4.0+ (Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, etc.).", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute but slow", "Author": "Lus", "ReviewID": "R28W2OMQ7TW8Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like everything about it.

Unfortunately,  I had to return the Tablet.  Here is why:  The LePan  2 Tablet, would work fine at my workplace but fail to perform at home.  While at work, I could download all kinds of videos from various sources like ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC.  At home,  the videos would not download for more than 2 or 3 minutes before stopping.  I even called AT&T; and had my internet speed upend to 6 mbps.  But alas, it did not work.  However, it would play YOUTUBE and NETFLIX just fine.  I have 3 laptops at home feeding from the same old router and they all work fine even with a lower mbps.  But the LePan 2 was being very selective at home on which videos would allow me to play.  Strange, because at work it really worked fine.  I was told that at work the Tablet works fine because we are super wired here at my workplace while at home, the LePan 2 Tablet might have some kind of bug in the Honeycomb system that makes it act like that.  Well,  for the price of this limited experience  I can buy  a laptop that will allow me to vision and play just about anything I throw at it.  Too bad, because the Tablet was kind of nice.  If you are happy just to use it as a great E-Reader, or casual video watching on YOUTUBE or NETFLIX, go for it.  It is great.  But if you are like me and want to enjoy the whole spectrum of videos available on the media system out there, then I would think twice before making the purchase.  I hope this has helped you to make up your mind about this very nice but limited Android Tablet.  LAST UPDATE AUG.15, 2012.  I have returned the LePan II Tablet and Purchased the Lepan older model TC970.  It is now on sale for $130 LESS than the Lepan II and works just as good as the most expensive version.  One thing I cannot do with the older model vs the LePan II, is that the older Lepan does not play the Smithsonian Channel .......Other than that, it is not worth the extra $130.

Maybe I am too naive about the technology, but though I knew about talking iPhones, I never suspected that I would be able to voice-Google with my new device.To avoid smudges as much as possible, I usually use one of those tablet \"pens,\" and the Le Pan doesn't always get my first press.

Also, after checking the \"allow plugins\" option in FireFox Beta, I no longer have Flash problems either.  Changing the rating to 5*s now.  Hopefully, Le Pan gets more recognition so that there are more accessories out there altho LePanTab.com's store has gotten better.For the price, this tablet cannot be beat.  There are a lot of cheaper tablets out there but this has solid build quality (love the metal accents), sharp responsive screen (not sure if it is Gorilla Glass I have read that it is & some say it isn't), long battery life (over 8 hours) & has all the little extras built in like GPS.It comes with 1 30 pin cord & so far you can only order another thru the company itself.  Altho if you shave down the plastic parts on an Apple cord, it works.The downside of the tablet is that it takes a long time to charge (altho the long battery life negates that).  The buttons are rather small & hard to press on the curved surface but that is to be expected when you want this thing to be thin & light.  The speakers are on the back which can be muffled if laying down or in a case.  It has rebooted itself on me occasionally but the boot time is fairly quick so not that annoying (yet).Flash works just fine when I use the YouTube app but if a video is embedded in a website, it does not work - tried in both the default browser & FireFox.The biggest complaint is the wifi does not always work - altho I suspect it has more to do with the hotspot than the tablet itself (or at least the compatibility of the 2).  In most places, it connects immediately with no problems but when I am at work/school it will not pick up a signal or it will take hours before it does (altho my phone & laptop find it).  If it did this everywhere I would claim it defective but it is only in the same wifi areas so who knows ...This is my 1st Android product so not much to say there but I so far prefer Symbian as it communicates more with you - like letting you see what apps are running & stopping them w/out having to download an app.  Speaking of apps, there are soooo many in the Play Market that it can be overwhelming to pick which one to use.Got the Targus Truss case for the HP TouchPad which fits this perfectly.  Hopefully this brand will become more popular and we will start to see dedicated accessories that fit it without adding bulk/size.In sum, if you are looking for the cheapest tablet that is decent, reliable & all the bells & whistles, this is the one for you.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "jae6704", "ReviewID": "R30S39ZML8L5KD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these for Easter gifts.

Two of them actually, one for each of the kids (10 years old and 13 years old). They had been begging me for a tablet, and I absolutely WOULD NOT pay over $200 for a tablet for a child. So, of course the iPad was out of the question ;-) I had done a TON of research on tablets at or below the $200 price point. I knew that for my tech saavy kids who both have android smart phones and love them, they would need to have something that at least had the \"feel\" of an iPad with things like great graphics, ability to play tons of games and of course the capacitive touch screen (NOT the resistive). For those of you who have no clue what those things mean (like me when I first started looking at tablets), basically the resistive version requires a harder \"push\" on the screen to register what the user wants to do and can be used with gloved fingers, stylus' etc. The capacitive ones are the \"cool\" ones according to my kids, that register the users intended action with a slight touch giving you the nice \"flow\" when flipping screens, easy launch of apps etc. Really, capacitive vs. resistive is a personal choice. I've used both and have no issues with either one, although I too prefer the capacitive version.So, after days and days of research, I learned that most of the tablets out there below my afore mentioned price quote had resistive screens instead of capacitive, low memory and had no SD card slot, and did not play well with apps, videos etc. Since the kids use their tablets mostly for game playing and/or video watching while on road trips, those were pretty high up on my list of important functionality.As other reviewers have mentioned, I too was wary about an new company that I never heard of. After reading all of the pros and cons, I decided that for the price, this tablet would give me the most bang for my buck. Now, almost three months later, I'm EXTREMELY pleased with my decision.First off, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the look and feel of these tablets. My mother-in-law has an iPad and she let me play with it over Christmas time, and I actually prefer the Le Pan to the iPad in terms of the overall look and feel. It's sleek, light weight and has a beautiful screen. It feels like a quality product right out of the box. I think my husband was surprised at the overall appearance and quality feel of the tablets. I'm not sure what he was expecting, but he was impressed like I was.Understanding that the Android OS 2.2 version that comes on this tablet is NOT designed specifically for tablet use, overall, their tablets have run just fine. They have had to reset their tablets several times (one of them more than the other), and the younger one seems to be having trouble with lots of apps being forced closed lately. I suspect that rather than a tablet/manufacturing issue, she's downloaded some apps that are not compatible with the OS running on the tablet. We've recently uninstalled, then reistalled several of her apps, and it's now running just fine. I keep asking my hubby to root it like he did with their phones, but he just hasn't had the time yet. I also suspect that after he does that, we will see even more improvement with the tablets functionality, even though doing so would void the warranty. Again, they were fairly cheap for tablets, and they are for young kids. If they crash on them, then they can start saving to buy the tablets they want when they get jobs :-) The only reason that this review is not 4 stars is because of the need to reset and the recent force close issues. Again, I don't think they are the tablet or companies fault, but I just can't rate it 5 stars without being 100% what the cause is. Overall, most apps play well, amazon video plays just fine, as does YouTube. I have not tried Netflix or Hulu, and probably won't since we don't use either of those programs. Also, I added some music files to their tablets and it plays those just fine as well. They love being able to play music from their tablets when they have friends over. Often they will take the tablets downstairs, turn on the music and have their own little dance party! They are kids, so they are fine with the sound. In my opinion, it could be better, however, I was actually pleasantly surprised with it since I had been expecting MUCH worse based on reviews. On sound only, I'd give it a 31/2 out of 5 stars.Actually, I think my husband was a bit jealous since the tablet he has and paid $1000 for doesn't have the capacitive screens like the kids do LOL. He was skeptical of my choice when I originally purchased the tablets (he is the \"techy\" one in the family) and really wanted me to get them from a known company. Since then, he's conceded that I made the right choice. To be fair, however, we have not had to contact Le Pan directly, so can't speak to their support response times or capabilities.I'm in the market for a tablet myself now, and am trying to decide whether to get the Le Pan II, or wait for the Le Pan III to come out.

The body feels sturdy, the grip feels comfortable and the software HUMS on the 1.2 Ghz processor. The upgrade to the RAM is a huge benefit, Android 3.2 is animation intensive, so any 'extra' RAM is 'good' RAM.Pros:  Handles Honeycomb 3.2 very well, no lags, no delays  Auto orients to any alignment. The Evo 4G has only 2 alignments(not the end of the world, but useful when operating the tablet whilst charging)  Larger buttons, making the touch-unfriendly Honeycomb 3.2 slightly easier to work with  Better microphone and camera for video call  Gorgeous Display, like the flagship Le Pan  Impressive Battery life. The HTC is 7 inches and guzzles battery life. This one sips for hours.Fixable Cons:  WiFi - Keeps dropping. ***THIS IS A HONEYCOMB 3.2 ISSUE***. I faced the same issue on the HTC, changing from DHCP to Static fixed the problem  Unnecessary widgets running. You can disable these from the settings menu  Skype flickers when beginning a call. Doesnt happen on the HTC. Le Pan needs to fix this, before it becomes an issue.Cons:  Weight is still good enf to make your wrist hurt if u hold too long.  Touch sensitivity needs to be adjustable  Speakers need more juice, video chatting shouldnt always need a pair of headphones  Hard drive space is not 8GB-with-a-pinch-o-salt. More like 6.5GB-with-a-pinch-o-salt. Pretty big 'pinch-o-salt' IMHO.  Insufficient support and extended development timeline for next upgrade. Deal-breaker for those not keen on 'self-helping'I still believe its worth the $280 I spent. Infact, better! My mom is a power-user, the tablet will be put to a test, and from the look of it, its prepared.

I only find one bad thing that being the tiny on/off button. However,I am now getting used to that. I tried two other tablets in the same price range. I tryed Kindle Fire and the HP Touch Pad. I brought The Le Pan TC 970 because it was the most functional for me. I like to watch movies. With the Kindle Fire I liked eveything about it but I could not get on the internet with it. And the HP Touch Pad was like a mini computer that could not run the apps. I love my Le Pan. But, I have one more gripe about it, It is that The Lepan Company does not make a case/stand for this tablet. I have been looking for a case that would fit my LePan 9.7 inch display. Since Le Pan does not make a case for their tablet. I have researched reviews on the Le Pan and found three cases that were mentioned that would work with the Le Pan 9.7\". I brought and tryed them (Targus Truss,Acase HP Touch Pad HQ and Hp Touch Pad Custom Fit). I found that neither of these three cases worked well. They fitted sloppy and did not secure the Le Pan Touch Pad. I purchased a black leather carying case (sold buy eforcity)that fits a 9.7 display.  I had to make simple adjustments with a mat knife. But, I now have the best case on the market at this time for the Le Pan. I returned the three other cases. If you are looking for a case try this one.

Anyways, I went to turn on my tablet yesterday, and it didn't respond. I figured it was just dead because I do use it a lot, so I put it on the charger. Today, I tried to turn it on, absolutely no response. Tried to reset it: nothing. I am very disappointed in this tablet. I liked it, but there is no excuse for it not working already. I have not dropped it, and always keep it in it's case. Sending it in asap. Hopefully it'll be resolved soon.I got this tablet about a month ago and so far, I love it. There are a few minor issues with it, though.1. The tablet runs on the Adroid 2.2 OS, and from doing some research, I have learned it will not be able to be updated to the 2.3. Minor issue, but one worth noting.2. I've noticed that sometimes, I have to tap an app a few times or harder than normal to get it to open. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel the sensitivity should be a little better.3. It's pretty hard to get cases for this tablet because it is an \"off brand.\" I bought a leather case for it thinking it would work, and although it was the correct size, I could not get to the home buttons when the tablet was in the case.4. The camera is only on the front. Which is great to use it as a webcam, but not so great if you want to take pictures of something other than yourself.Other than that, the tablet is great. Easy to use. It seems very well made to me, and worth the money.Works as well as more expensive tablets.

The lack of ports is the only reason I didn't get one of these for myself. There's no USB or microUSB port. There are not many accessories for it.

As far as HDMI output, I am not sure how that is accomplished. The supplied cable is the same as the I. There are no instructions in the quick start guide regarding that and no connectors available on the Le Pan site. They say it will do it but I can't confirm that right now.

My new favorite thing is that i can wifi print using  Google cloud print. Download google cloud print to your pc and download the cloud print app from the market its free. Your printer doesnt need to be cloud print ready but it does need to be wifi.The user manual is installed jus press the help icon. Also charge the battery completely at fitst use.I'm still working on video chat.  I can hear and see the other person they can hear me but they cant see me and i cant see myself.As far as freezing it will at times especially if you are pressing buttons like crazy you got to give it time to complete the one function before you ask it to do another and some large apps you may install might have an effect on it freezing as well.I think its a great tablet everyone i show it too is now purchasing one. You do need a screen protector and a good case.I have a folio case for 10.1 size tablets by Caselogic and it works great and i can access the function buttons.

I pulled out the small cover to get to the SD card and couldn't get the cover seated back as securely as I'd like. In addition, be careful that that you actually turn the tablet off when you're done by pressing the On/Off button and it asks you if you want to power off. It seems that it will go into standby mode (you can set the timeout for this) but it looks as if it has turned off.  You have to push the On/Off button to get back in. I drained the battery by not doing this. (At least that's what I think happened.) I also don't know how to block websites that I don't want my children going to. I'm hoping there's a way to do this.If you noticed in the section above about other items to purchase, there is a USB keyboard for around $25.  Do Not Buy It!  I ordered it and when it came I noticed that it had a USB-A plug and the Le Pan has a 30-Pin port. (I did hook the keyboard up to my desktop and it didn't work well. See my review for it.) I thought that I might be able to use an adapter or converter to get around this, but I emailed Le Pan just to make sure.  I was extremely impressed that they replied in only 2-hours and politely.  Here is the reply:Unfortunately, external USB devices are not compatible with the TC970. If you wish to connect external devices, they must be bluetooth ready.

Unfortunately, after three months of use, my third Le Pan TC 970 tablet died.  Amazon replaced this tablet for me twice and I had hoped that after three months of great use from this third tablet, I finally had a tablet that was problem free (NOT SO MUCH!).  Unfortunately, a few months seems to be the life span of these tablets, based on some other reviews I've read and my own.  Feel free to read my comments below, but as my final review, save your money and by a tablet from a more reliable manufacturer.  And by the way, when I finally reached Le Pan, instead of honoring the one year warranty on the TC 970, they wanted me to send them $80 for the Le Pan II.  Obviously, my answer was no.UPDATE:  3/23/13.  It is now 3/23/13 and so far, so good.  My 3rd Le Pan tablet is working great (so far), no issues whatsoever.  Please note that it is now 2 1/2 months since I contacted Le Pan regarding tablet #2 and they still have not responded.  Thank heavens Amazon stepped up to the plate.  It is also now well after the Amazon 30-day return period so any issues will have to be addressed by Le Pan, but based on their lack of response, and though my current 3rd tablet is working great, I will have to leave my rating as a 1.  I will always be a very happy Amazon customer and I keep coming back.  Wish I could say that about Le Pan.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:I purchased this tablet based on the hundreds of positive Amazon reviews and also some very good reviews on Youtube.  The price was great and I also wanted the larger size (9.7\") instead of a 7\".  Well, I received my Le Pan TC 970 tablet on 12/24, it worked great until it died on 12/28.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement the very next day 12/29 (of course, I returned the 1st tablet to Amazon).  Well, I've had ongoing problems with the second Le Pan TC 970 tablet.  More than 50% of the time, I would press an app (any app) up to 5 or 6 times before it would finally work.  Not just one or two apps, but pretty much any app.  I also had problems with the android keyboard.  Whenever I had to type, I would also have to hit a key anywhere from 5 to 8 times before it responded and instead of a particular letter or number I wanted, an option list of that same letter or number would open with accents over the letter or fractions instead of a number.  Press the X key to close the option list, then a letter or number, and the same thing would happen, over and over and over again.  Instead of my contacting Amazon, on 1/7/13, I called Le Pan and though the voice message said it would be a 7 or 8 minute wait for a live support person, I waited for over an hour and no support person ever answered.  So, I sent an email the same date to tech support informing them of the problems and the 60+ minutes wait on hold with no response.  4 days later (1/11/13), Le Pan finally responded saying they would send me an RMA # (no apology for the 60+ minute wait on hold and no name of the person who responded to my email) to replace my defective tablet.  As of today, 1/16/13 (9 days after I first contacted Le Pan), I have not had either a phone or email response from Le Pan with the RMA #.  So, I called again, the voice message said it would be an 11 minute wait for a live person, and 60+ minutes later, I was still on hold then hung up.Please note that my complaint is not with Amazon at all as Amazon has been wonderful.  With no response from Le Pan tech support with the RMA # and no one answering at their customer service/tech support line, I called Amazon, explained the situation and the lack of response from Le Pan, and Amazon, not Le Pan gave me the option of a refund or sending me a 3rd tablet.  Amazon is the greatest, but I wish Le Pan had responded as it is their responsibility to handle this matter, especially since my tablet has a one-year warranty.  Because of so many positive responses, I'm willing to give a 3rd tablet a try and have returned the 2nd Le Pan tablet.  I will have the 3rd Le Pan tablet on 1/18/13 (THANK YOU AMAZON, NOT LE PAN!), but when I finally do hear from LePan, I will let them know about their lousy customer service that sucks big time!", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "same bad review", "Author": "WI Bassman", "ReviewID": "R2AEE511N9LFUV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen and battery stopped working after only two days.

I expected a lot of problems because of the price, but I have not had any real problems. The Wifi problems were fixed with the update, and beside a couple of times I had to restart it, it has been awesome. The tablet is extremely fast for a tablet thanks to the top of the line specs. The ability to use an SD card is very much under rated. You can add 32gb to the tablet without having to pay hundreds more. Here are a few things I have noticed about the Le Pan II Tablet:PROS:1.) Amazingly Fast. Almost Instant responses on everything I do. The Processor is one of the fastest you will find for any price.2.) SD Card Slot= Alows you to expand the memory by 32gb without having to pay hundreds more like on iPads. You also can interchange cards with movies and TV shows without worrying about filling up your hard drive.3.) PRICE= The best price I have seen for a tablets with this size screen and processor.4.) Screen = Same size as iPad. cant find a tablet this new with same screen size for the price. You can watch movies at angle. I cant tell any difference between watching a movie starring right at the center of the screen vs watching it with my eyes looking right at the side. On my laptop I am constantly trying to adjust the screen position to get a clearer image. Images are extremely bright and clear. HD looking resolution for movies. Love the Color.5.) Dont have to mess with iTunes6.) BATTERY LIFE= I was amazed with the battery life i got with this tablet. I watched more than 7 hours of netflix without having to dim my screen or recharge. Recharging seems to take a long time though.CONS:1.) App Store= tons of apps but just not the number of apps that you can find on ipad but more than you can find on a kindle fire. It still has all the major aps you can find on apple store like netflix, pandora, kindle app, AutoCAD, Facebook, Twitter, and many many more. TONS of games for kids though.2.) Speakers = Speakers dont seem to be that loud even with the sound on max. I normally use ear phones anyways so that has never been a problem with me.OVERALLYou cant beat the price for the quality you are getting. The tablet upgrates to Android Ice Cream Sandwich. It is hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper than ipad and matches it on ever spec and more. It is just a little over the price of kindle fire but with a much larger screen. It is cheap in price but definitely not cheap in quality.

First off, I have an HTC Evo cellphone that runs Android 2.2.  And this Le Pan runs Android 2.2.  So right out of the gate I was pretty familiar with how to run this Tablet.  But, Android 2.2 is not really designed for use in tablets (there is a newer version of Android designed for use by tables).  So for Android 2.2, not all Apps work well on the table; examples:  Words With Friends is not usable on my tablet and I haven't figured out how to adjust it (the bottom few rows are cutoff on the tablet screen), my son reports some of his app games don't work on the tablet, but luckily for my son all the Angry Bird / Angry Frog / Angry Dad games work great on this Le Pan tablet.In terms of the brand I have never heard of Le Pan.  I even googled their name and there is almost no info out there.  Documentation that comes with the tablet is very sparse as is info on the web.  Maybe the info will increase over time.  This type of info is somewhat important for me because I'd like to know if this tablet will be upgradable to the newer version of Android software designed for tablets.  Also this would help me try to make tweaks/fixes to such things as Words With Friends screen size. +My pros:  Does seem to have good build quality (feels solid), Android Market appears as a standard icon and has been easy for me to download apps, screen display is nice, was easy to get up and running and synch to my home wireless, battery life seems decent, takes micro sd memory card so you can add bigger size. -My cons:  Power Button is very tiny and pain in the butt to turn on and off, sometimes the screen will turn back on for no reason, the 4 Android buttons are backlit but only for a few seconds - so if I'm using this thing in a dimily lit room I can't see where the buttons are and I can't figure out how to adjust the backlight timing (I googled around alot trying to figure this out but no luck), the charging cable is kind of a strange size (would prefer standard usb cellphone charging cable), relatively anonymous company so not sure about future support and info (eg; can I upgrade to newer android software, etc).Now compared to iPad, my friends iPad seems much slicker.  His iPad is faster, screen seems brighter, and everything seems integrated together more.  But then again part of this is just the nature of Apple's closed ecosystem vs Androids open ecosystem.Overall, I give this 3.51 stars (rounds up to 4).  It is a usable tablet, and better to use around the house for me than my Android 2.2 cellphone because the screen is bigger.  But, I deducted 1.49 stars for the cons I mentioned above as well as the fact that at $350 this is a bit pricey in consideration of the cons I listed and other Android options that are out there.

That is what I've been saying to my Apple Fanboy friends since the iPad came out.  Honestly, if it weren't for the Vine program, I would not have gotten a tablet.My first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.The instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.Cons:* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.Pros:* The display is very nice and a good size.* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.Some other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.I installed the \"Hackers Keyboard\" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.I played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.You might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.Update 5-30-11As of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.Update 7-24-12Now that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.

There are numerous issues that are really frustrating for everyday use.Wi-Fi:It connects to Wi-Fi very well but for some reason the highest speed you'll ever get is 1mb/s while my phone (also Android) seem to have no such restriction. This is quite frustrating as streaming movies suddenly can be troublesome and downloading large files (such as games) can be a big big issue. Another issue I've recognized is that it feels like this device always gets the lowest priority when it comes to connecting to routers. What I mean by this is that even though I connect both my laptop and the tablet to my school's network, there are times when the tablet just gets absolutely turtle-speed (imagine 1 minute wait time just to open a webpage) while my laptop works slower than usual but not annoyingly so (10 seconds to open a webpage).UPDATE:According to a comment of this review, newer Le Pan II tablets do not have this issue. Also, an update was released around 2 weeks after this review came up that fixed the Wi-Fi issue. You can update through lepantab.com's website.Freezes/Shutdowns:Occasionally, the tablet just shuts off or freezes (the first happens more often). It happens most often when there's a lot of stuff going on as if there's no safety net for how many applications can remain open. That said, sometimes it just shuts off without reason too. I really have not figured out why it happens.Not Stable:While this kind of goes into freezes/shutdowns issue there are also times when there are slowdowns and the tablet runs slower than usual. It is definitively not as reliable as other tablets out there.Support:Le Pan (the company) has a history of promising updates and not follow through with the updates. When I say history, I'm being a little bit unfair as it only happened once (with TC970) where a Gingerbread update was promised but then later said \"was not possible\". I bought Le Pan II without knowing this information and was quite excited for a Ice Cream Sandwich update but there has been no words about this update at all ever since it launched. History repeats?UPDATE: An firmware upgrade that fixed WiFi issues were released (although it was 4 months after release). Also, ICS upgrade has supposedly been spotted and supposed to be released at the end of May but this is NOT official (i.e. this information did not come directly from LePan)Minor issues:The following things I knew before hand so I consider it my fault for not knowing the severity of the faults so I thought I mention them just in case. Ok, the glare on the screen is BAD! It's almost unusable outdoors on a sunny day. The screen h/w ratio, size and resolution is not common and thus there are some applications that acts a bit weird (though most works fine). Front camera feels kinda muddy, it's not crystal clear despite a decent resolution. Oh and no rear camera, I didn't think it would matter but I found an application that would allow me to take a picture and write notes as well, which would've been very useful to me as a student.Last words:Despite all my issues, I think it's a decent tablet. It works generally okay and most apps are compatible. Watching movies and reading books is great (except for outdoors as noted above). If the tablet is compared to the terrible tablets, it comes out on top. If compared to the good tablets, it comes out at the bottom. I regret my purchase but not enough to sell the tablet and buy a new one. However, if I were you I would definitely look elsewhere. I personally would look at the Acer or Asus tablets, they should be very close to Le Pan II's price now and has marginally better specs (like larger internal storage and possibly rear camera).", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Tablet doesn't work", "Author": "An", "ReviewID": "R1Q9927PKFIY1X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Tablet doesn't work, the internet never work, is on and off all the time, it a lot of problems.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gave it a second chance", "Author": "Bhee \"Bhee\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q9LNOYIA86IU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "** Original Review **This tablet is pretty easy to use and I love the size of the screen.

I ended up sending it back.  I looked for another tablet to buy, but nothing was as good as this one is.

She has an aging laptop that she used for surfing the web so this is a nice, inexpensive replacement that lets her surf the web, play games and read books, at a fraction of the cost of an iPad or other high end tablet. I have been able to compare the Le Pan with an iPad 2 that I borrowed from work. I have used the iPad for a while now, and the Le Pan has several advantages:-Price. Can't say more.-You can load flash websites. It seems with the iPad I have to open up a lot of websites on the computer (online banking, etc never seem to work right)-More free/cheaper apps. By comparison, apps for iPad tend to be more expensive/fewer free apps available (and the free ones are full of ads)-Has built-in GPS (haven't used it much)The Le Pan 970 has some disadvantages:-It does freeze, it seems everyone has a different experience. This one locks up every few hours, especially if using one program (e.g., reading a book or playing a game) continuously. As others have pointed out, I upgraded the firmware right when I got it but the Le Pan still freezes. She keeps a paper clip handy all the time to reset it. Or, you have to remember to close out of the app you are using periodically, although that is not a guarantee.-It is not quite as fast as the iPad. Loading websites, zooming in, etc. takes a second or two longer. Maybe the iPad is faster because it ignores the flash content in many websites.-The camera is backwards. I use Skype with the iPad and it works beautifully, seems with the Le Pan a lot of people report issues.-It runs the somewhat dated version of Android that according to others, was meant for smartphones. So, a lot of websites open up in the mobile version, which can be annoying.All in all, a good tablet if you're on the fence and if you are like me and don't want to spend a lot on a tablet--especially considering that for the price of an iPad you can buy quite nice laptop that lets you do a lot more and get work done. But this is a great tablet to check email/facebook/news while eating breakfast, read a book on a boring day at work or play angry birds. But, only 3 stars because of the fairly frequent (about once daily) freezes.UPDATE August 2012: The freezing got so bad (she had to have a paper clip in hand all the time), she had to send it in to LePan. The customer service is terrible, it took about 6 weeks to get it replaced. 3 Months later, the replaced tablet freezes less often, but still locks up unexpectedly and behaves erratically once/twice a week (apps won't load, websites freeze up) even after rebooting. So, once a month she has to do a factory reset and reinstall everything.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Le Pan TC 970", "Author": "craig", "ReviewID": "R3O19ZGEC9QU0L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not to happy with this, i am sending it back.

You see, the thing does not seem to do anything I am interested in doing, or conversely, it does only those things I am not interested in doing. While it easily set up a Gmail account, which I did not really want, it is unable to set up a Yahoo Mail account, which I desperately did want.

Interestingly, neither Yahoo nor Amazon have been any help at all.I have already paid for and downloaded a number of productivity apps (through the Google Market that comes in the Le Pan), but they are moot without the email.

For the price paid, I was not totally satisfied with its performance.  I returned it and bought the previous older model of the  LePan  Android 2.2 Froyo for only $130.  This older model is just as good as the newer more expensive one.  I am so totally captivated by it.  First of all, just bear in mind it is not an Ipad or a Samsung  Galaxy Pad, but neither is the price.  So with that in mind,  do not expect somersaults out of it.  It has a beautiful bright almost 10\" screen.  It downloads and plays many movies and tv shows from Netflix, Youtube, TV.com, NBC Nightly News, The Rachael Maddow Show, Newsy, CNN, CBC/The National, (Canadian nightly news show), Crackle TV, PBS, C-SPAN/Washington Journal.  In addition it is a great EREADER.  I have been able to download many national and international Newspapers, and magazines like Time magazine to mention one.  It has a full Android Market already built in, and Amazon Kindle as well.  Connects to GMAIL, YAHOO MAIL and FACEBOOK.  Also I have downloaded Google Earth and already came with Google Maps and GPS.  It has a voice recognition device to let you browse the internet with your own  voice.  Downloaded Orbitz, Kayak,  Hotels.com, Amazon, Wikepidia and many more useful gadgets.  This original older version of the Lepan Android 2.2 Tablet, is a really little jewel.  If you are like me and will use it only for mundane entertainment, you will not be disappointed  with it.  On the other end, if you need a school or college type of Tablet device,  I am afraid you will have to look into higher priced Tablets like the Samsung or Ipad.  Better yet,  at that point, I would get a small 12\" Laptop that will work better than any high priced Tablets, and would be much cheaper as well.  But again, if you like me want something to entertain you on the go....You will be very pleased with this great Tablet.  You will not go wrong.

Ordering was easy and it arrived quickly, in about 2 days. Very impressed with look and feel, speedy and easy to use. I noticed I was not on my laptop as much and the Le Pan was great for Facebook, email, web browsing. Like others I read earlier reviews and was eagerly awaiting the release of ICS, that would round out the rough edges of the Le Pan on Froyo. Very disappointed that it now sounds like this won't be happening.After 3 months of using the tablet daily, on Thanksgiving day the tablet just would not turn on. I opened a ticket on Lepantab.com site and was impressed that support replied in about an hour. After trying their suggestion the Le Pan would still not power on, so the next day I was issued an RMA and had to pack and ship to CA for repair or replacement. Since it was at my expense I picked UPS ground shipping and that took the tablet a week to get back to Le Pan. The same day the broken unit was received they shipped out another tablet. The replacement also took a week via UPS ground. I was lucky that I had backed up my apps about 3 weeks before the crash so in about an hour most everything was back up and running. So far the replacement is running, just as well as the first one. Just waiting for the day it becomes a paper weight again. I hope this happens prior to the one year warranty running out and that Le Pan is still in business.

I am currently an owner of an Ipad which I truly enjoy. I was looking for something less exspensive for my husbands birthday.  The majority of the reviews were very positive, I was a little hesitant, but also excited because of all of the features described.  Out of the box it looked and felt great, but soon after that, I realized it \"ain't no Ipad\".  It would have a full battery, and 100% wifi signal, but would say no signal.  It would be fully charged, but would not come on. I had to reset it weekly.  I would use my Ipad at the same time as my husband attempted to use the le pan, but he wouldn't be able to get a signal, or it just wouldn't turn on at all. We use the pads to surf the internet and read email mostly. The le pan performes poorly at these simple task.  I was very disappointed, and upset with myself for wasting my money.

I ordered one last year. It started messing up in about 6 mos., but kept it and gave it the benefit of the doubt. It continuously got worse, and just shut down completely. Got in touch with LePan and they did replace it, but it was right at the year mark. The new one I received started messing up immediately. Screen would freeze and I would have to reset it. It got to the point that I would have to restart it 6-8 times within an hour. It then started to show horizontal colored lines, but nothing else. It would not turn on without resetting it. After this, it would not turn on without it being plugged in and resetting it. Final straw was 2 nites ago when it did not respond to anything. LePan has told me that my warranty with them did not extend just because they sent me a new tablet and they would charge $100.00+ to ship & fix it.

It seems many reviewers are first time tablet users, so I also feel it's important to mention that I am tech savvy, and I have used a wide variety of tablets and smartphones.The Le Pan had intriguing specs and good reviews and is at a price point that android tablets will be most competitive against the ipad elite. But, I'll boil this down...1) It is good for what you pay - great screen, nice looking body, easily handles gmail and simple web browsing... Does well with angry birds and the like... But nothing more video-intensive2) LAG - video playback is a struggle, simply moving around in android has noticeable delay at times - just sliding around using multitouch has a distinct lag compared to my touchpad and direct comparisons of youtube and flash playback were very blocky and disappointing3) Support - several reviewers stated positive comments about le pan support... Le Pan was completely unresponsive to all 5 of my emails with simple questions when I was deciding whether or not to buy and no one was available to answer the phone the 6-7 different times I called over a 3 week period. I am not at all impressed.4) I returned the TC 970, it's just not up to par. The Le Pan II has impressive specs and could potentially perform nearly as well as my touchpad, but the total unresponsiveness of the company would keep me from buying.

Soon after playback starts it starts buffering and buffering never stops.Similar problems occur with Netflix and any other apps/processes that require streaming and/or downloads. I observed it even on Google Market where most of the apps are pretty small - download/update starts, then stalls for several minutes at 10-20%, then resumes several minutes later. At the same time 2 other devices on the same WiFi network (laptop and Android phone) exhibit no such issues whatsoever.2) Lack of official Windows driversThere are no official Windows drivers available, so when plugged in device is not mapped to the drive letter in Windows Explorer. Other users reported on internet forums that they received email from Le Pan support stating that they will not release drivers to the public.I emailed support regarding driver availability and received no response at all.That being said there are unofficial drivers for the previous model of this device (970) that has been hacked to work with LP II. I have not tried them and can't comment on how well they work or if they can be used for doing software development on this tablet which was my intended usage (I am talking about development of regular Android apps that do not require device to be rooted).3) Source code for OS has not been published. As far as I understand this is a violation of license for Android OS.I am sending device back mostly because of WiFi problems and lack of drivers.
