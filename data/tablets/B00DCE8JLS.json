{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow, well worth the money!", "Author": "Chris in Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R3HNT9UGAUK35T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several Android devices - phones and other tablets. I wanted a tablet for my daughter for Christmas; she is 8, and very tablet savvy (they use them at school, and also she uses mine). The pink case sold me on it, and the price (< $80 delivered). However, I was skeptical of the cost, and how functional it would really be.First off, it shipped very fast by USPS. It arrived within a few days. It was pristine. Along with the tablet was a screen protector, USB cable, charger, USB type-A adapter (which I assume is to connect USB devices such as flash drives and *maybe* keyboard - I plan to test both of these later today), earbud headphones and a decent (although unnecessary) stylus. Initially, I thought the screen was scratched, and not very responsive, but there is a protective plastic cover over it. Take that off, and put the screen protector on instead and it looks and works great. The capacitive touch is very good, especially considering the price.It has decent performance. It came right up on my office network, and worked flawlessly. Netflix streamed very smoothly. Video playback from Netflix and MP4 files I copied from my PC worked great. Audio playback was reasonable for a tablet, and sounded very good with headphones. Sound through the speaker with video and audio playback was fine (plenty loud). Skype worked fine also, as did various games I tried (Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja come installed). The Android app store came right up, and I had no problem downloading apps and music.By default, the tablet comes in USB storage device mode, which did not work with Windows 7 x64. Not sure why. I switched the tablet to Media Device mode and was able to copy photos, music and video to it with no issues. The popup keyboard worked fine; no issues. Typing emails and texts works great; it synced right up to my Gmail account no problem.Overall, I am very impressed. This is well worth the money. The display is nice, and very readable. The battery seems comparable to my wife's Nook Color. With a bit of tweaking, this could be a fantastic tablet for anyone. Well worth the money. In fact, I am amazed at the price. I highly recommend.MORE INFO - NEXT DAYSome additional info for those considering this tablet. The USB port is a micro USB, same as what you find on most Android smart phones and tablets. It uses the same cable and charger as my Motorola RAZR MAXX and my wife's DROID X2. Also, it appears to support OTG (on-the-go) USB. It will connect to a PC to transfer files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and will also connect to a USB flash drive. Inside the box is a Type-A USB adapter cable. You connect your USB flash drive to it, then connect to the Zeepad and open the Android file manager (see photos). Also, I connected a USB keyboard this morning in the same way (via the Type-A adapter) and that worked, too. I was able to type/edit a letter, and type an email. No app was required for the keyboard, it was immediately recognized.I have tested Netflix, Skype, video playback, music playback, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run, Pinball Deluxe, Hulu Plus, Lookout (anti-virus/malware app), Dolphin Web browser, Google Play, Gmail, and Kindle app (and store) and it all works great. No complaints. I've tested WiFi in three places, including home an office, and it was flawless and fast. The SD flash card slot is a MicroSD, not the standard SD card you find in most digital cameras. The MicroSD is very common on smart phones and tablets. The Zeepad 7 looks to support 16 GB cards with no issues.Android System App says the OS is 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Kernel build is 3.0.8+. Internal storage shows max 1008 MB for downloaded apps + 1636 MB for app data, and photos/videos/music transferred from your PC. Max RAM is 353 MB. Everything else is tied up by the OS. Adding an 8 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card would be best for storing music, photos and videos, and off-loading some apps and app data (that support off-loading to removable flash, not all do). The battery is reported as being a LiFe battery, which is lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4). If true, that's impressive. LiFe is a high performance and capacity technology with a long cycle life (up to 2000 cycles, or 3-4 times that of lithium-ion). Such batteries are extremely safe; they will not explode or catch fire if over-charged or short-circuited. They can also be charged very rapidly, and can last 5+ years. So, if I can trust what the Android System App is telling me, I'm impressed. The display is 800 x 432, 60 Hz refresh, with a 160 dpi display density. It is very readable, and bright. I am running mine at 40% brightness. The CPU shows as being an ARM v7 running at 1008 MHz. The clock rate is variable; it will range between 60 and 1008 MHz automatically to reduce power drain - the OS does this automatically.Some things it does not have: obviously, no mobile networking support, only WiFi. So, you need to be in a WiFi hotspot to access the Internet (which is getting easier and easier in so many public places). There is no GPS. There is no rear-facing camera for taking photos, just the front facing camera for making video calls (that seems like an oversight to me, because a 5MP phone camera would be cheap to add). There is no Bluetooth, and no way to add it. None of these things are show-stoppers in my opinion for a $70 tablet, but would be nice if tablet designers could make some of this stuff available as modular user upgrades.Bottom line - this tablet is worth the price. Best $70 I've spent in a while.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Tablet", "Author": "Lishai", "ReviewID": "R17OA01F0IUGOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased product for my kids and I love it. My husband and I have the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 so we were looking for something very similar but smaller for the kids. This is the closest by far to the high end tablets for a great price. I love how it runs off the play store, many we have looked at were Android but they ran off of the \"get jar\" market and didn't have much like the play store does. I recommend this product to everyone looking for and affordable tablet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Value. Glad I found it.", "Author": "lj", "ReviewID": "RC3E67V4P6KGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED*** 11/18/13I promised I would update this review as time went on. This tablet has officially died. It will not turn on or charge no matter what I try.I still stand by my earlier statements that this is a good \"value\" purchase and/or entry tablet for young kids. Although you would expect things to last more than a year. I haven't looked into what the warranty is but I'm sure we're past it. It has served its purpose for us and I will be buying a better tablet later on to replace this one.If you know your expectations and you want a tablet that is cheap for young kids who may be rough on them, I recommend this tablet as long as you are not expecting more than a year and can deal with the issues I listed below.Otherwise, I would officially change my recommendation to a \"Do not buy,\" or Buyer beware. If you are looking for a Nexus/Galaxy/iPad type experience, keep looking.***UPDATED*** See below original review***I just bought this for my son for Christmas and it came in the mail today. It has an expandable micro sd card slot (TF)and most people will probably need it. (Keep reading) I bought this one: SanDisk microSDHC 8GB Class 2 Card with SD Adapter (SDSDQ-8192). I've always found Sandisk to be pretty reliable. The onboard memory states 4 gb but the available memory was about 1gb so keep that in mind if it's important to you. Memory cards are dirt cheap and can easily get you where you want cheaper than going the \"other\" route.I took the pad out to play with it some. It comes installed with Angry Birds, Netflix, Facebook, Fruit Ninja, Play Store, Adobe flash player and of course your regular items (wallpaper, camera, clock widget, browser, wifi, etc.)Some have said the packaging had a knockoff look. A better choice of words would be that it has \"generic\" packaging. It's not a ripoff or knockoff which connotes images of backstreet deals from some guys trunk. That's not a fair assessment of this product. The instruction booklet is admittedly small but who needs an instruction booklet to run a tablet?My only concerns are that it withstands the test of time and the 10 year old. It seems well built. (One minor design flaw is the screen and the outer frame aren't flush with each other so there is a gap. It will definitely collect dirt and be hard to get out.) Not a deciding factor but I can see it getting on my OCD nerves. The camera is also average at best but I never understood why people needed a great camera for a tablet. (Is a tablet really going to be your go to camera for things like vacation?)We bought this for our 10 yr old son. As such I think it's important for people to understand what this tablet competes with. It would be a mistake to compare this to the iPad for both good and bad reasons.It isn't in competition with the iPad but rather the iPod touch. We went with this instead of the iTouch and saved a lot of $. It was $69 for a 4gb Android tablet (expandable to 32) vs. $199 for a 16gb iTouch (not expandable.)I think we made the right choice and I think he will like it. Good luck everyone. Be smart.I will update this review after Christmas when the tablet sees regular daily use.****UPDATE***It's always good to come back and reevaluate a product after the newness has worn off and you can think more objectively. My overall feeling on the tablet hasn't changed much. I would still recommend it to the target audience that I mentioned above. Again, if you are looking for a backup to your laptop or an alternative to an iPad, this probably isn't for you. But for those who have read the description and know what you're getting, this will still be a great product.Here are my impressions over the past week of regular use:Screen: I start with the screen because at first I was turned off by the screen. It is more of a durable plastic. However when I go to my Galaxy tablet and come back to it I am glad for the build and glad that my kids have the Zeepad. It's perfect for them.As such you should know though that it will probably show marks. I'm fine with that. After all it comes with a stylus. The screen protector that comes with it is lacking and we have been looking (unsuccessfully for some that will fit it). Screen protectors for a 7\" tablet Do NOT fit the Zeepad. It is slightly smaller than 7\" so keep that in mind. Also finding a case has been a bit challenging. Universal cases that hold the corners cause it rub against the power button (which may be a design flaw). Nevertheless none of these things would cause me to fret.While I am glad that the screen is durable, others may be turned off of it if they are used to the high glossy, colorful screens. The Zeepad will look dull in comparison but again who are you buying it for?One other issue that has given me pause is the wifi. It works great but it can be quirky at times. One time it was turned off and after selecting on it would immediately turn off again. It would continue to do this until we finally shut it down. After a little while it worked fine. Maybe this was a one time thing. It happens. Also the clock constantly reverts itself to January 1, 1970. I don't know the significance of that date (LOL) but I finally solved this by checking the setting to sync the clock with the network when connected to wifi. Again, maybe this is an isolated event.The battery: I would take off a 1/2 star for the screen build and another 1/2 star for the battery. It definitely doesn't seem to last long but kids do forget to charge things. If you travel a lot this could be an issue for you. You might get a converter to get around this. (Finding a car charger might be difficult. The AC power cord is of the small, round variety.)One last thing: the memory. I said in my original review that the memory issue (comes stock with around 1GB available) could be worked around with a memory card. That is still technically true but in reality it has proven a little more difficult to run apps solely from the memory card. This could be an Android limitation as I am still new to the Android ecosystem. There is an app called App to SD which has made it a little more simpler but I am still not sure that it frees much space on the tablet. There are simply some games that you won't be able to play on this tablet. (So far it seems to be the racing games: Need for Speed, Asphalt, etc.) These use a lot of memory.While it may seem that I have changed my mind on this tablet because of these comments, in reality I haven't. I still consider it a good purchase and the proof of that is the recipient still enjoys it and loves it. However I wanted to be thorough for those who were still thinking of purchasing. All things considered I would still rate this a solid 4 star product and worth the risk if you understand who the target audience is and should be and also temper your expectations in regards to other similar products.PS - Just FYI. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews on this product because of shipping issues. Please read the reviews and find out if this product is for you. I am sad that others had shipping problems. Ours arrived in good time, from West coast to East coast during Christmas rush. Research the seller. There are probably some drop shippers used by Amazon that have nothing to do with the company that makes them. I have seen 2 or 3 different sellers to these.Hope this helps.**BATTERY UPDATE**Some users have experienced issues with the battery. I have monitored this with my son and we have come to the conclusion that the battery life is approximately 2-3 hours. It seems to be about 2.5 hours on average. This is basically Minecraft (which is all he plays) and nothing else. We have monitored it with low power usage apps and received about the same results. In short, you would be fortunate to get over 3 assuming all tablets are the same and this is the norm for these batteries.There was also an issue with the charger. It sometimes prefers certain outlets. Some outlets won't charge it correctly. I am assuming this is an adapter issue since we live in the USA. The adapter seems generic and I am currently trying to find a backup just in case.This still doesn't change much from my initial review but I wanted to keep the review updated. I always appreciated it when people would continue to be open minded toward their products and let others know how it was going.The battery issue may be disappointing to some but as I said above, it really all depends on who you're buying it for. My son has learned to work around it by keeping it charged and in all honesty kids need limits anyway. Long car trips could pose a problem but a converter would do the trick.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - This is a worse than bad SCAM", "Author": "Always Already \"Avid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2A9TL4NZY9ZAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How can something be worse than bad you might ask. I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon. I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time.  It finally arrived on Feb 26. The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged.  I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller.  The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96.  I shipped it back on March 1, 2013.  It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) \"as soon as they receive the item\".  Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad.  Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme.

But I'm certainly glad I took the risk. Considering I wanted this device mostly as an e-reader, the tablet would be worth the price even if all it i did was respond to touch and read PDF's. But it does a lot more. The right thing to do is to not have high expectations. I mean, after all, it's incredibly inexpensive. But I am honestly surprised as to how functional this tablet is.I'll start by listing the cons to get them out the way:-Ports and jacks quality: poor(Some of the physical ports, like the AC and micro USB may not align perfectly. You may need to push hard.)-UI virtual movement response: seldom slight lag.(The UI response lag is slightly noticeable at times, but not significant. Most of the time it responds very well, you have to be very picky to care for a few hundred milliseconds)-Bluetooth: None-Technical Support: Poor/Non-existentNow for the Pros:-Android 4.0 : Excellent OS & UI-Rooted!: Root access enabled(You'll be able to install apps that require root access)-Graphic processing: Impressive(I was able to play Raging Thunder 2, Angry birds Starwars, and some other demanding games without any lag)-G-Sensor: Yes-Display and touch response: Good(The display is much better than others have described it. The touch response is on point)-Micro USB OTG: Allows you to plugin many common USB devices (have tried Flash drives, Mice, Keyboards)-Included Bonus: Ear buds, Micro USB to OTG cable, Screen protector(perfect fit), USB to PC cable, Tablet Pen.Other observations & comments:-The device comes with a proprietary charger, which I thought was kinda lame, until I discovered you can also charge the device using any Micro-USB charger (Recommended use: 5v - 2A).-No micro HDMI (Oh well)-Google Voice recognition works great at a fair distance.-Running: ES File Explorer with LAN file management - Good, Android VNC client - Good, Fling - Good, Google Play - No limitations, SuperUser - Good, ConnectBot - Good, AutoKiller - Good, Terminal Emulator - Good, Tasker - Limited.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME affordable tablet", "Author": "A friendly helper", "ReviewID": "R2MQFNS4QOWYK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best buys i have gotten.

I was pleasantly surprised though. This little tablet is very responsive, the build quality is pretty good, and it even has expandable memory (which my more expensive tablet does not). I bought this as a xmas gift for my girlfriend and overall I'm really happy with it. My only real gripe with it is the screen, but for the price I can't complain. There's no dead pixels or anything, you can kinda just tell the screen is cheap based on viewing angles and quality of images. It's really not that bad though and again, for $80 what do you expect. I especially like the size of this device. It's nice and compact and fits easily in my sweatshirt pocket but yet it's still big enough to where you can set it down and watch something on it.

It is not fancy, not top of the line. It has a low quality feel to it, however, do not be fooled. This is a very good tablet to do your daily things, without having the fear to break your $200-$500 tablet.Let me mention some of the pros and cons of this machine, and this is my personal observation.Pros:For the price, it is pretty rugged and well made, you won't break it easily (but do not test it :-))It has Google Play apps, which is important.It is not large, can fit into a large pocket, or holder.Battery life is considerably long and that makes it great for travel.Easy to touch by finger and price is very affordable.Cons:The volume does not go to levels that you could hear some stations, prepare to use headphones in some cases.No GPS is installed in this machine, map directions cannot be used on road.App pages are limited, but it still isn't bad.Camera quality is very basic. Do not expect to have high quality pics.Overall, I am very happy with this tablet so far. It is an affordable machine, and you get what you pay for. I also have a Samsung S2 which is much higher in quality on all levels. But hey, this is a machine that if you break, it won't break your heart with it.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.  While I was very skeptical that a tablet would do all the things claimed, after seeing the Zeepad in action, I wish I would have grabbed one for myself!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does everything I need to do and is cheap", "Author": "Derek Brewer", "ReviewID": "R34RLXGL8OCW4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good tablet for the price.

They both work fine. Download of Apps is easy and the apps it comes with are very cool and all work.Reviews mentioned batery issues, some things we noticed and settings we changed that helped extend the battery run time considerably are as follows: When you first get the Zeepad the instructions say to charge them for six hours before the first use. Make sure and do that but when you connect the charger the plug that goes into the tablet will not go all the way in until the plug dissapears into the charger input so don't try to force it all the way in. When it \"clicks\" it's in as far as it can go. There will be a little of the silver part of the plug still visible that does not go into the tablet charger port. If you force it you might damage the unit.  After the first charge the instructions say charge for only 4hours. Do not overcharge and it would be good to set a timer so that you don't over charge the battery. The battery it comes with can be charged and discharged over 2 thousand times but it does not like to be over charged. Also don't not store the unit with a 100% charge for long periods of time, these new batteries like to be stored with 50-40% power only. If they are left to sit for a long time with 100% charge it can damage the structure of the batteries.  Rune time: The main killer of the battery run time is,  the screen brightness. Lower it as the screen is super bright and at only 7 inches they cannot build it with a very large battery. Leaving the screen on the super bright setting eats the batteries pretty quickly. The next big juice hog is the wifi. If yu are not going to be downloading apps, surfing or sending e-mails turn on airplane mode which turns off wiifi. Leaving the wifi on all the time keeps the table searching for the wifi signal and commnicating back and forth with the source and that eats the battery. Once you set it up and are using game apps ( what most kids do ) you dont need the wifi for them while they play apps anyway. If you do these two things the battery should last a bit over 2-2-1/2 hours on a 4 hour charge. Not bad. I wont get into the tech aspects as others have covered that pretty well in other reviews but considering these cost a lot less than other brands the main thing I was concerned with was, if it actually did what they were supposed to do. They both have worked fine and side by side to a samsung galaxy they donwloaded apps at just about the same speed as any other andriod tablet or i phone. The build quality is pretty good considrng the price. If you are looking for some \"special ops\" military grade hardware this is not the unit for you but if you need something to use daily under normal conditions these are pretty nice. The tablets are impressive and are worth the money. They come from overseas so shipping is not super fast. If you need them for a birthday order with plenty of time to give them a chance to ship from the factory.  If something goes wrong I will update this review but so far, these little tablets has been a very good purchase and the kids love them. Hope this info helps, The battery is not an issue but I addressed that more as most of the negative reviews had to do with them and that was the main thing I worried about when I ordered them. Happy to say the batteries have not been an issue so far.

There was also a micro USB cable included and we used that to charge the systems for a while but that quit working.  I contacted the company and they were willing to exchange the tablet after shipping it to China.  They also said they'd fix the problem with the charger and sent me another identical adapter.I believe this company is trying to do their best but they don't have an understanding of the US Market, I'd purchase from a different supplier.I also thought the tablet had two cameras, it only has a front facing one.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "My daughter loves it!", "Author": "Kenneth Welles", "ReviewID": "R2S6WO62D8ZQAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome product for the price!

I will say they run and work great WHILE THEY LAST. They can not take any wear and tear at all. So lets start with zeepad number 1 I ordered it got it in good time wanted to get it charged and set up before she opened it so she could play right away. I open it put it on to charge and it wont charge unless I prop  it  on something to put pressure on it. I should have sent back right away but I ordered it late and party was next day figured I could give to her and see if it was just outlet. After one week it would not charge at all. So I send back get a new one. I get it charges fine so i think ok other one just bad but after 2 weeks it will not charge you have to fiddle with charger to get it to light then another few days will not charge at all So I send back again to get the THIRD ZEEPAD. The third time the charger just fell inside after 3 weeks use. So after the last time I said screw this  go on another site find a kindle fire for 70 dollars got it and have had it 6 months now. Do not buy this product it may work great the first month but after that it WILL break and if u pass the warranty you are out of luck. There are times you can find good deals where you pay cheap price but get a great product. This is not one of those products you get what you pay for on this one. You are better off spending a bit more and getting something that will last. This not worth it. Yes I know I was only spending like 60-70 dollars on a tablet so I cant expect the world. I didn't want to spend 300-400 on a top of the line product for a 7 year old to play on so I just went with this and like I said I cant expect a product that will last years but 3 of these in like 2-3 month is bad she only got about a month all together of play time because a lot of this was shipping back then you wait for them to get bad product before they ship new one. So she got a little over a month on all 3 and after the second one I made sure I was the only one charging it just to be sure it was not her being ruff on it. I was only one charging it was so careful and still charger problem.

From Moma there is no labeling on the buttons, the preloaded apps described on the product pages are not there, they are missing.  The included earphones stylus and screen protector that are normally included from other sellers are missing as well.  The battery lasts only 45 minutes with screen brightness turned down as low as possible on the Moma tablet but last 2 1/2 hours on the same product from Goodios.  These (Moma) are not nearly the quality and completeness that others are receiving from other sellers.  Mine was defective (would freeze whenever screen blanked) and I returned it.  When I purchased the replacement it came from Goodios and that unit was MUCH better and did not have any of the deficiencies of the ones which were supplied by Moma..

Neither of us have used a tablet before so keep that in mind.PROS:It arrived packed securely before the expected arrival date (2 days early)It had about a 50% charge when it came, but I stuck it on the charger and left it there for the remainder fo the day (5 hours), the following day I got it back out and started to set it up. The battery lasted all day, but I was working on it it intermittently.WiFi set up was a breezeThe app store had all of the apps I was looking for and the ui was very intuitiveThe screen is very responsive and the colors are vibrant.CONSIt did not come with a screen protector for some reason (minor complaint)The camera is not very good quality considering the average throw away cell phone comes with better image quality these days, but as far as the skype app goes it was a bonus but not why I bought this.In the end for the money I cant imagine getting a better starter tablet than this.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eh, for the price...", "Author": "Maria A.

But it doesn't hold a battery charge for very long, maybe lasting for about an hour.  Also the actual plug connection for the zeepad is crap.  You have to play with the cord and jam it into the tablet in order to get the darn zeepad to charge.  The charger is not the typical UBS or iPad type, but a thin connector, which is impossible to buy at regular stores.  So when the battery goes dead on a car ride, you are simply out of luck.

Especially from my son's perspective, better to get the price down as low as possible to start with, and allow expanding it later.The one complaint I have is that it comes with a proprietary charging cable.  (It also comes with a USB cable, but I assume that is only for transferring files.)We were pleasantly surprised to find an included stylus in the box.

I am dealing with setting them up and downloading the games and such for the kids, because I want to control what they see.  Here are the issues I have noticed so far with these tablets...1.) Response time is ridiculously slow.  You hit \"Install\" and it MIGHT flip screens 30 seconds later.  If it doesn't it will \"time out\" ... Timing out happens consistently.  I don't know how the games are with response time, I haven't had the patience to even try.  The kids haven't complained, but they are just happy they have a tablet.2.) The screens aren't very sensitive.  I realize that screens can be too sensitive but I shouldn't have to jam my finger on the screen to get it to respond.  Very annoying.3.) Low quality graphics -- honestly, I didn't expect much from a $70 tablet, but just thought I would let you know. It's no ipad or Kindle with the graphic quality.4.) Battery life. .... It. Dies. FAST.  I was just TRYING to download a game on one, it gave me the \"You're at 14% notification\" and literally less than 5 minutes later when I went to plug it in, it was already down to 9%. This is supposedly a brand new tablet.  We literally got it in the mail yesterday. (Please note that we've had the other one for several weeks, so I'm not writing this review without having used this.)5.) Very cheaply made.  The Power Off button feels like it's going to fall off it's so loose. The camera is crooked and my daughters pad is coming apart in the middle. When I say \"very,\" I do mean VERY cheaply made.6.)  The \"User Manual\" is supposedly written in \"English\" however, it doesn't even make sense.  Here is a sentence from the \"User Manual\"  \"#3 Check the music file wherther damaged. Try playing other music, if the file have damaged may lead to serious noise or hop sounds.\"  ---that is letter-for-letter.  Huh?If you're wanting a serious tablet.  Avoid this one. I only gave it a star, because I had to. Like I said, the kids don't complain - they are just happy to have a tablet but I am not satisfied and would not use this for myself.

I didn't want to get them something that would make me hurt too bad if THEY broke it.As a techie I am aware that my personal standards may be a bit high but I tried to keep my expectations in check for the purposes of  the intended use.  a 5 and 6 year old.I ordered two of these thinking that less than 80.00 a piece for a \"tech toy\" can't be horrible.  Boy was I wrong.  The quality of the propduct build was about what I expected, plastic, and cheap plastic at that.  The screen, while I didn't expect it to be up to par with something like a Nexus 7, I didn't think it would be practically unviewable in portrait mode, and low visibility from certain angles even in landscape mode.I knew it would be slow, I fully expected (thus appreciated) the lag in functions.  The battery life however was a shocker.  One was dead in about 2.5 hours and the other made it about 3 hours.  Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.

They fixed many things and this is just another fix needed.______-------Added------_________After ordering a keyboard, I found that the recommended keyboard/case did not work with it.I also found out that the settings on it are very limited and people, beware, Like the spam mail in you In-box, this has many \"go-to\" adds on many of the apps there.so If you are going to give to children, make sure they do not have CC information nor access to it.If you could tther it, even better.

Pay attention to the delivery date.  It still came 10 days earlier than promised.  I only mention this because I didn't pay attention and wondered when it would show up.  Anyway I have an HP iPaq PDA that holds a lot of my day to day info and it is not getting younger. I don't want the data on my smartphone as I don't want it hacked.  I need to replace the PDA before it dies.  Looking at replacement costs was eye opening to say the least, 500 smackers.  Forget about it.  Then I thought, hey get a 7\" tablet, bigger screen and lots of apps.  I didn't want anything too expensive as it would be an offline one or two use device.  I saw that the Zeepad had a lot of good reviews and got one.  I've had it for several weeks and have punched a lot of data into it.  It is slow and punching data in is time consuming as sometimes the character doesn't register.  But for my purposes, I don't care as I will be inputting once and reading hundreds of times.  As I said slow, you click and then wait 3 or 4 secs but I am a very patient person and it doesn't bother me that much, though I gave 4 stars because of it.  The charger's plug to the tablet is longer than the socket on mine so it doesn't fit all the way in but it charges.  Do not force the plug into socket or you may break it.  One review says the prongs to the wall socket broke, I checked to see if mine were loose and I recommend you do the same.  Bottom line, this is an $80 tablet not a $200 tablet and you have to expect it will not work the same.  If you are looking for an all around excellent, fast 7\" tablet get the Kindle Fire, if you need it for a one or two use device I recommend the ZeePad.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!!", "Author": "Ashton Brereton", "ReviewID": "R3DP8OKRDZPNEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a fully functional tablet that would allow me, wirelessly, to access the internet, check and write emails, and access files on computers on my home network - from anywhere in or around my home - at a price below $100. The Zeepad 7.0 cost me $81.95 - delivered,  It does everything I wanted - flawlessly. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it does not have a backward facing camera - so I can't can't scan documents. The front-facing camera works perfectly. So, in sum, I recommend it unreservedly - at the price.UPDATE:I have been using the Zeepad more often now and found that the built-in browser was somewhat slow - taking seconds to access main pages for sites such as CNN, NBC and BBC - and occasionally the browser froze. So, I installed Opera Mini for tablets (free) and found the increase in speed of access to web pages was dramatic. Access is now in less than a second, the formatting of the pages was changed to suit the Zeepad screen, the font size was automatically increased, scrolling is a breeze and all the stories and information are available.

Displaying album art is non existent as well as even the song names.  if you click out to look at another album, you better go brew a coffee and take a shower, it might be ready when you get back.  This was not a symptom of Google's app either as all the other music players I tried had the same issues.On top of that turning it on and off is a problem, after it goes into sleep you have to hold the button for 30-60 seconds for it to reboot, it will not turn back on after it shuts down the screen like all other tablets do.

I knew something was wrong when I initially plugged it in for the very first time ever,  and it got a little too hot for my taste. The thing burned a hole from the inside out, burned a hole in my carpet and luckily I caught it in time!!!!!! This could be a huge lawsuit but I'm being nice enough just to ask for my full refund. I will spend the extra money on a kindle fire. Maybe I was one of the unfortunate to receive a malfunctioned product but it was a fire hazard and I'm sorry but I can't say anything nice.

At first she liked it.  About a week went by when she started swiping my Ipad again.  I asked her why and she said that it wouldn't cut on.  So after charging it and getting it boot up she started to use it again(for 2 days).  Then she kept bringing it back to me because she didnt like the way the movies looked and that they kept stopping.  Thats when I started to play with it more. I noticed that the batties didnt last long at all.  3 to 4 hours on avarage.(if you are not watching netflix)  The screen has to be viewed head on like an old computer monitor and freezes all the time when using Nextflix.  I have seen better screens on cheap smart phones.  And this thing is slow!!  I though that the thing was gonna be A LOT faster than this.  So when a 4 year old can pick out things she doesnt like on a tablet like an adult would that should tell you something.  Maybe the Ipad spoiled her but either way I am shopping for another tablet for her Christmas present.  I'm going with the Kindle fire or the Kurio 7 this time.

I run the Dayframe app and replaced the standard charger with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJHH20/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9PO5AM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_27 and have it sitting horizontally (landscape) in an AmazonBasics stand http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZT4VA0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_29 at about eye level when sitting.  It beats any other digital photo frame I've found for less than four or five times the price.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheap and not well made", "Author": "Melissa @ just one opinion \"mel\"", "ReviewID": "R2R15MQU2A4RE3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wrote this post months ago for my blog after buying the zeepad I'm not the type of person to just blast a company but I am so sad, frustrated and had my limit with the Android Zeepad 7.0 Tablet PC. My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the \"manual\" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the \"seller\" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these. I advice anybody considering a tablet for your kids to stay clear of these... iPad, kindle, Nook etc is the way to go...

They give him a address to send it to along with a money order request to fix the tablet. He sends the money order and the tablet the same week he spoke to them via phone. Two weeks later when he calls he talks to random people at the company. They tell him they have the tablet but did not have the money order. To make a long story short. He was out of a tablet and the money he spent on the tablet also the money order for the repair.

One drop from my 4 year old niece and the device split a little on one side and both the power and volume button popped out cleanly with no clear way to put them back in besides to take the tablet apart, something I had no plans of doing, and put it back in.

Meaning that I couldn't add any of the pictures or music to the tablet like I had planned to. Not only that, but the camera quality is absolutely TERRIBLE!!

I didn't want to spend a lot of money in case she broke it or didn't take care of it, so after looking on here and reading all the reviews I bought her this one. I gotta say I was really surprised with this because I was expecting it to be on the lower quality side because of the price. But it's actually really nice. Have a lot of pros and some cons for this tablet:Pros:-Very heavy duty but still light weight which I like. Seems like it'll last longer and it doesn't seem like it'll break easy if dropped.-Came with a bunch of stuff including charger, stylus, headphones and 2 USB chords-Very easy to set up WiFi and all the time/location settings.-Going between screens, closing out programs and personalizing tablet is super easy to do.-WiFi connectivity is great and have had no problems connecting to the house router and actually picked up a ton of other routers in the area too when it was searching for connections.-Touch screen works great. Using the stylus works even better.-All apps seem to work well - liked how there were a lot already installed like YouTube and Angry Birds.-Big pro for me was that you can turn this tablet off and on to save battery life. And it doesn't just go into \"sleep mode\" like the ipad, it actually turns off which is very nice.-Like how there's a slot for the SD card to add more storage to device.-Camera seems to work great. Can take pictures or record video and switch between the dual cameras. (Resolution is meh though - see below in 'Cons')-Charging is actually really quick. Takes maybe an hour or so to get the battery up to 100% once it's down to nothing.-Gets all the same apps as the iPad using the Google Play store (pretty much it's just like an Android phone but bigger and you can't make phone calls)Cons:-Will lag if you have too many programs open at the same time (which makes sense as the memory isn't that high).-Speakers aren't all that great. I think that's why they included the headphones because the highest volume is still kind of hard to hear sometimes depending on what you're listening too.-Resolution is alright. Not as good as the ipad or Windows tablet though. But it's not horrible, just not HD or anything.I'd definitely recommend this for a kid that wants a tablet.

Miles-monaghan", "ReviewID": "R1EGB80WLJ2W6N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this tablet for my wife to play casual games on.  For that purpose, and considering the low price, it works great.  Mine came with Jelly Bean pre-installed.  The box even says \"Jelly Bean\" on it.  The About screen in the OS confirms this as well.  Unlike other ZeePads with Android ICS, this updated model was NOT rooted out of the box.The first thing I did to prep this for her was to root it using \"Root with Restore by Bin4ry\", from the XDA forums, and then installed Ad-Away and Root Cleaner.  I also uninstalled the apps and games she doesn't use to free up some memory - root not required.Battery life is so-so.  A couple hours of gaming will kill it, but it lasts a decent amount of time for other tasks.  The back of the tablet does get quite warm while gaming.  Performance is decent, however a task killing app is useful for freeing up some memory.  The screen is OK as well and responds to touch accurately.  The viewing angle is quite limited compared to a high end IPS display, though the update speed is plenty fast for her games and doesn't exhibit motion blur.I didn't find any Chinese spamware on this tablet as I did on the Star N9500 phone that I purchased and reviewed here on Amazon.UPDATE 02-20-2014: The tablet has degraded substantially with light use.

So, giving it 3 stars as a \"belated thumbs up\".THE PRODUCT.  The Zeepad itself is fairly awesome.  It's decently fast.  Decently responsive.  I like the way Android is set up on it-- not a bunch of extra brand-specific garbage.  Easy to use.  Speaker is acceptably loud.  No bluetooth but that's as advertised.  Love the multi-function USB port.  Love that it charges either from the charger port or USB.  For the price, this is an impressive little tablet.  Didn't like the 800x400 screen pixels... too few really.  But it works and aside from typical \"short freeze\" lag factors common in Android devices, this is a great little system at $70.  The device itself I give a solid 4+ stars.THE SHIPPING and ADVERTISING.  Not so spiffy.  The ad seems to change from time to time and what was originally listed as \"up to 1200 x 600 graphics resolution\" turned out to be significantly less.  In truth, 800x400 just doesn't quite cut it.  It limits the number of icons one can have on one screen.  Now if that had been advertised would be fine.  Noticed at times the screen says just that.  But at other times it advertises the 1200 x 600 and (while I don't know why), that's going to cause problem expectations.But the real problem I had (and what knocked this down to 3 stars), when purchased from \"WorryFree Gadgets\"... it came shipped in its own box loose-packed inside an Amazon box-- no padding to keep it from bumping around.  Meh, these packages take quite a bit of bumping anyway, so not too worried.  But... Amazon box was in fine shape while the Zeepad box was significantly crushed.  Since the outer box was fine, that means it was PACKED in that condition.  As a result while the Zeepad itself seemed okay, the screen protector packed as a \"bonus item\" in the top of the box was also crushed.  Not happy with that.The bonuses were nice.  The Zeepad stylus, the screen protector (if it hadn't been damaged *at the time of shipping*), the mini-usb adapter, everything was fine.  But I don't have much tolerance for a merchant taking a visibly and significantly damaged box and going ahead and shipping it without even inspecting the contents.  That's lazy and it's just not right.So... three stars.  Like other users I give the Zeepad itself a thumbs-up value-for-the-buck rating.  For the shipping and merchant care, not so much.  The question I have:  was it shipped directly from the merchant or from Amazon itself?  The screen said \"Sold by Goodios and Fulfilled by Amazon.\"  So which is it... Worry-Free Gadgets, Goodios or Amazon to blame for shoddy packing?  Who crushed the inner box and who sent it out in that condition?  Dunno.  It got it returned though, and Amazon was great about that as always... with a refund to my account in less than 24 hours and free UPS pickup (just cannot beat Amazon on customer service).This is a product that cannot be exchanged, only returned.  That's fine because in truth, I want a bit better resolution screen if available-- and the new Zeepads are just now hitting the market with DOUBLE THE MEMORY for about $10 more (nice coincidence there).Despite the problems I still <3 Amazon, and the Zeepad is everything everyone raves about.  For a starter Android tablet or one for kids... this is a good choice.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "PAY FOR QUALITY!!!!", "Author": "Deashia Henderson", "ReviewID": "R3RD0BSG5GYMF9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Tablet is at a very affordable price for a reason the quality sucks.

My wife and I debated getting our 4 year old a LeapPad for educational games, but I was able to win out by pointing out the cost of many Android games: free.The screen has a small viewing angle and the resolution isn't the best, my daughter loves playing the ABC and puzzle games we downloaded for her. I have not purchased any software for her, but the free games on Play are awesome. This thing even runs Candy Crush (just in case you were wondering :).I wish this didn't have a proprietary charging end on it (it has a USB port, but that is not for charging) but my other tablets also have proprietary charging ports so it seems to be standard for them to make a different port.The box was full of goodies: charging cable, usb adapter (so you can plug in full sized usb items to the tablet), a stylus, AND a screen protector. They really delivered on the packaging.This tablet is really a bargain for the price, it wont win any processor speed awards and it can hang at times but if you are in the same boat and looking for something to entertain your children during long drives or you want to use some type of electronic game/learning system this is priced to be in your top 5 list of purchase considerations. On the other hand, if you are an adult looking for something to surf the web/look for jobs/ do any type of professional work with, I would suggest a different more powerful (and likely expensive) tablet.Willie-B", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R1HJVM1FB2GU6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great for my grandson with downs syndrome.

They do all this just as well a Nexus.About two months ago one the tablets stopped charging, the battery still had a small charge (not enough to power up) and the charger was working. Something stopped working in the charging circuits on the motherboard. So that one is no longer usable.All but one of the chargers has stopped working, I think the wire or plug is too weak and broke, they worked if you wiggled the plug. Also the charging receptacle in the tablets is weak, one tablet's does not work anymore. And the USB port of another does not work. This has probably as much to do with the kids jamming and yanking on the cord, as anything.Fortunately, the USB connector does charge the tablet, so even without any of the chargers you can still use the tablets.The third tablet is very slow to react when tapping on the screen. This is most noticeable on the home screen, but also when playing games, though not as bad.Very odd, seems more of a software based problem than hardware.The fourth tablet, so far (knock on wood) is working fine no problems at all. Battery life has never been that great, two hours or so max. It hasn't diminished in six months so they are good quality, just not that big. Keep a smart phone charger on hand and they will last as long as you've got gas in the car.Overall, I am pleased with these tablet. Especially for younger kids, when you don't want to throw a lot of money down the drain (literally!) Trust me, I know, before they got these, my wife's Nexus, ended up in the toilet when two kids tried to grab it at the same time. Fortunately, it still works fine.We know they can take care of them now, so we will upgrade them one at a time, as they stop working. So far only one has had to be replaced. Pretty good as far as I'm concerned.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zeepad", "Author": "Sultan Khan", "ReviewID": "RDOTU73PLPRAM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its kind of cool Android tablet for kids but lacks little bit of speed.

(Just wanted to say that before anyone jumps down my throat) Bought for my mom, who has cancer and lives with me. I handled it mostly to help her set it up and we noticed problems right off the bat. We weren't expecting anything fancy, but to work and be able to get some use out of it would have been appropriate for the price paid I think. We charged it to full first thing, set it up a little bit, turned it off with the charge at 74 percent and turned it back on 30 minutes later to discover the battery had completely drained. To our disappointment, it does that every time. The touch screen is unresponsive at times especially in certain areas, you have to press really hard and sometimes even then it does not respond. There are specks in the back of the lcd screen, enough to be bothersome when using. My mom is too polite to want to return it when I mentioned it she said no, she already threw out the box it came in anyways and said it'll be alright and she feels bad. At first it was extremely slow to charge, taking hours to just get even halfway, and sometimes after it has been charged all the way and she disconnects the charger the full charge goes right back down to only a barely charged within seconds without doing anything. I have been trying to contact amazon's customer service, I remember years ago they had the best customer service if ever there was a problem, now I can't even get ahold of them. I don't have a phone with minutes right now but have been trying to submit their online forms and have been getting a \"We're sorry. There was an error trying to send your e-mail. Please try again in a few minutes or contact us by phone.\" Message. I have been trying several times a day everyday, it doesn't look like they are fixing the form problem. I have scoured the internet for their customer service address but it seems like all of them have been disabled. Extremely disappointed with this product and with amazon's customer service, they lost a long time customer.

I have almost no experience with tablets, really have no idea what I'd do with one, but for the price, I figured I'd find out what its good for.  Still working on that part, but this little device is way more than I'd expected.  I nearly sent it back, could not get it to connect up to my wireless at home.  Took it into a local shop and asked nicely if he could get it to connect.  There it was.  Went home, reset the router and the Zeepad immediately connected.  It was me, not the Zeepad.  Off to the Google Play Store...A month later.  I still very much like this little tablet.  Had a terrible time connecting it to the computer by USB, but finally figured out that an option to \"debug the USB connection\" was checked off.  Sounds like a good thing to do whatever it is, but it stopped the USB connection.  Unchecked it, and bang, it was connected.Haven't found any apps it would not run, mostly games.  Battery life isn't great, but it uses the same micro USB as the cell phones we have, so finding a charger and cable is no problem around the house.

ANTIVIRUS AS SOON AS U GET TABLETThe tablet comes installed with games and 2 of the games came up as potentially threatening so if u just hand it to your kid and they try to play those games u are at risk I use avg pro its still$15 bucks but I have it installed on 4 devices so worth the money u can get it in the play store this tablet is awesome but an adult should go thru all the settings and run spywear b4 handing it over to kids as I said in my updates whoever rooted the device changed the settings if u run avg it will walk u thru the settings at the end of the scan to protect your deviceI bought this tablet for my 18 month old daughter because she is determined to keep up with her older brothers and loves all the learning apps available for young toddlers I must say this tablet is great for her im going to try to find a kid tuff case of course the tablet is on the cheaper side I only paid 76 bucks im not complaining all the apps work and this tab has options to delete installed apps and options to move apps to sd card I did not have those options on my galaxy so not bad at all shes gonna be so excited to play her word games when she wakes up from naptimeUpdateJust realized this tab comes rooted I know this is a high selling point for some it makes me a little nervous but so far so good I will update again if anything else pops upUpdateSo my daughter loves it the abc phonics games are a must for anyone with young toddlers the zeepad is definatly great so far of course the speakers suck and itscheap plastic its only $76 bucks I recommend going thru the settings whoever rooted it set those kind of weird still tweaking them my daughter doesnt want to let go of the thing its great for kids and budgets I cnt afford an ipad and if I could im not handing It to my child so this is a great way for u to let your youngster play without losing out on $500 or more if they drop itUpdateDay 2 with the zeepad the charger works its battery life definatly isnt great and it depletes even when your not using the tablet but I also believe those small annoyances to be the reason the zeepad is available for such a cheap price its a wonderful beginner tablet for young kids it comes already installed with kids games and is obviously intended for kids but as I said before if your on a budget an adult could find this useful also its not the fastest or the best thats why its so cheap but its still more than enough for my daughter to watch her shows and play her apps I would definatly recommend this tablet to others great purchaseUpdateThe tablet is still working despite the fact my 18 month old has been drooling and pushing on the screen a little harder than I like then again I bought her the zeepad so she wouldnt abuse my galaxy anymore so I guess I shouldnt complain reading the reviews are what helped me make my purchase and they are also how I determine what seller to purchase from that is ehy I keep updating I feel like this tablet is a good deal if u purchase from a reliable seller and supervise your kids charge it for them its not a tank they can still break it make them sit on the couch while they play it instead of running with it this tablet is cheap and has tons of features but its not durable or it would cost more if u want durable spend $100 more bucks and u will get higher quality this is a great beginner tablet its still quite fast for a single core processor and has tons of features runs netflix youtube and my comcast apps all fine on comcast I have to log out then back in somtimes for it to work but for it $76 delivered its not that big of a deal plus u can install apps that require root access my tablet doesnt do that and to buy higher end rooted tablets is at least $100 more on top of what the going price is so im assuming the negative reviews are the people who bought from the seller at the very bottom offering the dual camera on the probably fake zeepadsUpdateIts been a couple weeks now the zeepad is still charging and works great I only charge it about once a week but I also shut it off when my daughter isnt playing it I think this was a great deal my daughter loves it and it plays all her movies and games without any problemsUpdateThe zeepad is still working just got done loading a bunch of free mp3 songs for my daughter off of the free app I got off google play I really dnt understand all the bad ratings for my$76 bucks this is an amazing deal we have 3 samsung galaxy tab2 also and this tablet does just as much a little slower at times and not as good quality but for the price this is a great dealUpdateSkype works and all of the other apps we have loaded on here just got done reading elmo and dora ebooks we downloaded on the kindle app I still cnt figure out why people dnt like this tablet I'm writing my review on it rn the battery isn't that bad and why would u want your child playing 5hrs of games a day anyways either way zeepad still works and we still love it", "Date": "March

address was incorrect. I chatted with Amazon and they sent a request to Draco Tek. I also sent an email to Drack Tek and they responded within 48 hours...I was impress with the seller and Amazon for helping me correct the shipping address. I purchase this item on March 9,2013 I received this item on March 23, 2013 sooner than promised. I brought this product for my grand-daughter she is 4 years old and is very savvy with my iPad 4. I brought this product for the price and for what it can do. I was some what disappointed because when I received this product everything was their except the stylus pen, the box came with 3 different type of chargers. One was USB, AC adapter and one for using a flash drive. The USB and AC Adapter does not work I tried it and the charge stayed at 1%. So I tried a different USB and it started charging so I left it to charge overnight. I tried it the next day and it did not charge more than 2%. The product request that you charge it the first time 6 hours...so I was disappointed that I still could not use this item. So I tried another charger that I had and this charger was charging I started charging at 9:00am and it was fully charged be 2:00pm.  Finally I was able to see what this could do and so far it works okay. I know folks say this was inexpensive...however you should always receive what the seller is selling and the item should do what the product states it should do no exceptions.  I brought this base on what the product offered. Money should not be a factor...just because some items cost more does not make them a better product. I could send this product back after all if the product cannot work because you cannot charge it then it is no good to you...major flaw. I think Drakco Tec Store which is located in China should read their customers reviews. I did read the reviews and had mixed emotions. Being a buyer at Amazon and trusting Amazon I took a chance. I have purchased a lot on Amazon since March 9,2013 and I'm learning a lot about the sellers and shipping. I what have rated this product higher because it does work and it is a good buy...however not being able to charge this item is very huge for me. Please take the time to read all reviews...their was a lot to read. I read all of the reviews after ordering. So I did know there was a possibility that the charger would not work. So I did gather up all of the old chargers I had collected over the years from old cell phones which save the day...so in the end it did work out.

I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew knowing full well it was not going to be a top of the line tablet . It accesses the internet on WiFi only no Ethernet port that i observed . It is relatively fast but again we only talking 512 mb ram so your not talking lightening fast . It has a decent camera with it and also a built in microphone , both as i have said are decent for what your paying . Its only really bad downfall is it's battery life . Even fully charged its battery might last you an hour depending on what your doing with it . It seems to use more power using the internet than the games. Possibly because of it being on wireless .i am assuming you will not be able to use this in a wireless hot spot because you do have to set it up to detect your wireless configurations on your device at home . But if your looking for something for the kids to use and don't want to spend 500 bucks or more on an I Pad  then this might serve the need .

She saved a little over $80, so she didn't have much choice than buying a \"cheaper\" tablet, and ended up with a hot pink zeepad. This was PERFECT for her! So perfect, my 3 year old ended up with one for birthday just a month later. Now, being 8 months later, I ended up buying one for myself so I can stop stealing theirs. Granted, they use theirs for children games and learning games, including ones that have taught them to read. Mine is used for the Kindle app for the most part, since the screen is bigger than my phone, but I also use it for many other things, including Facebook, Twitter, etc. It's great! My 5 year olds is the only one I had an issue with, and thats because she kept dropping it- then I bought us all cases. And the only thing wrong with hers is the volume button stopped working.

All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

The first sign that this was not going to go well was the way it was packaged...or the lack of packaging.  LOL.  The tablet comes in the box that you would find it in any retail store, then it had only one layer of bubble wrap covered by a layer of packing tape. What kind of a company packs like this???  (it is not packed into a shipping box).It only gets worse, the screen is extremely scratched, and raised above the frame on one side, and it had a half worn sticker on it.  The WIFI must be within 2 feet in order to connect...but the browser doesn't work anyway.  Also the unit will not charge at all if the tablet is turned on.Despite all this we were able to download a couple of games that did work well and were a ton of fun at first, that is until they started to freeze up.I contacted the company on the 18th, and they responded back saying the item is new and \"show us a photo where is the scratches.thanks!\".  So I replied back with pictures.Next they agreed it was scratched and offered to send me \"the film\" to repair it and a new charger.There is so much wrong with this Zeepad that a screen and a charger wouldn't come close to fixing it.  I replied back that I did not pay full price for a used, disfunctional tablet that I would have to fix.Their last response was just one short sentence...\"pls ship back we refund you.thanks\"Evidently they also want me to pay to ship this useless, previously returned item.  It is so disappointing.  Hopefully they aren't planning to ship it off to the next unsuspecting person.Hmmm, I guess when I get back home I will need to dig out the layer of bubble wrap they used to box it???

At first I used the slide lock. Well I forgot the combination but after 3 tries it asked if I wanted to open with my google account. Nice save! So still feeling pretty sure of myself I set a password and left for work. Returning home to find her chores done, homework done and room clean  she earned play time. I have to admit that after hours of trying every combination of what I thought the password was, I was never able to unlock it.I take full responsibility for forgetting the password. I give this tablet a low rating because there is NO reset button!! Before sending back I searched for hours on the internet looking for help on how to reset it. For the money it is not a bad product and my daughter enjoyed it for her first tablet. But what are the chances that she would set a password and forget later on without any way to reset it? With the slide lock after 3 tries it did give the option to override and we were able to get in. With the password however, I tried over 300 combinations and never got the option to open with my google account. I saw many other sites with the same complaint but never found an answer. Nor was I able to find the manufacturer info to call and ask if there was a way to reset the tablet.

I admit there are a few things the Galaxy has as features this tablet doesnt do, but for the most part it can do all you need (unless you are a high end user).  This tab comes with just under 1gb memory onboard.  I do recommend you buy an 8gb micro SD card (TF card) to go with when ordering as most aps want to install to the card.  Set up was easy and second nature~ no having to flash the bios, or other such nonsense that many other no-name tablets had on their reviews to get Google Play (market).  We purchased 2 with \"Christmas Money\" and we are discussing saving up for 2 to 5 more (we are a family of 7).  They are reasonably priced, and well made, and fit our families needs.****UPDATED**** Battery expanded and after 9 mo no longer works.  The battery broke open the Tablet.  I am disappointed.  The child who this tablet belonged to, was not hard on the item, and it had been on the shelf for a couple weeks when we went back to get it, it had broke.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of Money", "Author": "Stacie Collins", "ReviewID": "RYR2W0RJ2T2OG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Daughter dropped one time and it broke.

We chose to buy this for our ten year old boy instead of an ipod touch for many reasons.  First, he wanted it solely for the purpose of playing games, as he already has an ipod nano.  He has asked for the ipod touch for Christmas, but I hope he is pleasantly surprised as we are!  Secondly - affordability!  My teenage son and I already went onto the playstore and downloaded apps, and I looked in his backpack for the books he is reading and downloaded them so he can read them anywhere! I am certain he will love the netflix and the angry birds along with the other games it comes with.  Bought an extra micro SD card, have set it up wifi in our house.  Love it love it.  Works well so far, hopefully it will continue with regular use!  Thank you for the previous reviews I read which helped me feel confident in this purchase.  The one in particular I agreed with - you can't compare this to the ipad - it's just a perfect mini ipad for games, movies and fun.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zeepad 7.0", "Author": "Brittany Clay", "ReviewID": "R3ULGSS7ZFCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these for my boys.

The thing is the equipment turned out to be defective tablet wont turn, the screen didn't work. So I went yesterday to the Toys R US Where I bought it the one in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, to have it exchanged by another tablet or for a refund. And not only did I wait sooo long in line I was attended by this obnoxious assistant manager , whom which after looking @ the tablet just simply told me she couldn't accept the tablet because the manufacturing company wouldn't accept it. I told her the Tablet had arrived like this yet she didn't do much or anything to help out in this situation. All I can say is that Toys R US.. should emphasize more on customer service which is very low quality, they don't seem to hire a lot of employees although the stores are very big. Sometimes you have to walk around for a while through out the whole store in order to receive some assistance by a employee. As far as this situation I feel totally robbed/Scammed for my money. Employees are supposed to assist customers diligently and efficiently on any situation. But I just sensed they don't really care even though my daughter was next to me while I was trying to exchange the item ( Which obviously made her very sad, she wouldn't stop crying on the way back home.) I simply don't understand why wouldn't Toys R US exchange my item or give me a full refund it seems there always some sort of controversy or excuse to their own benefit  when it comes to exchanges or refunds. Other stores like Game Stop, Electronics Boutique, Wal-Mart,  Amazon won't give those obstacles when it comes to exchanging a item which they also sell a whole lot CHEAPER. Iam beyond indignated because the store manager totally wiped her butt with my receipt ( The purchase had been made less than a month ago) And even though  she did admit the Tablets were in fact coming with defects  she declined to offer any assistance or a exchange, refund, store credit whatsoever. Usually I never really buy often in Toys R Us... because there isn't located where I live & because I don't find the prices of the items cheap or affordable.. compared to Wal-Mart or K-mart or Game Stop , AMAZON . But this incident totally made it for Iam never BUYING ANYTHING ON TOYS R US ... EVER AGAIN.. and will give NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS to relatives and Close ones based on my Personal EXPERIENCE. I WILL NEVER BUY HERE EVER AGAIN. EVER AGAIN, EVER AGAIN.
