{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Xperia Tablet Z: A Strong Contender for Best Tablet", "Author": "R. Voorhees", "ReviewID": "R3TYRJJY1OG31J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HAD to have one of these as I've been looking for my ideal Android tablet for some time, and so far, the majority of the pro websites have given the Sony Xperia Tablet Z very positive reviews. Not wanting to wait several weeks, as Amazon states for their shipping times, I bought one straight from Sony...and I couldn't be much happier! Just about every tablet I've tried has had defect issues, build issues, too low screen resolution (or underpowered when it was hi rez), etc., etc. Although it's not perfect, with everything I'd LIKE to see in a tablet, I think it's overall the best tablet currently available.BUILD:I know it's been said in many reviews, but seriously, this thing is amazingly light and well balanced. At roughly the equivalent in weight to an iPad Mini, it's a remarkable feat of engineering. Yet it's also quite solid and exceptionally well made. There is no tablet lighter and thinner than the Z...period.SPECS:Powered by a quad-core Snapdragon processor, the Z scores a remarkable Antutu benchmark of 20,000+ straight out of the box, readily defeating the Nexus 10. That's some serious power, and it shows in smooth and responsive controls, whether surfing the web, running apps, or playing graphic-intensive games. The GPS locked onto 15 satellites INDOORS within seconds using GPS Test. WIFI is rock solid and supports dual-channel wireless speeds of 300 mbs. It links up with a PS3 Dual Shock controller through a USB host adapter at first, then wirelessly after being paired with the tablet. It has a Micro SD card slot for memory expansion up to 64 GB. It even has a built in FM radio for heaven's sake. The IR remote control works very, very well, and the channel guide with show descriptions and pictures is a great added feature. And the ability to \"throw\" the channel to your TV with a simple swipe is pretty cool. And although Sony claims that the WIFI mirroring of your tablet screen is a feature for Sony smart HDTVs, it worked perfectly with my LG TV, much to my surprise. I really haven't had the ability to test out the NFC capability, but I suspect I will eventually as the standard is more widely adopted.SCREEN:Hands down, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z has the most vivid screen of any tablet I've seen, including the Transformer Prime, Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 4, thanks to the Bravia 2 engine, the same used in Sony's HDTVs. It's simply stunning. While not as high of a resolution as the Nexus 10 or iPad 4, I personally think the difference is hardly noticeable in side-by-side comparisons. A Matte finish would have been great as the screen is glossy, but no more so than the other tablets out there.SOUND:Sony touts the sound as a primary feature of the tablet, and for the most part, it lives up to the hype. The 3D surround is decent, although I have to say the Galaxy Note 10.1 still has the best overall stereo and 3D sound with its forward facing bezel-lined speakers. Still, the Sony sound is plenty loud, and full of nice enhancements and equalizers for fine tuning. I have to be honest and say that I was slightly disappointed in this regard, as the overall sound feels hollow, no matter how you adjust it. Not nearly as rich as the Kindle Fire HD's powerful speakers. But still, it's a tablet after all, and headphones are the way to go, with full surround sound support that's REALLY nice in every respect... something I don't think any other tablet features.CAMERAS:Sony made a lot out of the use of its EXMOR low light sensors used in the front 2 MP and rear 8 MP cameras, but at this point, despite it's plethora of features and adjustments, I find the results to be disappointing when used indoors...where you'd think the sensors are best suited. The result is noticeable graininess, even in fairly well lit indoor areas. Outdoors? No problem. Nice, crisp, well saturated photos and video that are as good as you'll get on any tablet. But why manufacturers can't use the same cameras as their smartphones is beyond me. Anyway, I have to say that Burst Mode is really cool. I got some awesome hummingbird photos while sitting on the back porch. I'm hoping Sony can wring out better results with firmware updates down the road.ANDROID OS:A lot has been said about the fact that it's running an earlier, skinned build of the Android OS: 4.1.2 as opposed to 4.2.2 on the Nexus 10. But honestly, the added Sony specific features are largely well implemented while keeping the experience true to the standard Android OS. Sony also stated that they'll have a 4.2 update \"soon\", but we'll have to see how that pans out.HEY! IT'S WATERPROOF!Although this may not be a selling point for many, it does open up some places for use that no other tablet offers, at least without some trepidation, like at the pool, spa, bathtub, or in the rain. Pretty cool I think, and yes, it really does work as advertised. You can't help but feel strange submerging it in a sink full of water for a couple of minutes (up to 30 by Sony's standards), but afterwards, you'll know for sure that you don't have to worry about liquids damaging your investment.BATTERY:Even though it's substantially smaller than the majority of tablet batteries, the Z DOES last as long as Sony claims, and even exceeds my expectations. So far, I've gotten 8 hours of constant use, from surfing to video playback to playing graphic intensive games, and it's down to about 15% remaining. Need I say more?Bottom line? Sony delivered in a big way, and it appears that they've learned from their mistakes in previous, rather anemic tablet offerings. The combination of a great hi rez screen, decent sound, expandable storage, ease of extended use, battery life, raw horsepower... plus features like universal remote control and waterproof... really do make the sum of the whole the best there is, in my opinion.Well done Sony, well done!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony hits a home run....possibly a grand slam", "Author": "Steven Rafalowsky \"Boris WRTC Trinity College...", "ReviewID": "R3NKFWME6G6KZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago, the word Sony was the name for the latest in cool products like the walkman.

It's the thinnest and lightest tablet with a 10 inch screen. You can use this tablet in ways that would be impractical with a full-size iPad or Nexus 10. Things like holding it in one hand or reading an ebook for a couple hours. It also looks great.-The screen1920x1080 at 10.1 inches isn't anywhere near the pixel density of the Nexus 10, but it's within striking distance of the retina iPad. You probably won't notice the difference unless you're actively looking for it. Text is sharp. Viewing angles are great. Colors look good. It gets very bright.-The IR blasterIt's actually pretty cool. Grab Sony's TV SideView app and you get an attractive TV guide. Selecting a show and letting the tablet change the channel without touching the remote is a neat trick.THE CONS-Port covers are a pain to open up. This seems to be a side-effect of the water-proof design.THE meh-Speakers are ok but nothing to get excited about.-Snapdragon S4 Pro processor is fast but already a generation behind other Android tablets coming out soon.-Battery life is good but not great.-Sony's default launcher is nicely designed but stutters a little bit even after removing the (useless) default widgets. Installing Nova Launcher is an easy fix if this bothers you.OVERALLUltimately, you're paying a premium price for a tablet with relatively high-end hardware and arguably the best design in its class. Whether or not this is worth it depends entirely on how much you value the design.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Suprisingly awesome", "Author": "Infinite Heteroskedasticity", "ReviewID": "RL0ZL6GGZ7VW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long time ipad owner that just picked this up at a local Sony store I'm very pleasantly surprised - so much so that I decided to write up my first Amazon product review ever.The good- Design - In short, its fantastic. Super thin and really light I was so blown away in person I absolutely had to have one. I like the unique squared off look of it and its pretty much the only tablet I've ever seen that makes my ipad look too big and clunky. This is a full performance 10 inch tablet that weighs as little as some 7 inchers.- Engineering - Whatever one thinks about Sony one can't deny their engineering expertise. This is beautifully put together and built. The internals are solid and the screen is gorgeous. Features like NFC and an IR blaster are significantly ahead of those in my 4th gen ipad.- Durability - As everybody knows this tablet is completely waterproof and dust proof. It can even be used in a shower. As somebody with a young child can attest, spills happen and ipad 4 + spilt apple juice = very annoyed parent. Another bonus is that I can just rinse off the tablet under a tap to get rid of smudges/clean it.- Android - This is a matter of taste obviously but to me, a tablet's primary purpose is as an internet consumption device. Just as I would never ditch the apps and stability of iOS on any phone, I prefer to use chrome natively (not the iOS safari skin) for the internet. Sony's android skin is also really light compared to the others (eg Samsung's touch wiz) and offers some useful features - the remote control app that uses the tablets built in IR blaster is proving very useful indeed. It's also a fairly recent Jelly Bean release so it's fairly smooth and responsive throughout.- Gaming - I like to play a few games while traveling and absolutely hate using a touch screen for most of them. This tablet supports my PS3's dualshock controllers natively and I'm fairly certain PS4 support will be ever deeper when it comes out.The bad- Battery life - Its not terrible but that form factor comes with a tradeoff. I get around 8 hours of mixed use from 100% to 10% with stamina on (restricts network when the screen is off - you can customize it to let certain apps through). Similar usage on my ipad 4 gives me around 12 hours.- Charging - The bundled charger is really slow. The tablet takes 8 hours to charge upto 100% from <10%. It's best to let this happen overnight. In contrast my ipad 4 takes 4 hours at most to charge up its bigger battery.- Android - To some this is a negative. Android is really powerful and much smoother than it used to be but the final user experience is not everybody's cup of tea. For me, having chrome was worth the hassle and all the major iOS apps are also there and work well enough but the final selection is much less polished than iOS. There is also no Amazon Instant Video app for android (AFAIK).- Cameras - On paper the camera loadout is impressive with both front and back cameras significantly higher spec than Apple's In practice the lack of a flash might prove an annoyance. I personally don't care because I have never understood the logic of using a tablet to take pictures but for those that do, it can be an issue.The verdictI wanted a tablet that was light but still had a 10 inch screen and chrome. I liked my ipad 4 well enough but eventually realized that I got the entire experience on my iphone 5 (I'll always stick to apple for my phone) but kept it because I disliked the look of every other android tablet on the market. This tablet came along and fit my needs perfectly. The xperia z tablet absolutely destroys every other android tablet out there in terms of design and engineering. I actually find both slightly superior to even the ipad. I can deal with the (mainly) battery related shortcomings. I've always been a bit of a Sony fan since childhood and had been disappointed with their non Playstation products over the past 5 or so years. In many ways, Apple had become the new Sony. This year, between the successful new phones, this and the very cool looking new Playstation 4 I'm sensing that they're back in a big way.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely stunned this is a Sony", "Author": "Abusive Reader", "ReviewID": "RQPD31QXM1RQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For years,  Sony has been an afterthought compared to apple and Samsung. Apparently Sony finally got sick of this and decided to do something about it. This tablet is the rest.Where do I start? It's about 50% lighter and thinner than an ipad, and is absolutely stunning. I cannot get over how light and thin, and well, sexy this thing is. On top of that, it has top notch internals, beating all current tablets in performance tests. The screen is equally gorgeous. Though the nexus 10 has more pixels, you would not know. Compared side by side, the sonys screen looks better, especially when playing movies.Amazingly well done, Sony. Best android tablet on the market.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The BEST Android tablet you can buy", "Author": "Louis Fischl", "ReviewID": "R8SFWXBBU7VBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having come from a Asus Transformer Prime with the wifi and I/O issues, I was ready for a tablet that was really going to meet my needs - great screen, snappy, good battery life, a mircoSD slot, and overall just a pleasure to use.  I wasn't sure if I should wait for some of the new Tegra 4 tablets to come out or possibly go with the Nexus 10, but after I had the opportunity to play with the Tablet Z in a Sony store, I decided that this was the tablet for me.The tablet comes in a smallish box, just big enough for all the items contained within.  Not premium feeling like some cardboard boxes feel, but certianly not junk either.  Inside you find the tablet wrapped in plastic and with a screen cover stuck to the screen as well.  Lifting the tablet out of the box reveals the wall charger, a USB cable, and Sony warranty and product information booklets in several languages - that's it.  Not much inside, but honestly, not much is required outside of the charger and the tablet.The tablet itself feels amazing in hand - the 'svelte' back, the thinness, the weight, etc - it's really nice to hold and to use.  The tablet has a camera on the back and a front facing camera as well, an IR blaster at the top edge, the power button (which also doubles as the notification LED) and the volume rocker on the left side, and then a few port covers around the tablet - on the top left is the port cover for the headphone jack, the bottom left has a port for the USB/MHL port, and the bottom right has the port cover for the microSD and SIM card tray (which is not useable on the WiFi only models).  The port covers are relatively easy to remove, provided you use your fingernail to lift by the latch on the cover, which can take some doing to find at times.  4 speaker grills are placed at the bottom left and right of the tablet, generally where most people would hold the tablet for viewing, thus making your hands into a sound bouncing device for enhanced listening.  The tablet does have a decent sized bezel around it - while some people might find this annoying, I personally enjoy having a larger bezel on my tablet - it allows you to hold the device without your fingers pressing onto the screen - much more comfortable to place your thumb on the front of the device instead of having to push in on the sides to hold it in my opinion.Pressing the power button in for a couple seconds brings the tablet on, and going through the initial setup of the device is relatively easy - inputting your Google account information, etc.  I personally did not sign up/in for the Sony services, as I did not wish to use them at this time.  Once all set up, there was an immediate update to bring the tablet to Android version 4.2.2 (the tablet ships with version 4.1), which was quick to download and install.  Once completed, I began the process of installing my apps and removing some of the bloatware that I was not going to be using on the tablet, which is easy enough to disable/remove via the application manager.  The tablet is nearly 100% stock android in feel, which is great.  Sony does provide some of their own widgets for use which seem nice to use, but I personally did not care for them.Using the tablet is FANTASTIC!  Screen transitions are smooth and fast, and I have not encountered a stutter at all doing anything.  Programs load fast, and everything just feels super snappy - a MUCH better user experience than my old Transformer Prime.  The tablet does ship with the Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core SOC - while this may be last year's top of the line processor, it certianly is fantastic in its usage on the tablet, and I don't see how the new Snapdragon 600/800 would improve any functionality of the tablet.  Everything loads fast, games run extremely smooth, and videos load and play back without a hitch.  The screen quality is amazing - incredibly detailed, sufficently bright (even too bright at times on the automatic brightness setting), and is vivid and crisp - watching HD video is a joy on this tablet.  The speakers are sufficently loud as well - very clear sounding, slightly lacking in the low-end bass though (which was expected from a small tablet speaker).  I've only used the IR blaster once as a test to try it out, and it worked great, but I don't see myself really using it all that much as I have a Logitech Harmony to do that work.  One thing to note though, is that the tablet does not have a vibrate feature - some tablets do, some don't - just a heads up in case you were expecting it.Wifi works great - locks on fast to the wifi signal, and has a good, long range.  Spots in my home where my Transfomer prime would die out, the Tablet Z is still locked on and holding a good signal.  GPS actually locked on inside my home as well, telling me I would have no issues doing so outside, though I did not buy the tablet for it's GPS capability.  The microSD slot was a little difficult to get my memory card into, but after it was it, it's snug and has no issues - installed a 64 GB Sandisk mircoSD card (SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A), tablet recognized it and was working instantly - no issues with it at all.  The USB port is also an MHL 5-pin port - I bought the Cable Matters Micro-USB to HDMI MHL adapter (Cable Matters Micro-USB to HDMI MHL Adapter in Black and Charging Cable in Black 3 Feet) along with the tablet and it works great for allowing me to plug my tablet into an HDMI TV.  Note that this uses the 5-pin MHL adapter, whereas some of the new Samsung Galaxy devices use the new 11-pin adapter - they are not cross compatible.Battery life has been up to expectations as well - I usually get 8-9 hours of screentime with mixed useage between web browsing, video watching, and game playing, most of the time with a couple days inbetween each.  Even with the battery saver option off (which disables syncing and turns off all connections while the tablet is sleeping), the battery life is great, especially for a tablet this thin and light.  I also tested the waterproofing, which works as claimed.  Dunked the tablet into the my bathtub and took it out - works as noted.  Don't know if I am going to keep trying it though, as the thought of waterproof electronics still freaks me out.Overall, this has been the BEST android tablet I have used to date, having used everything from the Transformer Prime to the Nexus 7 and 10.  The speed, fluidness and overall experience on this tablet has just blown me out of the water.  I know I will be enjoying this tablet for the next several years.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet!!!", "Author": "Jonathan Charnes", "ReviewID": "R2LNOM8518NN1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When purchasing a tablet I did not even consider this one at first. It still ran android 4.1 and I mainly just looked at specs when looking at tablets. So, I was looking at the Nexus 10, the iPad 4, iPad air, Samsung note 2014 edition, A variety of Windows tablets, and the Kindle Fire HD and HDX 8.9 . This review will show how I decided against these tablets and for the Xperia Tablet Z.My main top choice was the note 2014. It had the best looking specs and it had the pen which seemed like it would be great for school. However, at the store, the pen seemed a little gimmicky. In addition, the home screen lagged. This one also weighed slightly more (although I didn't really check the weight of this one at the store). I didn't want any lag in a device that costs $500 and the note 2014 didn't seem to warrant the large price tag. Granted a software update may have (and I believe it did) fix the lag, my experience steered me away from the note 2014.The iPad air with ios 7 at the store seemed like a children's toy. It was nice that it was light, however I couldn't get pas the fact that it seemed like a children's toy. In addition, I feel like ios is a very dumbed down OS, so that it feels easy to use for everyone. However, I like exploring features and tinkering with many other things which is pretty much impossible with ios. With ios what you see is what you get. The iPad was great for reading (one of my main reasons purchasing a tablet). However, other than that I saw no great use for it. So for the 500$ that an iPad costs, I decided against it.I decided against an iPad 4 for the same reasons as the iPad air. In addition, the iPad 4 was significantly heavier, and had worse specs.The Kindle Fire HD and HDX were very nice, however they lacked access to the Google play store. This was something I really wanted because I like all of the Google apps such as Hangouts, Chrome, Drive, etc. These apps are NOT available in the amazon app store. In addition, there are MANY other apps that are simply not available for the Kindle fire hd and hdx because they are not able to use the Amazon app store. So while these were beautiful devices, I decided against these as well.Windows tablets seemed very nice. However, Windows RT lacks many apps that I like which is the same issue as the Kindles. In addition, some of the tablets were slightly on the heavy side. But other than that these were pretty much awesome devices. Unfortunately the apps were what made me decide against this. There were some tablets with the full windows 8, which is nice, however I believe that the specs on those were pretty underpowered to run a full windows OS and windows would have taken a significant portion of the available memory.So it was down to the Nexus 10 and the Xperia tablet Z. Unfortunately, the store I was at did not have the Nexus 10 so I was not really able to check this out for myself. However, I knew that support for the Nexus 10 would be coming to an end and the new Nexus 10 was coming closer to being announced. The specs on the Nexus 10 were superior and the price seemed great. So, the only other reason I would not have purchased a Nexus 10 instead would have been the .1 lbs more. The Nexus and the note 2014 do have the most superior screens, however from what I've been reading most content is 1080p or below, so that is negligible.The instant I picked up the Xperia Tablet Z I was amazed. It was EXTREMELY light. It is actually just about .06 lbs more than the iPad air, however this was fine for me because of the bigger screen. Playing around with it seemed fluid with no lag (slight lag now on the home screen if I have a lot of apps open which is normal, otherwise it's great). The lag is removable if I use a different launcher such as Nova, however the Xperia one looks great, so I use that anyways.  In addition, the Sony version of android 4.1 was actually pretty great. It was better than the updated versions due to their changed UI which was optimized for tablets. This one is water proof and has expandable storage (I added a 4gb microsd which is awesome!). It also has a remote function (note 2014 does too). It has an 8gb rear camera and a front camera. In addition it runs every app I want and need. The 224 ppi screen looks pretty good as well and videos look great. Reading on Google Play books and Adobe reader is nice and smooth as well. Magazines look beautiful as well. At first the widescreen format seemed kind of awkward when used in portrait mode, however now that I am used to it it is fantastic for everything I do. The MHL capabilities for TV out and USB OTG to connect peripherals are nice, but I did not test them. I was also able to find this tablet in like new condition on Amazon for $300 (for some reason it was the Japanese version which didn't change a thing) so it sweetened the deal. My only 2 issues which aren't really issues were: 1. the ports start opening by themselves after light use (these need to be closed for the water-proof capabilities) and 2. battery takes a while to charge. However, the battery lasts a long time so that isn't an issue. The port covers opening up is an issue that needs to be fixed, however I don't really use my tablet near any water so it's fine. Although I don't know how it would hold up in my backpack if it was raining outside because of the ports opening. However no other tablet really has this feature and the amazing lightness of this tablet made it the PERFECT choice for me. It did everything I need and it did it great. If you are looking for a perfect tablet, you can end your search here. Trust me! If you have any questions about this or any tablet feel free to ask me :)UPDATE: I forgot to mention a couple other nice things with this tablet. It has multitasking abilities (you can open widgets and resize them and use them and the app that is open. For example I can have a web page or a calculator open while I am watching a video. There is also an FM receiver. I wouldn't put a new rom over this. It is a great OS. I can also download music or videos from computers on my home network using the Walkman app that comes built in.UPDATE 2: Turns out the android 4.3 update came out, however I was not able to get it because I was given a Japanese version from the seller. I was able to have English on my old version and it worked just like it should have, other than this little issue. I assume it would have came eventually, but it's been a while since the US version was released. I did not want to root it or tamper with the original Sony firmware. I am surprised I was able to put a stock US version of the android 4.3 operating system on this rather easily! I just downloaded flashtools, downloaded the firmware file I needed (ftf file), and then I turned off the decice, disconnected, made sure drivers were installed (enable unsigned drivers on windows 8), clicked the lightning symbol clicked flashmode, found my file, clicked ok, and then held the volume down button and connected device and just waited for it to do its thing. It is much easier than it sounds!!! Made my life a million times easier! Now in the future I'll also get the American updates and I'll get them on time. Just make sure you use the correct firmware for your device. I'll update this with any pros/cons regarding the firmware.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does it all", "Author": "Paul K", "ReviewID": "R13XTH6XAAI6YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm extremely happy with this latest Sony tablet.Pros:- very solid build, engineered to perfection.  The lightweight, the balance, the thinness, true Sony craftsmanship- screen colors are rich, the resolution more than adequate at this size. I like the true HD and elongated form factor more than I expected.- Sony Apps: SideView remote way cool -- it's made me enjoy using my television again. Sony Unlimited music doesn't get enough cred. This is really an excellent service with HD streaming, offline playback and playlists, and a virtually unlimited (as the name says) music catalog.  I use this along with Tuned In Pro for my radio.- Waterproof is more useful than I thought. When on vacation, I used in and around the swimming pool. Nice feature.- Battery very fine, longer than I expected due to lightweight form factor.- Speed very fine, no problems for me, snappy.- Music and sound are quite good for a tablet. I pair it up with my Jambox, or else use headphones, so it is more than adequate in my opinion.Cons:- guest mode was removed. maybe this will come back in next OS update. minor, but nice feature for sharing in the family.- screen is a bit smudgy. I may step up for the screen protector.- the cradle is well designed and very useful. downside is the 3' USB cable. It needs a 6' cable to be able to use a floor socket. this was a compromise as the old Sony tablets had real power supplies.Conclusion: I'm extremely happy with this tablet, with the speed and the business apps like Skype, box, and office I can finally use this as a real laptop replacement. The entertainment options rock, and this makes a true fun and business device for me.  I think the price is fair. It's a real laptop equivalent but better in so many ways. The engineering and form factor that Sony puts into the product, I can see the difference.  This is a 3rd generation product and it shows.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's hard to find much fault with this Sony Xperia Z tablet", "Author": "southpawami \"The Best Selling Book IS the Bible\"", "ReviewID": "R1LH3ULSOKOT0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: This Sony Tablet can be productive.  The screen is Full HD which makes books, PowerPoints, and video look excellent.  The built in notes app supports all sorts of media, screenshots, drawing, and various text options.  Microsoft Edge bluetooth keyboard syncs easily. The Sony software is well thought out.  (And if you're a person that forgets the time, the center screen has a large clock in the middle of it.)Note Art and Screenshots: The paintbrush and pencil tools in the drawing part of the built in notes application make darker lines when moving slowly and lighter lines when moving fast.  The paintbrush gets darker as it layers on top itself.  I'm not sure of the extent of layering with all of the built in note art tools.  This tablet isn't pressure sensitive.  Screenshots of your art, games, or any other app are made by pressing and holding the power button until a menu pops up (select the screenshot option; this is 4.2.2 tested).Memory, Office, and Browser: In 4.2 and 4.3, 16GB and greater memory tablets with the Google Android system seem to me to run better with 8GB free on the main memory, which makes the built in file transfer app useful.  This tablet runs Adobe Flash well.  You can search xda forums for the link to Adobe's download page for unsupported flash installs for Android 4.2; I use flash with web browsers Opera Classic and Boat browser.  Opera Classic is the only web browser on Android that I've tested which passes the Acid 2 test.  Some websites work better with web browsers that pass the Acid 2 test.  Boat browser has floating windows that can be selected from a link in a PowerPoint, making it excellent for multitasking while reading PowerPoints.(Yes, I do read a lot of them.)  In my opinion, OfficeSuite PRO is the best Microsoft Office replacement app for Android.  Even still, buy a couple different office suite apps, as not seeing a PowerPoint page because of a transition glitch may drive you nuts.  Most office suite apps available do not handle files in excess of 20mb dependably.Multitasking: Using the apps in the Google Play store named Widgets Anywhere and Boat Browser are the best multitasking options available for Android.  By multitasking, I mean looking at content from two different places at the same time.  An examples of this are when you are reading and you click on an internet link yet want to keep what you're reading in front of you.  Another example is when you're playing a game and you'd like to keep track of the time.  Other examples might include taking notes over something you're reading(I'm not aware of how to do this), or sketching something when inspiration hits while still wanting to keep what you were doing in front of you(I'm not aware of how to do this).Security and USB: The facial lock system depends a lot on the lighting within a room.  You can take more facial pictures in different lighting to increase the likelihood of unlocking the tablet with your face.  The facial lock times out quickly in order to reduce the possibility of hacking, which the tablet warns you about when you select the facial lock option.  After the facial lock times out, inputing a password, pin, or code is the only option.  The USB slot is a common micro style, instead of the more comfortable full size.  The ideal solution appears to be this StarTech product StarTech.com Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter - Micro USB Male OTG to USB Female Adapter - USB On The Go Adapter.  One reason USB is important is because art applications Sketchbook Pro and ArtFlow on Google Play advertise that they support Wacom tablets.Battery and Camera:  The camera is limited to lighting.  It will take a great sharp shot in the right lighting.  My luck is generally not the right lighting, which leans toward a grainy shot.  The forward camera is the same way, so if you're Skyping an interview, check your lighting.  Battery life is excellent.  I went on a vaction for two weeks with the wifi turned off and this tablet still had 8 percent power.  The screen is the main battery drainer.  Any app that uses Unity drains the battery quickly.Durability:  I've dropped mine while in the Moko case three or four times.  One time part of the corner was damaged after the impact with concrete.  I turned it off waited ten seconds, then turned it on.  It works well for me.  The best durability available appears to be the clear thin plastic case slid into the Moko case.Conclusion:  In the end, it's a tablet.  Not a laptop disguised a tablet.  An elite tablet.  This tablet includes Google content options AND Sony content options, which is more than Google content options only.  The 4.3 update removed the hold power button down for screenshot.  Apps of note on the Google store are Docs to Go(good excel display), VideoPad, My Screenplays Pro, Sunvox, Artflow, WaterColorPencil, Infinite Manga, biiCADo, TurboViewer X, Spacedraw, SubDivFormer, Chanu, Overbite Android(gopher), BoatBrowser, NoteLynX Pro, MX Player Pro, OliveTree Bible Study, Bard's Tale, and Level 22.  On the Sony Playstation store, you have apps that work on both the network and PSVita... so, it seems you can sync calendar events with PSVita.  There's note apps and other practical apps that work across PSVita and this tablet.  These apps have come very recently, so now, it is most definitely possible to use a PSVita in a productive sort of manner.  The game Cytus Lambda on the Sony store is a big plus.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware implementation, but serious (software) flaws", "Author": "Dan Nasty \"dnastase\"", "ReviewID": "R1XJM45SZEETEE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did my research before buying and I was happy with the specs, advantages and disadvantages of this tablet.However there are three things that I only discovered after playing with it:1) they didn't upgrade the Android on it.

I mean: what kind of quality control do they have there ?!3) the micro-sd card shows errors when used heavily :( This is an even more of a problem than the Wifi + bluetooth issue. It means you effectively can't use more disc space than the internal 32Gb.So far I didn't on the internet any fixes for these issues.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Android Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "RBIVEE2HVIWDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never owned an Apple product. However, my wife owns an iPad 4 that her work reimbursed. This is my first Android tablet, but I've played around with many. This is the first Android tablet that has been able to convince me to buy. I also own a Galaxy Nexus smartphone and two 5\" Samsung Galaxy Players (for kids,) as well as the original Kindle Fire that my 3 year old uses.What convinced me to buy?o Thin and lighto Decent battery lifeo Higher resolution screen w/16:10 ratioo Waterproofo IR blastero Elegant designo Sony claim to upgrade Android OSDoes the tablet live up to my expectations?Thin and Light: Extremely impressive! This tablet is so thin and light for a 10\" tablet. After using iPad 4 with protective case, this brings a smile to my face when I pick it up. If thin and light is a top concern for you, this is the one. Even my kids love holding this...so much so that my 8 year old thinks it's hers!Decent Battery Life: The battery life of the Tablet Z varies widely. When frugal to moderate, it can easily achieve the claimed battery life of around 8-10 hours. The way I use it with Wifi on,I typically get around 8 hours use. The screen brightness has the biggest impact. When full bright, it will drain the battery very quickly, 4-6 hours depending on what you are doing. With full bright, the AC charger can't even keep up during use. Your battery will keep draining. Even bringing down brightness to about 80% makes a big difference. Around that point, the battery starts to charge back up when plugged in and using the tablet. At 50%-65% seems to be a good balance between brightness and reaching the upper levels of battery life claim.Higher Resolution Screen: The reason I didn't bite on tablets such as the Note 10 is because of the resolution. It isn't bad, but not great. The Tablet Z is sharp, but compared to my wife's iPad 4, it's noticeably behind. If you don't compare to the iPad 4, it is really very good. The 16:10 ratio offers closer to a 1080P experience once softbars are in play. For this reason, I appreciate the 16:10 (1920x1200) resolution. Like any other large tablet, it is harder to type with both thumbs in landscape mode. However, portrait mode is better for typing. Color saturation is not overdone and yet renders colors well.*UPDATE 14 AUG 2013* I bought a great little app from the Google Play Store called \"Thumb Keyboard\" and it makes typing in landscape much much better by offering a split keyboard. It works perfectly with this extra wide tablet. It even helps typing in portrait mode become a better experience. I love that I can add custom mapped buttons on the top row for items like the comma and apostrophe. I am typing this update from the Xperia Tablet Z. Of course, this app can be used on any tablet or phone.Waterproof: We all like a little novelty. The waterproof claims are good. I have the freedom to use this tablet in places I wouldn't dare with other devices. I've used it in the tub, shower, pool, and even wash it in the sink. What you need to know, though, is that if you completely submerse the tablet, it is not functional due to the fact water does conduct electricity. The screen gets confused and does crazy things as if one were touching it all over the place randomly. The good news is, if watching a movie in the tub and it gets splashed, it can take a fair amount of splashing without acting like it is completely submersed. To keep it waterproof, the power, headphone and SD ports have covers on them. Especially power, can be a bit annoying taking on and off all the time. The flap can get in the way while plugging in the power cord. Even with a tiny \"latch\" to hold the cover when off, it does not hold tightly and gets jarred off easily. I'm used to it and willing to live with this minor inconvenience for the waterproof ability.IR Blaster: If you love TV and want a universal remote, this tablet works well. You can customize the layout, although it isn't always the easiest experience.  Bottom line, it works. I've always been interested in the Logitech Harmony remotes and with this, I no longer care to spend money on those remotes. Considering how expensive some of those are, this could be a nice justification in and of itself. The TV guide-like functionality does require an app download. I've used it and it is neat. It works. I set up my Samsung TVs and Bluray players with little fuss. It just worked.Elegant Design: This is subjective, but I think it is very nice looking compared to Samsung tablets. It's simple and elegant. I don't mind at all showing it off.OS Upgrade: I am currently on Android 4.1.2. It came with 4.1.1. I'm still waiting on 4.2, which is supposed to allow multiple user accounts. As of August 5, 2013, I heard 4.2 is around the corner with 4.3 being pushed out even later. While not here yet, I do appreciate knowing I can eventually get those upgrades.Other Notes:o I wish this had a dedicated button/switch to lock screen rotation like the iPad 4. As is, it takes 2 taps just to get to the menu. Other key settings that people want to change on the fly are also two taps away just to see the options. I'd rather it be only one tap away. Since Sony lightly skinned the Android OS, I'd like to see this change. This includes screen brightness, WiFi on/off, and Airplane Mode.o Camera picture quality is so-so. It's there. It needs very good lighting to take decent pictures. There is no LED light.o Video is the same as camera notes.o Sound quality was highly touted by Sony. In reality, speaker does get good loudness, but quality isn't anything impressive. In fact, when loud, it kind of hurts the ears. Compared to iPad 4, the Sony sound lacks much full body and depth and richness. iPad 4 wins hands down. I also own a couple of very high end headphones from Audez'e and HiFiMan and the sound with those headphones plugged in  is better. It's not as good as my Cowon player, but it's good.o Price/Value: Honestly, I'd say it isn't worth the high price unless you must have thin and light and waterproof features. These are the areas it stands out compared to other 10\" inch tablets and where the others are lacking. I was willing to pay for the thin and light, and am happy with the purchase for that reason alone.Conclusion:Mainly because it could be better in the value department, and because of a few other nitpicky points, I give the Sony Xperia Z Tablet 4 Stars. The Sony and iPad each have their appealing points. The choice comes down to which OS environment you want, and which features mean the most to you.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Greate tablet from Sony", "Author": "Tariq Salah Ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R17Y67Z0OJSSY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a light weight tablet since long time. The tablet I like should be with high quality build from a trusted manufacturer because I struggled too much with my hardware failure of my ASUS. This ASUS got not to switch on even plugged to the charger. I read several reviews about future tablets and I decided to buy this one from Sony.I ordered my tablet from Amazon and surprisingly, I received it after few days. When I opened the package, I was very happy of the lightweight of this very thin device. If you compare it to Note 10.1 or ASUS, you will feel the weight and balance difference easily.I switched on the tablet and now I understand why all reviews of its screen are positive. Really, the colors are vivid and the contrast is perfect. I started to fan some pages here and there and I was astonished with the high quality screen. Then, I copied my 14GB high quality photos to the 64GB SanDisk I purchased with the tablet while checking the reading quality of ezPdf reader, office applications, internet pages, mail, ... etc. and simply tell that it is really excellent. Compared to Note 10.1 and ASUS the text is very sharp and the wide screen with the high resolution makes a full page portrait reading easily in most cases.Second I watched some demo movies comes preinstalled and it was glowing with stunning HD and amazing colors. Again contrast play a rule in the tablet to be very happy watching HD movies.Then I viewed the photos. It is a pleasant to see your albums specially if you have a high grade camera.For my usage of a tablet mostly for reading staff, such battery is ok for me. Others may need a better battery to last longer. I am satisfied with the battery because I understood that bigger battery means heavier and bulkier device. The weight of the tablet is perfect. I wish my future tablet to be even lighter and thinner. I know before I purchase this tablet that there are so many negative reviews about the battery. But 9 to 10 hours is ok for my kind of usages.I highly recommend everyone going to buy this tablet to start with a good screen protector because the worst thing in this tablet is the finger prints. Yesterday, I have installed the AromSuit and I'm waiting until it will be dried to see the result. FYI while I'm installing the screen protector I found a very thin micro scratches on the screen glass. I thing that the glass is not scratch resistant and it would be better to buy the screen protector with the tablet not after one week as I did.One more thing, I bought Bamboo stylus it was the worst experience for me.

I have been looking for the right tablet computer for over a year.  I wanted an Android because my Smartphone is an Android device and I found it interfaced well with Windows (I have had issues in the past with the interface between Windows environment and other OS).  I also wanted something that was fast, with support for either USB or SD memory expansion, with excellent graphics for video and with good sound.  I wanted something that was set up for Wi-Fi and with 2GB RAM.  NOTHING I found on the market matched my requirements-and I looked at all sorts of Tablets.  They either had reliability issues, or build issues, or software issues, or I/O bottlenecks or so on...I could not find anything that met my requirements (which were pretty tough to meet I will admit).  Only two even came CLOSE-and one didn't have expandable memory and the other has known I/o bottlenecking issues.Then I saw the Xperia Z.  Now, I am one of those people who are generally 2 years behind the \"latest\" technology.  It is exceedingly rare for me to buy the \"newest thing\" when it comes out-because I know that 2 years from now it will cost half as much.  So I NEVER buy the \"just released\" items-and haven't for nearly 30 years.Despite that fact, I finally gave in and bought this tablet.  I bought this one based on the \"pre-release\" reviews, the overseas reviews and because the specs matched what I wanted. Nervously, in a panic that I would not like it, afraid I had made a huge error by buying the \"newest thing\"-but I bought it anyway.And I could NOT be happier with it.  It does everything I want-web browsing, e-mail, video playback, GREAT graphics and display capabilities, wonderful sound (both with and without headphones).  The memory expansion works beautifully with SD cards.  It connected to my wireless network without a hitch.  I had NO trouble downloading android apps.  I could go on and on-this tablet is simply a marvel.  I have had laptops that were not this good.Suffice it to say, for someone who NEVER buys the \"latest and greatest\" I am VERY, VERY glad I gave in and did it this time.

I started using the tablet today when I opened the box I was surprised at how light the tablet is.  For being so slim it is very sturdy. I love the fact that it is water resistant this is great as I have nieces who are young.  I had to update 15 apps on the tablet once I opened it and they updated very quickly.  Downloading apps was equally as fast.  The speakers are loud and clear to me  they are pretty good, though I am sure audiophiles will need to connect headphones.  The sound while using headphones, was also very good. I played a few games with no problems the screen was equally responsive and the sound was good.  The screen is very clear and watching videos both on YouTube and the net were beautiful.  I don't have a problem with the tablet not being made out of metal as I think metal would eventually rust. I cant reiterate enough how great this tablet is check it out for yourself at the Sony Store or read reviews online.

Seaton", "ReviewID": "R1DI8FTM0XK6BC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a good couple of full days pouring over review after review on 10 inch tablets, and eventually narrowed down my choices to the Nexus 10 and the Galaxy Note 10.1.  As a Google fanboy, the direct link to the newest operating systems and best resolution on the market drew me in, while I weighed that against my previous experience with the Samsung Galaxy line of smartphones and the ability to link to a GSM plan.Then I stumbled across a comparison to this tablet, which outperformed both in terms of design.  Okay, to be more accurate, I stumbled across a picture of this tablet functioning while fully submerged in a kitchen sink.  This necessitated a quick stop to the local Fry's to try out a test, as they were understandably sold out of all models.  Less than an hour later I was speeding home at Mach 10 to desperately click \"checkout\" on my account as fast as possible.  A bit dramatic, considering I could've done it with my phone, but don't judge me, I like speeding.Which is clear, after spending about a half hour tinkering with this baby.  It speeds.  Oh, does it speed.  There are a couple other reviewers who can give better technical aspects about it, but the bottom line is, it hauls donkey.  Or at least, it did when I tried using as much memory as I could to give it a rudimentary speed check.DELIVERY UPDATE:When I purchased this, the delivery time was estimated to be 3-5 weeks; July, basically. A day later, it was updated to shipped status.  So don't let the shipping times dissuade you.  From purchase date to \"out for delivery\" took 5 days, including a weekend.Review update:I bumped this down a star to 4.  It's still an absolutely amazing tablet, but I've realized I'm not the biggest fan of the way they implemented the power outlet.  Because of how small the space is with the watertight port cover, I'm unable to completely insert the plug, so it does stick out just a little bit.  I'm sure it's fine, but I'm not a fan of exposed metal when charging a device.Review update 2:  Back to 5.

More than what I was expecting!  I just lost my ASUS Prime (yeah it worked only for 1 year and 6 months) Don't get me started on ASUS.  I'll just focus on this gorgeous tablet.  Not the best of the best, but it certainly can give the best out there a serious run for its money.  Even the best of the best tablets have its flaws and imperfections.  So lets not nitpick on Sony's Tablet Z.  It works great! Sounds good (just tweak it! it is configurable to give better sound), does not have that tinny tiny sound as I read in some reviews.  They didn't tweak the sound settings. I thought they were right until I stumbled upon the sound settings within the pre-installed SONY movie app and the sound did get better.  Not home theater better...geez...its a tablet, ok? :-) But listening was a pleasure after that.  A good pair of headset will of course make it so much better sounding.  But its not a must, unless you are an audiophile and have to have the best sound :-)  Nothing wrong with that, specially if you can afford the best headsets out there. :-) I say, go for it.This tablet simply ROCKS! Snappy, fast, fluid. *crossing my fingers* so far, I have not experienced any stutter even if I was using the pre-installed widgets.  Probably got fixed with the update, I don't know but I didn't experience any stutters.  Zoom in and out is smooth.  Chrome did not give me a problem.  I also have Dolphin.  Works the same to me, so I just choose the browser I feel like on a given day.Love the remote function...have tried it on 2 TVs...one an old LCD Mitsubishi model...paired easy but it loses connection.  The other one is a plasma tv from Panasonic (4 years old), Comcast cable box, audio receiver (8 years old) and it paired well and up to this day, I can still use it as a remote.  I paired it without telling my roommates so it kinda spooked them some when I controlled the tv and cable box without them knowing it was me from several minutes and they thought something is wrong. LOLThe Bravia Engine is fabulous! It just works wonderfully for me! Go to display settings and configure it to your preference...it is more than satisfactory viewing :-)  I love it!Wifi connection is not a problem this time for me.  With the ASUS Prime, I CANNOT watch Netflix,check my email, twitter and FB coz the ASUS wifi reception just can't handle the distance of the router to my bedroom (second floor with lots of walls and doors along the way).  There were some reviews that say Sony Tablet Z can have wifi problems...well I am just so happy I CAN now watch Netflix, browse, check social connections, download in the comfort of my bedroom. FAST! Smooth! No buffering! Wifi indicator swings from 1 to 2 bars when I am in my bedroom, but I have no problems, it does not stutter or buffer.Camera? meh... don't expect too much.  In broad daylight it is good...great pictures. Not a techy person about camera, but I am happy with the way it captures the colors of the flowers in my garden.  Low light...now that is where you just cant win.  Videos? its okay...not gonna be using it much but when I can and its outdoors...its ok.  It can work for me.  If Sony can fix the low light with an update or something, that would be awesome! But camera isn't why I got a tablet, and I don't take pictures or video wit the tablet...occassionaly yes, I do but mostly outdoors.  I feel awkward pointing a tablet at something really ;-p  Its just me.  You can complain about it if you want. :-)Apps? Not as few as some would let you know.  There's a lot.  Just go search.  MOst major apps found in appstore can be found in playstore. I see no difference when I compare with my friend's IPAD. What do I have? I have picture editors: cymera, piccollage, befunky, instagram; News aggregators: Feedly, Appy Geek, Flipboard, Rockmelt, Pocket, news360, NPR News, Drippler; Ebooks app: Overdrive, Kindle, MangaSearcher; Entertainment app: Netflix, Crackle, Animania, Xfinity player, Youtube; Radio app: STitcher, songza, NPR's Wait wait don't tell, NPR Public Radio; Printer app: CamScanner HD, CloudPrint, Canon EPP; email clients; browsers: chrome, dolphin and photon, Google apps: simple games: candy crush, words with friends, subway surfer, sodoku free, royal revolt, chess, backgammon, minion rush, fast racing, pool mania; social app: Plume, Tweetcaster, FB, Skype, Line chat; Utilities: Trust GO antivirus, airdroid, waze, yelp, ziplist. Some widgets running, calendars, weather, clock and a few more... so if you still need more than these...go ahead, search for it and install.  Playstore is not lacking in apps or widgets.I love the fact I can read my ebook and songza or the music player plays something in the background. My roommate who owns an IPAD was so jealous ;-pThe tablet is nice to hold...the lightness and thinness makes reading your ebook a bliss! I read holding it with one hand and my hand don't get tired easy.  I wish I am not so protective of it tho. But I am, so I got a screen protector (it does have a very thin anti-shatter film already) from SONY to just lessen the fingerprint.  It is a fingerprint magnet...just like every tablet out there. It does not feel fragile because its way thin but the lightness just makes me nervous about dropping it ;-p  I just love carrying  it around.  So I bought a case a cheap one until  I find one that truly shows off its thinness but covers it just the same without gouging your pocket. The one Sony sells is pretty expensive...I can buy a cradle and a screen protector with the price. Besides with the cradle (yes I got one), I will need the case only when I bring it outside of the house.Charging time does not take a long time (I guess depends on how long you use it and for what)...try conditioning your battery. I let it drain to as low as 2% twice and fully charge it. Put it on smart mode, and I believe that helped me get my tablet thru the day and often, beyond a day.  I use my tablet at interval times...but it does make me use my laptop less.  I don't sit and use my tablet for 8 hours straight or even 6 hours...(2-3 hours straight is the most i could do and then just come back to it whenever I get a notice for email, FB, twitter feeds, then listen to anything new, read again, watch, I go pretty much back and forth, just not nonstop use) so I pretty much have a lot leftover as the day ends and I can still have lots to spare for bedtime tablet fun.  I usually charge only at night, sometimes, I don't even need to. I like reading the news, listening to the radio apps, check on my emails and social media apps several times within the day.  I do read ebooks and watch some movies as I work on my laptop. I watch more than one movie on Netflix as I work.  With the cradle, charging time is much better, takes a lot less time to do it.  So yeah, get a cradle if you want to. It does help with the charging time.  You sure can use your tablet while its charging.  It wont drain it, and it doesn't stop charging it just coz you are using. I observed it, when I started to charge it when it got down to 10%, and it did charge...not as fast but it does move...very slow, at 1% every 10 minutes (rough estimate). I was watching Netflix, other times I was playing my simple games.Bluetooth works pretty well too! I have the hdmx jam portable speaker and it rocks well with it. :-)  But like I said, I am happy with the sound from the tablet.  And Airdroid app pretty much makes file transfer/deletion a breeze. No Bluetooth, wires or cords needed, its fast. It connects well with my pc too if I needed it to.NO I haven't dunked it in water...but I have tried washing it when the fingerprints gets too much. I wash it while its ON and while its OFF...it works fine after each washing :-) Just make sure all ports are closed!!!I got the 16GB. Yeah pretty small storage, but after installing all that app and putting like 100 music files and 4 movie in MP4 format...I still have 6.6GB left. Pretty small, yes....but all I  have to do is get a microSD card and I wont feel the limited storage :-) I haven't gotten an sd card, I don't feel I need one despite the small storage space left.  NOt worried about it. Im not a file keeper. And I really don't need music files unless I am in an area without internet and cant use Songza or Netflix for entertainment.Overall, I am so so sooooooo glad to have this tablet.  Don't think of it as an IPAD killer.  But it does shine, looks beautiful, feels good to hold and works really great! And yes, it can stand with the best of the best tablets out there now. Sony did finally get it right...not get it perfect (coz there is no such thing).Should you buy one? Its a personal choice. But I will not hesitate to encourage you. Its a great tablet! I love it! When I was shopping around for a replacement tablet for my ASUS Prime that just died on me despite my babying it, I was looking at Nexus 10, Ipad, Galaxy Note 10.1, windows Rt and lastly, Sony Tablet Z. But when I saw the Tablet z in person, and held it and played with it in the store, I was hooked. Its it for me. Not because the others suck or is not better than Sony Tablet Z.

I kind of just can't stop touching it. It's super-thin, very light, and is regally handsome. I'm not willing to test the \"3 feet of water for 30 minutes\" pledge, but it is very nice to take this into the kitchen without sweating bullets over protecting it. The matte plastic on the back is a smudge magnet, but it is an easy thing now to just get it a bit wet and wipe it down.The screen, which is 1080p (plus a bit more for Android's soft buttons) is really a joy to view. No, it's not an IPS or an AMOLED display. But the black levels are terrific, the colors pop, and both video and photography look great. It gets bright enough to compete with natural light.The battery management really impresses me. We have an Acer Iconia A500, which is an early Tegra2 Android tablet. I feel like that thing just leaks energy out into the universe, at least 5-10% per night even with nothing turned on. The Z has \"STAMINA Mode,\" which automatically toggles WiFi and background updates off when the screen is off. When it estimates 9 days of standby time, I believe it. I had it off the charger for a good 8 hours and it was still at 100% battery. Watching Netflix in HD with the screen set to auto-brightness seems to deplete only about 1 or 2% per 30 minutes.The audio gets pretty loud and stays mostly clear. Netflix sounded great.The unit charges via Micro USB. I am not a lover of this connector, as I find it gets loose over time. No problems yet, however. Charging is rather slow, taking more than several hours to top off.The quad-core Qualcomm system-on-a-chip seems beefy enough to handle everything. Tasks that positively chugged on our Acer A500 are now quick and light. Scrolling between pages is a breeze. Games run very fast (I play The Pinball Arcade, which can tax older Tegra systems). About the only thing that seems slow is the page drawing on Chrome, but I hear there are workarounds, not to mention other browsers.WiFi has not been a problem for me at all. We have an Asus Dark Knight router which JUST reaches into our dining room (long condo, many walls). The Z locked onto it and I could stream HD-ish Netflix with only minimal hitches. It does better than our phones, not quite as well as our laptops, in this regard.SOFTWARESony puts its own skin over Android 4.1.2. Before you cringe too much, it's actually useful. You get \"small apps\" that run over whatever else you're doing, and there is a dock along the top for 4 frequently used programs (Kind of like Windows 7 and 8 desktops). There are some included Sony programs for music, photo, and movie viewing, but they are easily dismissed from the front page and you can use Google's own stuff.The included Remote Control program is marvelous. It uses the IR blaster along the top edge to be a universal remote for any and all home theater gear. It works with all brands, and it is easy to program macros to achieve any task )e.g. watch a blu-ray, watch TV, change inputs, whatever) which is a real boon to those who might be annoyed by techie stuff like that.The other thing you absolutely MUST get is Sony's SideView program. It is an interactive TV guide that works in tandem with the remote. It delivers an accurate program listing as well as a Netflix-like visual display of current programs. You can select a program to watch (or flick it towards the screen) and the IR blaster will do the rest for you, changing the channel. Really cool.VALUEI think Sony should be pricing this about a hundred bones cheaper than it is. That would put it more squarely in line with the competition (Google's Nexus 10, made by Samsung). If you pay full price, you know you're getting a top of the line Android tablet with design that will make people ooh and aah. But I really do think Sony is putting themselves in a tough to justify realm with this price.CONCLUSIONAll in all, this device has made me a believer in tablets as consumption devices. It will still never replace a laptop for me (interface, storage, and legacy programs are too important to me). But as an entertainment device, I am impressed. It is a very good universal remote and TV accoutrement. It is a very good media streamer. It plays games really well. It has great battery life and a build quality that is both beautiful and trust-inspiring. If Sony cut the price, they would sell truckloads of these things. As it is, it's the Android tablet that can really give people a feeling of tech lust on a par with an iPad.UPDATEI have raised the rating of this to 5 stars, given the price cut - exactly the amount I advocate above.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible Tablet.

It feels very light, have no issues holding it in one hand, and the metallic body is just awesome. It is ultra-thin as well and really, as far as looks, feel and weight goes, there is nothing in the market comparable with this.  The ports are covered, which is there ofcourse to waterproof it, but I personally have no issues with this.Screen: The screen is really nice, its resolution may not be as high as Nexus 10, but one hardly feels the difference. I did feel that the contrast wasn;t right and there was no way I could change it. It felt as if the videos had slightly yellowish reddish tone to them but it might have been an isolated issue since none of the reviews mention it.Battery Life; 6 hours aprox on wifi and streaming, no issues. Was very satisfactory for me, but then it depends on what your target is really.Sound: Sound is also very nice, I wasnt expecting it to wake the neighbors up, but I do think it is pretty loud and one should have no issues with it. The speakers are side facing, only front facing could have made it better.The TV remote is a nice feature, for those who intend to use it.Problems:After 12 days of use, the wifi started acting up. It would randomly disconnect from my network and would not reconnect until I turned the wifi off and then back on again. At first it happened a couple of times a  day, but then it got toa  point where it happened every 10 mins, which became unbearable. I have only found 2 other reviews to have this issue, so it is rare, but quite possible.Screen contrast (read the 2nd para)No HDMI output. (This was a deal breaker for me, but might not be important for other people).All in all, its a great tablet, but the wifi issue, and lack of hdmi were the problems for me. If hdmi is not a concern and you are looking for something light and sturdy, waterproof on the go, this is excellent!", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect tablet for eyes but remove screen Protector: A different kind of review; Found a perfect sleeve/case combo(updated 9/17)", "Author": "Ashley D \"Silk\"", "ReviewID": "R2BRZQOXPV3U2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Updated Oct 7th for available cases see at end)All of the other reviews are spot on: the best tablet currently available.(but remove the stupid clear screen protector that is pre-installed and useless -it will not remove Sony logo(is a myth), just remove it slowly as you would with any ptotector on a large screen. Trust me, it will significantly improve clarity,glare and reduce smudges. No other vendor I know does this with such a screen.Put your own protector on if you must, but remove the pre-installed one since it will get marked and scratched eventually and you may forget that it exists in the first place. I missed it was even there until I read about it. Made a world of difference when i removed. I NEVER use a screen protector for any Gorilla Glass type display-waste of money when loss of clarity is weighed against glare reduction. Gorilla type glass is its own protection, hence the name Gorilla...)So why repeat what others have said? I want to draw your attention to another benefit, for those of us(in my case middle aged)who have to keep increasing fonts due to our vision. Well the Xperia Tablet with the Sony screen clarity and portrait friendly aspect, cannot be beaten by ANY tablet, even the Ipad retina 4.A bold statement some would say...the less charitable however would say its damned foolish...or even inaccurate. Why? Because it has a lower screen resolution than the ipad or Nexus 10? True. But better specs do not necessarily mean clearer visibility. The hardware and software of the tablet has to support the screen resolution. Just because the tablet is capable of that screen resolution, does not mean that it actually achieves it. Don't get me wrong...both the Nexus 10 and Ipad retina have brilliant screen resolution, but the Xperia, to me anyway, is just as good to my naked aging eye. But 'just as good ' is not better. Sony's screen technology and software makes the difference in clarity. I find that with the ipad 4 the text doesn't look right . I would probably much prefer the retina display on the forthcoming ipad mini actually. I think the retina type displays on larger devices make the type look too bold somehow-that is the best i can describe it.There is a big difference between clear text that is easy on the eye and text that is just too crisp. Sony has the best screen technology ever-it is what they are the best at,IMHO. Their use of contrast,saturation and light, makes all the difference.But, and there is a but, i did not feel that way about  18 months ago and loved the Retina 4(though not the limited Apple Ecosystem, lack of widgets,customization etc): so vision has a major part to play in this.Just something I wanted you to know, especially if you are in your forties and want the best tablet to use for the next few years. This is it.October 7th: I have been using the PDAIR custom Leather sleeve and it is so form fitting that it makes the tablet look even smaller, I swear!It also makes it look even classier if that is possible. Hefty $99.00 price tag though-includes shipping from Hong Kong from PDAIR directly. Worth it to me since the protection is great while taking up little extra space in my man bag :)Sept 16th:I know so many of you do not know how to find a case or a sleeve that does not mess up the awesomeness of this slim light tablet. i found the perfect solution:91)Incipio Feather Case for the Sony Xperia Z Tablet - Obsidian Black (SE-201),which will still allow the Sony to fit inside the:Alchemy Goods Redmond Tablet Sleeve for New iPad and iPad2The sleeve is gorgeous(see my review for that) and has a leathery look to it, classy yet practical,with great protection.

I like the World Clock.All in all Sony has a good tablet here.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Very Nice Android Tablet With Just A Couple Negatives", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R340VZK45D4GSZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far I've been VERY pleased with the hardware. It's as light as my iPad Mini but larger, it's as easy to hold as my iPad mini but again larger, I particularly like the placement of the power and volume buttons something that I've NOT been pleased with on other Android phones and tablets (I'm talking to you Samsung).Performance so far has been solid, fast and smooth. The screen is very nice, but not quite Retina or Nexus level, and there is a very slight tinge of yellow instead of pure white, but the most important quality of this tablet is the fact that its almost impossible to believe that you're holding a complete tablet that includes a high quality display, micro SD card slot, processor, battery, wi-fi and all the other technology into a device so light and so thin.One really nice feature is the infrared transmitter built into the device and the included software which will in fact let you turn the tablet into a remote control for your home theater system. One negative though, it would have been nice if Sony included two infrared transmitters, on the top as well as the side so the tablet could be used in either orientation landscape or portrait to control your home theater devices (and the corresponding functionality in the remote control app to work in either orientation as well). Sound from the unit is loud and clear though of course bass is pretty much lacking as even Sony can't overcome the limitations of moving air through speakers in such a slim device. A larger device could include larger speakers and thus generate more bass but I absolutely believe that Sony has made the right choice creating such a lightweight, slim tablet and if bass suffers so be it.Just a few negatives, it's not running the latest version of Android, it's last year's version but I'm sure an update will correct this fact in time. The skin they use over Android is lightweight and I do appreciate the 4 spaces at the top of the information bar where you can put most frequently used apps available at a tap from any application or screen. The skin also includes a tray of \"mini-apps\" that pop up over other running applications, similar to Mac OS7's desk accessories of days past providing such tools as a calculator, calendar, a mini-web browser and other mini applications. I must admit I've found this functionality underwhelming.I can certainly appreciate the fact that the unit is water-proof to an extent as a benefit when using it in the kitchen while watching your favorite cooking show or catching up on the news or your favorite program. But there is a negative, any ports are covered by a port cover which you must remove to insert head phones, charge the unit, etc. While it's a minimal annoyance most of the time in today's day and age of bluetooth headphones, large capacity micro-SD cards that don't need to be swapped often, etc. it is a huge annoyance that you must remove the port cover to charge the tablet. It was disappointing to learn that the additional-charge companion charging dock which doesn't require you to remove the micro-USB port cover to charge and which I had planned to purchase at the same time as the tablet is back-ordered pretty much everywhere including Sony's store. Once they ship again though, the need to remove a port cover should be infrequent.And finally, again I must praise the general design of the tablet. It's lightweight but sturdy, the button placement for power and volume are ideal, better than any other tablet, speakers are average, not better or not worse than most of the competition, performance is fast and smooth, the built-in infrared controller a significant plus (not available on the Nexus Tablets or iPads) and thus considering all this I believe Sony has put together one of the most impressive tablets on the market today.I'm kind of a gadget hound, I've owned several different tablets, several different phones but even though the Sony carries with it a  premium in cost compared to the competition, you also get more functionality for your money, built-in infrared, remote control software included, water resistant design, and very fast performance so see this purchase as a longer term investment well worth the premium, and with the expectation that this will be the last tablet I buy in the next 3 years.

My phone carrier started considering my Nokia phone a smartphone and wanted to start charging for no additional services. I switched carriers, went with a Google Nexus 4, and combined my phone and iPod to one device. When my wife took over the iPad for work, I started using a Kindle Fire for more than just reading. It has been a relatively smooth transition, and Amazon's Appstore for Android has been a tremendous help for finding new apps. I have considered getting a Kindle Fire HD or an Android tablet but never quite pulled the trigger.This tablet has filled the void and then some. Where the iPad is good, and the Kindle Fire is good, this is excellent. It is incredibly thin and light. The display and the performance are superb. Technically, it is outstanding.I tried the near field communication (NFC). Putting the Nexus next to the Xperia does enable communication but I did not have apps to pass any real data.I would prefer if the Xperia had more clearly identified ports. I am not sure about Sony Select, which appears to be Sony's app store front end. I prefer to stick to Google Play and Amazon's Appstore for Android.As far as IPX7, I tested this in an Endless Pool. It is water tight to at least a couple of feet. It probably could be submerged further but I did not want to push it. The seals are reasonably easy to close but will probably degrade to insufficient for submersion after a number of cycles (I would guess around 50 to 100).The main issue with using this under or near water is the touch screen. It is sensitive under water and water splashes can trigger false readings. I wish it could be disabled. Also, for those interested in streaming, WiFi does not work through water. Videos on an external memory card could be played but the touch screen sensitivity makes it not too practical. So much for watching while swimming but it was a nice idea.The remote control and smart TV connectivity work well. These features seem secondary but turn out to be quite useful. The first part turns the Xperia into a big custom remote. On my LG TV, it only took a few steps to configure. Although it will not replace our universal remote, the functionality and convenience is handy when using it with the WiFi connectivity. This took a few more steps, mostly going into the settings and allowing the Xperia to \"throw\" data to the TV. Once set, I could easily stream data to the TV.

Peterson", "ReviewID": "R184CKC9UZUVOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like:1. Very light. My wrist gets tired holding a ten inch in landscape mode. So the more weight you can save, the better. This one fills the bill. The light weight makes it a viable option over a seven inch tablet.2. Waterproof! This was not my reason for getting it, but it's a nice perk. I've run it under water and it works as advertised. The peace of mind knowing that if I spill a drink I'm not going to ruin my $500 investment is nice.3. Expandable memory. Google doesn't seem to think we should be allowed to use memory cards. They want to force us to use their online storage. This is stupid. What about when I'm somewhere that I don't have wifi or network coverage? What if I don't want my documents stored online? This is why I'm not sold on the Google Nexus line of products.4. Compatibility with peripherals. You can use bluetooth, but for lack of a bluetooth mouse I plugged in a regular one with a USB to micro USB adapter and it worked flawlessly! Using the same adapter you can plug in USB flash drives to transfer data. All tablets and phones should be able to do this. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a full USB port. I have to use an adapter. But since only select few Windows 8 tablets have full size USB ports, I guess I can't complain too much. Don't get your hopes up about plugging in your favorite portable hard drive or dvd drive, though. Tablets don't put out enough power with their small batteries to power these devices.5. Premium quality and feel. Every time I look at it and feel it I'm impressed at its simple elegance. It feels sturdy, yet is very slim and light. Doesn't have a lot of bells and wistles, but it doesn't need them. It just looks and feels good.6. Screen quality. The viewing angles are good, colors vibrant, resolution great. No complaints.7. Stamina mode. With this engaged standby time is greatly enhanced. Put it to sleep and come back to it a day later with hardly any loss of power. Granted, there are apps you can download to do the same thing, but Sony gets props for including something useful like this standard.Dislike:1. Charges slowly. This is unfortunate. It comes with a good speed charger, but other charges don't seem to charge it fast enough. When watching a movie or playing a game the charger can barely keep pace and charging slows to a crawl. I shouldn't have to stop what I'm doing just to allow the device to charge faster.2. Battery life only average. Overall, for such a slim device, I'm surprised it gets the battery life it does. Guess it's a tradeoff for the small package, but it doesn't last a whole day with steady use.3. Lack of dedicated peripherals. Sony needs to offer their own bluetooth keyboard case since other manufacturers aren't stepping up in this area. Peripherals can add so much to a tablet's utility, but there isn't anything available that really seems like it was made for this tablet. The one case I did buy for it is heavy and adds bulk. I don't use it because it detracts from the reason I got it: to have a slim and light tablet. Maybe this is less of a complaint and more of a praise for the product.4. No dedicated micro HDMI port. This seems to be a trend with tablets and phones. In order to cut down on weight and cost they require an MHL adapter to connect to HDMI - essentially making your charging port two ports in one. Not a fan. Keeping an extra adapter that you have to plug in separately is inconvenient. At least it works with the generic MHL adapter I bought. I can't say the same thing for my Galaxy S3 phone which requires a special Samsung brand MHL adapter.5. Product update loses good features. The preinstalled software isn't bad, and the virtual button layout is good. But when you download the newest android update the home, back, and list buttons move from the left bottom of the screen to the middle. Sony, please fix this! One handed use is no longer practical. It was better before. Also, Sony had a nice screen dimming toggle available from the home screen that is no longer there. Sony took the android OS and improved on it, but with the update those features are lost.6. Speaker placement. To its credit, the speakers put out good quality sound and are sufficiently loud. However, the speakers are placed on the sides toward the bottom. When holding in landscape, your hands will cover these speakers. Having to make a conscious effort to uncover the speakers to get the best sound is less than perfect.Overall: Super good if you want something light that feels good in the hand, looks good, and offers unique features you won't find in other tablets. Offers versatile performance with a processor that seems fast enough to accomplish whatever you throw at it and a screen that looks great.

The Sony Z was in the top of several lists I viewed and when it comes to scoring, performance, what really matters it was essentially identical to the other big name, well known, popular tablets. I came to the realization the extra money the Z2 would cost just wasn't worth the minimal upgrades. Sprained my ankle when I decided it was time to pull the trigger since I'd be cooped up for 2-6+ weeks. 4 weeks later I'm using the tablet often enough and loving it. Being an Android device I'm sure everyone should know what to expect in those regards. Just like any Android OS on a smartphone or other tablets. Easy to use, tons of apps, games, etc. The performance is great. It's processor is snappy, HD videos stream and play excellently and using multiple tabs via Chrome web browsing doesn't slow this guy down. Enough can't be said about the display. The picture is great from streaming a Violet copy of a movie to reading an article online the display is excellent, Even the sound is incredible especially when taking into consideration how thin and light this tablet is.

Some of the preloaded apps will need to be updated upon first powering on. The screen holds fingerprints, but maybe I'm particularly greasy. It does easily wipe with a sleeve, though. I'm very impressed by both how sturdy/strong it feels and how light and thin it is. The shape is much sleeker and sexier than an Apple product (I'm typing this on a MacBook Pro, which I love).I have an HDMI MHL adapter for connecting this to my television and I am really happy with how it looks on a tv. I use it as my streaming device for Netflix and Hulu binges and it works very well. The learning curve will be a bit longer for someone coming from using an Apple device (I keep trying to use some of the shortcuts I use on my i-phone), but the software is fairly intuitive overall. When I first opened this from the box and held it in my hand I was alone at home and I let out an audible \"wow.\" I still feel that way about the hardware. This is an impressive tablet. My one real criticism is with the little memory and usb slot covers. Really, Sony? The best y'all could do was to have little plastic pull-off covers? There are small plastic pieces covering the connection places (sd memory, usb/power, headphones) that make you wonder how, with everything else seemingly so well engineered, that they couldn't have come up with a more elegant solution. Still, if you removed them completely you would have Apple's solution to this, so I suppose they get credit for trying.This is a solid tablet.

Major", "ReviewID": "RR1BM0F7X2L01", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet after experimenting with several others, including the older Asus Transformer Pad Infinity (don't buy that) and a few other android tablets. My needs were to get an Android tablet that was 10 inches mostly for reading scientific papers and textbooks for school, with the ability to be a basic media center (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) came as a side bonus. I found all this and more in the tablet, but it will take some explaining as to why. Let's break it down, shall we?Pros:- Looks sexy, extremely lightweight and thin- Waterproof is a bonus that makes you worry a little less about it- Built in Sony skin over Android is (after patching to Jelly Bean) extremely lightweight, very slick, and one of the best skins I've seen- Plenty of processing power for just about anything. I rarely saw stutter or lag even on high-demand games- Screen, while technically not as high resolution as a Nexus 10 or iPad Air, still looks downright phenomenal- Built in apps can mostly be deleted or removed- IR Blaster is handy and the setup intuitive- Bluetoothing a keyboard to it is easy, and when you do it the productivity of this device skyrockets- Double tap to unlock the screen is a brilliant feature that should be on every tablet- Overall, this is an extremely solid android tabletCons:- Price. I was lucky and got mine second hand from a different site for nearly half of what Amazon sells it for, but the standard going rate is still pretty insane for an Android tablet- Hard edges will turn some people off to holding it. A good case can help with that- Screen ratio is more widescreen than the iPad (which is 4:3), meaning holding it in portrait mode is really weird (which is too bad, since that's how I read most of my articles)- Battery life. The most recent firmware update seemed to make it worse. You'll get maybe 6-7 hours of heavy use. Expect to charge it nightly if you are a frequent tablet user.- Android apps are still not being built with tablets in mind, so lots are just stretched out phone apps. This is more the developer's fault than Sony's, but it's worth noting.- Because it's waterproof, anytime you want to plug something into the tablet you have to open a little flap and leave it open. Kind of a pain for heavy headphone users like myself.However, this is the biggest problem post patch: screen flicker. IT seems not all devices are being plagued by it,but I was one of the unlucky ones. When using any app that uses a keyboard, the screen will flicker randomly and spontaneously. This appears to be some sort of issue with how the GPU/CPU rendering goes with their updated keyboard, which is too bad since the keyboard is pretty great. There is currently a hotfix you can use by going into developer tools and disabling a certain feature, but it's been nearly four months and Sony still hasn't patched in a fix. Bad post launch support, guys.All in all, if this tablet were cheaper I'd say the jump to it would be easier. I'm satisfied with the price I paid (Which was about half of what it is on Amazon). However, if you pay a premium price for a product, you expect to get something that works seamlessly and doesn't have any large issues. While this tablet is really, really good, it has too many nagging issues to merit the high pricetag. If you can get one for cheaper then it's great, or if you live on the beach or something and need the water/dust resistance it's a must-have, but beyond that there are better tablets in the price range (the Nexus 10 for Android, and of course the iPad if you're into that ecosystem).", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best in show", "Author": "W.

Read a ton of reviews (here and \"professional\" reviews) and played with a few at the local electronics store.  The Xperia Tablet Z just stood out with it's size, weight, speed, micro SD slot, and screen quality (didn't care about the waterproofing).  Ordered it on Amazon immediately.  First thing I did when I got it was upgrade to Android 4.3.  PROS: High res screen quality, fast processor (very few or no hiccups when swiping home screens, apps load quickly, etc), weight, ability to add a micro SD card, battery life (use it on and off all day and still had plenty of juice left), and customization of the Android interface (when compared to the lack there of in iOS).  Only a couple of CONS: Very slow charging, plastic caps over everything is a little annoying (I know it's for the waterproofing, but they feel like they could break off easily), Chrome browser not as fluid as Safari (more a personal preference than a con), and the Xperia keyboard is a little buggy at times (strange flicker occasionally).

However, I wanted the larger screen and SD card so I went with the Sony.Well, there was a difference in screen quality but it's not the difference I was expecting. The simple fact is, unless you're in to pixel peeping, the Sony display is significantly better, with much truer whites and blacks, a brighter screen (almost too bright on automatic) and overall a much more pleasing color pallet. Typically, I view phrases like \"Full HD Reality Display powered by Mobile Bravia Engine 2\" as little more than marketing hyperbole, but in Sony's defense, whatever they did DEFINITELY makes the display noticeably better.This tablet is very fast, especially impressive because it's using a 32 bit processor.  HD movies look great and while I know some reviews have criticized the speakers, I actually found them quite good with outstanding clarity and decent volume, though lacking in bass. The screen (and accelerometer) is very responsive and accurate and, although I'm not much of a gamer, it should work well with most mobile games. I also understand that the Xperia Z will recognize a Playstation controller, though I haven't tried one.The tablet immediately recognized a 64GB microSD card and read/write speeds are acceptable, about on a par with other class 10 microSD devices. And, mounting a USB drive was as simple as downloading ES File Explorer from Google Play and plugging in an inexpensive adapter (mine was $2.99 on eBay) and drive.The downsides. . .? Well, both the front AND back are fingerprint magnets. I swear fingerprints appear in places BEFORE I touch the screen! The front 8MP camera has decent resolution and color but fairly high noise levels, especially in low light. Some of the problem appears to be in the image processing software; I've seen images from the same Exmor R sensor used in other devices that were significantly better so perhaps a future update may result in improvement.  OTOH, I would never consider using a 10+\" tablet as a camera so it's not much of an issue for me. Finally, the 500ma charger is FAR too small for the tablet and charging can easily take 8 hours from 10% to full charge.  Again, not an issue for me because I already own a 2.1A and 4.0A USB charger that cuts the charge time in half or better but Sony really should have invested a few cents more for a higher output charger.So, am I happy with my purchase? Absolutely, especially because I purchased the 32GB Xperia Z from Amazon's Warehouse Deals in \"Like New\" condition for 25+% less....good job, Amazon!BTW, the water resistance really works.

Having been a fan of SONY product for years, I always love how delicate and beautiful the SONY-style is, and this design style is undoubtedly adopted by Tablet Z.

I find that data transfers from my PC to my tablet will fail intermittently (e.g., can't create folder from PC, file transfer aborts before completing) until I fiddle with the microUSB connector.  In my humble opinion, the microUSB connector is mechanically weak and too easily damaged due to a lack of mechanical support from the body of the tablet. I like the other features of the tablet (after the software updates are completed), but in my opinion the poor microUSB connection is a fatal flaw with this tablet.

Very light and thin.  Chose it because I boycott all Apple products and I liked the waterproof design; we can live at ease even as it is laying surrounded by coffee cups and water glasses.  I will note that the battery life is nothing amazing AND charging time is pretty slow.  I've allowed it to charge overnight and wake to discover it is still hasn't reached 100%.  Battery life will vary depending on the app that you're using; if it kills you phone then expect it to kill the tablet.Other than that it's a sweet tablet with solid performance.  It has a nice feature where different users can be allocated, so you each have your own dedicated \"desktop\".  This allows each user to have their own wallpaper and apps, BUT some system settings carry through to each user; not a very big deal.  The only hindrance is that subsequent users cannot access external memory cards, and there is no way to give administrative rights to anyone else except the owner; that's pretty dumb.As a writer I will say that extended typing on the keyboard can be annoying, since the navigation bar runs along the bottom of the screen; your palm will rest along the bottom and activate the back, home, or menu buttons.  I've emailed Sony and made the suggestion to change the OS layout to correct the issue.  Like I said, it is only an annoyance, I rarely write extended pieces on the touch keyboard, BUT it is very fluid and I can type quite efficiently with it.  If it were not for the OS layout, then I may use it more frequently to write.The waterproof covers can be a pain in the ass to open every time you want to charge it or plug in headphones, so I would opt to purchase the charging cradle.  I don't have it yet, but am looking into it as a future buy.

By contrast, the Xperia is stripped down - lacks the bells and whistles and class leading screen/design/battery life in exchange for being light.I'd place the Xperia a step below the Asus, but I found the power/beauty of the Asus simply lost out to the lightness of the Xperia (I am a power user of my tablets - probably in my hands 12 hours a day, so lightness becomes a top consideration).", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a \"Main\" Tablet brand but a hidden gem instead.", "Author": "Cody", "ReviewID": "RH0VAN9WTRRY7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet trusting the Sony name as easy to use and reliable products.

I'm not counting this against it as it's my fault for not researching this earlier.  * it's laggy -- I understand that this CPU is a QuadCore 1.5 GHZ -- and 1.5 GHZ is sorta slow by modern standards -- however, the UI is laggy + jitters -- I found it physically uncomfortable  * worst of all: with the Xperia Tablet plugged into a micro-usb charger -- I can LOSE CHARGE while using the tablet. Yes, let me repeat this again:  * I'm using the Tablet  * The tablet is plugged in via Microusb. The microusb is connected to a wall outlet (not my computer)  * I'm losing battery charge.

I do not have any Apple products either.  I am not a big video or game user so my comments won't cover that.  My main purposes for buying this tablet were to use when I travel so I could have internet access, read books and load pictures to upload to Facebook.  I wanted something lightweight and well built so I didn't need to take a netbook and kindle all the time.  Since I have no other tablet or similar experience to compare I can only go by what I was looking to accomplish and a comparison with my laptop, netbook and Kindle use.Having said all that I might have given this tablet a 5 star but for a few technical drawbacks.  I used it on a 2 week trip in Scandinavia.  I have listed the Pros and Cons below based on my experience and needs.  Please note that some apps come with Sony and others are free or purchased.  Also I realize there may be some robust apps that could replace the versions available or that I found but the comments are based solely on what I was using or able to acquire before my trip.ProsVery lightweightVery thinSolid constructionNice touchscreen feelGood keyboard and features remember words used and can type quicklyMail app up and running quickly but not robust just basicPicked up wifi easilyKindle app for this works fine but have extra app for rotation stoppage when reading lying downMost features easy to figure out if you are an experienced computer userFile Transfer App works great and easilyDownloading from older camera directly doesn\u2019t work but if you get a travel \"On the Go\" (OTG) connector and use a card reader downloading works fineComes with apps I used immediately like Chrome, Mail, File TransferNice screen clarity and colorsNever had a problem with usage of apps or Android issues.  Windows users will know what I meanConsBattery runs down quickly compared to Kindle.  This is expected but I wouldn't suggest this for primarily a reader then.  I would say with mostly wifi usage it might last 8 to 10 hours.Battery takes overnight to charge.  Seems slow but not a real big issue for me.  This is running it down to about 35%.Flimsy USB coverShiny screen and smears easily.  Carried a screen cloth and worked great after each use.  Prefer matte screen.Few accessories - I did get a carry case and it was nice.  Also tried another that is pretty sad.  See other reviews on those.No user guide and the online one is pretty lacking.Short charger cord difficult to use and charge at same timeAndroid FB app is really bad \u2013 not just this tablet of course but really.Album app (Sony) is not very robustThere are other things that may be good or bad but can't comment on them.  Here are ones I would note.Cameras seem fine but not a big user of that so can't compare.Not a big video or game user so can\u2019t comment.Don\u2019t care about the \u2018waterproof\u2019 feature. Just may help make the construction better in general.Haven\u2019t used Bluetooth but that may work great as well as the NFC feature for future useAs I mentioned I am a sophisticated Windows user but not Android so this overview is from that perspective.

I prefer a 10\" screen because my eyesight isn't the greatest.  I do not find that a 10\" tablet is too cumbersome to carry.  This Sony featherweight tablet makes it even less so.The Sony Xperia Z is an Android based tablet.  Its stand-out features are (1) it is featherweight, (2) it is waterproof, and (3) it can function as your remote control.  The Xperia Z's competition is the Nexus 10.  Other 10\" tablets are the iPad 4 and Surface RT (iPad 5 is not out yet & the Surface Pro is more laptop than tablet, IMO).The Sony Xperia Z has a rich, vibrant screen.  It has a wide 1\" bezel and the actual screen size is 10\".  It has a rubberized, soft touch back, a rear & front facing camera, 2 speakers, a SD card slot & the ability to insert a micro USB (but the slot also used for charging).  The screen is nicely touch sensitive & Sony gives you the ability to customize your five start screens.  Tablet status information is in the bottom right corner, so you always know how much battery life, wifi status, and time.  On the bottom left corner is page back, hom, and list view.  Bottom middle are quick view of selected apps and the remote control app.The Xperia is not without its annoyances:1. While it is wonderful that the tablet is waterproof, the openings are a little difficult to open & I have a tendency to want to pull at the speaker rather than the slot hinge.2.  The USB slot is a micro USB slot & is also used for charging.3. As a non-Android user, I would prefer to have all of my preferences on my 1st start screen rather than scrolling through 5 start screens.4. So far, no great covers for the tablet & no covers that also have keypads.5. The screen doesn't change from portrait to landscape with you.6. It is more of an entertainment device than a business use device.  The office suites app is mediocre.7. The back is rubberized plastic, not metal, so I wonder about the durability.Overall, even though I am not a current Android user & had to teach myself how to navigate the Sony Xperia Z, I really like it.  It has a nice, vibrant screen, decent sound, decent front/back cameras (not good enough to swap out my real camera), easily connects to wifi & is super light.  While it can't be used for my business needs (the Surface RT can), and doesn't have a keyboard cover (would love this feature), it is a great tablet to carry around and use for on-the-go & for traveling.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A winner from Sony", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R12X2T1C071M5I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome tablet - with a super quick quad core 1.5GHz processor, gorgeous HD display (1920x1200), responsive touchscreen, microSD support, Wifi 5GHz, Bluetooth, capped off with a decent battery life (about 7-8 hours.)Usability is also excellent - especially when coupled with the excellent Android JellyBean 4.1.With that out of the way, let me focus on the loss of that final star.1. The edges on this tablet are mostly plastic. I accidentally dropped the table on to my table top, it caught the worst angle, and cracked the plastic speaker grille cover.2. The waterproofing design makes its charging port and MicroSD slot a nightmare to access - especially if you have short fingernails. Try it for yourself to see if this might be a long term annoyance.3. Its highly reflective bezel makes every speck of dust clearly visible. This is very distracting to my peripheral vision, especially in such proximity to the supremely gorgeous display.Overall, Sony has a winner with this high performing and attractive Android tablet. Its strengths cancel out any of its minor design annoyances, and so far I'm a very happy camper - resulting in a 4-star \"I like it!\" rating.If you are looking for a case - I'd recommend the budget MoKo Slim Cover Case. This is a functional and usable case, but adheres to the You Get What You Pay For rule when it comes to overall finish.

I haven't tried the remote functionality, but it has a spot on the bezel that if you touch it, it brings up a remote to use with the TV.The screen is beautiful, on a par with the newer ipad screens.  The thin and light form factor is great, and the tablet is easy to hold in your hand. It's not too heavy to use for reading a book.One small nit is that the waterproofing requires the charger connector to be covered.  The cover is hard to open and attaches via a small connecting piece. This will surely break before too long.So why don't I give this five stars?  Well it is pricey.  I got a B&N; Nook 9 inches for less than $200.  It's a really nice tablet.  This Sony is definitely better.  It has features, like a camera and a faster processor that make it work more than the Nook.  But not $300 better.  This Sony tablet is the best Android tablet I've tried to date.

It is the thinnest and lightest 10\" tablet that I have seen to date - iPads included.  It follows the design of most Android devices in having a matte plastic back and nice rounded corners.  Users will find the headphone, micro SD, and micro USB ports hard to open unless you look in good light for the slot for your fingernail to pry them open.  The fit is snug, but this is required for the dust and water resistant design to hold up.  Don't expect the water resistant claims to hold up if you have one of these compartments open!  The only things I don't like on the design are the power and volume buttons.  The power button is small and stiff, and it gives no haptic feedback that the device has turned on.  Wait for the blue light next to the power button to flash.  The volume rocker is harsh, hard plastic that just feels out of place on a high-end device.  It does have the tactile advantage of being easy to use without looking, but this is a small concession.Setup:  Getting up and running with the Sony Xperia Z is super easy - especially if you have used other Android devices.  The main thing you will want to do is look at the diagram to find where the various ports are located and how to open them.  Once you do that, plug it in for the stated minimum of 30 minutes or until the charging light turns from yellow to green.  I did the latter, and it took about 2 hours.  After you charge the device, fire it up and enter your wireless information and Google account.  There is a small update that I recommend you download and install before getting started.  Now you are ready to rock and roll.  I should also note that the Xperia Z boots faster (average of 25 seconds) than any other Android device I've had - phones and tablets included.Media Usage:  The display on the Xperia Z is a sight to behold - capable of true 1080p playback with rich, warm colors.  When you combine this with 9 hours of battery life, you have a device that begs to play your favorite video content.  If you plan to download content for use on an airplane, I recommend adding a micro SD card since the onboard storage is a bit puny at 16 GB.  I watched videos on Netflix, Crackle, Watch ESPN, and YouTube, and the playback is outstanding with one small gripe.  When starting up a streaming video, the picture is very pixelated much like the early days of digital cable.  This smooths out once it buffers enough data, and the picture stays crisp from that point on.  The throne room scene at the beginning of Thor is nothing short of stunning.  One other thing I noticed was that navigation of the Netflix UI when selecting a video to watch is very choppy.  I believe this may be an issue with the Netflix Android app because I have observed it on other Android tablets as well.  Be that as it may, it is still disappointing to experience it on a high-end device.  It makes it feel like a cheap knockoff tablet rather than a premium device.  Make no mistake about it.  This is priced as a high-end device.Music Playback:  Just as you would expect videos to pop, sound quality on the Xperia Z also excels.  Without headphones, the four speakers produce a nice overall sound; however, bass is lacking.  When I say that, it is lacking to the point of being unbalanced in its lacking.  K'Naan's \"ABCs\" had no detectable bass line at all.  This changes altogether when I plugged in my Monster Diesel Vektr headphones.  The sound quality is every bit as good (if not better) than what my HTC Rezound produces.  Sound on streaming music and local storage is both outstanding.Gaming:  I'm not the world's biggest gamer, but I found the experience to be better than any of the other tablets I've used.  Plasma Sky was smooth with good sound quality.  I don't own any of the higher end games that would stress the processor, and thus, I cannot speak to its performance there.Universal Remote:  This is a unique feature that I haven't seen on other Android tablets.  I was able to follow the setup steps and add my LG TV and Blu-Ray player, Cisco Cable Box, and Roku with no issues.  The interface also lets you create macros to setup different activities and transitions.  The one thing missing is the Logitech Harmony functionality of knowing how to automatically transition between activities and devices at the touch of a button.  However, as a free add-on, the functionality is more than adequate.  This feature is potentially good enough to justify some of the higher cost if you do not already have something like a Harmony remote.Connectivity:  I had no issues setting up or staying connected to my WPA-2 protected Wi-Fi with a hidden SSID.  My experience was similar at work with our 802.1x user authenticated Wi-Fi.  I was also able to connect my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and use it without any issues.  It performed as expected based on other tablets I've used.  I own Touchdown for Exchange, and I connected to my e-mail without issue.  This is somewhat of a tangent, but I highly recommend a third party e-mail app for connecting to Exchange if your company has the security PIN functionality turned on.  This limits the PIN scope and data wipe to the third party app rather than your entire device.  I don't want to have to enter a PIN every time I unlock my device even if I'm not accessing my corporate data.  Back to the Xperia - Gmail also works as expected.Complaints:  All is not positive with the Sony Xperia Z.  While battery life is good, charging time leaves something to be desired.  My rough benchmarks are about 20% battery charge per hour putting it at 5 full hours to charge after a full drain.  I work around this by dropping it on the charger anytime I put it down with 50% power or less remaining.  In addition, the browser experience on Chrome is on the lackluster side.  This is not unique to the Xperia Z as I find it underwhelming on every Android device - even the Silk accelerated browser on the Kindle Fire.  The response can also be a bit wonky as an attempted clicking on a link often results in zooming instead.  When you throw in the lack of Flash support, it makes me long for a \"real\" computer.  Then, Sony went over the top with bloatware.  They include a myriad of their music and video products along with a couple of alternate app/game stores.  The nice thing about Android 4.0 and above is that you can disable these apps so that they don't show up, but you need to root your device in order to remove them.  Finally, there are few choices in the way of cases.  The only one that looks worthwhile comes from Sony at a retail price of $79.  Amazon has a few, but my trusty standby brand Targus does not have one.  In the end, none of these is a showstopper, and they are on par with other Android tablets.  I guess I'm just holding out hope that someone will buck the trend of annoying users and taking up space with useless junk.Conclusion:  The Sony Xperia Z is an excellent media consumption tablet with a nice extra in its universal remote software.  It is a bit pricy and skimpy on storage, but the performance is better than average.

If you have had experience with an iPad or Samsung tablets, this tablet will only disappoint you. All of the \"connectors\" ie. charger, Sim card, SD card are all difficult to access and I suspect over time, they will break off.  Also, with only 30 minute use, there are fingerprints all over the screen, compared to others.

The layout was simple. However, it takes awhile to turn on and off. For me, after 2 weeks of having it, it began to randomly blink and the text would become condensed and elongated while spazzing out during web browsing. The bluetooth tends to disconnect with the keyboard.  All of this would be fixed after rebooting it but it would occur again after a few hours. I had a replacement for it and it still had the same issues. Also,  the replacement tend to lag slightly. In the end, I had to return it and got a refund. I would have given this a 5 star if it hadn't been for the defects.

It's lightweight, it has excellent battery life, and the screen is to die for!  Plus there is a memory card slot, so basically it has unlimited storage.  Really it's the nicest tablet I have seen, from a pure hardware perspective.My single issue has to do with the operating system, and yes I know it's not really fair to deduct a star based on the operating system, but from the perspective of the end user, the tablet and its operating system are one and the same.So, as a longtime iPad user (and owner of a Kindle Fire), I will try to post an 'end user' review.Firstly the issue of storage is a big one that has always annoyed me about the iPad.  As I discovered myself just last week, while sitting 3 hours on the tarmac in a plane waiting for takeoff clearance for a 4 hour flight, it is important for a tablet to carry plenty of movies and videos.  Apple's absolute refusal to add a memory card slot to iPad limits the amount of video it can carry.I thought the problem would be solved with this new Sony tablet, and indeed the storage is pretty much unlimited.  However the ability to find and download movies and videos is a problem.  My usual sources are Amazon's own video service (which has an iPad app for downloading), and iTunes.  You can forget both of those for this Android tablet.  Apple's DRM protection makes downloading to Android a non-starter, and Amazon has so far not produced an Android app that will allow its video service to download to anything but a Kindle Fire.  Netflix and Hulu work wonderfully on the tablet, but at 35,000 feet streaming video isn't happening.  It does come with Google Play, and I believe you can download from that, but I have a large collection of videos in various clouds that will work in the iPad and not on Android.  If you want to carry your own copy of a movie, you will have to buy the DVD and rip it yourself, or buy a DVD that has a digital copy included.  Both work fine on Android and look great on this tablet.It's sad that a clear winner in the tablet market (like this Sony) is marred by the draconian policies of other retail/media giants, but there it is.That being said, if you use and like Android, this is the tablet for you.  And it's water-resistant.  In theory you could drop it in the pool and it would survive.

If it isn't in the cookbook, they don't have the brain power to resolve.  The last straw for me was being given notice the I would have to repair the software (after loading droid 4.2.2 JB, via PC tethering).  Of course the software repair process reloads the same 4.2.2 JB.  The real kicker was the instructions received in e-mail telling me that is a failure occurred to proceed to step 12 of which none existed in the document.  The product is flimsy, the micro USB port is proprietary, the unit is slow to respond, it wouldn't connect to wifi, Sony support blows.

The other issue I could not get around was all of the covers for port access. I know they are there for the water proofing but they were annoying. For those reasons I returned the tablet.
