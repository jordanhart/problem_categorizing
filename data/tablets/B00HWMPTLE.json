{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow.. Giant Tablet, Laptop replacement.", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1NQ4BX08PQPO7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A 12.2\" tablet! Really. The first expression will be of gasp. Wide open mouth. But this is reality. Let us compare the PRO lines from Samsung. I will first compare the TabPROs briefly, and then give a crisp overview of the popular Tablets in market now. Then I will do in depth into the current tablet itself. This will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision. I am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which suits you. If you have any questions, do ask in the forum and I will respond within a day. The three Galaxy TabPROs and the single Galaxy NotePRO differ only in size, and little bit in specs; they are functionally identical in all respects.The single most fascinating part of the TabPRO and NotePRO lines is the resolution. Astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines which means on 8.4\" has the maximum ppi and excellent look. In comparison last year's Tabs have much lower resolution. I personally think this 12.2\" is heavy for personal purposes. Weight+Cost was the primary reason for my rating at 4 stars. For this price you can get a full blown laptop. I got it for work purpose, using with bluetooth keyboard and for personal purpose I will suggest the super gorgeous 10\" or 8.4\" tablet.COMPARISONS GALORE:key_specs: { model: resolution, ppi, CPU, RAM, Flash memory, SD_card, camera spec, weight, OS_type, size, charging/sync port type, GPS:y/n }Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 8.4-Inch {B,W},  WQXGA 2560 x 1600, 359 ppi, 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 331 gm, Android 4.4 Kit Kat OS, 8.62 x 5.06 x 0.28 in, microUSB, GPS yes.  4800 mAh battery (the very best resolution on a tablet!)Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 10.1 {B, W}, WQXGA  2560x1600, 298 ppi, Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 469 gm, Android 4.4 KitKat, 9.57 x 6.75 x 0.29 in, microUSB, GPS: y, 8,200mAh batteryWow, a 12.2\" tablet now!

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help, I have used several tablets over years!RESOLUTION:Good to see tablets coming straight out with Android v4.4 (KitKat). The resolution of WQXGA 2560 x 1600, and has a pixel density of 247 ppi. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read text very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app, and they are super sharp. Resolution will blow you away.  This new Multi-Window UI that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously, each in its dedicated window. 12.2\" is great for pdf, books and magazines.PROCESSING POWER:Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 3 GB RAM. Very powerful indeed! I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool. Notepro is truly professional in nature.  This tablet is touted as Enterprise-Ready and has Corporate E-mail/Calendar/Contact; Microsoft\u00ae Office-compatible; Mobile Device Management; On-Device Encryption (ODE); Preloaded WebEX; Remote PC and E-Meeting Apps; Virtual Private Network.  It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any market in the US and other countries. All these apps are available in your other device. Yes, you have it in your laptop!STORAGE:Notepro comes in 32/64 GB configurations.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a camera is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12\" tablets.  I personally don't use back cameras as much on 10\"+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to say of cameras, they just work for the required purpose. Front camera is good for skype and business meetings.ERGONOMICS:I personally like 8\" for home uses, but  at 12\"+ this is truly a laptop replacement. I really wonder if this will have a market, but it is an experiment from Samsung. At 748 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  This is 1.65 pounds. Still less weight than laptops. For example, 11\" MacBook Air weighs 2.38 pounds. Size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.33 in. The battery is 9500mAh and should come  for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp. Being a geek, I love this form factor.SOUND:Excellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISC:This is the only tablet I could see in Samsung's lineup with microUSB 3.0 port with backwards compatibility with microUSB 2.0. I tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band is really state of the art. 802.11ac is blazing fast!Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Also has infrared which can be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.Obviously the S-Pen is the one that differentiates this Notepro from others. S Note docs, S Planner makes it so easy to organize with S-Pen. Also this has NFC  as well as Ethernet connectivity via adapter.  I really doubt if people will use ethernet connectivity when wifi is used everywhere. I really wonder what is the use case.APP POWER:I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I use Pulse and the integration with it as well as Weight machine is very good.23andMe app (I love their reports)Aldiko Book Reader Premium (absolutely love it, many libraries have magazines for checkout)Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroid Central app (great and must have for Android users)Androidify (kids love it)Angry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt Car gameBattery Monitor Widget Pro (a great app)BeyondPod (use it daily!)BoxChromeCNET TVDictionary M-W PremiumNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)TOM TOM app (has some advantages over NAVIGON)Google Navigation/Earth/Maps using a portable MiFi boxGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Google Keep/Keyboard/Drive/Search/Books/Voice/HangoutsEbayFlipboardLinkedinGoogle Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)Tapatalk HD (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & AudiobooksMicrosoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for AndroidTwit.TvSkypeRealCalc Plus (Awesome calculator app)Wolfram AlphaZillowPlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the reviews cannot do full justice.

The 12.2 Note Pro has received a high percentage of positive reviews on Amazon and other sites. Most professional reviewers, on the other hand, seem to think it's just too big, too heavy, too expensive, or it's just not an Ipad. Fortunately for me I've learned to take professional reviewers with a huge grain of salt. Thanks to reviews from real users on Amazon and balanced reviewers like Lisa Gade from Mobile Tech  Review I was able to take the plunge when the Note Pro went on sale.And I love my Big Ass Tablet (BAT)! I wasn't sure I could use that word in my review, but I did a search on Amazon and found out they sell this Liquid Ass So I guess it's okay.I've owned two 7\" tablets, two 10.1\" tablets, and I recently bought the Samsung Tab Pro 8.4\". The 7\" were good for portability outside the home, while the 10.1\" were good for couch surfing. I thought the 8.4\" would be a good compromise between the two that I could use for both, and consolidate down to one size. However, after using the 8.4\" for about a month I discovered my eyes aren't up to looking at a small screen for several hours at a time (reading/web surfing on the couch is my favorite past-time). The 8.4\" has great resolution, but text is still small and zooming in just means you have to scroll a lot. However, it is great for portability outside the home, and I will keep it for that.The 12.2\" offers no compromise web browsing and document reading. Rarely do I feel the need to zoom in. I'm also addicted to the S-pen. Love to use it for navigating my tablet, and I also prefer to write with the pen then use the onscreen keyboard. I guess it's Samsung tablets for me, until the competition catches up and produces something better.Some people might complain that the tablet is too heavy for couch surfing. I've solved this problem by modifying the Aerb case I got for the tablet Aerb\u00ae X Pro Series Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Leather Case Cover Stand W Sleep Wake Function (for Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, Black Style A) By folding the cover of the case and securing it with four small binding clips I can use the case to prop up the tablet while lying on the couch or in bed. Weight becomes a non-issue and I only need to lightly grasp the tablet with one hand to keep it from tipping over. I've included some pictures to show you how I modified the case, for those that are interested (see the user supplied picture area of this product's web page).So far I'm completely satisfied with this tablet. My only complaint is the price. Wish it was more like $600.Even so, I'm livin' large and lovin' it! I hope Samsung keeps making this size tablet. It's ideal for my use.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hello Android And Samsung Goodbye IOS and Apple", "Author": "Honest Abe", "ReviewID": "RD4VYQM7K6H5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an early tablet adopter Using the first generation iPad I have been waiting for Apple to get its act together and improve the IPad. This has not happened, Oh sure they made it thinner, weigh less,upgraded the hardware, gave it a bells screen, they even made it smaller.SO what??? Apple failed to make the Ipad better in all the ways that Count. Apple also has foiled to make the Ipad in the size needed most 12 inches.Sounds like I am Apple bashing right?Wrong! I have been patiently waiting for Apple to make the Ipad everything this tablet is. Apple has been stubbornly doing whatever it pleases with the attitude that the Customer Can take it or leave it.I agree with Apple so I have left them.While Apple has been busy being Cheaper on there products and Charging more for them while becoming even more restrictive if that were possible, others have been improving their Operating Systems & Hardware.Microsoft has proven Abjectly Clueless when it comes to mobile operating systems and did not offer me a real choice regardless of which manufactures were loading there hardware with Microsoft terrible offerings.Reluctantly as I began to suspect I had only one option left and that was to look at the Android Operating System.Make no mistake I detest Googles desire to destroy privacy, and this is the one thing that prevented me from looking at Android offerings to begin with. Then I thought about it some more and decided who really knows what Microsoft and Apple Are really collecting anyway?There is allot of crapware that comes loaded on this tablet trying to get you to give up give up your privacy for the right to use their application. Some of it also in addition to compromising your privacy wants you to Pay to use it.Unfortunately these are also in addition to compromising your privacy wanting you to Pay to use it.Unfortunately these are Apps touted to make the tablet more appealing.My solution was simple I uninstalled them!When setting up the tablet I also did not Use my Google Account.Oh I did the first time And realized they were following the heck out of everything and there was no way to turn it off.I just about contacted Amazon for a refund until it came to me to restore the device factory settings in settings.After I did that I discovered I could set up the tablet without using my Google account and getting it so embedded into everything.Now I could pick and Choose my privacy options with apps and yes even Google.At the end of the day though it is more about retaining the right to privacy than tinfoil hat reasoning.This tablet is remarkable it is fast, it is responsive, it is the perfect size for viewing magazines, web pages, Video, and working with spreadsheets, documents,reading PDF's or books even Via my kindle library.The screen is chez easy to read text on.By the way this entire review was written YES WRITTEN Using the included pen. Trust me no one writes this long yen review this way unless it works really well. Due to lock of use my penmanship has suffered yet this tablet translates perfectly and I see my penmanship actually improving as I write.A feature lacking in other brands of tablets is the ability to clear the Clipboard Samsung as Android has added this feature to the keyboard first hold down the button that symbolizes the Choices of input to sets it.Samsungs free office suite is just like working with Microsoft office.Extra memory can he added using inexpensive Mico SD Cards .USB Flash drives can be attached with a cable to read and transfer too, These are a huge features cheap, overpriced stubborn Apple has foiled to include.Yes I am dissapointed and over it with Apple.There are more features of course but this review is getting to long.Bottom time it is a perfect device or at least as close as we can get to one as of now.Im glad I bought this and do not think anyone will regret the purchase if they get one.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R2FTIWXBHORN36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second tablet I have owned after the Kindle fire hd.

I use it almost an hour daily and in this entire month I have had to recharge it ony three times. Plus samsung gives goodies worth almost 800$ with this tab (gogo passes, google play credit etc).Cons: A bit on the heavy side. This tab is not something you can hold in your hand for an hour and feel nothing. No comparison with the lighter tabs (ipad air) in terms of weight.

Quality is ridiculous.Samsung has the best Android interface.Build is very nice and well-done.  Buttons nicely placed.  Great hi-quality speakers.Not sure if the pen is worth it vs the regular galaxy.  I wanted it for sketching but the pressure sensitivity seems hard to control - maybe just a matter of getting used ot it.  I plan on using this a lot for a couple of years so the extra $ was a worthwhile gamble.Bought a Sony 64GB sd card.  Works great.

I remember two years ago, the first time I bought a 10'' tablet, I was disappointed at how small it was. I always wanted something a bit bigger so I can read my technical books without zooming in and replace my old laptop with. This tablet fit the bill. I don't understand people saying this is too bulky. I carry my 10'' tablet in a bag most of the times so it doesn't bother me at all to instead carry a 12''. Plus, I used to bring a 7 pounds laptop with me so it's definetly not an issue to me.In fact, this is much lighter than a laptop but yet at the same time it's more flexible. Want to read a book? No problem, this is a tablet after all and you can read in the confort of your couch. Want to type a text on the go? You can pair a bluetooth keyboard and a mouse and use your tablet as a laptop. Want to write something? Use the Spen. I really like to be able to choose my input method based on what I want to do.On the downside, there are three things that I would change. First the physical button. I mean when you are holding the tablet in portrait mode, it's really annoying to have a button on the side of your tablet. It's so easy to press it by mistake. I don't know why Samsung is not putting virtual buttons on its tablets instead. This is a no brainer to me. It's not a deal breaker though. You get used to it but this is something that should be corrected.I also don't like the fact that not a lot of applications support the multi windows mode. I know for a fact that if you root the tablet, you can enable all the applications to be windowed so it's not a technical problem. I don't understand why Samsung made this choice. It's really annoying to not be able to use all applications side by side.Third, I wish this tablet was wider. This is a 16:10 device so the device is very narrow compared to its height. I wish it was one inch larger. This way it would be closer to a legal letter dimensions. Better, why not having the possibility to remove the bezels when you put your tablet on a table.

However, I didn't find software app that handles pdf itself with s pen \"smoothly\" although there are some apps. I tried some apps but its not the quality I have expected. This does not mean that this tablets functionality has any issues, but it does not fit to \"my expectation\" of specific purpose. (2) there are useful apps samsung embedded. I like most of them. However, I found that when I start apps, they ask my accounts saperately, and install something blahblah. I really don't like this process. Of course, you can ask my permission on my account or information. That's fine. but, I don't want to input account information every chances I set up apps.

Although I luvd the resolution, speed, and ease of use, I had to return it after only 3 days. Samsung offers 24-7 live chat so after working with them each day for issues below, I knew I couldn't keep it.Cons: 1. None of the 3rd party flash apps recommended by Samsung would work. 2. Realized there's no screen mirroring for projectors. 3. When I updated Hancom Viewer to the full free Hancom Office, I opened it up and over 200 files (excel, word, PPt type) were already in there, most in another language.  I signed up to the live chat & Samsung rep said they were there by default once updated to office so we had to delete in groups of 10, close the app, reopen the app so it'd recognize they were deleted then do this process about 19 more times. 4. I could never get used to the onscreen keyboard.I then went to Best Buy to get the HP 13.3 Touch Spectra instead as it wasn't offered at my base. I explained the issue with the galaxy 12.2, and he then showed me the Surface Pro 3 & said it'd be available to purchase on 20 Jun.

The screen is gorgeous \u2013 amazingly clear and bright, very natural colors.  The s-Pen function alone is worth the device for artists, and it\u2019s super-cool to write notes on on-line articles, clip them out and email them to friends.  Voice to text is flawless. The whole thing is fast, sleek and light.  Watching 4K video on this is a dream.  It\u2019s very hard for me to part with this.  As a tablet I give it 6 stars out of 5.Having said that, the reason I got the Galaxay Note Pro was because it has been touted as a lap-top replacement.  I bought is as an office productivity lap-top replacement for my 81-year old mother, who has never used mobile touch technology.  DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS.  This is still Android, and even if file management, etc. is a little more convenient than iOS, it\u2019s a tablet.  To print a photo, you have to got out of the gallery, open a printing app, find the picture again, and go through many touch-steps (like a dozen touches) to choose all the options.  Compared to a PC, it\u2019s a bear.  And for my 81-year-old non-techno mom to learn this?  Forget it!  That alone would take forever to teach her.  But every basic PC function she\u2019s used to, other than Chrome, is that much more complicated.Hword margins are in mm, not inches.  (Maybe there\u2019s a way to change it, but if so, it\u2019s non-intuitive).  The fonts are better than most Android WP apps, but limited compared to Word.  There is no way to print non-gmail emails from any printing apps I tried.  (Google only wants you to use Gmail, I guess.)  And let\u2019s face it \u2013 mobile operating systems were never designed to DO the data management and manipulation which Windows or Mac OS do so naturally.  Mobile devices are still computer ACCESSORIES, designed primarily for communication and media consumption.  Of course, they do many things a computer CAN\u2019T DO.  The touch-world and app-world are amazing.  But not full-on office productivity.Theoretically, yes, you probably could do 80% of what a laptop or PC does on this, but yikes, what a nuisance!  You could also write a novel on your smartphone, but would you want to?I\u2019m bummed, because I love so much about this tablet.

Sigh\u2026.Bottom line:  This is an amazing tablet (probably the best), but NOT a laptop replacement, unless all you do on your laptop is gmail and internet.
