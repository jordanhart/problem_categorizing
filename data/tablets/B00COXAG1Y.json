Even after charging the battery and trying to use it, the screen continued to freeze up.  It has completely stopped working and now I have to try to return it through a website from which I purchased it from.  After reading up on many reviews of this particular tablet, there seemed to be a hundred complaints all related to the same problems I have experienced.

Just because it's backed with an Android OS doesn't mean it is a quality product. I know, I shouldn't expect much from a tablet that costs under $100, but I don't care. It's still $100 and it should be a good product. I also should have reviewed the technical specs first.\u2022 1.2GHz Cortex A8 CPU\u2022 Android 4.0 OS (Ice Cream Sandwich)\u2022 Capacitive 9\" touchscreen display with 800 x 480 resolution  [the resolution is horrible]\u2022 8GB internal memory\u2014MicroSD card expandable to 32GB (card not included)\u2022 512MB RAM [With the density of the programs we use today, it's just so slooooow]\u2022 0.3MP front camera and 2MP rear camera\u2022 Built-in microphone\u2022 Network: Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n\u2022 Built-in lithium-ion battery\u20144200mAh for continuous use for up to 6 hours\u2022 Supports 3G USB-dongle\u2022 Measures 11.81\" x 7.87\" x 2.76\"\u2022 I/O ports: 1 Mini-USB port and 1 TF-Card (32GB max.)I think this is OK for kids, because they don't know any better and probably don't care.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Garbage!!!", "Author": "Shawnie", "ReviewID": "R1JKBT8W8BQB8L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and three days later it's not working. Initially, the screen froze and it took a full day to get a full charge on the battery. Day three, the screen no longer works and it will not reset or shut off. Hopefully, the battery dies soon.

Normally i would go with the famous \"you get what you pay for\" saying, but this thing isn't even worth $20.  It is so slow to operate, that it borderlines being unuseable.  It times out and freezes up constantly, and because it runs so slow, your battery life runs out much sooner than the stated 4.5 hrs.  Even for the low price, this tablet is very disappointing.  Save your money, and spend it on something that actually works.Now a month after having this, i find out the headphone jack doesn't work correctly.  I can only plug the headphones in about 1/3 of the way to get sound.  I would seriously return this right now, if the website i bought it off of didn't make it so complicated.  (It was not purchased on Amazon.)  This thing is seriously just a plastic paper weight, and it runs at about 1/10 the speed of my iphone 5, if i'm lucky.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!", "Author": "asgiii", "ReviewID": "R1UFPKLT0CWZWR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received as a Christmas gift.
