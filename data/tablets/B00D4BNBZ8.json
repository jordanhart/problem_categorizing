{"Reviews": [{"Title": "KF HDX 8.9 is ok; do homework on Prime download before you buy", "Author": "B. Tarbuck", "ReviewID": "R3OSONR0PBKHU6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.  To Amazon's credit it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than originally claimed.I have a Galaxy S3 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing.  Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Cloud Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device.  Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion.  This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download to your HDX.  Caddyshack can be downloaded but not The Hunger Games.  You can download certain videos but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out.  There is no banner (like the Prime banner on the movie icon) to show that it's content you can download to the HDX.  You have to open the content to check.  *** Edited 12/21:  You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device.  That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content.  Nice job Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.  Also NOT the case.  So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption.  That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.  You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.  Many people will opt up for the 64 GB device like I did only to find that 16 GB would likely do fine since it would be hard to download enough content to fill 64 GB.  As another commenter pointed out if you downloaded long movies in full HD perhaps you'd really want the bigger device.  Which brings me to the final point.The final criticism is that once you start watching content you have to finish watching the content within 48 hours or you need to reconnect to the internet.  Again, I was surprised to find out that the content I downloaded expired.  Hopefully these criticisms lead to a more informed purchase decision on your part.Here is the official word from Amazon which is indeed on their site and the purpose for my edit.  I was unable to find this prior to my purchase and learned about it only after I acquired the device.*  Many (but not all as I note above) Prime Instant Video titles are also available for download on Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation and Kindle Fire HDX devices. The detail page for each Prime Instant Video title indicates whether the title is available for download. You can download available titles to only two separate devices at one time. If you have already downloaded a title to two devices, you need to delete it from one of them before downloading it to another device.*  You can have a maximum of 25 total Prime Instant Video titles downloaded at a time across all devices associated with your Amazon.com account. While not all Prime Instant Video titles are available for download, the same videos may be available for rental or purchase from Amazon Instant Video, and rented or purchased titles can be downloaded to compatible devices.*  Viewing Period: If you have a Prime membership or Prime free trial, you can stream any video that is currently designated as a Prime Instant Video title on its detail page. You can watch Prime Instant Video titles that you've downloaded within a limited viewing period, which varies by title. A typical viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the title or 15 or 30 days after the download, whichever is earlier. We'll typically notify you when the viewing period for a title is close to expiring. After your Prime membership or Prime free trial expires or is cancelled, you cannot watch any Prime Instant Video titles unless you've also rented or purchased that title.So my recommendations are this.  Amazon is a great company, one that I have committed to in a big way with Cloud Music, Prime and now the HDX.  They need to be more upfront about the download limitations and I'm very disappointed that I've had to discover these limitations on my own and feel it is important to convey that to others who may be considering this device over others based solely on the much touted video download feature.Also the rear facing camera in my particular device only works properly 30% of the time.  There is some weird RGB output happening.  It's not even close to the Galaxy S3 quality or acquisition speed so just don't expect that the camera will replace your SLR and you won't be disappointed.The rest of the device is great.  All my Cloud music magically appeared and it is very easy to operate. I can get on a primitive version of Gmail but it works fine.  Outlook Web Access for work is fine.  Yahoo! email works fine.  No Dropbox app yet and it won't work with Google Docs or Microsoft's online Excel / Word apps but that was known in advance and expected given the fact that Amazon isn't touting this as a work tool; it's for play.Amazon really owes it to their faithful customers who purchase these devices to improve the download / Prime experience and this will be a home run.  I'm looking forward to trying Mayday to help sort out the problems with the camera and inquire about the return policy as I felt very underinformed in advance on the downloaded video limitations.  I hope these comments help you ask good questions and help Amazon improve their product and content experience.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rocks!

The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning.  Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX.\u2714 BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9\" HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos.\u2714 PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet.  There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).---Videos you purchase do not have a viewing period.\u2714 GLITCHES---Verify your kindle is set for the correct TIME ZONE or you might have glitches.---If you cannot see your apps or any other items on the CLOUD then you probably need to RESET your device.---Filling the device to the max with videos then trying to delete a video might turn your kindle into a brick.\u2714 POWER ADAPTER INCLUDED---Yes, you get a  Kindle Power charger! Previously this had to be purchased separately ($19).\u2714 OFFICE SUITE MISSING---You can view an item with the integrated Office Suite but you cannot edit the item unless you upgrade to the professional version and paying $4.99.  That is, the HDX has a built in OfficeSuite shell, not the full functional program.  Hint: Use your 500 free coins to get the upgrade free.\u2714 No HDMI port (MIRACAST instead)---There is no HDMI port. To view kindle content on a television you need a Miracast enabled receiver (which can be your tv or a Dongle you connect to your tv). Although this is all done wirelessly, you are not using your local wi-fi connection, the receiver creates its own adhoc network.\u2714 PICTURE QUALITY---The picture quality on the HDX is stunning. It is noticeably better than the HD, there is no comparison between the two of them.\u2714 SOUND---The sound on this device is about the same as the Fire HD.\u2714 PROCESSOR---Faster. A lot faster than the HD!\u2714 VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS---The volume and power buttons are on the back of the device instead of the side. Fortunately the power button is on a different side than the volume buttons.\u2714 VIRTUAL KEYBOARD---There is white secondary text on the virtual keyboard buttons which makes information easier to read. On the HD, the secondary text is black which is difficult to read on dark gray keys.\u2714 KARAOKE (X-Ray)---You can now get x-ray on your music which shows the lyrics line-by-line. This feature is not available with all songs.\u2714 PRINTING---This new device will soon support printing documents straight from the kindle. Previously needed a .99 cents app.\u2714 STORAGE---This model can be purchased as 64GB without having 4G connectivity.\u2714 MAYDAY Customer support---Click the Mayday customer support button (in the Quick Settings) and you can see the rep but they cannot see you.  I have used Mayday about three times and it is wonderful.\u2714 REAR AND FRONT CAMERA (Important information)---The HDX includes a rear facing camera with an LED flash. There is also a front facing camera. On the HD there is only a front facing camera and no flash.\u2666Important:  once you take a photo it automatically goes to the CLOUD storage.  Please do not take any images that you do not want floating around in cyber space!\u2714 Special Offers---As before, Special Offers show up as screen savers. They are much better than the traditional screen savers. I recommend buying cheaper with the offers. If you do not want them then pay the extra to remove them. If you buy without the offers then change your mind and want them, you can't get the discount.\u2714 Amazon Coins---All new Kindle Fire owners receive 500 Amazon coins to spend in the app store. This equates to about $5. Plus there is always a free app of the day that can be downloaded. This is nothing new.\u2714 RETURN POLICY\u2666If you do not like the HDX (and you buy from now through the holidays) then you have until January 31, 2014 to return it.  In general there is a 30 day return policy.Cheers", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An enlarged version of the 7\" HDX - Same good internal components with a nicer screen- still a battery hog though", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer \"Reviewing is my greatest int...", "ReviewID": "R2GE0AJTQPLZ9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simply put, this is the Amazon\u2019s iPad Air Killer. The 7\u201d HDX is the iPad mini killer.  Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware.  This means the 8.9\u201d version is an enlarged version of the 7\u201d version.  For my 7\u201d version review, please search for my HDX 7\u201d review.My profile: I\u2019m a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) & use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.  It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7\u201d \u2013 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7\u201d as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7\u201d As I mentioned in the 7\u201d review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This screen is a much bigger step up from the original HD 8.9 1920x1200 screen to the Kindle Fire HDX screen at 2,560 x 1,600.  The screen is comparable to the iPad Air which I saw in Apple store and text is crystal clear now with such a high per pixel inch density.  The viewing angle is just as impressive as you can hang the kindle in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly. Last year's model was not as clear as this. The overall screen improvement for this year\u2019s Kindle lineup is just impressiveSound (8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound. Similar to the 7\u201d that gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):Like the 7\u201d HDX, this 8.9 HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device. It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.The biggest improvement is the weight for this HDX 8.9 compared to last year\u2019s HD 8.9, the device is noticeable lighter (567g for Kindle Fire HD vs 374g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue. It\u2019s also lighter than iPad Air and that\u2019s quite impressive.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting. It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view. However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful. Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it. Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):With higher resolution similar to the kindle fire hdx 7, the battery life is still the biggest drawback.  As mentioned in my HDX 7\u201d review, it takes more to power to drive the battery now thanks to the screen upgrade.  Anything on the screen requires higher resolution = more power draw.  The 2650x1600 screen pulls a lot of power still compare to last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  It maybe fine for casual use but for people who are more absent minded in charging or require this for business productivity purpose, it can be quite annoying when your batteryrunning out of power.  Regardless, how much power saving features you have, it seems that the screen resolution is still taking most of the power.  I'm able to pull 7 hours of moderately heavy usage vs 9.5 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time. Again, if something like a battery case is available, that will be great. Otherwise, it will be wise to find an external battery pack for this just in case.Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueLike the 7\u201d Silk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX. For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use). The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon. I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):Same problem here arises for the 8.9\" compare to 7\".  For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available. At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch. This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached. Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon. Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.  At the moment, will just have to go with the original origami case (which again can be pricey as you can see from my other review)Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use. The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and its does show relevant items I maywant. Compare to the iPad Air, this is a total steal.  At this screen range, you cannot find anything comparableConclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad Air killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade from HD 8.9, I say YES to that.  The overall lineup for Kindle Fire has vastly improved and that is great on Amazon\u2019s part.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade. The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It used to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag. It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case. You get great price, great screen and great performance that surpass iPad Air. To me, the HDX is Amazon\u2019s answer to an iPad killer. This tablet at the moment has the best performance/price ratio.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market with no only one device revamped, but an entire lineup of Kindle Fire HDX having such performance leap. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!With 7\" HDX, it is my e-reader device whereas my 8.9\" HDX, it will be my productivity deviceThis will be reviewed periodically throughout the year. A more comprehensive review on productivity will soon be available. [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ipad convert", "Author": "R. Kumar", "ReviewID": "RTVD01N5TDVFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an apple guy since 1994.  I learned how to program on the Iic and have been using just about every version of the macbook and iPhone since it's inception.  I've also been a very proud iPad owner since day 1.  I still have my original iPad and bought both the iPad 2 and most recently the iPad air.  The iPad air is a remarkable device, it is gorgeous, thin and light.  I realized quickly however that iOS 7 was not ready for primetime on the iPad air.  Not to mention that I was having memory crashes 5-6 times per day.  On mobile safari, I would have two web pages open and the device would slow down.  If I opened a third tab and went back to one of the original two, they would both need to reload.  On top of all that, even though I am fully vested in the apple ecosystem (I purchase all my apps, music and movies through iTunes), I was quickly realizing that the competition was catching up very quickly.That's what lead me to the 8.9 HDX, mind you, I tested out the Galaxy note 10\" as well as the Nexus 7 for a \"true\" android experience.  I found jelly bean to be no different than ice cream sandwich which was marginally better than the last version.  I know android purists will say there is a huge difference and jelly bean was designed for tablets, but in all honesty, android is just a boring experience.  Even with a gorgeous screen as there is on the nexus 7, it has the occasional stutter, and I don't find the operating system intuitive with the exception of google now, I swear they've got spies in my house.With all that said, the HDX is the first truly different tablet experience in almost four years.  You will be truly dumbfounded by how light this thing is.  I mean after holding an iPad air, you'll feel like this weighs nothing.  But even with the lightness there is a \"heft\" to the device, one that gives it a presence.  And 8.9\" is the perfect size.  I mean PERFECT.  You can hold it in one hand in landscape easily.  And the rubberized plastic feels phenomenal.  From an iPad guy, this thing is neck and neck when it comes to design.  Yes, it doesn't have an aluminum back, but the front screen feels so much better.  The iPad Air screen felt plasticky in comparison to previous versions.The OS on the HDX is good.  I like the launcher.  It doesn't give me the feeling of completeness that IOS does by allowing me to customize and launch different apps, but it does it's job well.  I've always wondered why Apple didn't just have a live screen that automatically selected the apps I use most often and put them on the front page.  That's where Mojito's (as an aside, dear Amazon and Android, stop. being. cute.  Just give me a OS Version number, I can't wait for Android \"lifesaver\" or \"mint julep\") carousel comes into play.  It updates as you use it.Oh, and I know some folks like to use tablets for productivity, but let's be honest, they are purely entertainment consumption devices.  I realized that quickly with my previous iPads.  As much as I liked having email, iMessage, FaceTime, office suites, etc, the reality was that I used my iPad to browse the web, shop, read, and watch movies.  Guess what, that's what the kindle fire focuses on.  This is not a laptop replacement, this is not a post-pc device, it's the dessert you know you shouldn't have but realize after eating that it was the best thing ever.Prime Content is not exactly amazon's strong suit unfortunately.  I love prime, I've been a prime user for a very long time.  The streaming features of prime are ok.  Decent shows (like the most recent daily show) and movies (most of Marvel's latest flicks) are available.  But I'm paying 7.99 for netflix and until Amazon shows me content like that, I'll stick with my buddy.  Prime again is ok, not bad, not great, it does the job, but don't buy this for prime.  You can obviously buy all the same shows and movies on amazon that you could on iTunes, but from a free content perspective, prime isn't the driving factor behind this device.So, should you get the HDX, here's a few questions for you:How vested are you in google's or apple's ecosystem?  Have you purchased dozens of apps, more importantly, do you use the dozens of apps you've purchased?How important is productivity software to you?  Do you have to check email constantly on your tablet, open attachments, edit documents?  Or do you find that using a laptop or other PC a better solution for that?Do you play lots of tablet games?Finally, where do you get most of your content and do you purchase, torrent, stream?  There are ways to get movies from both the play store and iTunes to the kindle fire legally and easily.I found for myself, that a laptop is the best solution, and with today's ultra books and the macbook air, you can get a small, light laptop for under $1000 that does exactly what you need.  But for content consumption, the kindle fire is very hard to beat.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW.  More than I expected!", "Author": "My $0.02", "ReviewID": "R2VTY8AFSMKDI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this delivered last week to an Amazon Locker so it wouldn't be sitting on my porch and so I could pick it up in the middle of a work day. The Amazon Locker experience was really cool and convenient.First impressions....fast, lightweight, thin, and super sharp picture.  How the heck are there so many enhancements stuffed in the Fire HDX without weighing it down or slowing the processor speed?Navigating through the apps is quick and smooth, very responsive to touch.  I had multiple apps (10-20) running at once and it didn't affect performance at all.The picture is amazing, the colors are vivid and the contrast and sharpness makes some content almost look 3D. It also handles glare pretty good. Best screen I've seen to date and I have an iPhone w/ retina.The speaker sound is really good, they actually put out some bass.The app selection in the AppStore is plentiful...once you have your top 50 apps you should be set and Amazon has all of the must-have apps (do you really need 500,000 apps?), every app I looked for/needed was found and downloaded quickly and painlessly (love the Yahoo fantasy football, Facebook, Pandora, TuneIn PRO, and Netflix apps).The video camera is crystal clear and the rear camera is a much welcomed addition.  Great pics and video! The built in Skype app works very well for free video calls with friends and family.  The good thing is, anyone with the Skype app can receive your video call on their device (unlike Facetime where both users must have an Apple device). This allows you to have free video calls with more of your contacts as long as they download Skype from their respective app store.The camera app is surprisingly useful considering it comes built in. It has a ton of photo editing capabilities including filters (way more than instagram), panorama shots, cropping, text, and funny stickers you can paste to pics. You would think this was a paid-for camera app.The email client was very easy to set up, I had my Gmail loaded in less than a minute.The overall build feels sturdy and just pure quality. Again, it is very thin and lightweight but feels like it was put together very well.The battery lasted for 10+ hours while I was hopping around fantasy football, Facebook, and email on Sunday during the games. This is very good for an HD tablet.  People must remember a tablet is more like a smartphone and needs to be charged when not using since apps and wifi are constantly running in the background. For being so thin and lightweight the battery is very impressive.The Silk browser is nice, although it defaults with Bing, so I changed it to Google (personal choice).I really like the icon with reading glasses that appears in the top right of the browser that let's you change to reading mode.  It converts the web page text into a book-like page, similar to the Kindle e-reader.  It really makes reading articles on various websites easy on the eyes.X-ray feature: Watching TV shows and movies is enhanced by x-ray.  Just tap on the screen and factoids about the actors in the scene (at that moment) pop up on the side of the screen without interrupting the play.  Just tap the screen again and the info disappears.  This also works when listening to music from the music tab; the lyrics of the song appear while the song is playing.  I've always had to interrupt myself and check my phone for movie info or song lyrics when I watched or listened on other devices, now it's all in one place and available with a tap of the finger.  No more asking \"what's that actor's name\", \"what other movie was she in\", or \"how does that song go\"!The keyboard is really accurate, no typos yet. I noticed there is an external keyboard by AmazonBasics, but I'm okay with the on-screen keyboard for now.The price was reasonable for what I got. It's good to know they're not making a profit on me before I even opened the box!Overall, I am very pleased with the appearance and performance after using it for 7 days.  I was really looking forward to this purchase and I must admit that I am more than satisfied. Amazon over-delivered on this. Well done Amazon.If you don't care about \"labels\", then this is the best tablet you can buy right now.  And if you ask me, Amazon is the best \"label\" when it comes to taking care of their customers.  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!P.S. - You really should be an Amazon Prime member to get the most out of this tablet. The free Amazon Instant Videos for Prime Members are awesome!  I also opted for the Special Offers, which knocked $15 off the price of the tablet and does not bother me at all.  In fact, I am glad I got the special  offers version!  Since I've owned the tablet I have received offers that only Kindle Fire owners have access to.  I got a new Kindle Paperwhite for $20 ($100 off) and a Cuisinart Juicer for $20 ($100 off) - these 2 deals alone practically paid for my tablet purchase!  There was a deal for Madden 25 for $5 but I missed that one.  They are really awesome deals to take advantage of or you can just ignore them since the special offers only appear for a split second on your screen as you swipe to unlock the tablet from sleep mode. Definitely recommend the special offers, you can always opt to pay $15 later to have it deactivated but you'll find they are totally worth having.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Screen Display and All Around Nice Tablet", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R3L6RNVTOIVG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $379 you are getting a good deal on a large tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $399 for last year's base unit of the first-generation 8.9\u201d Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi base version of the iPad; if your pocketbook can afford it, I would recommend upgrading to the one with 64 GB of memory. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year\u2019s 8.9\u201d HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer looking for the larger screen size, or where price vs. value is a key consideration, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $269.  If you're comparing last year's 8.9\u201d model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one because other than screen size, for what I am using it for, I can only tell the difference between the video playback and playing a couple of games.I\u2019ve been playing with this for over a week now, and my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the 8.9\u201d Fire HDX to the original 8.9\u201d Fire HD as well as this year's model of the \u201cregular\u201d Fire HDX, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Initial setup of this year's model of the 8.9\u201dKindle Fire HDX was pretty easy \u2013 that\u2019s saying a lot as this year\u2019s versions of the various models had significant crashing issues due to operating software updates.  While this unit did update the operating software, it ran quietly in the background with no issues at all.Screen Display / Video Playback:If video is your thing, this version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date: I\u2019ve been comparing various episodes of the first season of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d TV show to each of the previous Fire models and I am very impressed at the picture quality. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp.  The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 2,560 x 1,600 (25% better than the HD version of the 8.9\u201d Fire) with 50% more pixels per inch at 339 ppi than the 8.9\u201d Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:It was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version sitting next to last year's HD version and this year's version of the 7\u201d HDX Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of CNN, FoxNews, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a slight difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My usual test of this feature is cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks and hear the bass), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  To have the sound throw back at you, you need to have a cover on it as the sound reverberates from the back of the Fire off of the cover back to you (hopefully, you followed that).One thing to point out is there is not a default equalizer with this Fire: everything sounds the same.  To get the most out of the bass and treble, as well as to turn down the mid-range, I highly recommend you downloading and installing one of the many free equalizer apps here from the Amazon app store as it makes a huge difference, especially if you are listening with headphones.The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account with the software came with the Fire.  Previously, I had to install and use an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store because like many of you I have more than one email account: Amazon eliminated the need for this aftermarket app because you can now switch back and forth between your various email accounts and it was very easy to setup my particulars.  The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.  The last tab on the top right contains a link to various deals on Amazon you can tap to open (or not) as you see fit.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app  here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There are two cameras on this model - one faces the front or toward the user / reader and one in the back.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.I really don\u2019t like the positioning of the back facing camera \u2013 primarily because if you use the Origami cover purchased here from Amazon (about the only one available as I type this review), the cover hides not only the camera but the LED flash.  That makes the back camera essentially worthless to me.Game Apps:Playing most of the games I play on my tablet is a much better visual experience than the 8.9\u201d HD model.  Now if this device would help me move up faster with Candy Crush I would be even happier!Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  Better yet, it is the \u201cpower fast\u201d charger that charges your Fire faster.  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.  Amazon touts it takes about 5 hours to charge this version of the Fire when the battery is completely empty.  I\u2019ve charged it several times when it was in the 20% - 22% remaining charge, and it took about six hours.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I pressed the button but felt pretty dumb: when the person who answered asked me how can they help, I basically said \"Hi, I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"  They laughed and I promptly let them get back to work answering other \u201cI just wanted to try this out\u201d queries.What I Wish it Had: a screen protector that was ready to go.  With all of the tapping, sliding, etc. on the screen, you can easily scratch the unit.  The screen protectors have been out of stock for a while now and I hope mine gets here soon.Overall, I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be.If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but I would recommend you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the 8.9\u201d Fire HD at $269.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Most Beautiful Screen I've Ever Seen", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae",

To see more videos on this Kindle Fire HDX, visit my YouTube channel:YouTube/JohnnySaigon2013You've already read a few detailed reviews from here, so I'll make this one simple to read: bullet points!PROS:*Beeee-ay-ew-tee-full screen: 8.9 inches at 2560x1600 resolution means the highest pixels per inch(339 PPI) for ANY tablet to date. Compare that with 299 PPI for the new iPad Air. This screen will literally blow you away. Apple is known to have the best phone and tablet screens on the market, and the new iPad Air is leaps and bounds better than the original iPad. However, compared to the Kindle HDX 8.9\", even it has to take a second seat.I read an article where DisplayMate compared this Kindle HDX's screen to that of the Nexus 10 and the new iPad Air:-100% color accuracy means whatever that is displayed is true to form. The best way to compare this is to pick up the Nexus 10(Samsung-made) and any Samsung AMOLED on Vivid settings.-This screen also has the brightest output - 527 cd/m2(or \"nits\"). This means that whether you're using it in pitch black, or on a sunny day in direct sunlight, this screen has enough brightness to excel in any situation. For a comparison, the best computer monitors output in the 400 nits range, and most TVs are in the 300 range.-Viewing angles are also top notch - you will not lose much quality even when you're not looking at it straight on.-Reflectivity is also minor. You bought this Kindle to see what's on the screen, not use it as a mirror. You don't know how important this becomes until you see a crappy screen such as cheap laptops.-Finally, it uses very little power, which means more battery life, and won't heat up and burn your hands.*Awesome stereo speakers. The virtual Dolby surround sound is really effective, and really immersive. You can crank the sound to 11 and it won't distort. By far the best speakers I've heard on any tablet or phone.*Truly lighter than \"Air.\" I hated holding the iPad 3(the most recent iPad I have). It was uncomfortable and wrist-breaking. Even with the iPad Air weight reductions, it still weighs about a pound(16 ounces). The Kindle HDX is 13.2 ounces. I can now finally read and watch videos in bed comfortably. Even holding it one-handed is now a comfortable reality.*Downloading movies, streaming videos, etc. through WiFi is super fast with the built in dual-band, dual-antenna.*This tablet is fast! Having a Snapdragon 800 processor means you'll never have to worry about apps and games slowing down on you. Having 2GB of RAM also means you can multi-task and run multiple apps to your heart's content.*It has never gotten hot or uncomfortable while holding/using it so far, so in totality the form factor and userability are excellent.*This is subjective, but I think at 8.9,\" this is the perfect screen size for a tablet. I have the old Nexus 7, and when compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3(5.5\"), or even my HTC One(4.7\"), there wasn't a big upgrade in screen size for me to use it more than my phones. The iPad, while having a nice screen size at 9.7,\" is too heavy and uncomfortable to use for a long session, even with the improved iPad Air. The Kindle HDX, at 8.9\" and 13.2 ounces, has the perfect combination. If you want something bigger, then just use your laptop!CONS:*There is no Micro-SD slot, so there is no potential of increasing your storage capacity. This is perhaps where the hardest decisions will be. The 16GB version has 10.9GB of useable space left, so it would not make sense if you want to download or store more than a handful of movies. Considering an HD movie can be anywhere from 2-10GB, make sure you select the right capacity for you.*There is no micro HDMI-out like on the older Kindle HD. The new HDX uses a wireless system called Miracast. This is all great, however, it is a new functionality that has not been widely implemented, meaning most likely that the TV you are using now isn't Miracast-enabled. So if you want to mirror your Kindle screen to your TV, you'll need to buy a new TV, or find an app or dongle that would provide an alternative.*The only other thing I can think of for the casual user on the fence is, because the ecosystem is not as robust as Apple iOS and pure Google Anroid, they won't have access to all those apps of the other two ecosystems. The Amazon App Store is growing rapidly, but it is climbing an uphill battle to reach the other two.CONCLUSION:The two most important factors I think people will have to decide from is:1) Do you love and live Amazon enough so that the lack of apps you would get from the iOS and Google app stores won't affect you?2) Are you one of those that uses your tablet as your universal multimedia hub, and want to store all your apps, games, music, photos/videos, and movies in there?I only play other media and games occasionally, so for me the lack of app quantity of Amazon from iOS and pure Android is not a deal breaker for me. It is for a lot of people, so in the end, it might come down to user preference and brand loyalty.Overall, for my needs, which is to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Videos, and surf the Net/read the news apps, this is the perfect tablet for me.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miracast and other misc.", "Author": "AMB", "ReviewID": "R3B8OZYWBFO34Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I love my new Fire HDX (64Gb, wifi only with ads), but all the positives have already been reviewed at length by others, so I will concentrate on what I have not yet seen discussed elsewhere in a lot of detail:1) Display mirroring (with Miracast).  I got the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and finally managed to make it work, no thanks to Netgear who have just lost a customer.  Well, not really since I never bought a Netgear product before and arguably I didn't this time either as I bought it refurbished, but still.  Installation issues notwithstanding, after it started working, it was pretty amazing.  I tested the Miracast functionality successfully with both my Win8 laptop and my Kindle Fire HDX.  Yes, there is a very slight lag, but nothing major and I suspect the technology will only get better what with the rate of the firmware updates being pushed out by Netgear for this product, trying to keep up with their competition which I think will be fierce now that Amazon has put its weight behind the Miracast technology by doing away with the HDMI output port entirely in the Fire HDX models.  Which means that if you are emotionally attached to using an HDMI cable to connect to your external screen or TV, or just do not want to put up with the potential pain in the neck the installation of the PTV3000 may turn out to be (though to be fair, some people had no trouble whatsoever?), you will want to stick with the HD models instead.  If you are excited about Miracast and want a WiDi adapter for your TV, use some caution, because as my review of said item demonstrates, it can be a hassle to setup.A cheaper alternative is the Tronsmart T1000 Mirror2TV Wireless Display HDMI Dongle Support Miracast DLNA EZCAST AirPlay Compatible with Android OS / Apple iOS / Samsung AllShare Cast S3 S4 Note2 Note3 Note10.1 / Google Nexus4 Nexus5 Nexus7 / Amazon Kindle Fire HDX / DELL VENUE 8 PRO which performance is unfortunately not as good as the PTV3000 (noticeable time delays and pixelation when mirroring and requires use of their free proprietary app, EZCast).2) Customer service.  I have never seen any company spend so much time and effort into ensuring customers were happy with their flagship product (the Kindles, I mean.  When it comes to every other product and services, they are just as impersonal and crushing as you would expect).  I have rarely -if ever- had to contact Amazon with any of my Kindle issues before, but I was forced to contact an Amazon representative three times since my HDX arrived and each rep was unbelievably polite, helpful (and downright nice! all three of them!  What?) and went to extraordinary lengths to resolve my issues (minor hardware problems - I'll update this review upon final resolution).[UPDATED:  my issues were resolved very satisfactorily, all it took was the guts to call Amazon support in the first place... All the customer service reps I spoke with -all 6 of them by now!- were helpful, patient, reasonable and even technically competent!?  I don't understand this minor miracle, but it's certainly no coincidence and I was very glad to be able to take advantage of it.  This great level of customer support is available for all your Kindle issues, not just HDX models, by the way].One of my calls was made while testing the Mayday feature and I was stunned by how amazingly good the concept and execution of this idea was!  Kudos to Jeff Bezos, this new feature is brilliant and will gain him major customer loyalty, especially among the older set (this is not meant to be insulting as I am no spring chicken myself).3) Accessories.  This tablet is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, granted, but it is also a fingerprint magnet -especially its display which is a touch screen, of course- and the rubberized back, which was so convenient and comfortable in the 7\" original Fire, seems to have become a sponge for natural skin oils with the 8.9\" HDX model?  Fingerprints are everywhere and stay obstinately attached to every surface, not just the display, and personally I never figured on wiping them off as a full-time occupation.My solution?  DecalGirl skins (check their website for a dazzling number of choices or why not, the original DIY look: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" DecalGirl Skin - 'Create Your Own'):  no, I do not work for them, I just spend a lot of time and as little money as possible trying to get the right accessories for my Kindles.  They are a tad expensive ($20), but they are unbelievably easy to apply, of superior quality, extremely durable, come in a huge variety of designs from colorfully eccentric to classically elegant and DecalGirl often offers up to 25% discounts on their website. They will keep your Kindle looking and feeling like new.Note that most cases easily fit over these skins but remember that if you also want a screen protector (I did!), it should be applied before the skin is applied to the body of the Kindle (front and back).  By the way, covering the front of the Kindle (the bezel around the screen) makes holding your Kindle a lot more comfortable... This is no ad for DecalGirl:  if you prefer one of their competitors (for instance:  Protective Skin Decal Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Tablet (2013) Sticker Skins Books), do your research and go for it, I am merely pointing out that I believe getting a good quality skin for your HDX is more important than buying a case.  Also a lot cheaper than an Origami case, Amazon's preferred solution which at $50+ is just too rich for my tastes (sorry, this bon mot was just too easy)!Speaking of accessories, since I cannot recommend any one case wholeheartedly, I can at least recommend the Targus Mini Stand Designed for Apple iPad, iPad 2, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, Clear (AWE65US).  It's surprisingly practical and elegant for a simple block of acrylic!  Designed for any smartphone or tablet up to 10\", it's perfect if you like watching videos on your HDX from a desk or a table rather than balanced in your lap.4) Downloading videos.  The limitations mentioned in B. Tarbuck's review could be a problem for everyone who purchased the 64Gb model with the new downloading features in mind, which was my case... but a few months of heavy usage later, I can confirm that the points he raises are not necessarily a big deal.- First, you'll want to keep in mind that not all Prime videos are available for download as licensing rights limit what Amazon offers and which videos are Prime and downloadable is liable to change without notice.- Second, there is indeed a 25 downloaded videos maximum at any given time which personally I find is acceptable, even though I would have preferred to have heard about it beforehand rather than discover it afterwards.- Third, the Viewing Period limitation (48 hours or so depending on the video) is a lot easier to swallow when you realize it only starts applying to videos once you start watching them.So the Viewing Period limit is actually quite comparable to the Lending Library's limitations:  you just need to remember that Prime Videos are not available for streaming while you are traveling outside the US which is why you need to download them to your Fire HDX before leaving the US.  Or if you are an overseas customer:  yes, this IS discrimination!  Just kidding, it's due to the same licensing rights limits referred to above which Amazon negotiates with the content owners (Warner, Fox etc.) themselves, ie the same people who insist on different DVD regions etc.[IMPORTANT:  the 'Viewing period' limit actually applies only once you've STARTED watching a video.  As long as you simply keep your downloaded videos on your Kindle Fire for later viewing without starting the playback of the file, the Viewing Period limit is irrelevant.  Now, that's more like it!  :)  ]Personally I invested in the 64Gb model because I am often in the position of traveling overseas for months, with very little personal internet access.  Let's not get into a discussion of what most hotels overseas -ahem UK, I am looking at you here, not that Italy or Germany or Japan have a leg to stand on either- think is 'free internet access' or the availability of English-speaking entertainment media outside the US.  Can you believe that some countries expect you to understand their own non-English language to get your entertainment?!  Just joking:  English is not my native language...  My point stands, however.Therefore purchasing the 64Gb model may be worthwhile if you like to load up your Kindle with lots of videos in preparation for a long overseas trip:  just remember that once you start watching a video, a fairly short Viewing Period time limit starts running - about 48 hours (more or less depending on the movie/show in question).  This is similar to the time limit you run into when downloading Prime Videos to your PC or renting vs. purchasing movies from Amazon, by the way... Please also note that movies and TV shows take up a huge amount of space when downloaded from Amazon, even when you do not choose the HD version, compared to your own personal videos (ripped from your own DVDs, I mean) which usually take up no more than 1 or 2 Gb per movie. Plus, your own videos have no such intrinsic Viewing Period time limit and can be re-watched as often as you want, forever, just like the videos you actually purchase from Amazon.Remember, if you are willing to actually pay money to purchase a video from Amazon, you can then download it to your device at any time (while you are in the US), and keep it on the hard disk of your Kindle Fire -and any other Kindle Fire you own, past and future- forever (or you can re-download it repeatedly).  Which is what Amazon is hoping we'll do, in fact...  That's the whole point of selling the Kindles at near cost, after all.One more relevant item of information when it come to the HDX hard disk:  the micro USB port is not OTG compatible, so you cannot simply use an OTG USB key (like this little beauty for instance: Patriot Stellar Series 64GB USB 3.0 OTG With Up To 140MB/s Transfer For Android Base Tablet/ Smartphone- PSF64GSTROTG) to easily increase the size of your Fire hard disk. Oh well...5) non-Amazon content and apps:  let's just reiterate a few points which most official reviews I have seen rarely make.- you can totally get non-Amazon apps from the Google Play store.  Or any reputable website, as long as you are careful and do a bit/a lot of research first if you don't want to be sorry later.  Download the .apk file (all Android apps are really files with an apk extension), then transfer it to the appropriate folder on your Kindle.  Opening the apk file then installs the app on your Kindle Fire and the app will afterwards appear in your Fire's Apps section. It's that easy!  This simple process is called sideloading and no, it's not difficult or complicated and does not require rooting and does not invalidate your warranty or anything:  the internet is full of simple how-tos on the subject, just begging to be read.  And Amazon is perfectly fine with your sideloading non-Amazon apps, especially free apps.Obviously Amazon will not refer to it or explain how to do it and they will avoid even mentioning it, but Jeff Bezos is well aware that lack of flexibility on this issue would be a deal breaker, even if he'd rather not admit as much officially.  Which is why it's a fairly straightforward process, even though it would have been quite easy for Amazon to prevent us from sideloading non-Amazon apps.- you can easily get non-Amazon ebooks (pdf or epub or any other commonly used ebook format, free or otherwise - B&N; etc.) to your Kindle:  just install the Calibre software on your computer and it will handle all the format converting and transferring to your Kindles, from the oldest Kindle e-reader to the latest HDX.  Plus lots of other neat and amazing features, including tagging or helping with the rental of ebooks from your public library system.  Calibre is free, it's got heaps of documentation and technical help, it's regularly updated and it can and will handle your whole ebook collection beautifully while synchronizing all your e-Readers easily.  It's like iTunes for ebooks!  If iTunes was easy to use, efficient, inclusive of formats and platforms.  And came with helpful free add-ins like Firefox does.  And did not lose your full music library the way iTunes loses mine all the time.- comic books/graphic novels/mangas and magazines in pdf format. This is a seldom mentioned advantage of the 8.9\" HDX:  its larger screen size and higher resolution makes it a great way to read comics in pdf format with the built-in pdf reader!  It's a bit less practical in cbr or cbz format (as opposed to reading comics on a PC where using a free cbr/cbz reader is best), but easily doable and well worth it for facing the hours of tedium that travel often requires.  No need to use a comic book reader app, especially since the best such apps are not free, if your comics are in pdf format!  But if your non pdf comics library is too just too extensive to convert, then you can check out ComiCat which costs $2.99:  it handles most comic formats, organizes your collection nicely on your Kindle HDX and allows easy synchronization with cloud services like Dropbox, which is pretty nifty - compared to having to copy your comics files to your HDX yourself.- other external content (music, photos, audiobooks and videos):  nothing is to stop you from ripping your favorite DVDs and CDs (reliable free and paying tools are all around you) and transferring them to your Kindle Fire.  It's even easier with an HDX than ever before!I've been doing all of the above since the Kindle Fire 1st gen all the way to the HDX without any trouble via the USB port of my computer:  a simple USB to micro USB cable -the same type of cable you use to recharge your Kindle- and you're all set!  Or send your ebooks attached to an email to your Kindle's email address:  Amazon Help pages are full of detailed descriptions about it... this email method incidentally lets you share your non-DRM ebooks with your friends and family simply by emailing them with your ebook.  Assuming their own Kindles have been set up to accept documents from your email address - this last requirement is a security measure to avoid spam.  Personally, I use this nifty 'sending books via email to a Kindle device' functionality to guilt my relatives into reading edifying books I think they would benefit from (passive-aggressive stuff about healthy diet, exercise and the like... ) and it helps with their insomnia issues, if nothing else!Google will lead you to numerous helpful how-tos explaining which folder you should copy your video/audio files to on your Kindle Fire and which free apps to use if for some reason you do not want/cannot use the default app.  Videos and Photos will show up in your gallery under your Photos section and your uploaded music and audiobooks, naturally enough, in your Music section.  If your files are in a format your Kindle Fire cannot open and you don't want the headache of having to convert your files, just use one of several apps that open most files:  personally, I use ES File Explorer to navigate the hard disk of my Fire and open all my non-Amazon content.  You can also check out MoboPlayer which plays any video file format, not just only mp4 files like the Fire default video viewer app.  These two apps are both available free on the Amazon app store and are very popular for good reasons.Again:  all of the above in point 5 works for all Fire models, not just the HDX.6) On a different, UNRELATED topic:  if for some reason you want to root your Amazon Fire in order to run the non-Amazon version of Android and be able to control the look and feel and functionality of your tablet, please be aware that you will lose all Prime membership advantages on this Fire tablet (though not on your computer or any other Fire you may own).  Such as free Instant Prime Videos and the Lending Library. And Mayday functionality, also a bonus of the FireOS.I just want to emphasize the fact that sideloading has nothing to do with rooting:  the amount of ignorance and misinformation floating about this topic is simply astonishing.  And by the way, I really don't recommend rooting a Kindle Fire, though yes, technically speaking, it is doable.  By anyone with nerves of steel.  And at least several hours of free, preferably uninterrupted time for in-depth research beforehand...  Just be prepared to take responsibility for the waste of hundreds of your dollars if you do brick your Kindle device.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed in the 8.9\" HDX vs the 8.9\" HD", "Author": "Harold W. George", "ReviewID": "R1EQJON9NR9QR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD for a year, having gotten it last Christmas (2012).  I have also been an Amazon Prime customer for some time. So I was pretty excited when I saw the hype for the new HDX.  This seemed like it would be a great upgrade.  It seemed like it had several things I wanted in the HD, like all my icons on one page, a rear facing camera, and faster Wi-Fi and internet, and a lighter, thinner package.  Since I already had the HD, this should be a pretty seamless upgrade.Well that's not how things went for me.  First of all taking the HDX out of the box, it felt really cheap and flimsy compared to my HD.  Even though both tablets are 8.9\", the HDX has a slightly smaller display.  It actually seemed like a tablet you might buy your 10 year old.  I already was having my doubts, but let's fire it up and give it a try.I started it up and went through all the registration hoops, and then had to go to the cloud to get all of my apps loaded onto the HDX.  Well, immediately, I noticed that apps I had purchased were missing.  Most notably was Weatherbug, which is my main weather app on the HD.  I went to the app store, and it's not there, either.  Ditto a calendar, contact list and calculator I have on the HD.  Apparently these are not compatible with the HDX.There are some items on the HDX that are not on the HD, as well, but for someone that has already set up all their apps, this is disappointing.  Most of the games, candy crush, deer hunter, pipes, etc., that I play came over, but you lose the levels you have achieved playing them on the HD.  That was a big disappointment.The other thing missing from the HDX is an HDMI port to connect the tablet to your TV.  The HDX uses some kind of sync technology, but it would not work with any of the 4 TVs, two of which are HD flat screen, in my house.  So there is no way I can watch videos or movies on my TV.  That was the real deal breaker.In addition, Amazon touts a much better display, faster Wi-Fi and faster browsing.  I didn't see it.  comparing the 2 tablets side by side, I noticed no difference in speed, and couldn't discern a difference in the screen quality.  They are both very good.  When I turned both tablets on from a cold start, the HD actually booted up and was ready to go slightly faster than the HDX,  The browser interface is different and much less intuitive in the HDX than in the HD.If you like to read books, which my wife and I do a lot of, you will also be disappointed in the ability to control font size in the HDX.  In the HD I have the font set to 7.  There is no comparable setting in the HDX.  You get small, bigger, bigger yet, and HUGE.  None of those suited me like the settings on the HD, which are easily adjusted.If you already have an HD and are thinking about an upgrade, I would suggest you not waste the money.  You are not gaining much with the HDX (the rear camera, mostly), and are giving up a lot.  If you haven't purchased a tablet yet and are considering the Kindle Fire, I think I would still buy the HD, the prices have dropped to $229 for the 8.9\", which I feel is a great value.If you find you must buy the 8.9\" HDX, definitely stay away from the Origami cover.  It's expensive and it's a piece of junk.  I returned it along with the HDX, and would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE:I have since returned both the HDX and the Origami case.  Seeing how this was a Christmas present to me from my wife, we are both disappointed.  I certainly hope Amazon rethinks the HDX and it's marketing.  For now, my old 8.9\" HD workhorse is still going strong!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2YPITHVTYLCZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9\" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7\" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9\" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9\" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" vs. 9.4\" x 6.4\" x 0.35\"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9\" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7\", and the Nexus is 10\". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:\"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy.\"It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4\" x 6.6\" x 0.29\" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful tablet!", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R23L7BXQOFIB6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my HDX 8.9\" on the day it was released and have been enjoying it since then. Here are some of my impressions that may help you decide whether or not to buy one for yourself.1. Very nice to hold. This tablet is amazingly lightweight and thin. The HDX weight is about 1/3 less than the iPad Air! It is quite thin, and in a very good way. The back is nicely rubberized for a good grip, unlike some cell phones that are too thin and slippery, so much so that they feel fragile and are difficult to manipulate without a good case. The HDX is very, very comfortable to hold and manage.2. AMAZING screen. The screen on the HDX is the best I've ever seen. \"Beyond HD\" is not an empty marketing phrase. This thing surprised me with its color, clarity, and brightness. It still reflects noticeably, though.3. Easy to navigate. I can quickly and easily switch among reading, watching videos, shopping, and more. I happen to like the carousel system, because it lets me return effortlessly to any of the last few things I looked at. With the instant response of the touchscreen of the HDX, I can find books faster than on my Paperwhite.4. App selection. Most of the apps I want are available for my HDX. Dropbox and almost anything Google, including YouTube, are what I miss the most. But YouTube works just fine on the Silk Browser. And there are plenty of news apps, games, alarm clocks, The most annoying aspect of apps for Fire is the prevalence of 3rd-party apps that do a poor imitation of the original. There are scads of apps that try to connect you with Google, YouTube, etc. but do so poorly.5. Seamlessly integrated with all things Amazon. I buy the vast majority of books and movies from Amazon, and my HDX provides an unbeatable way to enjoy them. I have come to prefer watching movies and reading books on my HDX over and above anything else I have, including a nice large HD television with sound bar and fancy ultrabook with >HD resolution. Plus, I can shop from my favorite retailer. The HDX makes it easy and enjoyable to watch movies and TV shows, read books, shop, listen to music, go through my email, catch up on the news, and more. Our family has owned the 1st and 3rd generation iPads and numerous smartphones including the latest iPhones. When you consider CONTENT, other tablets cannot match the ease and seamless integration of the HDX.6. Mayday. I've only used it once, but I was pleasantly surprised. I honestly was not expecting Mayday to live up to the hype Amazon is putting out there, but my experience was just like the commercials! Hardly any wait and a prompt answer to my question.  Amazing!You may have recognized in the past that great hardware is nothing without great software. Well, in 2013, you might say that great hardware and software are nothing without great content. And now you can get all 3 from Amazon!!", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The good the bad and the ugly - Missing items like \"Officesuite\"", "Author": "Artist formerly known as Amazon Customer \"ghe...", "ReviewID": "R2Y13IX845STIG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all I am exactly the audience that Amazon aims at with the Kindle.  I am complexity immersed in the Amazon universe as a Prime member for the last 7-8 years (and customer long before that) all of my music is on the cloud player and a huge consumer of Kindle books and prime videos. Amazon makes it easy by offering more than competitive pricing including freebies and really low cost books, music and apps. You don't get that with iTunes and the App store.  I used to buy a lot from the Apple store but since I discovered how much more I always had to pay for everything I switched and haven't been back.This is my sixth Kindle starting with a Kindle 2, Kindle 3, original Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9. So the day the HDX's were announced I ordered the 8.9.  I am a gadget freak so in addition to the multiple computers I own, I also own a New Nexus 7, and an Asus Vivotab Smart. I have also played a bunch with various iPads.The good:I can honestly and truly say this is the fastest, smoothest most appealing tablet by far (in terms of hardware)that I have ever held in my had.  The screen is simply stunning, my Google Nexus 7 has a gorgeous screen and is the same resolution as the 7\" HDX.  but in spite of the similar dpi (326 vs 339) the screen on the HDX in my opinion is more vibrant, the colors just pop and at times it looks almost 3D.  One thing I haven't seen in any of the reviews is all that much about the sound. It is truly AMAZING sound for a tablet and frankly is better than my HP Envy with Beats Audio.  I watched Galaxy Quest on Thursday night.  It is one of my favorite movies is almost mesmerizing on this tablet.  I keep hearing about \"virtual surround\" on devices with two speakers.  I have never really experienced it.  But watching this movie I could hear Foley sound behind me!  Music is sharp and clear and not at all tinny like an iPad.  Web browsing is incredible, it is fast and smooth and easy to use. The enhancements to the interface and browser functionality work really well. I can honestly say this is the first tablet I have seen that I can really use as more than a casual browser.  I much prefer a PC most of the time but I am confident I can use this on the road.  With a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I have full function.  Screen sensitivity is excellent and the on board keyboard is terrific but for these older hands separate devices are needed for real work.  (which makes my \"ugly\" part even more frustrating.Mayday is as good as advertised.The Bad:I have found several apps that don't seem to work on this including Madden 2014 Football.  I am sure they will be fixed in a matter of days but it is an irritation because I want to play!Speaking of play, it is really irritating that Amazon and Google continue to have an impasse on allowing downloads from the Google Play store. It may be true that Android is so customized that many apps won't work properly.  But many do if you know how to side load which isn't true for most users.  But what it does do is give people a lot of ammunition to the \"The Kindle is just a machine for Amazon sales\" argument.  Virtually every review I see says the Kindle family is only useful for people that are married to Amazon already.  Virtually every time I am in a retail store like Best Buy that has Kindles and other tablets I hear the store personnel steering away from Kindle for that reason. It is a very short sided policy on the part of Amazon.  Yes you bind your already loyal customers more closely to you but a more open policy would sell far more tablets and bring in many more new customers. The relatively small amount of sales lost to Google Play would be way overcompensated by the number of new customers Amazon would gain.  And it would take away the biggest criticism of Kindle.  I know that Amazon is providing a lot of encouragement to developers to provide apps for the Kindle store. One of those developers should be Google!Make sure if you plan on using the new Amazon Prime movie download service that you get at least the 32 Gig. HDX and preferably the 64.  The average 2 hour movie in 1080p is almost 10 gig of space, which is roughly twice what it would be on a PC.The Ugly:Missing promised items like OfficeSuite? One of the reasons I was really excited was that an office suite was supposed to be available on this and available for the previous Kindle Fire devices I already own at a fee.  There are a number of \"Office\" apps in the store, most of which are mediocre at best.An \"office suite\"  includes at a minimum a word processor, some kind of spreadsheet and a presentation editor.  When I gave up searching and contacted Mayday I was told that no I wouldn't find an app but if I had a document on the device I could open it.  She couldn't tell me what file formats it would open, like if it would open spreadsheets or presentations.That is not considered an office suite, that is a document viewer.  I do not see any way to create documents or even edit existing documents. At this point all major tablet vendors bundle at least basic Office capability. MS Surface and other Windows tablets offer MS Office 2013,  Apple offers iWorks suite which appears to be really nice.  I am using QuickOffice on my Nexus 7 which is of course written by Google and free for Nexus devices and a part of Android 4.4 KitKat.  Not providing an office suite when everybody else is and then trying to promote your device as being work and business friendly is not a good thing.  Saying you have an office suite when all you have is a viewer is false advertising and frankly shakes my loyalty to Amazon badly.Update:Actually when I copy something over from my PC and open it there is an \"OfficeSuite\" that shows up long enough to view the item and now yes it does open docx, xlsx and pptx files in addition to pdf. And it does allow for at least some rudimentary editing.  From the icon and capabilities it appears to be OfficeSuite Viewer from Mobile Systems Inc. The same app is available for free on Google Play and the Amazon store for free.But there is NO ability to create new documents and the application does not appear as available anywhere on the Kindle.  The average user isn't going to know how to find the viewer the way you and I just did.  There is an OfficeSuite Pro that I was not prompted to download that costs $4.99.What is included does not in any way constitute an \"included Officesuite\" any way you would care to define it.I am not an average user.  I support enterprise middleware and MS SQL systems for a major corporation and have been a systems professional for over 20 years.  If I have troubles what  kinds of problems will the average user have?", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mirroring is great! Mayday is unbelievable!", "Author": "kdsm", "ReviewID": "RVW91PO437UBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for my wife. She already had a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD and was in love with it. She uses the oldone for reading books (works great),e-mail,and her jigsaw puzzles which she is fascinated with. She thought it couldn't get anybetter. I am a retired electronics guy and was blown away by the specifications of the new HDX with its fast quad core processorand its graphics coprocessor. I was particularly drawn to the MIRACAST capability that was mentioned. This is a wireless way tosend the screen content of the Kindle to a HDMI equipped T.V.There isn't much written about the MIRACAST feature, but I found out that NETGEAR makes a streaming video device called thePush2TV (PTV3000) which I also bought from Amazon at the same time. It arrived before the Kindle Fire HDX.I was so proud of myself for finding and downloading the \"firmware\" update for the Push2TV and I was ready for the Kindle to arrive. When the KIndle arrived it was cold from the outside and I decided to let it warm  to room temperature and wait for wifeyto come home from work.Wifey arrives and we began the process of trying to connect to the Push2TV device. I followed the directions to the letter that was a BIG mistake! I tapped the MAYDAY button (unbelievable genius that) and was connected to a very pleasant young ladywho knew less about \"mirroring\" than I did but she REALLY tried. Unfortunately that connection was cut off. I tapped the MAYDAYbutton again and was again connected to a pleasant lady who couldn't help me and was again disconnected. I think the disconnections were due to the fact that the MAYDAY operators took control of my Kindle and accidentally disconnected the WiFilink. I was getting frustrated at this point and I was also very disappointed, The mirroring was a big reason for my HDX purchase.I tapped the MAYDAY button for the third time (wifey says I'm stubborn, I prefer tenacious) and again spoke to a very pleasantyoung lady who could not have been any nicer. She and I could not resolve the problem either but she set me up to receive a call from an Amazon help operator. The call arrived within seconds and again I'm speaking to a really nice young lady (do you see a pattern here?). This lady's name was Charlie and she couldn't help me either but promised to research the problem andconnect me with an I.T. deity which I requested for after Thanksgiving because it was already after 10:00 p.m. my time.Here comes all the good stuff. Even though it was late, I was determined to make this thing work I'm retired and can work all night if I want to. I started at the beginning! This time I DIDN'T follow directions about pushing the button on the side of the Push2TV box! I did push the reset button with a paper clip on the Push2TV unit. I observed my T.V. screen and noticed that the versionnumber on my Push2TV was 2.4.3 this is really important! I did NOT need to upload new firmware. The firmware in my unit as shipped was NEWER than on the NETGEAR website which was 2.4.26! In the end all you have to do is connect the Push2TV toyour T.V. the turn on mirroring in the Kindle and your done.Mirroring is beyond belief. The picture on the T.V. is stunning.

I returned that one, because the bezel around the screen, invaded the screen to much to make the device prove useful when reading magazines, and for viewing some webpages.Also, I have owned pretty much every tablet made including, the ipad 1 & 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab (orginial), Kindle Fire HD 7\", Kindle Paperwhite, Microsoft Surface Pro, and most recently the Dell Venue Pro 8.I feel qualified to speak to the usability of this tablet in comparison to the others and in its own right. What I will not do in my review is review the technical aspects of the HDX, as you can read them on the product page.1. First Impressions:This device is solidly built, and it light as a feather. It is really a shame to put a case on this device as anything that makes this baby heavier is a shame. For the women out there that may be wondering, if you threw this in your handbag, your arm would not fall off, provided you have it stowed in a sleeve case or very light weight case. The speakers are placed at the top of the device and have a good output of sound at low and high volume. If you are using the device flat on a table it can muffle the sounds a bit.2. Screen:The screen is perfect. No blue haze, or abnoramalities whatsoever. The brightness of the screen is wonderful, and while I have not used the device outside, I have used it sitting near a window with the sun streaming in and I had no problems seeing the screen.3. Ecosystem (OS)It should not be a surprise to anyone that this device points to Amazon's ecosystem. People that knock this tablet for this seem to be off base. If you want a google tablet with no restictions, then buy a Nexus or some other type of tablet. Amazon is not going to build a table that points to another company ecosystem, anymore than Apple would allow you to interact with Google directly. Lowering the rating of the HDX for this reason is unwarranted.Using the Kindle OS is simple, and the onscreen hints help for first time users. If you are coming from a previous generation Kindle you should be able to navigate without much trouble with a few small differences. I also use Amazon's Cloud service for photos and docs, and you probably should also. Installing the Cloud Photo app on your cell phone will allow any picture you take to upload to the cloud and once you register your HDX, they will automatically populate. Such an awesome and thoughtful feature. The Cloud Doc feature works the same, install on your PC or Mac and any document you drag into the doc folder will automatically show up on your HDX4. Music Player:To my surprise, the HDX will show the lyrics to certain songs that have the Xray enabled. This is an awesome feature if you are someone that likes to know the words to songs, or if you are like me, a singer, and need to actually KNOW the lyrics to some songs. If you also have songs in Amazon's Cloud Music Player these will automatically populate on your Kindle when you register is, and if the lyrics are available they automatically show. You can also place your music directly on your Kindle via usb as well from your PC or MAC if you want.5. Kindle Book ReaderI read entire book on my HDX just to make sure that I did not have eye strain or any other issues before deciding to rate this tablet. Amazon for me has always been about books first and of course my HDX excels here as well. I read well into the night and all the next day with no eye fatigue, or issues.6. Video/Prime SubscriptionOk, people here are getting upset about the prime subscription. For the $79 bucks a year you get free 2 day shipping on most anything in the Amazon market place and a thousands of free movies, of which some are downloadable, 1 free book you can borrow each month, and now a free book that is new to the Kindle store to preview. That's a lot of stuff to consider, and yes there are improvements to be made, such as choosing a movie from the Prime Movies to Download category showed movies that I could not download along side the downloadable ones (so why the category?) but overall, its not a deal breaker. You have a month to decide either way.The videos are beautiful, with wonderful color and sound. Not much to say here. This was another expected point.7. ProductivityI wanted to see if the tablet could really function as quasi laptop for when I was out of the office and still needed to stay in touch with work. I added my Microsoft Exchange Account (along with my personal email accounts) and was surprised to see that my work email was able to sync easily along with my Exchange Calendar. All my contacts were added to the HDX as well. The true test came when I needed to open a spreadsheet emailed to me, which I was able to do. The HDX comes with a program that allows you to view office documents, to edit requires you to purchase the full version. I own my own business, so being out of the loop is never really an option, and I am always looking for devices to allow me some acces to work without carrying 3 or 4 different devices.8. PrintingI was able to print to my HP Laserjet printer, the HDX required me to download a HP Printer App, which allowed me to print an email just fine. You are supposed to be able to print emails and docs. I would like to be able to print from the Silk Browser as well, but I'm not sure that this device allows that. Maybe I'm wrong. Somebody please correct me if I am.9. Mayday Button:This may seem gimmicky, until you actually need help, which I did. I purchased another HDX for my husband, and while setting up his, all the books and music and newsstand items synced, but not the apps. Odd to say the least! I pushed the Mayday Button and within seconds I was connected to a nice lady who tried to help me, but was unable to fix my problem. She transfered me to another woman, who I could not see as she was with Kindle Second Level Support, but who I was able to speak to online. She needed to call me back becuause I had to reset the HDX, which she did right away, and helped me solve my issue. Which by the way was to deregister and then re-register the device and everything was able to sync perfectly.10. Magazine Reading:As I stated earlier reading a magazine on the 7\" HDX is just too small to see the pictures and text completely. The 8.9\" solves that problem, opening up a whole new world for me. I subscribe to several boating magazines, where there are a lot of pictures of beautiful boats that I want to see. Also, utilizing the 'reading view' allows you to pull the article you are reading into one cohesive reading screen. Great!11. BrowsingSilk is fast and easy to use. Not sure why people do not like it. Not much to say here.12. BluetoothI was able to pair the HDX to a Bose Speaker easily and an external keyboard within seconds. Again, not much to say here, bluetooth works as expected.In conclusion, I hoped I have answered any questions you may have from the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" I cannot really speak to gaming, as I do not use any gaming apps, but take it from somebody that loves trying out new tablet, this one is definately one I'd recommend to someone that loves to read, watch movies, read a few emails, and listen to their favorite music. This a consumption device, and all roads lead you to being able to read, watch, listen or browse easily and quickly.**Update 12/21/2013**I thought I'd update you on how my and my husband's experience has been with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.My husband has an Ipad2 which he uses daily. I have noticed that he uses the Kindle Fire a lot more everyday. I asked him about his experience and he told me that the Kindle Fire is much lighter and the screen resolution is better. The only thing that stops him for using it fully, it that he has some apps he paid for on the Ipad that he does not want to pay for again. He is a bit of a technophobe, and he has also found that navigating the Kindle is pretty easy.We also purchased the device with special offers and he really likes it. He likes getting the special deals on the lock screen, and even the recommendations from the Carousel.He is a big Netflix, Slingbox, HBOGO user, and he finds that the Kindle Fire handles all of these apps well.My experience is really surprising for me, as I find myself using my Kindle Fire HDX for work a lot more. I can easily look up information on our company website when I am away from my office, and even respond to emails easily. I am having a bit a trouble transferring documents to my Kindle via usb for some reason. PDFs and word docs transfer easily, but for some reason excel files will not. Not sure why I keep getting an error. Beware though, it does take a few minutes for docs transferred via usb to show up on the Kindle for some reason.Working with the docs with the Office Suite App is pretty easy too!Revision 1/4/2014There seems to be some problem with my Fire HDX hanging a lot. I am getting a message saying that I do not have a wireless connection, when clearly I have full bars. I have made sure there is no issue with my WI-FI - none of my other devices are losing a signal. The only fix is to disconnect from the network and reconnect and then I can continue with what I was doing.I also have had an issue playing videos. Both on Prime, and on the A&E; App. At first I thought it was the app, so I closed it an reopened, still was unable to play videos. Next I tried to watch a Amazon video and was unable to even pull up the first screen that pops up when you press video. I had to turn my Fire on and off before I was able to play any videos. I do not that sometimes these devices need to be turned off and on to 'clear' or reset them, but with these two issues, I'm getting a little concerned. The WI-FI issue is starting to be a hourly occurance. I am going to have to press Mayday to find out what is going on. I will have to lower my review by one star. This whole device is dependent on the wireless connection. If that does not work well, then it's just a nice looking paperweight.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Let's take a look....", "Author": "ND Mike \"rabid1\"", "ReviewID": "RB19URRPGZ104", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first. I have been one of the most outspoken people against Kindle tablets. The lack of hardware options and the proprietary interface always were a big minus to me. That is why writing this review is painful in soooo many ways.As a big supporter and developer for the lesser brand and generic tablets I have owned around 50 tablets in the last 3 years. I always look at hardware potential first, OS functionality second because that can be fixed. That is also why I decided to check out the Fire HDX 8.9. The hardware specs made it difficult to believe it can't deliver. It does indeed deliver.While benchmarks can often be misleading in real world application but they still give a good performance comparison and an idea of what to expect. In Quadrant it hits with a blazing 19,546 and in Antutu it jumps in at 31,765. To put this into perspective the Galaxy Note * get's about 18,000 in Antutu.The tablet is thin and light to the point of thinking I got an empty shell, but it still manages to feel solid. I have an Afunta 8 inch that while a little heavier still feels like it is going to break in your hands. As thin as the HDX is there is no flex to the case.When I booted the HDX the display is obviously the first thing I noticed. (OK the boot speed surprised me first) It is really crisp and bright and the colors are crisp. Even when set at the lowest brightness movies are still entirely watchable. The touchscreen itself is very responsive, a little sensitive so it took a a bit of getting used to. But having big fingers isn't the tablet fault.Both the N and A wifi are strong and solid. The 5GHZ connection is the best of the 3 tablets I have that use it. The 32GB HP Touchpad is the closest. I can hold -55dbm all the way out to the curb. With Netflix set to the highest quality it needs no refresh time when the movie starts.The speaker quality is easily the best I have experienced. Not just volume but actual sound quality.The rear camera with flash always sounds great. I have several tablets with this feature and up until I bought the Sero 7 Pro it has always been short of useless. The HDX exceeds the 7 Pro. The pictures taken with flash off the HDX look like they came off a camera, not a tablet with a camera on it.As for the things the HDX is missing. HDMI out, MicroSD, I can't knock off points for thing that you should know about before you buy. Lack of research on the part of the buyer isn't the manufacturers fault. Just like knocking a tablet for not having Google Play when it isn't a Google certified device.  You don't buy a chain saw to hammer nails do you?As for apps it is simple enough to side load apps onto the HDX.I really was planning on writing a scathing review thus justifying my dislike for proprietary tablets. But as a pure tablet the Kindle Fire HDX is amazing. There are tablets within the price point that may have more features, but none can do what the HDX does as well as the HDX. That goes for much more expensive tablets as well. Time will tell if there will be a lot of independent development on the HDX but I would guess the hardware will draw developers like candy draws a fat kid.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "one more", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "RLED3IV8E8HNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been buying kindles since the 1st generation, so I will leave the very wordy reviews to others and simply tell you, this is the fastest smoothest kindle so far.

Ferrell \"virtualgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R26J06WBJ4XIPE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first say I really wanted to be a Kindle Fire HDX fan. I recently ditched an iPad 4 in favor of the Kindle but found ultimately that the device just doesn't perform. Upon receiving the Kindle I connected to my lab network powered by an Ubiquiti Unifi AP-LR which provides 802.11n MIMO. I went about downloading my cloud stored apps and books but found some interesting symptoms.When downloading my Kindle would sometimes timeout after prolonged periods of waiting with no start of the download, other times with apps like Olive Tree's Bible Study I would download one of the Bibles and the download would stall and timeout at different points maybe after 1MB or even nearly complete. When surfing my page load times were unbearable. It wasn't just that my pages loaded slowly but my pages wouldn't start to load until several seconds after hitting a link or enter at best. Sometimes they would never load. I tried restarting the Kindle, resetting the Kindle, completely erasing the Kindle, de-registering and registering the Kindle again. I changed my wireless security, I changed from HT20 to HT40, I assigned static IPs vs. DHCP, I used public DNS versus my internal DNS server. I turned every single device off in the house, disabled Amazon's page surfing booster and still didn't see a performance improvement. I downloaded a Wifi Analyzer and watched the Kindle drop the signal strength every few seconds, I pinged internal servers and saw fairly typical responses but if I pinged an external server I saw between 10-15% packet losses. Other devices on the network did not experience the same performance and even other Android devices running the same analyzer never saw the same signal drop at all.I called Kindle customer service who asked me to do all I had already done and then went on to ask that I reset the router I use to power over 40 different devices including our virtual machines in a lab environment. When I explained to them why I couldn't they told me it was because I had too many \"people\" on my network that my Kindle didn't work as fast despite no other machines experiencing the same. I eventually conceded and reset the router, no difference. I open the Kindle IP up to the internet completely unprotected by the firewall and still got no different response. The last recommended step per Amazon was to drive to an Internet cafe and try their internet. Despite how ridiculous that sounded I did go to another location and get on their wireless connection with the same results. I exchanged the Kindle for another Kindle thinking I had a defective unit. The second Kindle did have marginally better performance but still the same symptoms so today I forfeited and got a RMA to go back to the iPad.As a device the interface is great, I didn't have an issue with reading a book or using an application if it worked but it seldom worked and since tablets are primarily internet connected devices it just isn't anything above one star without functioning wireless. Prior to boxing it up the Kindle started to not show a MAC address or valid wireless option and would take several restarts to get the wireless connection to appear again. I may have left out one of the resolutions I tried but I believe I went well beyond what a typical consumer would do anyway to troubleshoot a device.If Amazon's engineers need it, I finally ended up on channel 1 of HT40 for the best performance which is to say I was able to surf with still long delays or no page load at all unless I sent the request a second time. I think it's fairly common but the initial ping was often times 4 to 5x longer then the subsequent replies and the software my wireless APs run showed the Kindle as going in and out of powersave mode from second to second. I booted up Wireshark and did notice that when pinging an address from the time I started the command using Fing on the Kindle to the time it showed up on my network was near equivalent to the maximum ping response time minus the average ping response time. I have a feel that the power save features of the wireless chipset may give an additional hour or so of run time but create a performance issue and since it isn't user selectable it's a pain.Thanks again Amazon, better luck on the next release.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the upgrade from the KFHD 8.9", "Author": "Martin Gregorski", "ReviewID": "RS8YVOPL5TQQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the KFHD 8.9 and the new HDX doesn't disappoint in any way.

Then the device reset itself after I tried to start up a new app for my e-mail, it took 20 minutes with the Kindle resetting over and over before it came back on. I contacted customer service and I was told that my problem would have to be forwarded to the Kindle developers and I probably wouldn't hear back for a few business days.So far my Kindle is still running through the power cycle, over and over, but if I don't get this issue resolved and receive a new Kindle within the next week I will be demanding a refund.I did enjoy the high-def quality of the screen and how it played videos. I just wish Amazon got rid of all the bugs before putting stock into this new device. I also happened to order the Origami case and I am very happy with this accessory.I really hope this was a fluke and I happened to receive the one Kindle in the whole bunch that didn't work. I'll update my review if I happen to receive a new Kindle.UPDATE:Earlier this week I received a brand new replacement Kindle. Fortunately it seems that the first Kindle Fire HDX that I received just happened to be a, one in a million, defective device. I wanted to wait a few days before I reviewed this item for the second time. I did this so I could see if my new Kindle had the same problems as the old one and I wanted to be able to play with and try to experiment with all the bells and whistles.Display: The display is crisp and clear, with no blue bleeding around the border. This was a problem that some people reported, but that isn't the case with mine.Ease of Use: The Kindle Fire HDX is very simple and easy to use. I have yet to use the Mayday button, but the mere fact that it is there makes all the difference.Apps: There are a lot of apps available for the Kindle and I have downloaded most of the same games and apps that I use on my phone. There are a few apps that are not availble for the Kindle, but they are few and far between.Video: I have used my Amazon Prime membership to watch several free movies and tv shows on the Kindle and I am very impressed with the resolution and playback.Books: I really enjoy using the Kindle to read books. I was dead set against using an e-reader, but my growing hardback and paperback collection and the slowly dwindling space in which to put my books, has made me rethink purchasing a Kindle. I like how the kindle allows me to place bookmarks, toggle text size and most importantly the price of each Kindle version of books I read.The only real issue I had with Amazon, was how long it took them to send me a replacement.

I'd bought the original Kindle Fire 2 years ago and thought it a good reader for those who need color for illustrations, as I do, but its design and functionality struck me as rather clunky and hit-or-miss. Its use as an internet surfing device was frustratingly slow and whatever other functions there were never seemed to shine because of its meager storage. I used the Kindle Fire as a reader almost exclusively and was satisfied with that.The new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" takes direct aim at the heavyweights, especially the iPad, and does so successfully. Its Wi-Fi version weight of 13.2 oz. feels feather light and its slightly smaller size makes it easy to manipulate using only one hand. For me, that ability to comfortably carry it one-handed, leaving the other hand free for data entry, is a significant breakthrough. My iPad, despite all of its many virtues, never felt truly portable. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is the first truly portable full-sized tablet I've used.The Kindle Fire 8.9\" HDX touchscreen display with 2560x1600 resolution is impressive. As my eyes get used to 1080p high definition images from pretty much everywhere these days, it is one indication of how beautiful such densely-packed pixels can look when you let out an involuntary \"ooh\" as I did at the beginning of The Hobbit. Hobbiton has never looked so green and verdant. This new touch screen display is a triumph. The screen is responsive to the lightest touch, something owners of the original Kindle Fire could only dream about.Browsing the web in a Silk environment is meant to be faster by dispensing with \"unnecessary images and other website clutter\" (according to Amazon) by using Reading View. I prefer my websites un-tampered with but normal browsing is extremely fast and responsive due to the new Kindle's Quad-Core 2.2 GHz processor and the Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. This is a very fast tablet in all respects.There is one aspect of the Kindle Fire experience every prospective buyer must take into consideration. This tablet is designed to operate within an Amazon ecosystem. There are limitations built into the Kindle. Its Android operating system is modified so that there are differences users of Android devices will quickly notice. But Amazon Prime members (like me) can at last really experience membership - the way it was designed to be experienced - every time they dip into a vast pool of free films and TV shows, both streaming and downloading for offline viewing. The earlier Kindle Fires were simply not equiped for enjoying high definition films, for example. The speed of the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" finally delivers on the promise of Amazon Prime membership.There are a host of other features that give value to the new Kindle Fire. Its increased storage capacity means no more desperate decision making on what items to keep and what to discard. Music lovers will enjoy having their Amazon CD purchases instantly appear on screen and available for either streaming or downloading from the cloud, eliminating the need for time consuming ripping. X-Ray showcases the song's lyrics onscreen, adding another dimension to music listening. The Kindle's Dolby Digital speakers are well separated when it's held in landscape position, producing true stereo sound, a first in my tablet experience. The new Mayday feature will be a boon to many, though techies will probably snort in derision and dismiss it. But the Kindle Fire tablet is meant for a larger audience: those who are still uncomfortable with technology and appreciate help wherever they can find it. Well, here it is.The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is two things: Amazon's delivery on a promise made several years ago, and a portent of the future in technology. The Kindle is a content delivery system and, within its rich Amazon ecosystem, it is probably the most effective device of its kind. With the increasing use of cloud computing, devices like this one are the future of computing for personal use: both for work and entertainment.

The volume control (which doubles as a zoom control when in camera mode) is on the back of the unit by the headphone jack, and the on-off button is next to where you plug the unit in -- a BIG improvement over the HD side volume and power controls.  This unit has plenty of tools for the visually and hearing impaired; a big step forward from the HD.  BUT, there's something Amazon ISN'T telling you...and I have no idea why they aren't using this as a selling point. The HDX has VOICE RECOGNITION...when ever the on-screen keyboard pops-up, there's a button right by the space bar that has a microphone on it; so instead of typing something in, you hit the microphone button...a little graphic equalizer animation comes on, and you say whatever you would have typed, push the microphone button again when you're done, and all of a sudden you see the text you were going to type in the blank you would have typed it in!  I haven't worked much with voice recognition software, and I really wasn't expecting much -- it has done a GREAT job...in fact if you've got some kind of audio source across the room you'll need to turn it down/off..when I wasn't speaking the unit recognized every word from the source across the room!  Do you see ANYTHING about this feature in Amazons promotions???  Maybe I need to try that 'panic' button and ask them why they're keeping this secret!  Fortunately I haven't had any reason to use the 'panic button.  I'm tempted to try it one day and exclaim \"I can't find my keys and I'm in a panic, can you help!?\"  (I probably WON'T) GREAT variety of EVERYTHING..movies...apps...music...games...AND don't forget about that FREE APP of they day Amazon has EVERY SINGLE DAY...I've got about 15 app/games I've installed (since they are FREE) that I haven't even TRIED yet.  I'm just planning to keep this unit as nice as possible so perhaps I can trade it in when Amazon decides to release their next 'tablet'.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "KF HDX is impressive!", "Author": "viki sunshine", "ReviewID": "R1BRPC8YRD2Q2B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am amazed by the screen resolution and speed of the 8.9 HDX.

I love my little \"svelte stealth\" companion:  Svelte, because I am so very impressed with its light weight, its thin profile, and how easy it is to hold for decently long periods of time.  I call it \"stealth\" because its low, thin profile, together with its sexy black outer layer, is so easy to slide into my handbag, my laptop sleeve, between two notebooks, incognito in a file folder.  It helps that its battery lasts for a good long while, too.Being so svelte and stealth, it is stunning--a full-blown delightful experience--when it comes to life:  Color and movement are as bright and sharp as I've ever seen.  Sound is wonderful.  I like everything about this Kindle!And, I call it a \"toy\" because it is a gift to myself.  I have lived without one for so long, that I know it is one of super electronics that I don't really need, but I really, really wanted.  I'm so glad that I finally convinced myself that this Svelte Stealth Kindle would be good for me!Okay, maybe a few too many exclamation points, but I'm really excited about owning this baby and had to convey that to you.  I'll settle down now and go play with my new Svelte Stealth Companion; I'm done with the exclamation points now...  So happy to have it.UPDATE:  A few observations on using the Mayday feature:  I can't use it if my dog is in the room:  He barks at the voice and I can't hear what is being said.  So, that's just a heads-up to put your dog in another room before connecting...  And one other thing:  If you have poor internet connectivity, you will have trouble communicating.

This is my first bad review involving Amazon itself with their product the Kindle Fire HDX. Long story short; my original piece was replaced twice with non-working refurbished pieces. The original started getting blue lines in the screen after three months of purchase. The replacement, which was refurbished kept on dropping wifi connections. The third one, which was also a refurbished replacement would not load videos. It's great to have the mayday button, but I really don't like to spend lots of time talking to them. Don't forget time wasted for shipments. My first and last Kindle purchase from Amazon.Update on May, 28; I was sent a different Kindle since the very last one would not load Prime Instant Videos. The replacement was also refurbished and will not play videos from the Prime Instant Video store or Kindle Free Time. Still waiting for a solution.

It was a Christmas present from my husband that I got to buy myself (He wanted to make sure I got the one I wanted, one of those know what it is can't have it Christmas gifts)Awesome. It arrived. When I got to open it I went about all the instructions, and finally got to play around with it.One issue.....it kept glitching on me. When i would open my book up the screen would glitch for a split second. Odd.....Then the wifi started to refuse to connect, or the web browser would completely crash and my whole kindle wouldn't open up apps, Allow me to get to the internet, the device kept glitching on me. I had to do a few 'Mayday' calls and even those crashed.Off to actually call amazon because after having it a few months, it was obviously not working right.Making a long story short I have done quite a few 'Mayday' calls with them and every single call would crash. I have been on the phone with them a few times trying to fix my kindle. It came down to I has re-booting my kindle every single day, if not twice a day for it to work. And I would have to do a whole system re-start for it to work after so many days of the re-booting not working. I have cleared everything off the Silk browser  through the apps like I was told to many times, I would force stop....pretty much everything, then re-boot. I had a 60/40 chance of that working before I had to do a whole system re-boot (Which, BTW, deletes everything off the device, if you back things up on cloud no issues, but cloud does not back up any games you have played)So anyway, finally fully fed up, Amazon said they would send me a new kindle. Awesome right? Here I am all excited that I was getting a new kindle to replace the one thats been giving me so much trouble.Except....it was a reconditioned one. Now...usually I wouldn't have an issue with this, except I paid (my total came out to just shy of 500 dollars, but the kindle was closer to about 400, I also got a protective case for the kindle) for a brand new kindle when I bought it, Obviously it didn't work and they sent me a used one. So.....I paid.....400 dollars.....for a refurbished kindle. This doesn't make me happy.Now I know they have this 'its been checked, its working like new, its backed up' guarantee, however, if I wanted a used one I would've paid for a used one and there is nothing they can do for the amount I paid for my first glitchy kindle  and the used one they sent me.Bad taste in mouth.So now I'm debating returning both kindles (The new used one they sent me AND my old one) and taking what refund (They can only refund me 80% of the original price I paid, fine I get it, I have used it, I'm not mad about that) and buying a different device. I feel pretty ripped off here. I wasn't told I would be getting a reconditioned one and they never gave me an option for a new or used. So yeah....I was actually a huge lover of amazon but now? I'm not sure I am. I might sound petty to some, but.....I paid for a brand new one when I bought it, Got a defective one, and send a used one for a pretty penny.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Five Star Tablet!", "Author": "Winston Kindle", "ReviewID": "R1RZHK4JFN8GQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a Kindle Fire version 1 user since it came out.

If you are getting this as a gift make sure you note that when you order it, otherwise it will automatically set up to your account.Things I didn't like:Amazon app store is lagging compared to Google's Play.  I previously had an Autocad WS app that I used on my phone, when I tried it on the Kindle Fire I was told I had to update it.  Unfortunately Amazon does not have the update on it's app store and it would not let me go elsewhere.  There is a way to get the apps as a quick search will tell you but I don't really want to pay this price and then have to do some work around.If all you want is something to keep you entertained then I highly recommend the Kindle Fire HDX especially if you are a Prime member.  It is very much improved over the original Kindle Fire that I got my wife when they first come out.If, like me, you want to use it for other things then I would keep on looking or at least make sure the apps you need are on Amazon.  I would up returning mine after a few days use, for me it simply was not worth the cost.  So if I returned it, why the five stars?

The HDX 8.9 is sleek, shiny and amazingly light!  The resolution and graphics are phenomenal.  The sound is fine for me for movies, videos and games.  In previous versions of the Kindle Fire, Silk has always been sluggish and froze a lot.  I have not had that problem at all, even when having 4 or more tabs open!  YAY!I have downloaded several of my books and the reading and coloration is fine just like previous versions.  Videos play nice, they are not choppy at all.

Struggles a bit outside of it.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1AVF6VFAVF5T4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a former 1st gen iPad user that was in the market for an update.  I chose to move away from the iPad because I found that I'm a fairly basic tablet user that walked away from the itunes network a few years ago.For music I had transitioned over to Spotify & SiriusXM.  For movies, Netflix & Amazon Prime.  For reading, Kindle app, but with the iPad I was not able to fully utilize the Prime membership advantages.Further, my iPad was quickly becoming obsolete because Apple didn't allow for it to download the latest iOS updates so within 2 years of ownership some of my iPad apps were constantly slow and/or crashing.  This was the straw...After shopping around for approximately 30 days I ended up purchasing 2 tablets for my household of 4 - the 2nd gen Nexus 7 32gb and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" 32gb.  (By the way, I picked up two 32gb tablets for about the same price of one 32gb iPad mini with retinal display)Pros of Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\": Size, weight, display (unbelievable), sound (those little speakers work really well, including virtual surround!), and the speed on Amazon Network.  Being an Amazon Prime member, this machine is really, really slick.  From the home screen you can easily shop, access games, apps, books, music, videos, etc., etc., etc..  This is combined with their carousel feature of recently accessed programs, books, etc..  I have to add that pulling up a video from Amazon was lightening fast.  This can't be said for the Netflix app.Which leads me to the Cons of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\": This tablet crashes - without warning - but I've only experienced the crashing when using apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem.  But when the Netflix app crashed on me yesterday it required me uninstalling the Netflix app, restarting, then adding the app back for it to work again.  Also, streaming music via bluetooth, which is all I do anymore (Spotify is a truly fantastic service that gets better everyday), can be tricky.  The bluetooth pairing struggled a bit the first time I tried it, but has since locked on seamlessly.  However, the Spotify app is a very stripped-down version compared to Apple's and Google's.  So much so that it is missing some pretty significant components that I will truly miss.  Further, last night after I paired it with my stereo system and launched a song on Spotify, it crashed.  When streaming SiriusXM at times there are gaps in the songs where the streaming fails a bit.  Maybe a system update will correct a lot of this (fingers crossed)?I understand that they are different machines in many ways, but comparing the Pros of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" to the Nexus 7 - the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" wins.  The Nexus 7 can't compete with the specs, particularly if you are a Prime member.  As a Prime member, I really get a kick out of the extras I get by also owning a Kindle.  The book lending alone is a truly fantastic perk.  Also, the display and sound on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" are truly remarkable especially when you consider that the device weighs so little!However, if you're looking for an all around tablet that will work both within and outside of the Amazon ecosystem (Spotify, SiriusXM, Kindle, and Netflix apps specifically), I'm sorry, but the Nexus wins.  I have yet to have an issue with crashing.  Pairing to bluetooth - no issues.  Streaming music and movies on the apps mentioned - no issues.  And by the way, I'll stream music for entire days without an issue.To top it off, rumor has it that Nexus is planning a Nexus 8 launch before the end of the year (the \"8\" referring to an 8\" size).So, needless to say, I will be weighing the pros and cons of trading in my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" for a Nexus 8 if that day comes.  iPad, however, will not be considered.UPDATE: Amazon let me return my HDX for a new one and the crashes have ceased.  Also, Spotify has been updated (finally), but the bluetooth streaming still struggles.  That being said, I love my HDX and have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

I wanted to like it since I have so much video media and books (eBooks and audio) purchased from amazon or amazon companies. I used the fire for a 10 hour bus trip and again on the way back. The battery lasted for the entire 10 hour trip and the fire was running about 75% of the time.As an entertainment device, movies, books, and audio it was very nice. I also loved the idea of downloading the movies and TV shows from amazon prime to watch off line when there wasn\u2019t any internet available. With 64GB I had plenty of room to load my device with mp4 movies I already owned to watch later. Strange you have to use the photo app on the kindle to watch a downloaded mp4 movie.The email was very easy to set up and worked seamlessly with my work email, a big plus. I purchased excel contacts (5 Star app by Sam YU, samapp.net, in kindle store) to load all my contacts from my ios device to an excel spreadsheet then to my kindle.Why I sent mine back.The operating system supporting apps needs more time to mature. The apps I commonly used were not always available on the fire and there were no substitutes.A problem I had I tried using the mayday feature. I wanted to convert my ios calendars to use on the kindle. I have hundreds of appointments, birthdates, anniversaries etc. plugged into a calendar already and I was trying to convert it. I used mayday to get information, she had no help for me. Next step for mayday, I asked if I converted the ios calendar to a google calendar (information on the web on how to do this) how do I change it to the kindle calendar. I kept getting a repeated message, which I believe she was reading, \"You can only use what is available in the kindle app store\". I wrote to Sam Yu, one of the developers at, samapp.net. They have the excel contact app (in kindle store) but they also have a great excel calendar app which I have used on ios and was hoping they were close to one for the kindle. No luck.ConclusionThere weren\u2019t enough PRIME movies or shows that I have not seen available for download. My main reason for purchasing the kindle hdx, to justify keeping the Kindle HDX. I also do not like you do not know if a movie or TV show can be downloaded until you click and open the movie options. Most of the newer movies and shows cannot and must be streamed and will not work without a fast internet connection. I had to spend a lot of time opening every movie or show to see which ones I could download to take on the bus with me. The internet provided at most places on the road, or on our bus, will not support streaming without the constant buffering stops.I ended up sending the kindle fire hdx back and purchased an IPad Mini retina. I\u2019m pretty sure square trades will transfer the warranty over so I just pay the upgrade in price. They told me to call them directly. I have not given up and will most likely purchase a kindle fire, maybe the next version.

If not, I would have returned it, but the other features are so nice, I really don't want to do that.  The Mayday feature worked great, I got help within 10 seconds.  And there are more than enough apps for anybody to be happy.**Update** - I have a lot of movies on my computer and the only way to view them in the Kindle is under Videos - Personal Collection.  The way they are displayed is very stupid!  They are displayed graphically in a grid with the first still shot of the movie showing, and there is no way to organize them by title.  So if you want to watch a particular movie, you have to guess and keep opening movies until you find the one you want.  I asked Mayday for help and they said it's not possible to do it any differently.  This may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for me.  I may be returning it for the iPad (in which you can just import anything into iTunes) if I can't figure out a way around this.  Downgraded to 3 stars, feedback given to Mayday.***Update #2: I downloaded a program called ES3 which allows you to copy files to the HDX and you can sort them however you want.  Some movies won't play (it seems to be the ones purchased through iTunes) but I've been satisfied enough with this program that I didn't return the HDX.  And they have added a \"Cloud Collections\" function to the HDX finally.Now that these issues are resolved, I'm really giving it 4.5 stars, and the only reason for the 1/2 point deduction is because it is just not nearly as easy and streamlined as the iPad in terms of watching movies and listening to music.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as good as the Kindle Fire HD", "Author": "Clyde Layton", "ReviewID": "R6UFTERKDKOX2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When they upgraded and downgraded the Kindle Fire HDX they removed the mini HDMI.

I had planned to just borrow his device for mobile reading.  I often find myself waiting for him to finish with an activity or work.  I had been using my smartphone, Android os, to read and play a few games.  However, the tiny screen was leading to major eyestrain.  I can read a paper book, but during the winter it is dark when I am waiting on him to finish work and I was running down the car battery to read, if I didn't use the phone.  There also were some issues with the Android os and the Kindle app, Amazon kindly fixed those, but the screen was still very small.With the latest sale price on the Kindle, I decided to go ahead and purchase one.  I had intended to purchase the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", but after some encouragement from my son, I purchased the 8.9\".  I was afraid the larger device would be awkward to tote around.  I was very wrong.  I am actually reading more since I purchased the HDX,  The device was fairly easy to set up.  I turned it on and signed in -- and it defaulted to mountain time zone.  I don't live there anymore and it was annoying to hunt to find where to change the time zone.  I ended up borrowing one of the Kindle guides and learned many interesting things about the device.The device is for me, most of the time, but I was pleased to find apps for studying for the GRE for my son who is a junior in college.  I also like the language apps which help us master correct pronunciation.Since I have a small iPod, I don't use the Kindle much for music, at least not yet.  It isn't portable enough to fit in my pocket when I exercise, therefore I cannot comment on the speakers.  We will likely use the device for watching Amazon prime movies, assuming the streaming doesn't eat up our internet allowance which is why we chose the larger size.  I also find the clarity of the screen and speed to be excellent.A few things I would like to see changed -- I read more than one book at once.  With this Kindle I can set more than one bookmark in a book, but I can't \"name\" the bookmarks -- one for where I'm reading, one for something of note....  I would also like to be able to have a tiny box or something to display the current time and battery icon when I am reading, or playing a game.  I know others won't want that, so I would like to see it be an option.I purchased the WiFi model because I could not afford 4G.  I am pleased that the device automatically connects to the WiFi devices it has \"met\" before, automatically.  One thing I learned early on, make certain to fully shut the device off to conserve battery power.  If used mostly for reading, the battery really will last 16 hours, or more, but only if fully shut down, in sleep mode it will continue to consume battery power.We don't watch much tv, although we love old movies.  We don't do social networks, I tend to be a more private person, so I wasn't certain if I could find enough uses to justify the Kindle purchase.  I was excited to find one of my favorite apps, Laudate available, and I can get an assortment of other theological resources easily.There are enough differences between the HD and the HDX that I am very happy I waited and purchased the faster and clearer device.  I do recommend a cover and if possible a padded bag for anyone who is as prone to dropping things as I am.  Actually, I have put my ID, credit card, and cell phone in the outside pocket of the padded bag and left everything else behind.  I purchased the set of 12 accessories at the same time I purchased the device.  The cover isn't fancy and if I use it often, I'll have to replace it within a year, but it is fine for now.I did not think I would like reading without the physical feel of a book in my hands.  Admittedly, I cannot close the book when I finish an electronic book with the same finality.  However, we already have 20 bookcases, very full, and I am reluctant to purchase more paper books without getting rid of some.  It will be so much easier to throw the Kindle in the vehicle and know I don't have to box up all the books included in it when my son head off to post-graduate work and studies!  I also love that I can change the font of the electronic books on days when my eyes are tired instead of digging out a stronger pair of reading glasses!I will next see how I like having the Kindle read to me, but that is another adventure.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen, good sound, a few  minor dislikes...", "Author": "CMB", "ReviewID": "R2DGYF70H05JY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a woman in my late 50's, computer savvy but not a techie, and I like electronic gadgets.  I thought long and hard about buying a tablet (do I really need one???), and then about which one to buy.  Based on reviews on both Amazon and other websites, I had a hard time deciding between the Google Nexus 7 (the 2013 model) and the Kindle Fire HDX.  After playing with both of them for about an hour in Staples, I decided on the Fire.  I was originally going to buy the smaller Fire but got the 8.9\" because I wanted to use it to watch videos.I really like it very much.  I'm not into apps, so it doesn't matter to me that I don't have access to the Google (or Apple) app store.  I use the Fire mainly for surfing, checking emails, watching video and listening to music. The interface is easy to learn and use, and things move with lightning speed.  The Fire does have an absolutely beautiful screen which makes watching videos a pleasure (the picture is much better than my TV).  I haven't actually purchased any videos but have found lots of things I like in the streaming videos.  Of course, this thing is an Amazombie's delight - it's easy (maybe too easy) to access videos, books, my Kindle library, etc.  I think the speakers sound pretty good on their own, but I got a little Jam speaker and also some bluetooth headphones and love listening to music via Pandora or my iTunes library.Some minor complaints:  I understand that the Silk browser is improved on the HDX, but I absolutely don't understand why it doesn't support Flash.  It would be much more useful if it did.  I installed the Dolphin browser, and can play flash videos, but Dolphin acts a little twitchy on the Fire.  Also, there's no way to organize bookmarks in Silk (there is in Dolphin).I wish that I didn't need a smart TV in order to mirror the screen and watch videos on my TV, but it could be time for a new TV anyway.  However, I've read other reviews and people are generally disappointed about not being able to use a cable to connect their Kindle to a TV while traveling.  It's too bad this feature was removed, but I knew that when I bought it.It's really easy to set up email accounts, but there's no way to organize email other than the standard folders.  Also, there appears to be no way to select all messages so I can delete them - I have to go through and select them one by one.  I wouldn't want to have this as my only was to receive and send email.I've had a couple of Kindle e-readers, and I like reading on the dedicated e-reader better than reading on the Fire.  It's nice to have color and the back lit screen is good sometimes, but there's a lot of glare.  The 8.9\" size is a bit heavy for reading.  I've had to get used to reading on it, and I still use my Kindle Touch a lot.In general I'm really pleased with the Kindle Fire, and I use it a lot rather than getting out my laptop.  Although as I said, I like gadgets, but I don't have a smart phone and the Fire is in between a smart phone and a laptop - very useful except for making phone calls!  I chose the Wi-Fi only version because I don't want to pay for a data plan, and it was great on a recent trip where there was Wi-Fi everywhere.  I didn't have to bring along the laptop but was able to have all my books, music, plus check out hotels etc. all in one small package.

This is the 6th Kindle we've owned in our family.  Our first foray into the Kindle world was the original Kindle Fire.  After that we purchased 2 of the second generation Kindle Fires and then I purchased a Kindle Fire HD 7inch.  We also have a basic Kindle e-reader.  Now, I've finally gotten the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.....the 8.9 HDX.  I'm not a techno whiz by any means, so I can't tell you about all the bells and whistles this little baby has.  What I can tell you is that it is super user friendly and almost absurdly easy to use.  This tablet is now my primary means of surfing the web, watching videos, checking email, as well as reading.  It's like an all in one entertainment center.  I love the bigger 8.9 screen.  The additional ability to categorize my books into collections is awesome!  I have so many books, I often overlook ones that I've yet to read.  Furthermore, when I'm in the mood for a particular type of book I would have to search through my entire library to figure just what to read, and then oftentimes I'd forget whether a specific book was of the genre I was looking for.  Now that I've organized my books by genre, I no longer have that problem.  I love it!  My only complaint is that, while I am still able to review a book directly after reading it on my tablet, Amazon has removed the ability to edit the review once it's been submitted.  So many times after I submit a review I realize, after rereading it, that I've made some grammatical error.  Now because I am no longer able to edit the review once it's submitted, I have to go online via \"Silk\" and find my review in order to do the editing.  It is a bit of a pain in the....., but not overly so.  Otherwise, this tablet is just about perfect.  My husband has an Ipad and I would not give up this tablet for that one EVER!

Finally, this December my hubby and I ordered one as my Christmas gift. Christmas day I pulled it out of the box and everything worked perfectly. However, early January I went to turn on my new Kindle in the morning and nothing. Dead. I followed the suggestions given on the Amazon website, but to no avail. Called customer service, and they end up sending me a new Kindle. I was truly bummed that my new device was faulty, but Amazon's customer service was excellent!So, after playing with my second Kindle and reading other reviews, here are my thoughts on this device.1. I love most everything about this Kindle, the light weight, the features, etc. Things that drive me a little crazy include the fact that the power and volume buttons are on the back.  It is awkward to feel around for the volume button while you are watching a video or whatever.2. Mayday is helpful but a little creepy. So, I was trying to figure out how to open Word documents that were sent as attachments via email. I had purchased the OfficeSuite Professional App and had no problems opening documents sent via Yahoo mail, but couldn't figure out how to use it for Gmail. I pushed the Mayday button and right away had a customer service rep online. He walked me through the issue. At first I thought \"This tech is so cool. He can see/control everything on my Kindle,\" followed by, \"Oh, that is kind of creepy.\" Not that this is any different then was Dell or any other computer customer service can do with your permission on your computer, it just struck me a little weird. BTW, contrary to other reviews, you can open email attachments on this Kindle from both Yahoo and Google mail servers.3. I love the video quality when watching something on this device, but not sure why they did not include an HDMI outlet so that you could watch on other devices, like your TV.4. Having Amazon Prime is definitely worth it, you just need to be aware of its limits. We have had Amazon Prime for years and use at least one of its features almost daily, whether it is free shipping, the free movies/TV, or checking out a free book from the Kindle collection. Amazon's new feature lets you download some (that should be capital SOME) Primes movies and TV programs.5. I have yet to find a cover/case that I really love for this device. I have the Amazon Origami case and the MarBlue Ultra Lightweight Origin Case for Kindle Fire. Neither have all the features I am looking for, like really good protection. If you have any suggestions I would like to hear them.6. I will probably continue to read books mostly on my Kindle keyboard e-reader. I work on a computer during the day. When I go to read at night I find the back-lit screens really bother my eyes. I have read on this Kindle just fine, but I prefer the size and screen of my Kindle e-reader for long stretches of reading.7. I would recommend setting up some parent controls, even if you are the only one using your Kindle. Once you turn on the controls you can go into the settings and choose the controls you want to use. For example, I want my Kindle to ask for a password before a purchase is made or a video is watched, just in case I accidentally hit a button or my kids happen to be using it.8 If for any reason you have to return your Kindle, I was  told by a customer service rep to deactivate the Kindle from your account for security reasons, even though the first thing Amazon does it delete all information on returned Kindles.9.

All accessible to our devices and smart phones.EmotionWe love it. By \"we\" I mean me, my wife and our 5 year old daughter, who has been using it since she was 3. She would have been using it earlier but we didn't have one.ConstructionIt is very thin, very fast and elegant. More-so than the HD version. The original Fire, which is highly functional, seems very primitive by comparison. Now one of our original Fire's broke. Amazon was kind enough to give us $75 credit on it. For this we are very grateful.FunctionalityMy wife is a Database developer and has resources that help her with her job.I am a musician. I have wonderful books, a 4 track mixer, can write notes, take video notes... browse the web, run apps, games, movies. it is beyond my wildest dreams and I am very impressed. At this stage in my life it takes a lot to impress me, but this has a lot.My daughter has tons of games (minecraft, reading apps, etc) that she adores. The worst thing is we have strive to limit her. Now the kindle will do that for us, but we still reserve the right to do that. She's very careful with her \"Piggy\" as she calls it. This is based on an early application (2 years back) that featured a \"Piggy\". Well, she loves it. We all call our kindles \"Piggies\" because of this.LongevityI don't know how it will hold up. I pray it will last years. I can see using it for years if it does. I can't imagine what Amazon's engineers will come up with in the coming years. It's yet another reason to fight to stay alive. I am amazed by technology. I rank this right up there with innovations such as the Kemper and almost the cell phone. It's just amazing and a game changer. IMHO, easily the leader in it's field.Tech SupportAmazon's tech support is top notch and second to none. They make a mistake they'll break their backs to fix it. If carriers make a mistake they do their best to make it right and then some. They don't have to, but this reinforces good-will and makes us come back to them time and time again. We love amazon. This product is tied to amazon and their success and quality shines through in this product. They deserve all of their success.Originality and other tabletsThere are many tablets on the market. The key competitor is the iPad and the two are very comparable. The iPad's keys to success are it's larger screen and it's elegant programs. It's weakness is it's cloud is too proprietary compared to the Kindle. I have two iTouches and like the elegant, well designed programs, but dislike iTunes. The Kindle beats the iPad in every other department. The Kindle HDX is less expensive, the programs are usually on par or close to Apple, and the resolution is actually higher on the HDX. The HDX also boast a faster quad core processor. This might be negated by the higher resolution of the Kindle but the difference is negligible.VerdictBoth. I would be happy with an iPad and a Kindle. If I had to choose one it would be the Kindle. Amazon has found a way to worm themselves into our lives and our hearts. Their relatively low priced kindle, great shipping, excellent selection of everything has done it. They are part of our culture with south park making episodes based on UPS/Amazon deliveries and so forth. It's a huge deal and probably the beginning of something larger than we can imagine.

If you want the tech specs, you can read them on the page for the tablet. So I won't repeat them here. I have and have had a number of tablets including the iPad AIR, iPad 3rd gen, iPad 7\", Nexus 7, Nexus 7 2nd gen, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 8, and an Asus 10\" (I don't remember the model). So I am very familiar with the different models and operating systems.I had a Kindle Fire Hd 7\" that I sold because I didn't like the carousel, and getting to apps that I wanted to used wasn't convenient. The color, resolution, and sound were fine for my purposes to watch Amazon movies and to uses some apps, but it was cumbersome as compared to other android tablets that I had. Apps couldn't be grouped or organized as they could be on other tablets, and every app used was added to the carousel making the carousel lengthy and virtually useless.I decided to give the Kindle Fire HDX a try in hopes that some of the disappointments I experienced with the Fire HD were resolved. I have had the Kindle Fire HDX only a couple of days, but so far, I am impressed with the improvements. It still has the carousel, that can be useless if you use a number of apps or new apps are added - all are added to the carousel. Those that you don't use often have to be remove, one-by-one, manually. It would be nice if adding apps to the carousel was an option so that only most used apps could be added. (Hint to Amazon).On the plus side, you can now view all of your installed apps and execute them by swiping up in the screen. You can also group your apps into collections, or folders, and name the folders. In addition, apps in the apps view can be arranged in a way that makes sense to you by dragging and dropping them into position. In this matter, the Kindle Fire HDX function much more like other android tablets and is a huge improvement over previous versions of the Kindle Fire. This versions offers much more user control for organization and usage of the tablet.A couple other improvements that are obvious to me are the resolution and the crisp true colors. The colors on the screen really do \"pop\". In comparison to other tablets that I have, the touch response is extremely good, and the accuracy of the on-screen keyboard has been flawless. In addition, moving from the carousel to the apps screen and going from one app to another has been very smooth. There is no lag at all.I did have an opportunity access Mayday, that is reached by clicking the \"?\" icon. I used this at 3am, and go almost an immediate response. The representative was very helpful and answered all of my questions. I did find out that many of the Google apps are not compatible with the Kindle Fire HDX because developers have not made them compatible. They hope that this will change with future updates to the OS. In my experience, developers of apps have most developed the iPad apps and then the Google apps. The Google apps never seem to be quite as good as the iPad apps. Now that Amazon has developed  a very capable tablet, maybe developers will start to create more apps that are compatible. This is yet to be seen. In the meantime, users of the Kindle tablets are pretty much limited to apps available on Amazon other than a few Google apps that may be compatible.At this point, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX tor android flexibility, the improved display, and for use with Amazon Prime deals.

We purchased both of our Kindle Fire 8.9's with 32 GM of memory, without the special offers feature.We want to emphasize that the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a very fine tablet, and if you do not have the extra funds to purchase the HDX 8.9, you should purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 while they are still available from Amazon for $229. The two are very close in the quality of still and video graphics. At this price, they are an incredible bargain.Nevertheless, we were very pleased (amazed might be a better term) by the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. In the following commentary, keep in mind we are comparing the HDX to the HD 8.9.The new HDX 8.9 is noticeably lighter to hold, yet retains the solid build quality of the original 8.9. As far as still graphics are concerned, the colors are more vivid, contrast is even higher, blacks appear even blacker. In short, the display is amazingly impressive!  Comparing the two tablets side by side, it is as if the original image is being viewed through a very slight polarizing filter on the original HD 8.9.As far as viewing Video content, we noticed very little difference between the two tablets, with the original KF HD 8.9 perhaps having a slight edge. Both are excellent, movie picture quality varies widely. If you are a Prime member, try The Robe, or Contact if you want to see just how good the video quality truly is. The soundtrack on Contact showcases the sound quality possible with these tablets.The rear/back facing camera is fun to use, color is quite accurate. The camera is effective in relatively low light situations with low \"noise\". If high picture quality is required, we would recommend using your digital camera.The sound quality seems to be slightly better on the new model, which might be due to the altered position of the dual speakers. If you are watching a movie, you will definitely want to use high quality lightweight headphones. With these, the sound quality is very impressive.The New Silk browser is greatly improved.  Internet browsing is significantly faster with snappy response.Battery life is significantly improved, we noticed at least a 20% increase in useable battery life.Overall, the new Kindle FIre HDX 8.9 has managed to improve an already excellent screen image,  provide slightly better sound, added a useful rear/back facing camera, while being significantly lighter in weight.There really isn't anything we would describe as being negative with this tablet. Some icons, apps, and text appear slightly smaller in size because of the increased screen resolution, and one of our apps did not run properly on the new Kindle fire. If a reset is required, one must now depress the power button for a full 20 seconds, release, and repress the button to allow the kindle to reset. We only experienced one lockup requiring a reset, which we are sure was software related.If Amazon is still offering the four payment plan, there is no better time to purchase or upgrade. If not, we still are impressed enough to spend the full $444 for the 32G KF HDX 8.9, without special offers. (If you opt for 16GB and special offers, the price is less).

However, I had seen some of the reviews referring to how light the HDX was and my husband was like, well my little tech junky would you like that for Christmas. I of course did some research on the forums and said yes.  Now, one caveat, if you get frustrated with not being able to get a specific app you really want, be sure to go to the forums, I have not yet found an app that I couldn't get one way or another so I'm very happy with this light little unit.

The Kindle Fire HDX could possibly be my favorite of the three (although they are all excellent devices).1) LOVE the form factor.  It's unbelievably light and makes the iPad Air, which I was previously amazed by, feel chunky in comparison.2) Fast processor and zippy graphics.  No lag in the user interface.  Everything loads up instantaneously and even graphically demanding games like Riptide GP run as smooth as butter.3) Great Amazon interface that gives me access to my Amazon Prime videos and video library (which I do not get on my Nexus).  I own many movies and TV shows in my Amazon library and it is nice to have access to these, as well as the dozens of Kindle books I own.4) Kid friendly options like Kindle free time offer tons of content for parents to let their kids enjoy.5) Mayday option is pretty cool.  I tried it out twice when I had some general questions about Kindle Fire OS and the representatives were friendly and helpful.  I never had to wait more than 10 seconds for a representative to appear.Here is how I would compare the devices:vs iPad AirI can do anything on my iPad Air that I can do on my Kindle Fire HDX, plus I have access to all of my Apple content.  The app environment is MUCH richer for the iPad then it is for the Kindle Fire HDX as there are many more apps and especially many more tablet optimized apps.Having said that the Kindle Fire is significantly cheaper and is also lighter, and Amazon pretty much has everything you need in terms of Apps, books, and media content.  So I would say that the Kindle Fire HDX is a poor man's iPad Air that is almost as good and would satisfy the great majority of consumers.  I also prefer the slightly smaller form factor and lighter weight of the Fire HDX.vs Nexus 7The Nexus 7 has a better app environment through Google play.  However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 has access to the video content from Amazon Prime and a bigger screen, more storage, and more powerful graphics and CPU.  I honestly like the HDX 8.9 better and would choose this between the two if I could only have one.  The Nexus 7 is still a great tablet though, especially for the price.  This is just a personal preference for me.  But Nexus 7 is the way to go if you are an Android fanatic or prefer a richer app environment.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A tablet superior to the iPad Air ( have both)", "Author": "Dominic Wu \"Digitari\"", "ReviewID": "R86F65N2CG4XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is thinner, lighter, and has a better screen than the 800 lbs gorilla in the tablet market, especially considering that if you are viewing this review chances are you are already part of the Amazon ecosystem.  The HDX integrates with Amazon seamlessly making everything you do just works even better.  Your Kindle books (many free ones), your Android apps through Amazon app shop, Prime Instant Video streaming (ironically available on iOS but not Android).  Granted, it would have been nice to have the Play store feature but that would make the HDX with Mojito just another super thin and light Android tablet with a beautiful screen.  No star subtracted since it is meant to provide a complete user experience and differentiate itself from the other offerings.  The size is perfect and the way it balances in your hand, the placement of buttons (only 3, Power, Vol+ and Vol-) are all subtle yet greatly appreciated design choices..  I cant say enough good things about this tablet.  If you are in the market, have Prime, this is a no brainer.  About the only thing that could make this a better tablet is an even lower price to really seed the market.

However, I have had some hiccups with service quality worth noting.The big issue is that the device would not download anything a couple of days ago, with everything just hanging in the queue. I hit the Mayday button, and someone eventually called me back. This was the second time I used Mayday, and the second time I was shifted over to someone else on a different platform. So, to be clear: Mayday is not a tech support service, but what you use when you can't figure out how to crop an image or something else simple. Considering the considerable amount of promotion around instant customer service via Mayday, this is a massive limitation and is the reason for one of the missing stars in this review.I received a phone call from an Amazon rep immediately after getting off the line with the Mayday rep, and this phone interaction lasted more than an hour. He made an earnest effort to help, but it actually made the problem worse. See the attached video - which I made for an earlier and considerably different draft of this review - to see what happened. I actually lost access to my book library. I eventually fixed this myself, by resetting to factory default. But, this then required more than an hour of re-customizing my device.On top of this, five graphic novels I purchased for the Kindle are only downloading in low-resolution files, making them look outright blurry. This appears to be a software issue, since a service rep was able to download higher res files to his device. It is automatically pushing these five - and just these five - titles to my device in inferior quality. I did both a Mayday call and an e-mail about this about two weeks ago, with no resolution, and no follow-up until yesterday.A very friendly customer service rep called me last night and took notes on both the major problem that led to the reset, and the graphic novel issue. He is still researching the latter.I hope that these are temporary issues that are just coming with a new launch and that I will be able to add another star to this review soon. However, until I can get content I paid for at a reasonable quality and go a few more weeks without having to reset my device (note: I never had to reset my original model Kindle Fire in two years of ownership), I am hesitant to enthusiastically recommend this, despite the awesome hardware.Note: This review is almost completely rewritten from the original post, reflecting some responses from Amazon.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Light, Thin, an iPad contender", "Author": "Chow", "ReviewID": "RS7WXHXW7G2P3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an improvement over the Kindle Fire HD!

It's been a good tablet, a workhorse for me, but it's past it's prime.  I initially balked at the Fire when it was first introduced.  Not enough apps, the presentation was so different, etc.  But a few months ago, I ran thru all the apps I use every day and they were all offered by Amazon's App Store.  Combine that with the fact that I'm an Amazon super-user, I decided to take the plunge and get the Kindle HDX 8.9.Well, I've been using it non-stop for about 6 hours and it's awesome.  Display is fantastic, very light, Everything loads fast, video streams well, and my books look great. (No blue tint on border that I can see.  I've read in different settings and lighting, and no color tinge of any kind.)As an Amazon Prime and Audible member, I was also looking forward to their integration into the Fire.  It is great!  Amazon Video is fully integrated and I can even download some shows, apparently.  Haven't tried it, but looking forward to it.  Great option for traveling, I think.  And with Audible integrated into the Fire, you can do immersion reading if you own both the Kindle and Audio versions of a book.  That sounded cool to me when I heard it . . . and it is!  I recommend it to all readers out there.  A lot of great deals to be had as well i.e. Many Kindle books have a deal that once you purchase the ebook, you can purchase the Audible version for $.99-3.99 Great deals.The only thing I'm working thru is getting used to the interface.  It's pretty, and it makes sense, but it's new to me so there's a bit of learning curve.  But I'm getting there.Lots of other bells and whistles, but that's my initial impressions.  I wholly recommend it to anyone looking for a high performance tablet at a reasonable price.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, but does lack a little.", "Author": "Jackie Gill", "ReviewID": "R3LUD8QO8WX33L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am giving this 5 stars because it really is beautiful, has an outstanding display, and is very light. However, it does have some limitations.What I like:The display! I have had an original iPad, a 4th generation iPad with Retina, and an iPad mini - this display blows them out of the water.The speed: This pad works flawlessly. There are no hangups, no freezes, and no stuttering during video playback.iCal CAN sync with this: Many will say that your iCal cannot sync with your Droid based devices. YES IT CAN. All of my computers are Macs and I love iCal. Furthermore, my Macs store all of my contacts and task lists. There are apps that will sync your contacts, calendar, and your tasks. I use CalDav-Sync available via Kindle store and Google play and everything I update on my Mac shows up on my Note 3 and Kindle HDX. I do not care for the included Kindle calendar (I am a big calendar person) so I also bought AwesomeCalendar and it is a great calendar app. CalDav also works to update this calendar with all of my information on my Mac and I never have to do a thing to make it happen.Reading Features: I considered the following before purchasing this Kindle: iPad mini with retina, Samsung Note 8.2\", and a Kindle HDX 7. I am pretty tired of Apple products. I am not saying they aren't great, and it is the only computer I will buy, but I like new things. Each time I purchased a new i-product it seemed so much like the previous that it just didn't feel new. Therefore, even though the new Mini with retina is beautiful, I ruled it out. I really like the size, shape, and feel of the new Samsung Note 8.2.\" Samsung went back to black and moved away from that strange brown decision and I love the ability to use the stylus. Plus, I also switched from an iPhone to a Note 3, so this means all of the Apps I have purchased in Google Play would be available for my pay as well. So, this being said, the Samsung Note 8.2\" was almost my new pad. However, it is very similar to my Note 3 and the the Kindle beats everyone in one area: READING. Yes, you can get the Kindle app on your other products, but you can't get immersion reading. I have not built my library via iBooks, luckily I have purchased all of my books via Kindle. So, when I opened my box and pulled out my new Kindle, they were all there. I am a PhD student in the dissertation phase, so I read A LOT. not all of my books have been available via Kindle, but when they are they are less expensive and I love the note taking features. I do think the note taking features and highlighting works better on the Kindle than it does through the Kindle app. You are allowed multiple highlighting colors to choose from, it keeps track of my notes and reading on all of my devices, and you can get the audio versions of the books (if available) for very good prices. I have been an Audible fan for a long time. I know many do not care for audio versions, they prefer to read. Immersion reading combines them! This is WONDERFUL for me because I like to accomplish tasks while listening to a book, but if I need to highlight something, the immersion reading will show me where I am and I don't have to hunt. This is a big upgrade and what tipped my decision to make this purchase. Now, at the time I was not thinking about actually carrying this thing around while I listened, and the 8.9 is a little large for that, perhaps the 7 would have been the better choice, but the 8.9 isn't too heavy and I can always listen on my sisters 7\", or i-product if I am moving around and it will sync with my 8.9\" to let me know exactly where I left off.The organization of the Home screen: I really like the carousel and the folders that you place apps in. Unlike Apple app folders, the Kindle allows you to place many apps in a folder (this may have changed in recent Apple IOS updates, not sure).Weight: Very light! I like the feel of this pad. It is lighter than the iPad air and does not feel cheap to me (the 7 inch does not feel substantial enough to me).Aesthetics: I love the all over black! I find this to be a beautiful pad. Comparing it to the iPads, I cannot say that one is better looking than the other because I think they are both beautiful in their different ways; however, this has a rubberized back that makes it MUCH easier to hold onto. I also prefer the shape. iPad is a little wider and I don't think it is necessary. I prefer the more 16:9 shape. I had a very difficult time deciding on whether to buy this because of size. I found that an 8\" display was perfect. The full size iPad was too large and too heavy. The iPad mini was just right, although I still prefer the more rectangular look of the Kindle 8.9\" and Samsung 8\". I felt the 7\" Kindle was just too small. The 7\" feel a little cheap to me and there just isn't enough screen for reading. Moving back up from the 8\" mini made me nervous. I will say that I do wish this Kindle was slightly smaller. Even moving down to an 8.3 - 8.5 would probably help, but it is not overwhelming. I am still happy that I chose the 8.9\" over the 7\" and I really do like the size and shape when viewing movies.Ability to download free content: One of the big pluses of a Kindle is Prime. I know you can download content from iTunes and get movies and such that way, but I have NO DESIRE to pay $20 for a download I will watch once. We take a road trip every summer and WiFi/4G is not always available. Plus, streaming via 4G eats up a lot of data. So, I wanted to be able to download movies and TV to watch on the road. You can do this with Prime and they do have free content (I'll also discuss this more under what I don't like). Amazon also gives away a free paid App a day. This is pretty cool. I log in every day and download most of them. Most are games, I would like more variety, but they are free :-).Origami Case: if you buy the Kindle HDX 8.9 or 7, I highly recommend the origami case. For my previous i-products I have purchased multiple cases and contraptions to hold them where and how I wanted them. Never has any case been as nice and met all of my needs like this one. I did and do not like the price of this case. It is about even with Apple brand leather iPad cases, but those are incredibly overpriced as well (and I do not like Apple smart covers, they are far inferior to this case). However, this case, at least, does a GREAT job. I did choose the leather and I am glad I did. It feels like a very nice quality leather, has not scuffed, smells good, and the Kindle fits it perfectly. The case also allows you to easily push the Kindle up to take photos, control power, and control volume. My sister bought one of the non-leather origami cases for her Kindle HDX 7, and while the case functions just the same and is a great color, I really prefer the leather - it just feels better, looks nice, and has a leather rather than chemical smell. The magnets in this case are great, holds very securely, and they turn the unit on and off. The case folds back flat, or holds the unit vertically or horizontally; and, if you like to read it bed, it does a great job of holding the Kindle up on your stomach or on a pillow. Again, while I agree this case is expensive, I do believe it is the only case I will need to buy for my Kindle.What I don't Like:Number one biggest complaint - DESKTOP BACKGROUND and Home screen images. You cannot change them! This is crazy to me. I did not expect this and I am disappointed. This in no way has anything to do with the function of the device, but I really like personalizing. I chose no advertising - there is enough of that in the world - and I removed the Amazon recommends section on the home-screen; but, that is where my choices ended. I cannot change the black background and I cannot choose what images greet me when I open my cover. I don't know if Amazon chose to do this because of their advertisers and/or for ease of help via MayDay (which I have never used, it isn't a complicated tablet), but I DO NOT LIKE IT. I want to open my pad and be greeted by my Boston Terrier, not a generic picture (although the lock screen images are pretty nice looking). I think this could be easily fixed via software update, but I also assume Amazon left this common feature out on purpose and doesn't plan to include it.Amazon Prime Free Content: I stream via Prime and Netflix and between the two I get most of what I want. However, I wanted to be able to download shows and movies and take them on the road with me. First, know that this EATS YOUR MEMORY. I chose the 64GB pad and it doesn't take much to fill it if you choose HD - a couple of movies and a few episodes of a show and you are full. You can choose lower quality, but it does look inferior on this exceptional screen. Downloading HD is also incredibly slow. I have pretty fast connection, but HD takes forever! That being said, the worst part is that there really isn't much to download. Sure, Prime offers a lot, however the majority of Prime cannot be downloaded. Hopefully this will change, but this is a feature that I was hoping to get a lot more out of.Size: The jump from a 7\" to an 8.9\" is pretty big. I wish they would offer an 8.2 - 8.5.\" It would be a little more slender, easier to fit in a large pocket and easier to hold with one hand. One thing I like about the 7\" is that I can hold and control it with one hand. The 8.9\" requires two hands. Still the size it much better than the full size iPad.App Store: I don't feel the app store is all that lacking. It is pretty extensive and serves most of my purposes. Unfortunately I have had to purchase duplicate apps because my iTunes purchases obviously don't transfer and Kindle does not use the Google Play store. The perfect device would allow purchases from all of them, but I get that this won't work. There are apps in all three app stores that are not available for one or the other. So, there are still apps on my i-products that I can't find for my Android devices and there are apps via Droid that I can't find for my i-products.Final thoughts: The perfect pad for me would be around 8.3 inches, include a Samsung-like stylus, have the power and performance of i-products, work with an app store that has all apps for all platforms, be very customizable, be very light, and include all of the reading features and Prime features of Kindle. It would also fit in an Origami case because it really is the best case I have used. That being said, at this point, Kindle simply offers more of what I am looking for in a tablet. I don't know if my perfect pad will ever exist, but, in the mean time, this one is pretty great!", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "HDX 8.9 is Fantastic and and the Installment Plan is Great!", "Author": "TLS", "ReviewID": "R9BJL8VK3HJ9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a Kindle from the 2nd generation through PaperWhite.  I have looked at the Fire for quite a while but was not sure how the reading experience would be.  Then I saw I could pay for a Fire on a no-interest installment plan - so I went for it.  The marketing beauty of the installment plan is that it lets you upgrade to the larger size Fire over five payments rather than one big lump.  Memo to Jeff Bezos: smart, very smart in coming out with the installment plan.Now about the Fire experience.  It is great on all fronts - I've watched a movie, read The Week magazine, and read a book.  Looked at YouTube videos using the free app.  Downloaded other apps.  The screen is so sharp, the 8.9 size is great and it's not too heavy, the battery life is pretty close to stated, and the interface is very easy to understand.  Since I have the PaperWhite, a lot of the learning curve was already taken care of.  However, even if you have never used a Kindle product, the interface is very intuitive.Of course, the breadth and depth of the Amazon ecosystem means just about any book, digital magazine, movie, or whatever is available with one click (maybe that's why Amazon calls it \"one click\").  And Prime means you can see a lot of movies and TV shows at no cost (think Downtown Abbey, Hunger Games and 007 Skyfall).  Getting Prime if all you are looking for is video content may not be the best deal at $99 (I paid $79 in the last few days before the rate went up).  However, if you do a lot of Amazon purchases, the 2nd day shipping is awesome and on top of that you get video content!The Fire 8.9 out of box experience was great.

If all you are doing is reading long form text in books, the PaperWhite is the best solution.

I explained that we were talking about RAM and that it only had 2 GB so they said well in that case it is bad!  So again they replaced it.  This one so far is perfect.

Apple puts not effort into the audio experience of their tablets and laptops, assuming, I guess, that everyone will want to use those damned earbuds all the time.  I got really tired of plugging in an external Logitec stereo device into my iPad 3 whenever I wanted to watch a movie, really tired.  Make no mistake, the HDX's speakers don't generate a concert-like experience, but it's far better than the iPad Air.  I also found the reduction in size and better display resolution to be helpful for reading.  Easier to hold, and fonts are rendered far more smoothly on the HDX display than Apple's retinal screen.  Steve Jobs would have to agree.  I don't understand why buyers would rather put up with continuous advertising than paying the few extra bucks for the ad-free version of the Fire HDX.  The HDX's version of Android also is kind of annoying.  Transferring movies from computer to tablet requires third-party software to remove DRM coding, whereas with Apple and even the plain Kindle Fire, movies are a simple drag and drop task.  Android's a pretty decent OS, but you wouldn't know it by the HDX.  You also have to be careful with Amazon Prime video.  Amazon subtly combines rental/purchase movies & TV with it's free Prime content, and it's pretty easy to press 'Watch Instantly' and later find out you've paid $5.00 to rent a movie.  You also probably notice a yellow cast to the display, especially with skin tones.  This is likely intentional to make the display appear better than it is, but I don't know why the Kindle makers thought this necessary since it's already the best display out there.  OK, so most Kindle buyers will likely just read, watch video and surf the web.  The HDX is very light & handy for doing these things.  Look at the limited accessories & general apps available and you'll understand it's not good to overreach with this devise. You will look silly bringing a Kindle to that important conference. My only other suggestion is to go with a vinyl skin rather than a TPU cover or folding case to protect your Kindle HDX.  I tried a TPU cover and it just bugged me. The Kindle Fire HDX  is really thin and light.

They will tell you that you are limited to Amazons selection of apps, which is insufficient.  That the Kindles are only good if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber.  Well, that is simply not true of these newest tablets.  While the Amazon app store is not complete, it does have a ton of the most popular apps.  If you can't find what you need there, you can do an internet search and find out how to load any Android app on your Kindle.  And it is not rocket science.  The interlinking of Amazons content to the Kindle can not be shortchanged.  It is wonderful how my wife and I have all of our music, pictures, documents and videos stored in Amazons cloud and can access them easily, very easily, wherever we are.  The ability to watch many Amazon prime videos is amazing.  We are sold on this tablet.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.

We added it to our mobile share plan with AT&T; so that my wife would have access to email and the internet anywhere she wants it.  She can also use a mapping program and since this unit has GPS, she can use it instead of her separate GPS unit when traveling.  She is in the process of converting to using the tablet instead of the daily planner she has been using for years to keep track of appointments and important dates as well as keep notes in.

I knew early on that the Kindle HDX was not meant to be a full featured tablet like the Thrive and Nexus. But I was still disappointed at how much Amazon unnecessarily left out or disabled features that are common on Android tablets. The Mojito OS takes some getting used to even if you are accustomed to Android, not seeing a whole list of configuration options was a little jarring. But overall the HDX OS performed very smoothly.PROS:- Lightweight. About a third of what my Thrive tablet used to weigh.- Great display and video.- Sound was clear and crisp.- Nice case texture and screen. The back has a subtle rubber texture that makes it very easy and comfortable to hold. The screen is super smooth; it feels like you're moving your finger on an oily surface.- Painless E-Mail & Calendar Sync. I was able to connect my Google GMail account to the HDX's email client quickly and easily. However the email & calendar client are basic and limited in what they can show. For example my GMail Inbox message categories did not carry over into the HDX email client.- Speedy performance. I was able to stream Prime movies with no noticeable lag.- Connection to Amazon.com was seamless. When I took my HDX out of the box it recognized me right away and connected me to my account.- Mayday Tech Support. Really works as advertised. I was connected to a tech adviser in about 30 seconds. He was knowledgeable although he did misunderstand my initial problem and I had to interrupt to correct him.CONS:- Speech-to-Text(Voice Dictation). This is a new feature that was added in an update after my purchase. Is accurate but is noticeably slower than the voice recognition in other Android devices.- No GPS. I have read conflicting reports on whether or not the HDX has GPS or not. Either way using your HDX with GPS enabled apps is a no go.- No Haptic Feedback. It would've been nice to have a tablet that provided tactile feedback for text entry and games.- Bad photos with the Camera. My HDX took pics that were very grainy with inaccurate color. The photo options available for the HDX are also very limited. About the only things that you can change while taking a picture are the flash and panorama modes. You cannot adjust the white levels, spot metering, etc.- Limited personalization options. On my old Android tablet I like being able to organize my apps as I saw fit. Also I liked being able to change the wallpaper every now and them. There is no way to do these things with the HDX.At this point I'm torn on whether to keep my HDX or to return it. I like the idea of watching Prime Movies on a tablet even if I am not connected to the internet. However not having basic tablet functions is very frustrating. Also Amazon makes no promises that the problems will be addressed in the future. All I was told by Kindle Support was that a new update was coming soon.

Sherman", "ReviewID": "R1W5FBZXY74ODH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon sent me this tablet free for 30 days.  I was in the market for a new tablet anyway so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to test the kindle.  I own a first generation iPad retina already and I'm looking to possibly upgrade to the Air.  Amazon puts the Kindle HDX 8.9 directly against the Air.I will start the comparison with my current retina.  When I unpacked the HDX the first thing that stands out is the weight of the machine.  It's very light and comfortable to hold.  Seams appear tight, however the plastic housing feels a bit cheap.  No doubt they used the plastic to cut weight but it does not have a quality feel and I worry about it's durability.  Next I plugged the HDX in, the plug is either purposefully angled awkwardly up (I doubt it) or it's just poorly aligned when built.  The plug works, but it is not anywhere as smooth to plug as the lightning plug on my 5s and on the new air.  It's about as easy to plug as the old Apple 30 pin on my retina.Once it was fired up and ready to roll the home screen is fairly spartan.  I decided to open my Amazon cloud account and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my stuff there and waiting.  Your Amazon account is very nicely linked to HDX.  I pulled up BB King's \"Live in Japan\" on both the HDX and my Retina iPad and did some side by side audio.  There is no easy way to put this, the HDX is an audio dud with the external speakers.  the iPad was capable of getting much louder, clearer and better bass response.  I tried with both on flat hard surfaces and holding in hand.  I use the external speakers when I'm working on projects around the house and want some music around so this is a fairly important feature to me.  Next came the headphones test.  Both performed equally with my Klipsch S4i headphones and my Sennheiser over ear headphones.My Amazon prime streaming was very handy on the HDX.  Easy to access and I had zero issue streaming HD quality movies.When it comes to the screen it's a bit off a toss up between the Retina and the HDX.  The HDX is capable of a slightly sharper image thanks to the higher resolution but the Retina has better colors...The HDX display just looked dull.  Whites appeared with a distinct yellow tint and nothing seemed to pop off the screen. Try as I might, I could not get it to display colors as well as my Retina.  But again, the resolution is sharper on the HDX so you need to decide whats more important to you.  To me, the colors are far more important so I will say that I prefer the Retina display, slightly, but it's still my preference.In terms of general use.  I do not, at all, like the lay out of the HDX.  Simply finding things is much more of a chore compared to the iOS layout.  This might be more to do with the fact that I'm very accustomed to iOS, but I would like to think that a well laid out tablet is something that you can pick up and it feels great right away.  I never really had a learning curve on any iOS device, it was all fairly natural.  It's hard to blame Amazon here, ease of use is something Apple has been leading the industry on for a long time, but Amazon does have a long way to go to catch Apple here.Next I did some simple web browsing.  Silk on the HDX was VERY disappointing...It's a standard web browser, but it was not smooth at all.  Load times were twice that of my Retina and scrolling up and down pages was vert stuttered.  Safari on my Retina is very smooth and very quick.  Keep in mind this is a two year old machine.Besides Safari Vs. Silk, the Retina and HDX seemed to run at about the same pace, if not slightly quicker on the Retina.  Very upsetting considering the Retina by Apple terms is a slug now.  In all reality my 5s runs circles around the HDX.When I was visiting a friend that I know picked up a brand new Air, I brought the HDX with me to do a direct head to head.  Now that it's all said and done, Amazon has zero business comparing the HDX to anything Apple is producing today...The Air just blew the HDX out of the water in nearly every aspect.  Once again, the only thing the HDX had on the Air was the resolution.  The Air loaded everything faster, was snappy and smooth as butter.The HDX is lighter, but it's also a smaller screen...IF you consider the extra screen size, the weight difference is in my opinion a non factor.  Add to that the Air keeps that solid quality Apple feel with it's metal case.  I found the Air to feel very light and nearly as tiresome to hold as my Retina.With the Air everything that has bothered me about my Retina since the latest rollout of iOS is fixed.  Mainly my Retina is now a bit laggy.  Most notably when typing.  The HDX touchscreen keyboard was hands down the worst part of it.  Almost impossible to type on in my opinion.  Laggy and a lot of mistypes compared to my iPad and even my 5s.All in all, this is not a BAD product.  But to act like it competes with the Air is just down right false.If $400 is your MAX budget, I would go with the iPad Mini Retina all day long.  If you can swing the $500 for the Air, it's no contest.My advice to Amazon, continue to fine tune this thing.  The next generation NEEDS to be MUCH faster and the HDX screen must display better colors.Maybe in the future, but it's just not there yet to sway me away from from Apple.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Amazon.com Fan", "ReviewID": "RHJVV00FGIZG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful, light, thin, fast, easy to use...the new Kindle HDX seamlessly incorporated all my videos, magazines and books from my other Kindle devises within seconds of the very simple and short setup.

Since it was my first Kindle, I thought it was pretty good.  My only complaint was the weight.  Holding it while reading a book made my wrist tired.  My 29 year old son tried it one day, and I let him take it home to use on a loan.  That was six months ago, and it's obvious it's not coming back.  So today I went to a retailer who had one in stock on sale (hate to wait for things to arrive) and purchased this instead.  I'm in love.The unit is much larger, lighter, better sound quality, awesome picture, and great camera.  As an author, it's great to look at my own books and even hear my own audio books on the unit.  It lets me know what my readers and listeners are seeing and hearing to use for my own quality checks. Besides that, I can do so much more for my own entertainment.  Everything works fine on the unit.  Easy setup.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

However, I have always stayed away from tablets as I work with workstations and servers.  I was finally drawn into the tablet market when I saw how well the Kindle fire 8.9 HDX could play videos.  My main concern was the cost of having to pay for 4G option to be able to have access to the internet all of the time.  I opted out of the 4G option and went with the 64 GB for the following reason.  I can sideload ( another way of saying copying files from your pc to the kindle via the usb cable) many of my MP4 movies and photo charts and mp3 music files ot my Kindle.  I can even make a folder on the kindle when connected to my pc using the pc to do the work.  So, you can have personal folders for putting all of you material into an organized matter.  You can also turn off \"auto update to personal cloud\" so you do not go over your personal 5GB of space free.  The battery stays charged longer when wifi is off (known as airplane mode which you can set on your kindle).  I had to order the 64GB directly from amazon as Best Buy does not carry the 64GB option.  I have placed a lot of charts, books and personal videos and personal music files on the kindle and still have only used up around 5 GB of space with around 49 GB still available.  The 64 GB model actually uses around 5+ GB of system memory so you end up with around 58 GB available for storage space when you first turn it on.The back camera takes a very high quality movie file in mp4 format.  It played back upside down at first on my pc but I used premiere to flip the video and exported it to a straight up video.If you take a picture with the back camera you will get a very high quality photo.  The catch is that if you email the pic to yourself it will be of a size around `1600 x 1200 picture.  If you hook it up to your computer via the usb cable then you will find it under a Dicom folder looking for camera then look through the subfolders and the file will be located.  copying from the dicom folder to your pc will end up giving you the maximum size of the photo without being sized down.  So it is extremely high resoulution at 300 dpi.Also if you want to turn off the auto to personal cloud  you will go through the settings device storage personal movies settings and buried that deep is the option to turn off auto load to personal cloud.  recommend you turn that feature off.The speakers give you great audio for personal use while you may need to use an external speaker for a louder sound.  In mentioning this the Bluetooth external speakers around 49 and below do not play any louder than the speakers you all ready have so you do not need to purchase a blue tooth speaker unless of course you get a high end one with high gain at 100 dollars or more.I would recommend this (64GB) to anyone who has lots of mp4 videos and charts and pictures and music to sideloadI played netflix on my kindle via the wifi in Books a Million and it played great.  No dropouts.  Make sure you go through the kindle store to get the right version.

I have owned several ipods, an Ipad2 10\" and an iPad mini.  I still have the ipod and the mini, and when my Ipad2 went on the fritz, I was debating whether to replace it with an iPad Air or a Kindle Fire.  I have always believed the ipad was superior and the Cadillac of all devices.  But the cost!  And I hate iTunes.  Apple does their updates and they never seem to care if their customers are having problems or not.  If something goes wrong with your device, you had better have an extended contract, because they won't fix anything.So, tired of Apple and iTunes, and all the hassles that come with it, I decided to look into Kindle.  A friend gave me the Kindle Fire HDX with 64g as a gift.  My first impression was OMG at the beautiful screen.  It is so clean and clear and just gorgeous!  A little smaller than a 10\", but come on.  Not really noticeable.  Watching movies and everything else is just plain great.I was very surprised that a lot of my Apple products automatically synced with Kindle with no hassle whatsoever.  I also have a Energi charger for my iPad that also works with the Kindle!  I was amazed.Mayday, where you have access to 24/7 help, is awesome.  Where else can you get service like this?  Try and even find a live person on Apple to help you.  I dare you.  I was having trouble with setting up music and they walked me right through it.I found it difficult to figure out setting up music and movies.  I was used to iTunes and I just couldn't figure out the Cloud Player.  I find it sort of clumsy, but after I figured it out it was no problem.  Amazon books and music are cheaper than iTunes.  I have an Apple TV and now Amazon plays on there as well.I read that getting 64 gig wasn't necessary.  Well, music and movies and photos take up most of your space.  Even though Amazon doesn't allow you to have a ton of videos on your device, we always end up using more space than we think we will.  On my Apple devices, I have my music and audiobooks on my ipod.  I put my photos on my computer.  The rest goes on my Ipad.  With Kindle, I can pretty much put it all on one device, if I choose to do so.Amazon Prime does not have the movie and tv selection for free that Netflix or Hulu have.  They need to work on that.  But the free shipping more than offsets this little glitch.I also love Amazon because you can get help.  If something goes wrong or you get a product you don't like, they make it right.  You get your money back and they help you and they appear to listen.  So I am a big Amazon fan and always will be.  In this day and age, customer service is important to me.Lots of neat little features.  Too many to go into here.I do not like the email, the way it is set up.  Confusing and just pretty much hate it.  I get emails much quicker on my ipad. Don't like the keypad.  It's a little different in that the space bar is small and there's a period next to it, so I keep hitting the period.  Little stuff I don't like, and it doesn't matter in the scheme of things.I don't have an Ipad Air, but from what I've read, it's probably awesome.  But I got 64 gig of memory and an awesome tablet with wonderful features for $439 on a Kindle.  Try buying an Ipad Air with 64 gig and see what it costs you.I think it all comes down to what do you want from your tablet, which will probably last you about three years.  If it doesn't go bad, technology will move forward and you will want to replace it.  I think Amazon hit a home run with their Kindle HDX.  I have had it a couple weeks and I absolutely love it.  Oh, and by the way.  I did not get the Origami case for it.  I bought a bundle called DigitalsOnDemand and it gave me the most awesome leather case, sleeve cover, stylus pen, USB cable, chargers, etc...  a steal for the money.  The screen protector was a piece of junk, so I got the Moshi iVisor XT.And best of all.  Try it and if you don't like it, send it back.  You can't go wrong.  You can't do that with Apple.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Even a seventy year old can use it.", "Author": "NC. movie man", "ReviewID": "R3NPR4JCG425VE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I want to say I know nothing about computers only how to turn them on and off but I love to read I saw the 7\"HD and wanted it.

She asked if she could take over my screen I told her by all means so bless her heart she did everything she could to connect it for me, she told me I had to get a number from my IP what ever that is so I call the telephone service they gave it to me, well I hit the mayday button again, this time an older man came on I told him what the little girl did and about IP he said I didn't need that he took over in 10 seconds it was up and running.

I was very excited about this purchase and was so much looking forward to this kindle.  One of the main reasons for my purchase was the text to speech and also that the kindle has a camera (where as my apple ipad does not have the text to read, read to me option).The text to speech worked perfectly and i was impressed, as this was better then my earlier kindle from two years ago. However my thrill for the kindle soon disappeared when i tried to make a 30 second \"happy birthday\" message and send this to a relative.  It seems that this is not possible with the kindle (where as the apple ipod, i have made hundreds of 40 to 50 second video messages and sent them to relatives and friends).I figured that i must be doing something wrong. So i used the instant help \"mayday\" (which is nice), once the technician help came on, he told me that the video can not be longer then 30 seconds and this should work fine.  So i made another video that was about 27 seconds, however this did not work.  So i used mayday day, this time the technician told me that it must be less then 25 seconds long.  So again i made another short happy birthday message that was 22 seconds long.  Once again, this video would not send and i used mayday and spoke with a third technician. This technician told me that the video must be less then 20 seconds.  So once again, i made a very short 15 second happy birthday message, and once again, it would not send.  So once again, i used mayday and spoke with a forth technician and i was told to purchase a special app that would allow me to send a video.  So i purchased this app, and once again. It did not work and the app crashed.  So i called amazon and spoke with a supervisor who informed me that he believed that the kindle COULD NOT make any videos longer then 2 or 3 seconds that i would be able to send by email. This supervisor was very kind and informed me that i might be better off returning my kindle fire hdx and just purchasing a kindle fire hd (just for the \"read to me\" option).  So this is what i did (however i really did not want to as i was bored and i wanted to spend the money on a new toy for fun, and i was just looking for any reason to keep the kindle fire hdx and did my best to try to make a video using the camera and send this in a email, like i can do with my apple ipad).I was hoping the kindle fire hdx would be user friendly as much as my apple ipad, however for myself, this was not to be!", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 16 GB", "Author": "Kristina2011", "ReviewID": "R12EIROD0VI18", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2013 edition) and have owned an iPad (2nd gen), Nook Tablet, and Nook Simple Touch in the past. I love my new Kindle Fire HDX because it is remarkably fast. I purchase/rent kindle editions of my textbooks and I noticed a lag when reading them on my other tablets with the Kindle app. This isn\u2019t a problem with the Kindle Fire HDX, thank you quad-core processor! Another reason I wanted a Kindle was for the Immersion reading experience. I use this feature almost everyday. I originally thought I could save some money on audiobooks and just use Read-To-Me but the voice is too robotic and mispronounces words like \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d. The last main reason I wanted to try a Kindle was for the ability to mirror the tablet to a TV screen.It isn\u2019t the best reading experience outside when it is bright but I think it is better than most. It is really lightweight and I never know when it\u2019s in my purse or backpack and the battery life is excellent.I really like Kindle books but unfortunately when I started purchasing e-books I had a Nook so I had a lot of books in the B&N; store that I did not want to repurchase from Amazon. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I was going to return the Kindle Fire HDX but changed my mind when I found a way to get the Nook app on my Kindle. I am still disappointed in Amazon because they made it challenging. You can\u2019t personalize the background on the lock screen and that is also something I really don\u2019t like. I originally saved $15 by purchasing the Kindle with special offers but the ads were too annoying so I decided to pay the extra money to get rid of them. Unfortunately the default backgrounds are not a lot better to look at.I would suggest doing research before deciding to purchase a Kindle Fire. If you want a tablet and don\u2019t already have one, the Kindle Fire will probably not be good enough for you. If you have a lot of digital purchases from amazon (books, audiobooks, video) and want a simple tablet/e-reader, this will probably be a good investment for you.

I am a current Kindle HD owner, but my child confiscated it from me so I used this as an excuse to upgrade. First thing I notice is the HDX is thin and very light. The sound is incredible, the screen is very nice and the processing is smooth. I haven't had any issues with the device, but it is an electronic so I am sure it will freeze up or get hung up somewhere down the line. I have owned an IPAD before and after using the HDX I truly believe I over-payed on the IPAD. I am a true believer in the KIndle after owning one previously. It does everything I want it to for a much lower price (Even though I got it for free). I did have enough points for an IPAD but I still chose the HDX. The sound is so much better than the IPAD, the picture, in my opinion is better,  The only thing I don't like is that Amazon does not have a NOOK app. I wanted to retrieve my NOOK books, but I suppose it is good business not to promote a competitor.

The Nexus is wonderful. Although it is a great size at 8.9 inches, I find the Fire tablet to be very frustrating.When using the keyboard it seems that it put spaces in all over the place and is very hard to type what we want. When editing it is almost impossible to put the cursor where you want it - sometimes the cursor is not visible and sometimes it isn't showing up even though the computer has you set to type from that spot . The capitalization seems to jump around without asking it to. It seems to put a space at the beginning of each paragraph, and takes several steps to get rid of it since you can't move the cursor accurately. Voice recognition is ever so much better on the Google Nexus.  And in general the screen touch sensitivity just seems to be off.  Lots of retyping.When you set a bookmark it is named sometimes in caps sometimes not, sometimes with icons and sometimes not.  Bookmarks are in one menu system at the top left. Saving a bookmark is in another menu on the right. The buttons on the edge of the screen are not there for some of the applications, so you have to get completely out of the application to get the home button back.We knew that the application store would not include many of the games and other applications that are available on all other tablets. Didn't think that would be such a big deal. But to discover that some very common applications and games are not available in any way on this tablet makes it much less useful.I could go on with many other little frustrations, and there are many more .

This feature works pretty damn good. See:dmediamomDotCom/2013/12/11/are-you-using-the-kindle-fire-hdx-dictation-feature/2 - Screen, duh! It *is* nice and everybody has talked about it.3 - Keyboard, especially \"long-press\" for numbers and special characters.4 - There is a scrollable word correction display as you type that would be annoying on an android phone but work well here.5 - Battery charges to 100% overnight and I have never gone below 50% with the exact same usage I gave my laptop every day. But I do not remain tethered to it like some people that I know. As for playing games, although I had about a dozen on the HDX I did not find one addictive enough to play for more than just a little while.The Bad (FYI, submitted to Amazon's returns-feedback email address.)1- Documents I copied over according to directions that the HDX provided after clicking on the \"Docs\" menu were not showing up in the docs section. I copied them over in individual year-dated subdirectories that the HDX does not recognize. It appears that, although folders (sub-directories) can be copied from laptops to Documents through Android File Manager (AFM) and are visible on the kindle through AFM, the Kindle software through the DOCS menu cannot see sub-directories (folders). I have several years of files on my laptop that reside in their respective years' folders. It appears the only option I have is to copy every year into the single Documents folder on the Kindle. This is unacceptable as it would make sorting (without renaming each and every file) impossible because most of the files have the same name. Sub-directories and sub-folders have been included since computers' existence. Leaving such a basic capability out (it is not even a \"feature\" but a common sense capability of all computing) makes the Kindle Fire HDX \"Documents\" menu item useless. This screams for a software update. Fortunately, I could see the document subdirectories in ES file explorer and in Kingsoft Office.2 - I also tried using the email documents option. The only problem with that is you cannot edit documents once they get to Kindle because double-clicking on the document pops it into Kindle like it was a non-editable book.3 - I could not watch live internet television due to I get the \"need to update flash player.\" Sideloading Adobe Flash works but audio/visual is out of sync. I tried with both Firefox and Dolphin. Forums here and on XDA were no help. \"Mayday\" rep said \"they are working on it and I will submit a ticket.\" Like that would help with a known issue.4 - Attempted to watch CBS's new series Intelligence.\" When prompted, I allowed Amazon's BETA streaming player to load but the video/audio sync is still off. Audio is before video. To confirm it was not my router, I put the Kindle HDX next to my laptop and started both of them at the same time. My laptop was perfectly sync'ed. [Note I was only offered to use this BETA software when watching CBS, not CNN or other networks streaming through the internet.]5 - The most disturbing thing to me is that after using Amazon's BETA streaming player for 30 minutes it started playing commercials! It even-numbered them in the top left corner one of five. The same exact feed through my internet router had ZERO commercials. I paid $15 to not be bothered with commercials but yet I get them on Amazon's BETA streaming player! I don't care if it is a beta player. I am not going to be a beta tester after paying nearly $500! This was the final straw for me deciding to return the HDX.\"Mayday\" rep had not heard of, nor had any notification of an Amazon BETA streaming player. Such things are to be expected from large corporations that typically do not inform Customer Service Reps about BETAs or updates. However, even after the rep put me on hold (meaning she was asking someone else), she denied any knowledge of any such \"workaround\" and suggested I sideload Adobe Flash. I explained I already tried that.From my career as a Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 CSR and trainer in hardware and software support I know that even the best CSR's will not know everything if they don't think outside of the box and keep asking questions from \"veteran\" reps and their Systems people. Instead, I received the \"I apologize\" excuse ad infinitum despite the fact that I told the rep that she had no reason to apologize as it was not her fault that a basic feature expected from all such hardware is sorely lacking in the HDX.6 - If you are used to texting on your phone, type and edit in portrait mode. Typing in landscape is difficult. Swipe is not supported. Every piece of nonsupported software that I try to sideload eventually had glitches and problems trying to run on the HDX.7 - I explained that I could not find a way to change the internet background color on websites in Silk. The white background is hard on my eyes and the screen has a bad glare on it. She hesitated for a moment, checked her screen and advised that there indeed was no way to change it. I now know that changing to \"Reader View\" allows for font and color changes. The \"Mayday\" rep was either not sufficiently trained or was not provided hands-on testing after the training; either of which would have solved that problem.8 - As far as the Carousel is concerned, I want the same icons on it every time and I don't want them moving around based on usage frequency. And, adding the first photo from the photo collection to the carousel each and every time I go to photos even if I never looked at that first photo is really annoying. The rep explained that she understood and started to explain my options of deleting or moving each Carousel item. I explained that I already knew this as well as just scrolling the Carousel up to hide it but that lack of simple customization is frustrating.9 - If I attach a photo to an email and then later go out and choose photos from the top menu it brings up the email. Just a tiny bug that can probably be quickly fixed. This should have been caught before rushing this to market but this type of bug is typical for corporations that rush products to market to beat holiday (or other internal) deadlines.10 - Screen glare is bad especially on the Bezel. A color other than white might help the screen background but the only option to change the screen background is while reading a Kindle book or in Silk's \"Reading Mode.\" A black bezel is not recommended for any product if you will be using it in a brightly-lit room or where there is artificial light behind you. I notice no difference from my current laptop's 1680x1050 resolution except my laptop glare is much less.11 -  It is a fingerprint magnet. You need to leave a soft glasses cleaner cloth nearby.12- As almost all people have noticed, there is a pesky backlight issue. At first I thought it was because of the extremely sensitive screen but it makes no difference how long you leave your finger on the screen. Moving from screen to screen causes the screen to change from bright to dim with auto-brightness turned off. The screen is way too dim with auto-brightness turned on.13 - I could not access Kindle book discussions from the book menu. I do not think HDX is a complete \"fail\" or the software is completely broken but, even as a PRIME, movie-watching member, I can't live with it. You will need time and patience for its learning curve and for software updates if you need to do more than what it was designed for, reading books and watching Prime movies.Last, it was very difficult to hear my \"Mayday\" rep [name omitted for this review], even with the HDX volume turned all the way up and my home completely quiet. This may also be attributed to either not having her headset adjusted correctly or her non-English accent.  And NO, there is nothing wrong with my hearing! I got the definite impression that she was extremely uncomfortable in her job due to she was not prepared. Hiring bi-lingual reps strictly for their language capabilities and ignoring their lack of customer service experience and lack of communication skills is a Human Resources issue that I strongly suggest Amazon address if they want to keep their \"#1 Customer Satisfaction\" rating.\" Finally, when I asked the \"Mayday\" rep to help start my return process, she again put me on hold and a minute later another (male) rep came on the line. I could hear him saying hello to me but because the original rep left her system on hold, he could not hear me, nor could I see him. He continued to try saying hello to me with my hellos going un-answered for 5 minutes until the connection was lost. My email address was previously confirmed and the first rep accessed my account so they also had my phone number. When a connection is lost, common customer service dictates the rep attempt to contact the customer again. Not here! This experience was the poorest I have ever received from any company in my 30 years of IT experience. Fortunately, Amazon's Returns policy does not require a customer service rep's help and I initiated the return myself online.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "What can I say????", "Author": "RiverCat", "ReviewID": "R18CUNNTZOTM6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I say, Fabulous!

I am certain that it is as good as the iPad mini at about half the price. Playing games and using apps is even better than before, with brilliant color and blazing fast speed. I generally don't leave home without it, and consider it one of the best technology investments I've ever made.

In addition, it stay work not less then 11 hours reading with leasing. This device support education much and much, so I recommend for those who intereste to get the education in an advance way.

In fact, it still works.  My son inherited it.Anyway, I was ready for something bigger, faster, able to do more, but not as heavy or big as my laptop.  So, I started researching, and quickly narrowed the field down to either the Lenovo Yoga Tab 10 (my laptop is a Yoga 13, which I LOVE) or the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I had just about decided to save the $100 and get the Yoga, but there were a few things that kept nagging at me on some of the reviews.  The Yoga's processor lagged when it tried to do too much, the screen resolution was sub-par compared to other 10-inch tablets - those were the big two.So, finally, I bit the bullet and spent the extra money for the Fire HDX 8.9 - and I'm SO glad I did.This machine is so much faster than my old Kindle Fire, and pretty much anything else I've tried.  The screen is big, bright and crisp, making graphics just jump out at you.  The speakers are wonderful - loud and clear  The Wi-Fi works very well.  I have had no issues connecting to my network, even all the way across the house - meaning the signal has to travel through at least 5 walls.The battery holds up pretty well for me.  I have had the tablet for 8 days, and it is just now charging for the second time.  As a caveat, I have been at work for much of that 8 days, but I'm pretty sure that even on my off week, I should get 2 days per charge or so.  Now, I also bought a 11,000 mAh external battery pack at the same time I bought this, and I HIGHLY recommend the one I bought ( B00DUTVOU8 ).  I would really love a bigger battery (or a case with built-in battery), but it works just fine as-is.I have a co-worker who is an Apple aficionado, and he was impressed by the picture and sound quality.  We compared it to his iPad Air - and the Kindle was better in both picture and sound quality.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this machine.

The HDX is a tremendous improvement over the older model in nearly every aspect. The display is brighter and clearer. Performance is very snappy. Setup was easy. I use MS Outlook for my email and all I had to do was provide my password. The Kindle app handled all the server setup automatically.I love the dual cameras, especially the new rear facing one.

This helps someone like myself who has arthritis. For me, this was the main selling point.I haven't needed the new live help yet, but I am curious how well it works. I know I will eventually try it to satisfy my curiosity.Games and video play very smoothly, unlike the previous model that tended to freeze up at times.

There seem to be NO WAY to place photos in collections or folders (I've created folders with a file explorer but they were ignored). I am just wandering who wrote the software...>So far, I have not been able to set up the Kindle calendar (this just amazed me). It wanted me to synchronize with an existing online calendar of some sort, but I don't have one. It will NOT work in a stand-alone mode and, apparently, it will not store it's data in Amazon's Cloud either. With \"CalenGoo,\" I created a few Google calendars (as it recommended), and so far it is working very well.>I was able to open, edit, and save older versions of Microsoft Excel files with \"Polaris Office,\" but it does not work with Google Drive. I used a file explorer to transfer files from-and-to Google drive and then I moved them from-to another subfolder on the Kindle; it was doable but unnecessarily tedious.>The often bad-mouthed Silk Browser has worked quite well (but I've turned the \"acceleration\" off); the only problem I've discovered so far was NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) site (disappointing).>A fact that the user cannot change the screen backgrounds (login and \"desktop\") is astonishing...The included user guide is too basic. I've just bought an e-book to solve that problem.>Amazon does not allow access to Google Play, which has some applications that are either newer or even not-available in the Amazon's App Store. I have also discovered that a lot of the available applications I was looking for (productivity and utilities) have poor users' ratings.>It would have not bothered me that there was no easy way to connect to Google Drive directly if Amazon offered a similar functionality. For example, not allowing storage of calendar data in IT'S OWN \"cloud\" totally amazed me (unless I am missing something here or I am just having a bad dream).I think, the Kindle Fire has a great potential; Amazon just needs more ambition to go beyond the reader-viewer-listener-shopper business model, or sell them for half price so we can buy multiple tablets for different purposes.Please report all shortcomings to Amazon, so the software can be improved (hopefully soon).>For clarity sake, I am a long time, \"loyal\" Amazon's customer.==============================================================================================For people new to Kindle Fire 2013 (now or in the near future), I recommend this e-book by Michael J.

I have 3 browsers on it and 2 readers, and the pixel count exceeds that of most apps and games,  so it should be a photographers delight. The 8 mp camera takes the best pics compared to a certain fruiti pad.I hope the screen is gorilla glass; so far so good.  Stays charged a long time also.  The reflexes and speed  on the kindle exceed those of a cheetah, no gripes there.  I have no gripes about the wifi.  I do find that the auto brightness can be distracting, so I turn that off most of the time.  I discovered quite by accident that it has sleep mode and Off, and no instructions about that unless I do some internet research.  It's really simple to use.  Sleep mode is a power sipper.  I can charge it from way low to over 90% in about 2 hours with the handy dandy wall wart and usb plug.  It's bright enough to read even  under my 2x4 foot skylight, which is pretty darn bright.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "kindle fire hdx 8.9", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R28ETG80OUBGC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the hdx 8.9.

My eyesight is failing (the only thing worse than growing old is its opposite) so the Kindle Fire 7 was a great improvement.  Then I decided I would like something larger with a keyboard and print capable.  The Ipad Air was very attractive in a store, but the price and operating system made me hesitate.  Then I read a review comparing the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" to the Air, and was sold.  I love the extra size to make print larger.  An external keyboard did not work out for me, I need to hold the screen too close, and printing is still unexplored.  The young, sharp-eyed engineers decided that with the improved screen resolution they could decrease font size(!) of system text, like settings and messages.  Fie on them!  But web sites are easier to read.I tried the online help feature, and it is wonderful.  A helpful tech showed up in a postage stamp size window and we discussed my problem, I had accidentally turned on an awkward keyboard option, and she drew a red circle around the screen key to long press to turn off the option.  Great!Reading more closely about settings, I discovered I could turn off auto correct on keyboard entry.  That plus using a stylus makes writing on a Fire much easier.I am very pleased with this little computer.  I still need to find out about printing or maybe about storing files on line so I can access them from phone or Kindles.

The one that will and that I have yet to find a good work around is the Silk Browser.  I don't like it and I wish I could more easily replace it with a different browser.  No matter how many times I change the search engine it reverts to Bing.  Nothing against Bing but I am a google man.  Taunting me with settings that seem to let me change my default search engine (and it does until you reboot) does not help.This is not Android.  Anymore than Apple OS is Linux.  This is built on an Android core but it is not native Android.  As such some apps are not available for it and some need to be side loaded (download the apk and load it manually).  If you want to always check the latest and greatest of each type of app out there then this might be a big negative for you.  Me? I want to find one I like and never change it again until a major upgrade is demonstrated to me.The App store is more arrogant than Microsoft used to be.  The App store thinks it knows you and it doesn't.  It takes your Amazon purchase history, your books, and then assumes you just want movies, books, and games when it returns search results.  Use google (or Bing I guess) and get software reviews there then search for them specifically.  I like to use the full Amazon online shop and search within Android Apps to get a better return on my search.So why did I give it 5 stars?  It is powerful, its graphics are beautiful, it is exactly what I thought I would be getting and it cost less than other comparable systems I looked at.  I am an Amazon Prime member so it fit with my current online usage and I did my homework and was aware of the flaws and work arounds before I ordered it.  Get some utilities (ES3, Evernote, King Soft Office) to compensate for issues and check to make sure your treasured games are available (no haytown for my wife was an issue) and then decide if it is worth the extra 100 to 200 dollars to get a pure Android device or worth the risk of voiding your support if you root it.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1IYK4C0OM5YFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are not enough stars to calculate how much I love my kindle fire 8.9 HDX.

The speakers are not as loud as last gen, but for a tablet I find them adequate for a quick couple of tunes on break or an episode of my favorite TV show before bed.I have occasion to use my HDX for up to 12 hours at a stretch at times and the battery keeps up quite well for reading or researching the occasional article on the net. The included charger and cable will keep you juiced up at a very pleasant rate as well.Bottom line: The kindle as a media consumption device does its job without a hitch. Highly reccomended.

Live Tech support could only suggest locking in the desired orientation (Options menu).

There are apps that are similar, but not the one you expect. Same for several of the word games I play on my Android phone, not available on Kindle. The other disappointment was my local newspaper. I wanted the whole paper, with the same format. A reviewer posted a reply from the paper regarding the format that said Amazon restricted the way they could submit it.

The exceptions that I experienced are printing to a Cannon wireless printer and is perhaps more fault of the app rather than the Kindle. But, the unit is advertised as a productivity tool from which you can print. I can't as of yet.Also, I downloaded multiple movies from Amazon Prime. Upon deleting them the last movie would not allow me to delete it in the conventional manner so I re-booted and the screen responded with a question that basically asked if I wanted to restore factory defaults or continue to boot normally. I chose not to restore settings and continued to boot. I later went into the settings screen and found an alternative way to delete the movie without having to resort to losing my personal settings.Other than these issues, I really like and would purchase it again. The live help feature works great with knowledgeable and professional support techs. I perhaps should have asked them to assist me with the two aforementioned issues and still may do so.

It says it is a 8 meg pix but my picture come out blurry or poor quality. The footage part comes out ok. The sound on the device could be louder. Also I bought a Fintie cover for my kindle and due to the magnetic for the automatic turn off when you shut the cover, it interrupts the use of the camera.

I have only had a small issue with the downloadable Prime movies listed on the device in that some were on the list but could not be downloaded.

I did decide on the roocase oragami instead of the Amazon version as it is lighter and I really wasn't worried about the slide to take pictures function.  I did find, however, that the roocase functions that way as well purely by accident!

I have had a Kindle DX, original Kindle Fire and a Kindle Fire HD 7\".  The first HDX was a little glitchy, but after doing a Mayday call and then reporting that the issue did not resolve with resetting the device they sent me a whole new one and it is a dream!  I have only had a small issue with the downloadable Prime movies listed on the device in that some were on the list but could not be downloaded.  When I reported this Amazon was kind enough to rent the ones I wanted to me for free until they can figure out what is causing the issues.  I have never had issues with Amazon, I love Prime and my new Fire HDX is the best ever!The HDX is so light and thin, but still very strong in its construction.  I did decide on the roocase oragami instead of the Amazon version as it is lighter and I really wasn't worried about the slide to take pictures function.  I did find, however, that the roocase functions that way as well purely by accident!  If you have the case open and the cover flipped all of the way over to the back it will turn on the camera automatically if you slide it down just a half inch!  C\\Kind of a nice surprise unless you are in the middle of a timed game or something.  I travel for business weekly and the tablet is so easy to hold and read on, or sit down on the airplane tray table in its case and watch a movie or play games.  The display is so awesome even when next to the older Fire HD!  I am so glad that I upgraded and went for the larger memory as well.

Also, being a technically oriented type I'm feel that the support for apps is a little thin in the areas of performance and user friendliness.

I learned this by using the Mayday button and going through about three reps before one that understood the problem could explain it. He stated that you had to have certain email accounts (ie. Gmail, yahoo etc in order for the app to sync.) Why in the world would you write an app like that? He further stated that there were many other calendar apps availabe that did not need to sync with your email. Supposedly that's a satisfactory answer.

This is my second, bought the original Fire when it came out a couple years ago.  Looks and feels great, software works fine, quick response for the few things I have used it for so far.  Amazon was also quick to ship and made adjustment to order when I asked for it.  Don't know much about electronics, but I know right now that this will be used 90% of the time for all my web surfing, email reading, taking on vacation, reading books and downloading movies to watch on the road.  Great reader also.  Battery life is good.  Setup is a breeze.  Wireless works great.  Don't know anything about gaming capabilities, look to other reviewers for that.  Pay the $79 per year to become a Prime member to realize the greatest advantages of this unit. The quality of this build is on a par with and maybe better than that red tree fruit that grows in Washington state.  I see some reviews griping about being tied to Amazon, but for my use and needs, that is a plus rather than a minus.  Could go on with praises, but you get the idea.

I had been using the 8.9 Fire HD model and I really loved it.  I decided to upgrade because we are so often away from WiFi and I wanted the 4G LTE model.  The issue for me was that once I received the tablet, it was only then that I was made aware that this tablet will only support 4G not 3G at all(Verizon).  I live in an area with 3G and I travel to remote areas where I am lucky to get even a 3G signal.  I let Amazon know how disappointing this was and they kindly refunded the $100 I paid to get the 4G enabled tablet.  I was grateful but I would not have traded my Fire HD in the first place for just another tablet that was WiFi enabled.  Yes the graphics are better than the old tablet and yes there is now the ability to use Miracast technology so streaming is wireless with the use of a dongle I purchased, but this new tablet has issues.  I am writing this review on my laptop because while trying to type the review on the Kindle, it, for no good reason reloads the web page on which I am attempting to type, requiring me to start the review over and over again.  I fianlly gave up and decided to use my computer instead.  This issue has plagued my tablet since the first time I turned it on.  Generally it is only annoying but when you are typing and you have to begin a long review again, it becomes more than annoying.The books, music and video download with no problems and reading works seamlessly.  I did learn that with 3MG on my wifi I can stream a movie or TV show as long as it isn't in HD.  I will keep the HDX and live with the web page reloading issue but if you already have a Kindle Fire HD I would recommend keeping it.  Mine worked flawlessly 100% of the time.

Unfortunately, they are still a little behind and need to rethink it a bit.It is great to be able to limit the time a kid spends playing apps when he/she could be reading and nice to be able to control the length of time using the tablet per day and control the hours of the day when it can be used. Bravo. Unfortunately, \"free time\" is designed for kids 8 and under and so much of the functionality of the device is eliminated by running free time. They assume a kid is never going to want to use the camera on the device or listen to music, for example. Access to the internet is blocked and so is access to calendar and address book tools. If a child is 9 and over, there is another level of parental control that allows parents to turn off certain features only--for instance, purchasing, internet browsing and social media. Unfortunately, Amazon fails to recognize that parents might want a means to regulate play time with OLDER kids as well. This method also means that if you are using your own account to provide content to more than one device that everyone will have access to everything on the cloud, whether or not something is age-appropriate.My wishlist of changes:(1) Make a level of \"Free Time\" for kids 9-14(2) Make it possible to play music from \"Free Time\" and give selective access to the music cloud.(3) Make it possible to turn on other functional aspects of the device, such as email capability for certain kids.(4) Make it possible to regulate time spent in certain types of apps or to simply lock some apps in favor of others--e.g. if there are educational apps that get the back-seat while game apps are active.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still considering a return", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Z1EFYLRWXYJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This purchase has been very frustrating.

This is a very powerful tablet with good cameras for a tablet, Includes a good decently loud stereo speakers. The lack of apps and some ui elements are the only thing holding this back, as well as ui customizations. But you are a huge amazon consumer and already part of the Amazon Ecosystem, i see no reason why you wouldn't fall in love with this tablet.Pros:-Thin and light but NOT cheap feeling (except on the first point made below)-Screen is not too small or too big, i really think they hit the sweet spot on this 8.9'' Display, not a huge reach when you want to reach something in the middle and it allows it to be light enough to hold with one hand for a long time.-Bright Gorgeous Screen with high pixel density and great color accuracy.-Stereo Speakers (although not the loudest but it is just a tablet)-Great specs and Graphics-Simplistic UI good for adults and kids Alike-Good Assortment of free apps and free app of the day is a great idea.-Clever UI additions like swiping out the on screen navigation to get to recent apps, as well as, getting new application suggestions based on what you have already below the app.-Great amazon services and quick customer service even on the mayday. Mayday took me all of 10 to 15 seconds to get a live person pretty much every time.-Probably the best reading experience ive ever had on any tablet, hands down. This integration of the tablet with the reading app is fantastic. Its fast fluid and a pleasure to read with, They really picked apart the experience to make it better in pretty much every way, looking up words,authors, more information on the book as well as text customization's that all actually had a function and weren't too complicated and convoluted.Cons:-Bezel Pressing on the short sides lead to discoloration-The back buttons are a great idea and are implemented well enough this time BUT, they are too recessed into the unit and are hard to find and feel for, I never got used to it.-when lightly pressing on the short sides, the screens light seems to bleed into the display discoloring it. It doesn't burn into the screen, its something i noticed with this unit. My other tablets and phones have never done this.-Lack of Customization's even if you want them or not-Notification bar is full screen and seems like a blown up phone UI- The Soft touch back is a finger print magnet making the device look cheap and requiring regular cleaning and wiping down to make it look good.-Taking apps off the recent Carousel is annoying and tedious requiring a long press and hold then a tap on \"Remove from carousel\". This needs a faster and more intuitive way of removing them, especially since it gets so populated quickly with nonsense.-Lack of google Apps, and people should be given to choice to download from either the Play store or the Amazon App Store, but having said that, there app store is respectable has come a long way since the original Kindle fire, by a lot. They should give users the choice but obviously giving them incentive to use and buy the apps from the amazon store when they can find it.Basically this Kindle fire tablet is easy to fall in love with when you first pick it up.Any basic computing tasks are completed without a hiccup. Advanced tasks and gaming are also completed without any hiccups and are absolutely gorgeous on this display. Its Simple yet sexy exterior makes you want to pick it up and get enveloped. Although it not perfect it would be a great choice for Adults and kids and Adults who own it and let they're kids play it. There's parental controls and locks making this convenient.I wouldn't have trouble recommending this tablet to anyone looking for a fast simple and intuitive tablet experience, especially for adults. More Tech Savvy people will find this tablet a bit limited in functionality.

The tablet's performance is stellar, I have yet to trip it up with any game or application. Opening applications and switching between them is not just fast, it's nearly instantaneous. The screen is amazing and puts Apple's retina display to shame. Physically the tablet is comfortable to hold, pleasing to the touch, and extremely lightweight, making it very easy to tote around the house for a myriad of uses. The speakers are top notch with crystal clear audio. The optional origami case is very useful for table-top use of the tablet, holding it at a comfortable viewing angle and standing up to repeated pokes and swipes.The OS is very content-centric and responsive with the only major downside being the lack of Google Play store access. I'm a gamer and a lot of new generation games have companion apps that are just not available in the Amazon store. A workaround is to download the .APK and .OBB files of the application and upload them through USB via a PC, but that's a bit more of a pain than it needs to be to get this kind of functionality.Overall it's a great tablet, but the lack of Google Play access is slightly heartbreaking. You can search for your desired apps in the Amazon App store and it will auto-complete your searches like it has your app, only to discover that it's not available through the AA store.

Very angered and disappointed because I was told by an Amazon Representative that it did work with Verizon . Shame on you guys for advertising it on the 8.9 advertisement page.

Vera", "ReviewID": "R19I6IWACT3FK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were early adopters to almost every single Kindle ebook reader, and we picked three of the original Kindle Fire 7\" as soon as they were announced. We eventually moved to the 7\" HD and last Christmas I got my wife the 8.9\" HDX because she wanted a larger screen.Our son had an iPad 2 as a Christmas gift in 2012 and my company issued me a second iPad 2 sometime in 2013. He likes his, but has already gone through one warranty repair for a bad GPU and three insurance claims for cracked screens (Walmart has an amazing warranty extension plus insurance, it's insane). My work iPad 2 hasn't broken yet, mostly because I don't use it. I hate the damn thing. It is slow, it is heavy and it is weird.And my hate for the iPad 2 got worse when I got the 8.9\" HDX for my wife because while the screen was smaller, the device practically weights nothing. And the screen is amazing. So I got myself one too.I actually like this thing so much that many times I read with it instead of using my PaperWhite. The PaperWhite is now used mostly when I am out of the house. If I am at home I rotate between the 8.9\" HDX and the PaperWhite. It is light enough that I can read or watch movies in bed, something I can't do with the iPad 2.Cons: Very hard to locate the back buttons by feel. In the 7\" HD I was used to run my finger along the edge (this is in the dark) until I felt the headphone jack, but now I have to feel for the speaker grille, which tells me if I am holding the device right.  Yes, I could turn on the lights, but the idea is to turn on the device without waking up my wife.Durability: it is too early to tell, but mine has already survived a nasty fall that would had murdered my iPad 2. I had the 8.9\" HDX on the holding tray on a treadmill, I knocked it over, it landed on the treadmill track, BANG, it bounced, landed on the hardwood floor, BANG. Not a scratch.Screen: fantastic. Photos look like glossy prints. Video looks incredible, no slowdowns at all. Reading is much more pleasant than on a 7\" Kindle Fire (for reading purposes you can't compare the original Fire to any of the e-ink Kindles), and nicer than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD (not by much, but it is better). I never play games but my wife seems to spend hours playing games on hers, never a complaint except mine whenever I see a new order for Amazon coins.Chassis: really nice, I like what Amazon did except that they could have added some kind of marking one could use to locate the buttons by touch. The buttons are better placed than on the HD 7\". And it weights nothing, it is amazing how light it feels.Software: Not a problem unless you depend on Google-branded apps. If you aren't joined to Google at the hip, then you won't feel much of a difference between this and a pure Android device. You can side load without jail breaking, or you can jail break the device and risk warranty issues later, but that's up to you. I believe that for most people this is very handy, especially if you are a Prime subscriber.Sound: I prefer headphones, but my wife uses hers with the built-in speakers exclusively, and they sound very nice.Value: Even tacking a 2-year square trade warranty+insurance policy, and even taking into account that you won't get Google-branded applications, this is a fantastic deal.

As when PPI gets above what Apple calls a retina screen, my peepers cannot tell the difference).  So don't worry about the screen, either tablet presents what is being displayed in a gloriously bright and clear manner.One item that I do wish Apple had included (In an aesthetically pleasant way, of course) is a microSD slot which would allow quick transfers of data without an additional dongle that plugs into the Lightning port.  The kindle provides this out of the box.The OS that is installed on the Kindle is what is irks me the most of all and is the reason I wouldn't suggest the purchase over an iPad Air.  The kindle has an obvious purpose here and it has become overtly advertised with the discounted kindles like the Fire HDX that ruins the feel that you are getting a premium product; \"Special Offers!\" Once you realize what Amazon's true goal of the Kindle Fire is; to try to sell you more products from Amazon based upon what you do with your tablet, or should I call it their tablet as you are losing your privacy from where you are when you do whatever it is that you do with that* kindle.This is a deal breaker to me as I know how iOS on the iPad Air was designed and who it was designed for; the business sector and Apple users that think like the designers.  The iOS operating system is very detailed about when it is going to provide personally identifiable information to an application regardless of developer (Apple or any other).  Apple also does not let out any applications that attempt to gain user information without absolute transparency and asking first.  This walled garden is something that cannot have a price attached to it.With the Kindle HDX, you are paying for a device that is letting a company know what you are doing with their tablet at all times. When you consider this factor in the pricing hype over the Kindle HDX you would not be alone to wonder what they are paying you to use their tablet over a protected Apple iPad Air. (I cannot stop thinking of this tablet like those free* internet providers that  were around a few years back as well as those companies that used to give you a free computer that used these same targeted advertising techniques Amazon has rediscovered and deployed with the Kindle HDX).I expect Amazon to keep information on what I search their site for and what I purchase from them.  But this is where I feel our relationship should stop.  If you are comfortable with this information keeping aspect of the Kindle Fire and the absence of a large, tested and safe marketplace of applications and add-ons from tripod mounts to microphones to lens attachments and more.  The Kindle Fire HDX might be good for you. Be sure to try one out first at a Best Buy where you can compare it to the iPad Air.I will continue to use my regular Paperwhite Kindle, to read eBooks.  This is one thing the Kindle Fire can't do, surprisingly.  But to get that paper-like look you need an eINK display not a high resolution one like the Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad Air have.For my peace of mind, I am going to return the one I purchased to the store and stomach the slightly higher price of the iPad Air.

As when PPI gets above what Apple calls a retina screen, my peepers cannot tell the difference).  So don't worry about the screen, either tablet presents what is being displayed in a gloriously bright and clear manner.One item that I do wish Apple had included (In an aesthetically pleasant way, of course) is a microSD slot which would allow quick transfers of data without an additional dongle that plugs into the Lightning port.  The kindle provides this out of the box.The OS that is installed on the Kindle is what is irks me the most of all and is the reason I wouldn't suggest the purchase over an iPad Air.  The kindle has an obvious purpose here and it has become overtly advertised with the discounted kindles like the Fire HDX that ruins the feel that you are getting a premium product; \"Special Offers!\" Once you realize what Amazon's true goal of the Kindle Fire is; to try to sell you more products from Amazon based upon what you do with your tablet, or should I call it their tablet as you are losing your privacy from where you are when you do whatever it is that you do with that* kindle.This is a deal breaker to me as I know how iOS on the iPad Air was designed and who it was designed for; the business sector and Apple users that think like the designers.  The iOS operating system is very detailed about when it is going to provide personally identifiable information to an application regardless of developer (Apple or any other).  Apple also does not let out any applications that attempt to gain user information without absolute transparency and asking first.  This walled garden is something that cannot have a price attached to it.With the Kindle HDX, you are paying for a device that is letting a company know what you are doing with their tablet at all times. When you consider this factor in the pricing hype over the Kindle HDX you would not be alone to wonder what they are paying you to use their tablet over a protected Apple iPad Air. (I cannot stop thinking of this tablet like those free* internet providers that  were around a few years back as well as those companies that used to give you a free computer that used these same targeted advertising techniques Amazon has rediscovered and deployed with the Kindle HDX).I expect Amazon to keep information on what I search their site for and what I purchase from them.  But this is where I feel our relationship should stop.  If you are comfortable with this information keeping aspect of the Kindle Fire and the absence of a large, tested and safe marketplace of applications and add-ons from tripod mounts to microphones to lens attachments and more.  The Kindle Fire HDX might be good for you. Be sure to try one out first at a Best Buy where you can compare it to the iPad Air.I will continue to use my regular Paperwhite Kindle, to read eBooks.  This is one thing the Kindle Fire can't do, surprisingly.  But to get that paper-like look you need an eINK display not a high resolution one like the Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad Air have.For my peace of mind, I am going to return the one I purchased to the store and stomach the slightly higher price of the iPad Air.  At least now I know why I am paying for the product that I will feel is COMPLETELY mine.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Only good for kids.

Not great but OK. I spent 3-4 hours exploring the HDX and playing about 15 minutes of video, placed it in sleep mode and let it sit for another couple of hours and the battery was nearly drained. I wouldn't consider that excellent but OK.The wireless connection on my HDX gave out several times. Uncertain as to why as my other wireless devices were working just fine from the same location and only a few feet from the wireless router. I've read other reviews where this was a problem. Perhaps a driver upgrade for the wireless would fix the issue at a later time.For the most part, my HDX lived up to the hype but at the end of the day, I just couldn't justify spending this money on an android device which won't play nice and allow downloading/installing Google apps.Amazon simply doesn't have enough apps to fit my needs and for this reason, I had to reluctantly return it.I've read about ways to circumvent this and get some Google apps installed but it's simply not worth the hassle for me.Seems Google, Apple and Amazon all want people feeding from their trough and their trough only. Can't we all just get along? :)If you primarily live and breathe in the world of Amazon and only need browsing capabilities outside the Amazon world, this might fit your needs.

This means reset to Factory Defaults and start over loading apps from the cloud and input of email addresses.  I also noticed that many game apps would try to play automatically without me touching screen.  Amazon does not have a fix for this. My wife's Kindle Fire HDX plays these same games without any problem. Called and emailed Amazon Customer Service, first time ever to be treated rudely.  Spoke with foreign lady with bad English.  The big man in red must have ruined her holiday with a few bags of coal.  Solution without Amazon's help...sending unit back for a refund as defective.  I would have settled for a replacement unit but customer care being nasty took care of that idea.  I now have ordered a Apple Air 128 GB.  Suppose to be here soon.  Amazon usually blows the competition away with helpful customer service.  I have emailed them that Amazon is the best company on earth.

It\u2019s extremely limited unless you got it for reading and watching Amazon content.

I returned it and ordered the LG G Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition so it has straight Android Kit Kat, just like my Nexus 4 phone.  As soon as I logged into Google on the G Pad, it immediately downloaded all the apps that I have on my phone and everything\u2019s ready to go.

The PBS App, which I was looking forward using frequently, is completely unusable.Other things, like being unable to watch \"Justified\" in Full Screen mode, which means I might as well have a smaller, cheaper tablet.

I couldn't get the same functional bank app that I have on my android phone where I can take pictures of checks for depositing.  The app let's you know that it won't work on Kindle Fire HDX.  Another issue that the help folks couldn't solve was how to use my Holy Bible app that I use on a previous version Kindle on my new Kindle.  Fortunately, I got hold of the author of the app and got instructions that allow me to use the app.  Otherwise, I'd say from the initial turning on, it was very easy to link it to my various e-mail accounts, all my previous Kindle book purchases were readily available for transfer to the new Kindle.

Broussard", "ReviewID": "R3FLLUB1BLGMXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided that my older 2012 Kindle Fire HD 7 wasn't big enough for my fast changing school needs.  As technology is progressing, more and more of my classes are offering ebooks or online access to supplemental software/programs.  This semester 2 of my required books were only available as an ebook.  I did purchase them for the Kindle Fire HD 7, but it was a pain to use them.  I had to zoom in and out to see different areas of problems and pages and read ok.  Being accounting themed books, I was doing a lot of zooming and scrolling and shrinking to see the whole problem I needed to do for homework.  This of course took up a lot of time.  I also only got my Kindle in 8gb at the time and I was running out of storage room for items I wanted at all times on my kindle (music, movies, books, etc).  So I decided with my school refund I would apply it towards the Kindle HDX 8.9.What a smart move!  I have only had this 2 days and I am in love.  Even though it is \"8.9\" inches bigger, it seems to me like double the size.  I can see 1 whole accounting problem on the same page in a font that is easily to read.  Makes my homework much easier to get done.The screen clarity is much clear.  This was not a huge importance to me, but a big plus.  HD movies are crystal clear.  On the Older fire I had the HD movies were a smudge blurry.  In addition, it processes much faster.  I feel like my old kindle fire was \"dial up\" and this is \"cable'.The sound quality is impressive.  I feel like I was sitting in an i max theater watching an episode on prime last night.For the size this is very light.  Yes it weighs a few ounces with the case on than my previous fire, but overall when I hold it in my hand (most likely because of the larger size and more balanced weight) it feels lighter.  I got the Trident case to go with it.  (If you go with that case I do suggest a zippered tablet case in addition just to protect the screen.)The onscreen keyboard is much easier for me to use vs previous model kindle fires I have personally owned.The front and rear cameras are amazing. The rear camera does take some very nice quality photos.  I had a fun time today going around the apt complex snapping various shots.It is very nice we can download some of the prime movies and shows now to watch at a future date when we aren't or may not be connected to the internet (or maybe a really slow connection).I did go ahead and get the 64 gb.  I was going back and forth between the 32 and 64.  But honestly for the $50 difference, I knew I would be happier with 64.  I have many cd's and movies that I purchased.  I travel via train and plane often so like to load the kindle up with enough movies/music for the trip.  My parents are 7 hours away, so depending on what deals I get, I either fly or take amtrak.  It's nice to have the room to put enough entertainment onto the kindle for the trip.  My grandparent's don't have decent internet (they are still dial up) so I put enough for the length of my trip when I travel to them.  And with technology going towards e books I do have the room to put all my school books on there.I am not disappointing with my purchase at all.  When I have more funds I will be ordering a second for my roommate. She was eying one long before I gave it though.  Just made it into PTK (International Honor Society for 2 year colleges) and she got me a nice gift when I got into PTK, so I figured would be well worth a gift for her.  This would make a very nice gift for a graduating high school student or someone in college.  Like I said, technology for college is going towards all electronic.  All of my classes had e book options this semester...but 2 classes I could only get e books.  I am going to rent the e book for the other 2 classes just so I don't have to lug heavy books to/from school any more.The only one downside I want to share is Amazon put the $500 charge on my account as a \"hold\" and then charged again when shipped.  I was a little upset by this as I\"m still 2 days later waiting for that \"hold\" to clear.  I have ordered hundred of times off of amazon over several years and never has this happened.

When tying it onto the Prime membership, it makes it a winning combination. There are a few reasons why I can't give 5 stars to this Kindle:1. No Google integration - Yes, I know what everyone else will say. If you really want that you should've bought either Google hardware or go with Samsung, etc. Sure, you're right. But no, that doesn't mean Google integration should not be part of the package. What happened if Google decided not to support any Amazon app (and just removed them all from Play store)? I wish Amazon would just allow Google apps in and let the market decide who they want to go with. Again, this hardware is just plain beautiful.2. Problem with speakers - Within the first few weeks I had a problem with speakers where they just stopped working.After reaching out to Mayday (awesome service, Amazon!) the service person suggested that I would insert/remove headphone jack and see if that would fix the issue. It did immediately. The person went on to say that it was a known issue and product development was working on it.

Connecting to my WiFi was simple and without problems.  Adding the device to my existing Verizon account did require my calling Verizon's tech support, but that's probably because I live out from town and wasn't getting a strong enough signal.  However, Verizon tech support was very helpful and quickly resolved the problem.  There was also a glitch connecting to my email account on my ISP, but that seems to have been a problem at their end, and has been resolved.  Connecting to my Gmail account was seamless.I've found the frequent complaint of not enough apps (compared to as standard Android) to be a non issue for me.  I've had no problem finding the apps I need and want, or acceptable replacements in cases where the ones I'm use to aren't available.It would be nice if the HDX came with Google maps/navigator installed, but I have that on my phone, so it's not a big issue.  Besides Map Quest maps/navigation is free at the Kindle app store.  It may not be quite up to Google maps, but then again, maybe it is.  I really haven't an opportunity to try it yet.All in all, I'm pleased with my device, and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I've only had it for one day.=======================  Comments added on 2/27/2014 ==================================================I'm now two weeks into owning my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (Verizon), and I've added another star to my rating to make it a 5-star rating.  I stand by all my comments above, and would like to add that I find the management and use of my Kindle library so much easier with this tablet than with my old (Gen. 3, I think) Kindle.  With this device I get to see the cover of the book I'm reading each time I open it on the carrousel, so I can remember the name of the book I'm reading.  On my old Kindle, I usually only saw the title and author when I first started reading and quickly forgot both (hey, I'm 70 years old).I've installed Waze navigation app, and it works very well - not that I will use my tablet often for navigation, but it's nice to have.Like most, if not all, Android based tablets, it doesn't get as strong a 4G or 3G signal as my Android phone, but I'm usually connected to WiFi, so that's not particularly important to me, which I'm sure begs the question of why did I buy a 4G model to begin with.  The answer is simple - I wanted to.All in all I find the Kindle Fire HDX far superior to my wife's Android tablet, and I'm very pleased with it.  So far, I've found no down side.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent, fast with beautiful display", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R3NP8GGV0UQAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave the Kindle Fire HDX 4 stars because of not having access to Google Play Store for even more apps. The \"plus\" is you are allowed to install apps from 3rd parties via a selection in the setting menu. I sometimes have the need to remote in to our servers at work using RDP. I can do that with the Kindle Fire HDX. I tried several RDP apps available through Amazon and the results weren't satisfactory. I got an app from a 3rd party and now I seamlessly access the servers I need to get to and can even access my workstation desktop.

The graphics are amazing and I am very happy with the placement of the power and volume buttons. Also, because of the slimmer profile and the lighter weight it is much nicer to hold. I'm already looking forward to the next model upgrade. Thank you Amazon!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I take it everywhere!", "Author": "M.

And they are reasonably priced and often free! I get my news, my games and my books all in one device. The only negative item I have found is you can not use any application that uses Flash. And some videos won't play on it. For what it DOES do, it out weights the couple of things it doesn't do.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "im in love!!", "Author": "raquel", "ReviewID": "R29JMXRB4KY9Y1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is my 3rd kindle and I love it!!!  its nice and slim.
