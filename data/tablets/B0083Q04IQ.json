(as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.============The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE. The cover from my wife's Gen 1 Kindle will fit the Gen 2 kindle (sorta) but NOT THE HD.THE SCREEN:- FIRE HD SUMMED UP IN TWO WORDS Oh. My. The Le Pan, the iPads and the Gen 2 Fire all have great screens. The Fire HD takes them all out. I read somewhere there was polarizing a filter over the Fire HD screen. Polarizers reduce glare by only letting 'straight' light though not off angle bounced light. This makes an enormous difference to this display. The off angle viewing is probably the best I have seen in any flat screen. 6 stars.- FIRE GEN 2 Still a high quality screen. I'd same the same or better than any other high end tablet on the market.- NOTE A few people in the comments asked about the touch response. - I do not have a problem except in the browser, it is sorta too sensitive. If you move your finger smoothly you can avoid the jitters.THE WIFI.- FIRE HD I admit only the geeky probably care but the wifi rocks. I have a mimo router and one quick copy from my server and I was getting almost 30MB/s. To put that into perspective, that's about as fast and an external USB Hard drive can push data to your computer. (USB 3.0 will be faster but they are rare today) -- The other thing is that I have a long skinny house and when I'm in the back bath, the Le Pan drops off. (ahem not that I surf on the potty or anything, just when I test it, you know.) With the Fire HD I can surf in the back yard.- FIRE GEN 2 still got 20MB/sec. But consider this... at that speed you can fill the entire memory in 5 minutes. Seems good enough to me.THE SOUND:- FIRE HD ok I'm a bit of an audio snob. The sound is fantastic for being a tablet. Which is to say it's still only marginally acceptable. You can still buy a $15 pair of Koss KSC75 headphones and blow the speakers away BUT I will say this is the first device I would actually listen to music on. The rest I simply don't even bother. I suspect most people would call the sound excellent.- FIRE GEN 2 still have a very good sound. For the spoken word it would be very fine. For music it is lacking in my book.SPEED: Both are quick with the HD being quicker. The Le Pan II is no slouch but I think the HD edges it out. Since the Le Pan apparent died this morning it's hard to compare. :-(NOTE: IT DOES NOT COME WITH A WALL WORT CHARGER It comes with a micro USB cable that can be used with your existing USB wall worts. (ie your cell phone charger) You can buy a rapid charger for it or even plug it into your computer to charge. This is an odd choice from Amazon IMO.NOTE 2: Unlike the Gen 1 Fire, (and contrary to what you might have read) the new Kindles DO NOT support flash. Rumor has it you can hack it to install Flash I have not tried yet. I'll try to run this down by this weekend.NEW FEATURES (as promised)EXCHANGE CALENDAR SYNC:BOTH - Exchange on the Fire (both) just rocks. I really like the calendar app. The contact manager can't keep up with the one on the iPad but it is sufficient. Ditto the email. But the setup was easy and it seemed fast. Love it.SKYPE:- FIRE HD Spent way too long video skyping today. It worked as well as skype ever works. (long time skype users will understand that) yes it was glitchy but less than other platforms so no complaints. The sound really made a difference here.- Fire GEN 2 I don't think Skype came with it. I'll update with a definitive later.HDMI- FIRE HD ONLY I promised someone in the comments to test this soon but I misplaced my HDMI cable. (drat) I guess I'll order a new one and update when it arrives.BLUETOOTH- FIRE HD ONLY worked very smoothly pairing with LG tone. (great product btw) I'll be using that for Skype in the future.FREETIME: BOTH This is a widely requested feature that allows multiple users (i.e. kids) to log in and have their own customized tablet experience. It also allows parents to limit the time kids spend on certain tasks, like watching movies, while giving them unlimited time to read. Parents have been asking for this forever. (Are you listening Apple?) I wasted 20 minutes looking for it before I looked it up and Amazon is not shipping it until next month. The existing parental controls are pretty decent actually.CLOSING THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:If you're new to Kindle make sure you understand what you are buying here. Kindles are made -and sold at a highly discounted price- to allow you to purchase media from Amazon. Don't think of this as an android tablet, because it really isn't. Yes Amazon uses the Android operating system but you'd never know they hide it so well. This device is made (basically) exclusively to read/watch/listen to media you buy from Amazon. In that regard this device is about as great as they could make it. HOWEVER. The Kindle Fire (first generation) was notorious for not playing well with many Android apps. If you're a app monster or looking for something to replace your laptop to allow you do work on the road and occasionally consume media, you need to look at an Android tablet or an iPad. But don't let that discourage you:Via Amazon Prime, you get 25,000 streaming movies and T.V. shows you can watch 24/7 unlimited. We dropped Netflix because Prime Instant Video was so good. Amazon gives you a free month with the either Fire so you'll get to see the value before you buy. (it's a no brainer btw) There are also over a million free books available for the Kindle. I try to limit how many I buy/download but I have over 100 books on my previous Kindle that are waiting to be read, all but like 4 of them were free. Also if you own a Kindle and subscribe to Prime, you can borrow one book per month from the Paid section. And big name books too... all 7 Harry Potter books are up there. If you figure that is worth at least 10 bucks a month, you're getting $120 of content per year and Prime only costs (I think) $79. Or looked at another way, that's $240 in content in two years and the Fire HD is only $199.If you're new to e-readers, owning one might just change your life. I had probably read 8 book length books in the last decade. (I'm a periodical junkie.) I now read at least one book per week. I was a big reader before but I'm reading more than I ever have in my life. Many studies show that people are reading as much as 3X more when they get an e-reader. If you're a parent looking to inspire a love of reading in a child, STOP. DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200. Buy them an e-reader.SO THE BIG QUESTION, WHICH ONE DO I BUY?- If you're on a VERY tight budget the Fire Gen 2 is a great product at a great price point. Coupled with Prime, you have access to mountains of cheap content.HOWEVER. When you look at what you get for the small difference in cost, the Fire HD blows it away... You get a better screen, better sound, bluetooth, it's faster, thinner and lighter than the Fire. You also get double the memory, better wifi and over 2 hours more battery life. All for $40. I guess Amazon wants to make color Kindles as affordable as possible but I don't even know why they made the small one. I'm not sorry I bought it but all things considered, I would buy two big ones if I had it to do over.I'll be taking questions in the comments for the next week or maybe more, so feel free to ask.Hope this was helpful.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful product and incredible support from Amazon!", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R35ZL1Q6W1WCPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter.  Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen.  Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it.  Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work.  Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us.  Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD.  We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors.  Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat.  Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one.  Their customer service is incredible!  The Kindle Fire itself is amazing.  The internet is fast; connects perfectly to all wi-fi; the graphics are clear and sharp; the books and apps offered are endless.  My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly.  I'm always reading.  My husband checks the sports scores.  My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best value", "Author": "Me \"Me\"", "ReviewID": "R19CVLCFQC4DNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my kindle fire today.  I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite.  I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading.  I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks.  It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info.  The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this.  The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time.  I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace)  in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, \"11/22/63\".I also tested out the text to speech.  It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard.  It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version.  I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be.  I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television.  The offers only show on the startup, no big deal.  I already took advantage of a $5.00 credit for amazon video.  I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway.  So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements.  I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.  These are books I always wanted to read,but never had the discipline to just read them.  Reading and listening to those books are worth the price of this new gadget, IMO.Way to go, Amazon, for a great product and a great price!P.S.I have an iPad, and the last time I went on vacation, I left it at home and brought only my fire and kindle keyboard.  I didn't miss my iPad at all and this new gen fire is even better.  Seriously, it's that good.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product but they get you with the ads and missing accessories", "Author": "Old School Working Mom \"Old School\"", "ReviewID": "R1WNJJT4FP9W1S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it.  He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future.  My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her.  She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it.  We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her.  Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra $20, and it cost us $15 to have the ads turned off.  So now we're up to $194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for $159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012***  Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills.  While I'm sure folks are \"well intentioned\" (sarcasm), I don't recall asking for parenting advice. Many have said it's ridiculous to buy an eReader for a child who can't read. Yet the FIRE is marketed as a competitor to a tablet device, not an eReader.  The Fire does everything the iPad can do (except take pictures and videos). My children prefer to read books on paper. Instead, they use the Fire almost exclusively as a gaming device as there are hundreds of free (or super cheap) game apps for kids - including educational apps.  They also listen to music and watch videos on it. I looked at it as a replacement for my daughter's leapster (which she is aging out of) and as an alternative to a portable DVD player and/or iPod.  Several devices in one.  As we are getting ready to take the kids on a cross-country trip, I will be thrilled not to have to lug around several devices that come with DVDs and expensive game cartridges that are easily lost. We will pack one device. Done.***Update Oct 22, 2012*** Sorry, me again.  First, wanted to THANK those who offered support and told me to ignore the negative nellies who suggested I was an indulgent parent raising the spoiled rotten brats of the future. Secondly, wanted to respond to some questions I've repeatedly received.  The ads appear primarily on the lock screen.  When unlocked, they disappear.  For adult users who are used to dealing with ads in free apps, this might be something you'd be willing to contend with to save a few bucks.  But this was a confusing concept for my 5 year old - and I repeat that the ads I saw were too mature for a young audience.  Even after I paid the $15 to have the ads removed, my daughter's Kindle still received an ad to \"Vote for Obama\". It appears as a banner at the top of every screen and I have not been able to get rid of it.  I am extremely irritated with this, as it seems some ads will get thru regardless.Others have commented that it's cheap to buy a wall charger, and to quit complaining about it.  OK, I see your point - but if it's so cheap, then Amazon should provide it.  I find it absolutely unacceptable that Amazon would not provide a wall charger.  I realize Amazon loses money on the device, but they do so anticipating they will more than make up for that loss in profit from the apps, books, and movie purchases.  As far as I can tell, Amazon doesn't seem to be hurting.  So come on, Amazon, throw in the darned wall charger already!!Finally, since I purchased this item on Day One of its release, I see that Amazon has updated its product description so it's more obvious as to what the device does - and doesn't - come with. Additionally, the product title now includes the words \"with special offers\" (IMHO, a deceptive way of saying it comes loaded up with ads) - But I'm glad Amazon added it - now people can be more informed than I was about what they are getting themselves into.I'm an Amazon Prime member - so have invested pretty heavily in Amazon.  If I weren't a Prime member, I would have considered other brands over Amazon's Kindle.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value for the Price and Improvements Over First Generation Fire", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R27VUDXJZZTQZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for just $159 you are getting one heck of a deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for the first-generation Fire this one is replacing and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad.  Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is an outstanding tool / toy.  My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire to the original Fire, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Wi-Fi Connectivity:My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags.  In this comparison, I had this version of the Fire sitting next to the previous version of the Fire, my Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the new 7\" Fire HD (the Fire HD is in a separate yet similar review) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity..My website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle.  The ones that were usually slow on the other devices and were slow on the Kindle Fire (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router.  When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did not have a noticeable difference in the other devices, except it did lose connection on CNN.  Basic web searches on Google were all at the same speed.Screen Display / Video Playback:Amazon has made a few tweaks in the display / resolution, and I compared the viewing experience watching - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's.  The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpnessthan last year's model.  For you technical folks out there, the display is the same 1024x600 on last year's model yet looked crisper - the only thing I can attribute that to is last year's model I have has been used quite a bit and maybe there is some decrease in the view over time or it could be because I have a 3M screen protector on the old and haven't put one on yet with the new.  I don't know, it's just better looking.Sound / Music Playback:Similar to last year's model, the two speakers are located at the top of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports.  My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I wanted to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The headphone jack is located at the bottom of the unit just to the left of the power switch and the micro-USB port.  I don't like the placement here, as I tend to read books in the portrait mode (up / down similar to holding a book) vs. landscape mode, and the bottom of my headphone cord tends to \"poke\" you in the leg while reading and listening to a song at the same time.Email Setup:Email setup was very easy, but I will tell you I am using an existing app called Enhanced Email that I received here on the Amazon app store for free vs. what came as standard with the Fire.  I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails with no problem.  For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool.  The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web tabs Amazon has added a new look and feel to the overall display such as rather than 5 rows of 5 apps per row on the apps tab it is now 4 rows of apps with 4 apps per row which means bigger icons and fonts (yes), but more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for.  To offset that pain, I think that's why the added the new tabs called Shop, Games, Audiobooks, and Offers.  While many of these are self-explanatory, there are a LOT of ads in each of the tabs - after all, Amazon wants you to buy a lot of stuff to help offset whatever the true cost of this unit is.While the apps tab has all of your apps in the cloud or on the device, the games tab basically slices and dices the apps you have to be game specific - that's pretty handy and helps out quite a bit, especially if you have a lot of apps and want to sit down and play a game (although you still have to scroll away to find, say, a business app in the app tab).What I think is a really nice new feature is the Audiobooks tab.  Amazon of course gives you many opportunities in this tab to make purchases from their Audible subsidiary, but you also have a \"Library\" area where you can see your audiobooks that are stored either on the Cloud or on your Kindle Fire in the Device tab.Reading Books:When the Fire first came out, I preferred reading on my e-Ink Kindle and not at all on the Fire.  That's because I think reading is easier on my eyes with the e-Ink version of Kindle, but I'm getting there!  Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.Feature I wish this had?The #1 thing would have to be a Bluetooth connectivity option.  Of course, if I put this right next to my iPad there could be others such as the larger screen and a 3G or 4G connection option, but that's going to be in next month's release and I would call myself an iPad-lite user vs. an experienced pro so who knows what else I could be missing (life has been good so far, so I'm not complaining)?  For $159, I feel like I am getting a lot already.The #2 thing would be a plug / charger that connects to an electrical outlet vs. a USb port on your computer or a USB-compatible charging plug you may already own.  I realize they had to cut things out to keep the cost down to $159, and luckily I - like many of you - have lots of these things laying around.  First time buyers may not, but they might be in the minority.Overall, at $159 this is not a great deal it is an outstanding deal.  Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things.  Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Charging Port Let Down DUN DUN DUNNNNNN!!!!!!!!", "Author": "hair8girl", "ReviewID": "RGNOKYCQMRNR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First I have to say that I feel sorry for the customer service people that work ay Amazon and that all of them have been nice even with the fact their hands were tied.

Right out of the box I loved it. Got it a pretty case and screen protector and immediately stuck it in there before ever even powering it on.Right out of the box it had issues. The touch screen would sometimes not recognize my touch. I'd have to turn the screen on and off again several times to even unlock the dumb thing. I had read about it, and I never thought it could have been THAT bad.. but it was.But I kept it.. and read some books. Started some really fun games and paid real money for things device specific (regrettably so). I dealt with the issues in sensitivity, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.But what really took the cake was when I took it to the doctor with me. Two different appointments two days in a row. Fully charged it the night before, sat it in my bag, and then off to the doctor I went. 20 minutes after sitting it in my bag, I pull it out.. and it's off. Now that's strange, I thought, the battery was FULLY CHARGED and the stupid thing WOULD NOT POWER ON. AT ALL. I spent the 45 minute wait trying to figure out what had happened. Popped it out of it's little case, looked all over.. felt it to see if maybe it had overheated? No way.. After 45 minutes of continuously pressing the on/off button it finally turned back on. With close to a full battery I was flabbergasted.. Why did it turn off? Why would it not turn back on? I thought it was a fluke... The next day it happened again.And it's happened about a dozen times since then in less than two weeks. Well today was the last straw for me. It completely froze up on me and randomly turned off as I was playing a game. It had never actually shut off in front of me, but there is obviously something defective with my device.Also had problems with the charging port like lots of other people have mentioned. Have to plug and unplug it a dozen or so times to get it to register, and even then sometimes will not charge.Will be dropping it off at UPS tomorrow. No thanks Amazon, no thanks.

The Fire will support flash, but you have to install Dolphin browser to run it.  That will use up part of the limited available storage, but it was worth it to me.

This is apparently an older version of flash which may not run everything you want, but it's better than nothing.#2. Buy the AC power adapter when you buy the Fire.  It will cost $10.00 more if you buy it separately later.  The Fire comes with a USB cord to charge the Fire via your PC, which is a much slower process.#3.

Instead, you are faced with a full-screen add whenever you wake up your Kindle.  These are especially irksome when they are for movies I Saw and hated.  I find myself unlocking the screen as quickly as possible just to get past the full-page ad.  Not the best way to set myself up for a quite hour of reading.Ads also sneak in in other ways.  When you pull up the shortcut for and app, the bottom of the screen is filled with obnoxious \"suggestions for you\".

I'm still new to the tablet/smart phone world, so I must say that I have pretty low needs and standards when it comes to these things. I am a grad student, and I need a device that allows me to check my email on the go, take notes, store books, and all that jazz. I don't play a lot of games and I don't use a lot of apps. That being said, the Kindle Fire has been suiting my needs pretty well.A lot of people complain about the ads. In particular, I've noticed a lot of people complaining that adult themed ads come up - this is true! Other than that, the ads are not all that annoying and they do not interfere with your use of the device. I kind of like the suggestion ads because they allow me to check out apps/books that I wouldn't otherwise go looking for.The battery life is OK - it's not stellar, but I can make it through a 3 hour class on a charge while taking notes and surfing the web. On Airplane mode, I can read and listen to music for about 5 hours. Contrary to other reviews, I have not had difficulty using the device while it is plugged in. It does not matter how you hold the device, the screen will always rotate smoothly and quickly.I am concerned about the small amount of memory especially because there is no way to upgrade. I have not filled up my 8 gigs yet, but I know that I can only carry a limited amount of music and that is kind of annoying.The Silk web browser is kind of slow and clumsy. At times, it is down right difficult to use.The touch screen is very responsive and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use. The speakers are pretty good, good enough to carry around with me while I do stuff around the house. However, there is no easy way to change the volume. You have to go into the device settings and do it that way - too complicated if you ask me.I like and hate how the opening page of the tablet is set up - all of your apps/books in a row with the most recently used ones coming up first. This make it easy to access the things you use all the time (like), but it also makes it nearly impossible to find items that you rarely use (Hate). I would prefer a grid set up, but I haven't figured out how to make that change.All in all the tablet has lived up to (but not exceeded) my expectations. It is quite obviously a device that Amazon created for amazonophiles so that they can quickly and easily consume materials and give them money. I have Amazon Prime (recommended!) and am in a stage in my life where I do heavily rely on Amazon for text books and other stuff so it works well for me.

As soon as I saw the box I was ecstatic because I'd been eying one forever but just didn't want to make the purchase. As I gleefully unwrapped it and turned it on I realized that I'd soon be using this for everything.And I have.I'm definitely a big electronics consumer, I have multiple smart phones, video game consoles, computers, mp3 players, cameras, etc. I work as tech support. I feel comfortable discussing the pros and cons of this tablet.So what are some of the best features in my opinion?-Ease of use. There's really not much of a learning curve. You literally turn it on, create/sign into your Amazon account, and from there it's ridiculously easy to find anything you need. Books? Got it. Movies, Apps, Games, Music? Got those too.-Portable. The perfect size. I don't feel ridiculous pulling this out if I take it somewhere with me to read. The screen is just big enough that I can comfortably let my eyes wander around it, and I can hold it with one hand. Also, I don't have swaddle it like a child and dread dropping it. It's sturdy!-The price is amazing for the amount of things that you can do on it.-I'm going to rehash the ease of use, because really, Amazon could not make it easier for me to get books and apps. I can spend 20 minutes just browsing through the free books they have to offer alone.-The processor on this thing can handle a lot of multi-tasking which is good if you're like me and get easily distracted by wanting to check email, testing out an app real quick, and then go back to reading while listening to streaming music.What are some things that I'm not crazy about?-The sound is terrible! Seriously, terrible! Maybe my Kindle just doesn't work correctly, but watching Netflix I need to be holed away in a room under the covers to hear maybe 50% of what's going on. Maybe my hearing isn't great. But this is my biggest gripe. With headphones in, I can't find the middle ground. It's either way too loud or way too soft. So frustrating.-Not enough customization. I like to tinker, and I'm also into design. And the look of the Kindle Fire just isn't clean, sharp and minimalistic enough for me. I want to be able to choose my fonts, icons, theme. None of those options are available on mine! I know, I know, the price is great. Why would I complain? Because it doesn't seem like adding these features is really that much more coding when you've got an Android OS backing it already.-Sometimes the Amazon app market takes forever to get applications your friends on other OS systems are raving about. Occasionally you'll get some sort of \"generic\" copy of it, but there's really nothing better you can do but wait for to finally reach the Amazon app market.-Lastly, having to purchase my own USB cable to hook it up to my computer was a bit of a pain. Could Amazon not have just made a USB/AC adapter?All in all, I definitely recommend it as a solid system, and a solid tablet. The price is remarkable for what you get.

They said the new kindle currently doesnt support flash.  So I asked if it will one day, and they said they cant make any promises.  Sorry to say, this made me return the kindle.  I will likely get one again when it supports flash like the old kindle fire does(if I havent bought another competitors tablet by then)Also, if you are going to buy this tablet, pay the extra $40 for the 2 year warranty.

If you, like me, like to curl up in a big chair or in  your bed and read a good book on a rainy day, forget about that!

Yes, you can charge it all day and yet it's only good for a couple of hours before it's turning off with no juice left.I thought one would be able to read a book with a charge, but even a short book, that's not going to happen unless you are a speed reader.  And games?  Forget about that too, because games just chew the battery up and you will be playing games next to your computer.What a shame this kindle doesn't come with a wall plug that charges the unit.  Sure you can buy one, but it might or it might not work on your kindle.  And if you buy it from Amazon, it's pricey to buy the plug that the usb cord plugs into. Why on earth doesn't it come with this plug?  What a pity.I will probably not buy another kindle until the price either comes WAY down or the battery gets a LOT better.  Or if it came with extra battery and a battery charger that isn't dependent on being inside the kindle to charge.... kind of like my digital camera, I can take the battery out and charge it and put a fresh one in while the other one is charging.Moving on.  The kindle is much heavier than I thought it would be.  It's hard to hold it up with your hands for any length of time.Also the kindle is hard to hold because the \"frame\" around the screen is so narrow.  I am constantly having to lay it down to \"flip\" back to the page I was reading because my thumb got too close to the screen and flipped the book back 4 or 5 pages or forward 4 or 5 pages.  This is irritating.On the good side, the kindle is easy to use and it's very easy to buy books for it.  It's also pretty easy to down load books.One thing I haven't figured out is how to get books that I've already read off the screen on the kindle.  They need to just stay in the cloud and not show on my kindle proper.  Of course, there's no manual to help with this and that is a shame.  I would think eventually I will run out of storage space on my kindle and then what do I do?  Buy another one and fill it up?  I'm sure there's a way to delete things, but darned if I can figure it out.All in all I love my kindle.  BUT I would suggest if you don't need one yet, I'd wait another generation before I bought.

Here are some thoughts for newbies to Kindles. If you previously had a Paperwhite or an e-Ink version, the Kindle Fire (HD or HDX) are not the same. They can't be read easily in bright light BUT they don't require a lighted cover or accessory light. They DO require an easel cover and you may end up reading them in landscape (sideways) rather than portrait. But some books are for portrait format only (this annoys me.) These Kindles are better at apps and games. You can watch downloaded video, so PRIME is excellent to add and it's worth having. Then, you figure out, the bigger Kindle is better for viewing but...it is larger for carrying. I like the smaller size because it's no bigger than a trade paperback and it fits in a purse. Finally, the Fires are an awesome travel tablet. I went all over the darn place (right to the end of the earth as it happens, South America and Patagonia.) Except for when we were cut off from civilization because they don't have a geosynchronous satellite over unihabited areas of the Atlantic or Pacific, the Kindle was a great device to grab email, yack on Facebook and check this and that. I even ordered a book and a few apps. The Kindle worked as my alarm clock and boredom-relieving device in airports, planes and long waits for various connections on a long journey. There is a multi-voltage kit for a fast charger and if you are a traveler to foreign places, I recommend it instead of the standard fast charger. Not much more, much more useful In short, this thing travels well. It doesn't hold a charge as long as a Paperwhite, so you have to strategize your charging. But I'm completely in love with my old Kindle Fire and am considering an upgrade.The Kindle Fire adds features not available on the older, black and white models. But it's a different creature and has pros and cons. If you want color, streaming video and many new books (especially cookbooks) you may find you must own a Fire to download those Kindle books--a new trend. Also, magazines work well on the Fire and are nearly useless on the black and white versions, no color, poor resolution of photos. So the Fire has its uses compared to the older Kindles, but it's not 100 percent perfect, either. The older Kindles have very good applications for which the Fire is not as optimal.  Here's my impression after a few weeks of use:1. Ease of reading: Flipping book pages is easy. You have a choice of formats, page curl, no page curl and a simplified text that fills the screen (more like the original Kindles.) To page through, you stroke the screen and the pages turn easily.2. Text size and picture size: to enlarge by stretching the screen, you move your fingers apart on the page. But if you are in the simple text mode, you cannot zoom in. I have heard from other users that it is harder to enlarge the text. In the b&w; Kindles, you can change the font size. You can also change some fonts in the books on the Fire, and you can employ text-to-voice mode. I didn't like the voice in the book I tried out--kind of a scratchy female voice, not something I wanted reading to me.3. Magazines: to look at pictures and zoom in, you need to be in normal mode, but for ease of reading, the simplified text makes the page fill the screen. I can't read some of the magazines in normal text mode; the print is too small. But one magazine was fairly good in this mode (a magazine on painting.) I enjoyed zooming in on the photos and they were brilliant. A cooking magazine (Vegetarian Times) was very readable. A knitting magazine was nearly useless--zooming in on the pattern chart left a lot of it out of the frame even turned landscape mode, and since knitting charts need to be big enough to read AND be visible from side to side, I decided I'd get my knitting magazine via CD/DVD rather than in a Kindle format. In short, not suitable for every magazine you may be reading.4. You need a constant WiFi to really take advantage of the Fire. I have no Wifi at work, so it's only useful for reading previously downloaded books. If I want to buy a new book, I have to find a hotspot.5. The battery runs down far faster--well, it's broadcasting to WiFi, it's projecting light through the screen, so it's power-hungry compared to the simpler Kindles. You will probably end up wanting the Power Charger, which works 3X as fast as a USB port.6. The screen gets smudgy from your fingers. Some screen protectors reduce the clarity of the text and picture resolution7.Yes, you cannot see the screen in full sunlight. Glare/screen protector needed, see comment above about reduced resolution.8. Cases are helpful--the glass screen is beautiful but subject to being banged around if you carry it in a purse or briefcase. So your purchase price is going to increase if you add charger, case and screen protector and maybe a stylus9. Hitting the stroke to activate the home icon can be annoying--if you don't tap just the right spot, can take a while (maybe a stylus would help?)Summary:This is great for reading magazines but not great for enlarging text in simplified text mode. It is heavier than a regular Kindle but you get color and streaming video. The speakers are adequate. If you want more tablet function for video, you'd probably be happier with the HD, for resolution, size and for the increased memory. Either way, if you buy a Kindle Fire, count on spending more, quite a bit more, to fit it out with case, stylus, screen protector and a faster charger that can be used instead of USB/computer charging.I still prefer my Kindle Keyboard for everyday use, but I like this because I can read magazines and see videos. I also prefer the Keyboard for travel--it's more compact, it stays charged for a longer time, and it has 3G, meaning I can download new reading material from nearly everywhere in the US, wifi or not. However, if you are a magazine and newspaper subscriber, and want tablet entertainment (apps, games and video) then the Fire is a good choice.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the Kindle Fire 7\"", "Author": "djames", "ReviewID": "R1WVQ2NXD114QF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kindle Fire for my 5 year old son. I was going to get him a childs tablet for Christmas, but this was on sale for almost the same price.  I decided I would get him a real tablet with a better range of games, books and overall better quality.I bought the Kindle on Cyber Monday, and paid for 2 day shipping.  I bought it around 2PM, and received it the next day by 10AM.  I was incredibly impressed with how fast I received the product.Before getting the Kindle, I read a review that there wasn't a paper \"Getting Started\" guide in the packaging.  That review also went on to say that they had trouble navigating and figuring out how to use the Kindle.  When I received the Kindle, it didn't have the guide.  It only came with the Kindle and the USB cord.  Having a smart phone, I wasn't too concerned because I know the basic functions of a touch screen.  When you start the kindle, it walks you through a \"Tips and Ticks\" start up feature.  When you get to the main screen, there is a getting started guide in the carousel of \"Apps\" to choose from.  I applaud Amazon for being green!  That's a great place to put the guide, and you wont' have to worry about losing it! I, personally, found the Kindle very easy to navigate without using the guide.It does not come with a wall charger, but I used my iPhone charger and it works just fine 9 (and fast) in charging the Kindle.  If you plug the USB into a laptop, it charges VERY VERY slowly BUT if you drop down to the notification screen on the Kindle, it does proactively tell you that it's connected to a low power supply and it'll charge slowly.  It also tells you that while it's connected to the low power supply, it won't charge while the Kindle is in use.Overall, I found the set up process very easy and seamless. I was able to start downloading within minutes of setting up. The picture quality is simply amazing.  The video quality is crisp and the dual speakers are just awesome.  I brought up one of the free books pre-loaded on the device to test reading, and the quality is just as wonderful!  Very very easy to read the text.  The touch quality is just as great as the rest of the features, it's not slow or spastic.  I am extremely impressed with the quality of the product for such a low price.It really is a great little tablet, especially for kids.  I find it very user friendly, and I'm not concerned that my 5 year old wont know how to use it.  I love the Cloud part of this device.  It makes pictures/videos/music accessible without having to store it on your device (keeping memory free).  If you're thinking of getting your little one a tablet, I really encourage you to get the Kindle Fire 7\" or Kindle Fire HD 7\", because it's perfect.  Save your time, money and the headache of getting a child's tablet(having to connect it to the computer to remove and add things.. eck.).  You'll get more bang for your buck with the Kindle and you will not be disappointed!Or if you're thinking about getting this for yourself, I would definitely encourage it as well!  I love it!

I saw the promise of the future in the first Kindle. I loved the size and ease of carrying multiple books with me any time I wanted. Also, the battery life was great. (One thing I really miss on the new Paperwhite is the cool screen savers on the original Kindle.) Then I bought the iPad and used the Kindle app some, but there were way too many distractions on the iPad to read much. This year I decided to upgrade my ereader to the new Kindle Paperwhite. I have it and love it for reading.Now onto the Kindle Fire. When I ordered the Kindle Paperwhite, it wasn't supposed to be delivered until Dec. 21. I read reviews every day for the Paperwhite and started to get concerned about the negative reviews. I used the iPad in poor light or in the dark, but I wanted something smaller to take around with me. So, anyway, one day in early November I got a Lightning Deal on the Kindle Fire for $129.00. I decided what the heck. If I didn't like it, I figured I could give it to someone for Christmas or see about returning it. It ended up that I spent a total of $135.00 for the Kindle Fire and case and $158.00 for the Paperwhite and case. Still I got two cool gadgets for less than an iPad mini would have cost. I had considered the iPad mini at first, but I decided to wait for retina display on it before I felt compelled.I ended up getting the Kindle Fire and the Paperwhite on the same day. I tried both of them out, and I like both for different reasons. I decided to keep both even though I have two iPads already. The Paperwhite is as great as I thought it would be for JUST reading. It has nothing extra to distract me from the joy of the book.The Kindle Fire though was a surprise. I really like it too. I like the feature of it reading to you if you want. The Prime membership was a huge surprise too. I bought a new TV this summer and now I can watch a movie on the Kindle or my iPad on the Amazon video app and finish it up on the TV if I want. I am keeping the Prime membership for sure. I really think the Prime membership is necessary to get the full benefits of the Kindle Fire.Yes, the Amazon app store has a lot to be desired compared to iTune's app store, but the basics are there. For what I wanted it is great. It is smaller and easier to tote around and it does some fun things.

So as I pondered buying another for my kids to share, I was thrilled to hear that a second generation Fire was going to be released.  Both of my kiddos have significant developmental delays and had both responded very well to the first one.  So much so, I needed to buy another to alleviate the arguing.Well, I received the new one yesterday and am completely frustrated.  When you power the machine on, you can either unlock it with a swipe to the left, OR go to an ADVERTISEMENT with a swipe to the right. (Which you can unsubscribe to with a $15 fee) On the main home screen, there is the carousel and no longer are your favorites listed below....instead there are more ADVERTISEMENTS labeled \"Customers Also Bought\". I am so very sad that I can no longer let my kids use this Kindle without direct supervision to keep them from buying everything that looks shiny and exciting. (I do know I can turn off purchasing, but the device is back and forth so much that it would be a lot of hassle.)  It's highly annoying to me when I am using it alone.  It's far too distracting to even be usable with kids.  I don't even want it anymore.  I want another first generation Fire.

It is unfortunate that this makes it unusable for my kids.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOT IT RIGHT!", "Author": "P. Steward \"pls\"", "ReviewID": "R3U2WX5KZGKRYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the one I have been waiting for!  I have a Galaxy Tab and had (and then resold)an iPad, so am familiar with tablets.  Tablets are not meant to replace computers for complex computing tasks and this device doesn't pretend to do so(although browsing, email and apps work well).The Kindle FIRE is easy to use and priced at a point that is accessible to most everyone.  Text-to-speech is the feature that is unique to the Amazon products and it is a mystery as to why Amazon isn't shouting this capability from the rooftops.  It enables a person to listen to the majority of the Kindle books on an infinite number of topics.  For even capable readers, this enables us to listen to a book when our visual attention is elsewhere (cooking, house chores, driving, computing), so it enables me to cover much more material than I would if I had to stop when other activities demanded it. TTS capability is only available on some of the Amazon products, so those for whom this is an important feature must carefully check the specs of the models they want before ordering.  It has now been enabled on the basic version of the FIRE (also on the DX, Touch and some models of the keyboard versions).The only thing that would make it even better is to make the TTS capability available on the new larger FIRE model.  The HD FIRE models have a new ability to integrate with Audible to get some dramatized spoken literature, but the added cost of paying for each piece is a real limitation (I also listen to audiobooks almost constantly on my iPhone, so I love them, but they are spendy).  Compared to the availability of material enabled by the Kindle TTS, selection is limited.  Currently, TTS carries no additonal charge for use with enabled Kindle books.Text-to-speech has the potential to have an enormous impact for many large groups:With the big bulge of population moving into their older years, many of us who have had good vision in the past are finding that long stretches of reading are much more fatiguing than before.  I am a boomer who loves to read before bed, but by the end of the day my eyes are tired and even with glasses and large text, words start jumping and blurring late in the evening.  It makes it hard to keep up with the flow of the story and I will eventually give up.  With TTS, I can read along without having to backtrack.  With a huge segment of the population just coming into seniorhood, this will be a very popular way for aging readers to stay involved and informed.  Most seniors are not aware of TTS capability and even most librarians and senior advocates do not know about this.A second group that should receive specific information about this capability are what we call \"weak readers\".  These are people of any age who can read, but for many reasons, labor to do so.  In my years as a special ed teacher I was able to help many students go from being non-readers to getting through essential reading tasks.  However, reading remains a difficult process for them, so as adults they only read when they can't get the information otherwise.  These people are not intellectually limited or lazy--in fact they are often exceptionally bright and diligent.  They would love to have access to the vast array of reading material of any topic, but they just don't have the time or energy to struggle.  TTS opens an almost endless supply of reading material to them in a way that they can actually use.  One of the ironies of reading instruction is that the more one reads, the better one becomes at it.  By having TTS support for a printed page (i.e., a \"read-along\"), weak readers can continue to grow their skills over time.  This technique is universally acknowledged as the most effecitive way to teach children to read, but it is just as powerful a way to motivate and continue to grow reading skills at any age.Second-language speakers/readers can access a greater variety of material while simultaneously strengthening their own aural comprehension. Other features, like the dictionary is a great way to expand and clarify vocabulary in the context of a piece of material. People with severe vision impairments have resources available to them, but the technology is often expensive and access to it is cumbersome and limited.  A Kindle with TTS is a simple and cost-effective way for them to participate in an information society.Another large group would be accessed by integrating standardized textbooks from schools all around the country and at all grade levels into the Kindle platform.  This is a no-brainer in terms of handling and managing textual information.  The simple ability to pack a lockerful of texts in one small device is huge and cost-effective for cash-strapped districts. The game-changer is to make this material available in a larger screen, color format that maximizes the use of illustrations essential to so many subjects (especially the sciences).  For the cost of one or two standard texts, an entire school's resources can be loaded onto the Kindle when needed.  The costs of handling paper texts, storing them when not in use and replacing those that deteriorate is much less with digital versions.  The new 8.9\" HD FIRE would be especially suited to this, but it does not have TTS, but now the basic FIRE does.Applying this technology to the standardized text would have a huge impact.  In a given classroom, there is always a wide range of reading abilities, with the span greater the higher the grade level.  Further, it is typical that texts are written at a reading level that is well above the intended grade (e.g.: 8th grade text written at 10th grade reading level).  This means that 50% or more of the students in that class cannot effectively use that text to get the required information.  Teachers spend an enormous amount of time trying to find other materials that convey the same information at lower reading levels in order to include students in the standard curriculum.  If all students had equal access to the standard material, this would allow them to keep up with the pace of the class, assure common information and free the teacher to give more individual time to direct instruction.  Most parents I worked with would spend whatever it took to provide their kids with a resource that would potentially help them so enormously even if the school didn't alread provide it.Amazon should be much more aggressive and explicit in marketing the TTS capabilities of the Kindle products and resources.  Targeted mail and demonstration campaigns to advocacy groups for seniors and students in particular would result in a lot of sales to both private parties and public entities.  The TTS technology is the most unique capability that distinguishes the Kindle products from the ever-growing tablet products and Amazon is missing the boat in not promoting it as far and wide as possible.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good device, but not for me - returned it.", "Author": "J.R.P.", "ReviewID": "R34II9ZUAIYMRI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Even though I returned this item, I really do think it's a good device overall. The price is obviously the best selling point (I was able to buy mine for $129 at a promotional price), the screen is great, I love how it works with my Amazon Prime account to stream music and video, and it is a very capable and easy to use device. One notable downside is the \"recommendations\" that appear at the bottom of the screen. I know Amazon sells this thing at cost and makes money by selling more on it - but the inability to turn it off is a HUGE annoyance. If it weren't for that, I'd have given it 4 stars.However, after a couple of days I discovered that it just wasn't for me. I almost hate throwing this out there because I know there are a lot of \"haters\" out there, but I'm a *gasp* iPhone user. I wanted a tablet, but didn't really want to spend the money for an iPad because I believe they are highly overpriced. I own a Kindle e-reader and heard good things about the Fire, so I decided to give it a try. I knew when I bought it that it wasn't going to be the same thing and had realistic expectations. Initially I was pretty impressed, but after using it for a couple of days I came to the realization that it just wasn't what I was looking for. I like the functionality and intuitive \"flow\" of using my iPhone. The Kindle Fire experience just wasn't the same. Navigating was not as effortless and I found myself having to search for things and sorting through things to get to apps, media, settings and the app/media stores.. Additionally, the app selection, while impressive, wasn't what I was looking for. The facebook app was less than impressive (only shows the last 2-3 hours of posts), to give one example, and a lot of the apps that I know and love simply weren't available. I know I probably would have gotten the hang of it eventually and could have lived with the app selectoin, but I simply didn't want to have to \"get used to it.\" This device is good and a lot of people love it. But it's simply not what I was looking for. I spend a lot of time traveling and would be getting a LOT of use out of my tablet, so I didn't want something that was just \"good.\" Even though it makes me cringe to say this, my experience with the Fire has convinced me that in order to get what I'm looking for I need to be saving my money and taking advantage of a holiday sale for an iPad. Please note, that this is NOT an advertisement or endorsement for Apple products!! **To all the Apple-haters out there, please keep your negative feedback to yourselves** This is simply my experience and my opinion. I'm the type of person who likes things a certain way and isn't afraid to pay a little more to get what I want IF IT'S NECESSARY. I tried this product in order to avoid overpaying for something I wasn't quite sure I wanted or needed, and my experience helped me realize what it is that I really want.

I use it every day. I do a lot of reading, although reading is not the only thing I use my Kindle Fire for. There are tons of applications (plenty of which are FREE) available to include games, social media, organizational tools, and much more. You can watch videos and Netflix. You can listen to music. You can share excerpts from books you read on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites with a tap of your finger. You can highlight portions or text in any given book and it saves it for later referencing. You can also make notes, bookmark pages, and share your reading progress right from the page you are reading when you are reading it. You can download books via wifi right from the Kindle Fire. My FAVORITE part about the Kindle Fire is that I can read on my Kindle Fire, Cloud Reader Online, and my Amazon Kindle application on my phone and never have to worry about not knowing where I was at in a book or which device I last read on because they all sync with each other. Therefore, I have the opportunity to read basically anywhere and anytime if I'm near a computer, my phone, or my Kindle Fire. Also, once books are downloaded to the Kindle Fire device you do not need an internet connection to read. The same goes for Cloud Reader if you are sure to download the book for offline reading. The Kindle Fire is great for a fast reader because you can find another book right at your fingertips at any given time. I highly recommend the Kindle Fire for anyone who enjoys reading in general.

I WISH I could return them for a refund because I would. They are NOT kid friendly and my daughter and niece have had it for a week and already don't use it much because they have trouble finding their stuff on there with all the ads you have to go through first. What a waste of over $300. After reading and researching about this issue, seems there are many people not too happy about it and there is no way to take the ads off. I did however read that there was going to be an option to pay amazon $15 to remove it. That is so ridiculous I don't even know where to start.

My human just purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (tips below on how to get them to purchase a second tablet so that you get your own) and gave me her old Kindle Fire.  Of course, she should have given me both, or at least the new one, but.... there you have it.... humans aren't nearly as intelligent as they think they are.I thought I'd write a review for felines, or for humans thinking of purchasing a Kindle Fire for your feline.  Humans, you really should, your cat will love you for it.I am not interested in reading books, or going on the internet, or any of the other many things you can do on this tablet and which my human loved and often did.  My interest lies solely in the apps, especially Gizzy's Friend Gizzys Friend - a Cat Toy and Squish Squash Squoosh Bugs SQUISH SQUASH SQUOOSH BUGS! .  I'm sure there are other quality apps for us cats, though if there aren't, there really should be.  For now, I am very happy with these two, but certain I will be looking for more in the future.The screen is so clear, it looks as though the bugs and mouse are real!  I will admit, the first time I saw Gizzy the mouse, I thought he WAS real and tried to pick him up in my mouth after catching him under my paw.  I only admit this so that you know just how clear and vibrant the picture is.  The sound is also wonderful --- how I adore hearing the squeaks of that mouse when I catch him, or the chirps of the bugs when I squash them!Now, for how to get your human to give you your very own tablet --- steal theirs!  Stare at them and meow pitifully until they relent and quit reading their book or surfing the web, and turn the Kindle over to you.  Be sure to have them purchase some fun apps for you to watch and/or play with (see above for suggestions).  If you fall asleep whilst your app is on, keep an ear open because your human may try to steal it.  In that case, immediately wake up and give them the hurt \"How could you possibly do this to me?\" look.  They should then put it back down beside you.  Note, this may happen several times, and though it's not fun to have one's sleep interrupted like this, it is a necessary step to ensure you get your very own Kindle.  Your human will eventionally see that s/he has no hope of ever finishing that book unless she gets another Kindle for herself.Be assured, you will be very pleased with your human's purchase and will spend many waking and non-waking hours enjoying this wonderful tablet.

My first Kindle Fire was well-loved by me and my grandchildren, it was used every day and in many locations.  We took it to the pediatrician, the dentist, to school meetings, and especially when in the car and heavy traffic was anticipated.  The plus-factors are the ability to download movies and/or TV shows and watch them anywhere, anytime; the many games available (even for preschoolers) so the kids are not stuck with just a movie; the wonderful books, including children's picture books, available for download.  I told everyone who commented on the Kindle Fire that I felt they should be gifted to every parent/grandparent of a preschooler, and seriously considered as an alternative to video games for older children.  One day, my granddaughter was playing with the Kindle Fire and fell asleep.  It had happened many times before, she wasn't laying on it - it didn't fall - but it did shut itself off and it never came on again.  Fortunately, I had ignored my husband when he told me NOT to buy the extended warranty (Square Trade).  I called them, they completed a form over-the-phone, sent me to a webpage for the shipping label, and my new Kindle Fire was on the way!  They even told me I could wait for the new one to arrive, put the defective one in the same box, attach the label and ship it out.  What could be simpler?  My new Kindle Fire is wonderful, and knowing I have up to four replacements available on my extended warranty - that makes a great product even better!  One word of warning - my four-year-old granddaughter has been able to navigate through the screens and de-register my Kindle Fire twice.  Easy enough to fix.  She has also purchased a few games and the entire second season of Dora the Explorer...I have turned my 1-Click settings off!  The new Kindle Free Time app looks good, I am trying it out - it allows a profile for each child, I can select books, games, apps to allow in each profile individually - AND I can set time limits!  After my free trial, there is a monthly fee - but at least I won't have to worry about several more seasons of Dora and Diego!  If you are thinking about a tablet - think about the Kindle Fire - I have several family members who now own one after seeing or hearing about mine...and all of them are happy with the Kindle Fire!One last comment - I own the Kindle Fire 7\" HD with Dolby Sound as well.  When it comes to videos, I am not impressed.  It seems to always want to buffer, and then it will ask me to adjust the video quality down to allow \"optimal viewing.\"  Even when adjusted to the lowest setting, I get \"buffering.\"  This does not happen with my Kindle Fire 1st generation or 2nd generation - both of the non-HD models handle videos excellently - and on the same network as the constantly \"buffering\" HD model.  Without significant improvements, I would not recommend the HD models.  Too much money for too little enjoyment.

I originally purchased two for my family.  They worked ok for what we paid for them but after about eight months they both started having trouble charging.  I would have to have the USB Port and plug in the perfect position for the device to charge.  It wasn't too much of a problem so I let it ride.  A few months later after they were past the 1 year warranty one stopped charging at all.  I ran a search about the problem and did all of the trouble shooting suggestions. Based on the amount of information about this problem it was obvious most of the Kindles sold had the same problem.I called customer service. They were great, told me that this was a very common problem and there had been a soldering defect in the USB port connections.  They sent out a replacement even though the warranty was expired!  It arrived quickly and worked out of the box.  Soon the second Kindle would not charge.  I called and had the same results.  New Kindle in the mail.  Operator said that even though the warranty was up they would replace it because it was a know problem with the device.Based on this experience I purchased another Kindle Fire for my third child.  Before buying I read where Amazon had resolved the problem with the poor soldering in the USB port.  This combine with the good customer service described above convinced me that even though the device leaves much to be desired performance wise, it was still the best value on the market.Well the third Kindle lasted 13 months and started having the same charging problems.  I was not to concerned because I was expecting Amazon to stand by their product as they had in the past.  When I called I was told that there was no defect with the product and they would not replace it.  They would offer me a discount on a new/upgraded model.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, they told me they were all busy but if I left my number one would call in 10-15 minutes.  Two hours later, no call.Very disappointed with Amazon.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "RLOT1MQ2PQ3KW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "________________________________________________________________IMPORTANT:If you are going to order this model or the HD make sure that you order the charger at the same time because the new Kindles come without one. This is the only opportunity to get the charger at half price.________________________________________________________________We bought our first Fire for our (then) 8 yr. old baby girl and it was love at first sight. She's been using it daily to watch movies and TV shows, learn new arts and crafts skills from posted Youtube videos, challenge herself with puzzle games she orders herself from Amazon's Appstore, Google for... whatever, learn a lot form Wikipedia and email back and forth with her friends. We liked the initial Fire because it offered the best features and quality a low price could by at the time and because the 7\" screen size made it ideal for a child to use. But there were issues with that Fire and my first Fire review was a 3-stars only. I didn't appreciate Fire's almost-close 'ecosystem', its lack of some essential features (see below) and I didn't appreciate the near complete absence of parental controls or the ability to turn-off or restrict one-click ordering.Well... this 'new and improved' Fire goes a long way toward mitigating many concerns to the extent that they could be met without making major hardware changes - you will have to buy the more expensive models for a more feature-rich pad. Prior to this model's announcement we were considering getting another Kindle Fire for our other baby girl so when the new model was announced we decided to order in a heartbeat and I will explain why.MISSING FEATURES THAT ARE STILL MISSINGFirst, let me begin with the not so good news. While Amazon clearly listened and did a lot to address some of the criticism that followed the first Fire launch, not everything could be fixed without a major redesign and this IS the 'old' Fire made better mostly by taking advantage of the availability of better, less expensive components. The current iteration of the initial model still lacks a number of features I wished it had. Still missing are, in the order of importance:- microphone- camera(s)- Bluetooth- microSD slot for storage expansion- HDMI-out- GPS- compass- gyroscopeThe lack of the above means that you still won't be able to make or receive voice or video calls, won't be able to play your music on Bluetooth-linked larger speakers or use your Fire with a physical keyboard. Voice search is also out and you won't be able to use any of the Siri-like personal assistants. Not having a GPS, gyroscope and compass means that your Fire won't be able to give you directions as you drive, won't know where you are if you are out of Wi-Fi range and won't know which direction you are heading or looking which would make it impossible, for example, to use apps that that show you the night sky at the exact time and location you happen to be.On the software side, a lot was done to improve the Fire's user interface but we are still limited to whatever we can get through Amazon's Appstore. Sideloading apps is possible but most users don't have the drive, the skills or the confidence to do it meaning that most users will still be if not locked then gently held inside Amazon's ecosystem.And there is at least one thing that got worse when compared with the prior model: a charger is no longer included. Unless you have a PC and you don't mind hooking up your Fire to it for half a day at a time, I suggest that you buy Amazon's own charger - get it for half the price if ordered at the same time with the Fire - or some compatible charger.NOW THE GOOD NEWSAnd there's a lot of it. Here are the improvements briefly followed by a discussion of what they mean.- lower price (remember you will need to pay a little extra for the charger)- faster processor- longer battery life- parental controls (coming up in October 2012)- X-ray for books and movies (gimmicky but nice)- Whispersync expanded to cover games (actually useful)These improvements justify me adding a fourth star to my Fire rating and persuaded me to order this model shortly after it was announced. Parental controls are missing at the time I'm writing my review - will update it once they become available and I set them - but, once in place, they should make the use of a Kindle Fire by a child a lot safer. The faster processor means that some games will play better and a couple extra hours of battery life never hurt. I don't know how often we are likely to use X-ray but Whispersync is a great feature to have because our larger than average household is accessing various media through numerous devices and it's nice to be able to begin reading a book on your e-reader Kindle and pick up where you left off on your Fire tablet.WHO SHOULD BUY THIS MODEL?We are buying Kindle Fires for our children because 7\" appears to be the ideal screen size for them and we/they play a lot of Amazon content. Price is also a factor. There are more technically advanced tablets 'out there' that cost about the same, from the Fire HD to the excellent Nexus 7. We already have a Nexus 7 but our children voted 'Fires' when asked what they preferred for themselves, probably because the Fire interface is familiar to them by now and it's less intimidating or maybe they just turned into Amazon fans. For this particular model which was bought for our youngest kid, some of the missing features (camera, microphone) were actually something that we preferred not to have and found desirable for a user of her age. The low amount of storage is not an issue because most of the content she's going to access will come from the Web or from Amazon's own cloud.Now, for grownups, sure, the Nexus 7 is a technically superior device but when you buy a Fire from Amazon you buy more than just a tablet. It comes with Amazon's many services and the confidence that Amazon will support you even to the point where they make it very easy to return the product if you are not happy with it. A semi-geek like me will always prefer the more open and interesting products that can be improved, tinkered with, upgraded and customized but most of the rest of my family is asking for something that delivers their content, be it games, movies, music or 'web browsing' quickly and intuitively because they don't have the time or the motivation to learn every new gadget and are happy to see the exact same user interface on all the Fires in the house.If this is not for a child, you may want this Fire if you trust Amazon and you trust that Amazon will deliver the content that you want. However, you should pay a little more and buy one of the new Fire HD models if more onboard storage, making video calls, voice chat, voice search and the opportunities that Bluetooth and the HDMI-out port open (external speakers and keyboards, output on large screens) are important to you. For significantly better performance, flexibility, upgradeability and access to Google's apps and store plus GPS, NFC and so forth, think Nexus 7.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE the Kindle Fire, but...", "Author": "hornhunter", "ReviewID": "RYPJARTVALWZ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love my Kindle Fire!

She didn't want, nor need anything too fancy, so she opted for the \"All new Kindle Fire\" - the $159 model.More than anything she wanted to play The Sims FreePlay, a game she had grown a sort of addiction to on my device, and was excited to get home and download it.I helped her get started with her Kindle.Immediately I noticed the myriad differences between her new kindle and my original.For one, there is a lock on the screen. I do like that, so kudos to you.I also noticed advertisements on the open screen - something I found off-putting.This isn't a rented device, I see no excuse for advertisements on a device one owns.Next up was the \"carousel\". This, too, was markedly different - and I think LESS intuitive.The settings are in a \"drag down\" format, which is helpful in a way, but I found it gets in the way as well.The app that helped to finally get my girlfriend to by the device, The Sims FreePlay, app is NOT COMPATIBLE with the NEW Kindle Fire.I'm not sure why that is, or what changed, exactly.I would hope that amazon did not \"downgrade\" the basic Kindle Fire (secretly wanting people to purchase the other newer, more expensive KFs.) But that seems to be the case, in some ways.Another huge issue, and I'm left shaking my head over this, is that the device does NOT come with a charger.Considering that one of the main selling points is \"Works out of the box, no set up or need for a computer\", and then you dont include a charger, is ridiculous.My girlfriend doesn't have a computer (part of the reason she got the KF) so then had to spend twenty more dollars on a charger.I tried to keep an open mind about the device - afterall, I was the one telling her to get it - but found it difficult to do.We had problems downloading apps (other than the sims), trouble loading them, and trouble playing them.The New Kindle Fire felt like a completely different device.That was my overall impression of the device -\"Less intuitive\".And it seems that, if they COULD change it, they DID change it.Change for the sake of change isn't always a good thing.Though it may be faster and have more memory, I still would rather have the \"original\".My girlfriend even wanted to trade devices with me and I wouldn't do it.In all, I'd give the \"New and Improved\" Kindle Fire 2 out of 5 stars.Everything I liked about the Kindle Fire seems to have been stripped or modified.Apps that were formerly compatible, now are not.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stoppard working after a year", "Author": "Trishann", "ReviewID": "R3N7GZR8G0HGHT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got my kindle as a Mother's Day gift.

If you search (Google or Bing) for \"Kindle Fire not charging\" you get endless hits form users that have experienced the same issue, which is the bad design and implementation of your micro USB port.  Period.  It isn't abuse, it isn't excessive use, it's a bad design.Let's make one thing clear.  You, Amazon, are in a war for market share when it comes to e-readers and tablets.  You have a LOT of competition that can do everything your tablet can...and more.  When you make a faulty product you don't tell the customer to buy another one, even at half price (which they didn't even get close to).  You stand behind your product like a car manufacturer for an additional period of time.  Ask me to send it in.  See that it wasn't rooted, dropped, damaged or abused, but don't say sorry buy another one from us.To anyone reading the review, I love Amazon.  It's my go to spot to shop.  It's our go to spot for Christmas shopping.  Until this experience I've never had anything bad to say about them...I think.  So I'm seriously bummed that they put out a product that they aren't willing to stand behind.  Give me a refurb unit.  Give a $100 off.  Give me online credit.  Look at the tablet and tell me it was abused...really, seriously.

Amazon was nice enough to trouble shoot with me and then proceed to tell me that I should have bought the extended warranty.  The only thing they were willing to do is offer to sell me a new kindle device for $20 off the regular price.Now I'm not saying I expect things to last forever, I'm not even expecting electronics to last more than 3 years (even though most of mine have).  But really, 18 months and the thing is a brick?!?  It hasn't been abused, dropped, or gotten wet.  It's been charged when needed and that's what broke it.  Charging the device broke it!Thanks for the offer for me to by another one of your devices Amazon, but I think I'll take my business elsewhere.  We have an iPad that's had rougher use...still going strong.  Three smart phones, Android and Apple, over 2 years old and abused...still working great.  I also happen to have a Samsung tablet that's 2 years old...no problems.You know it's an issue, there's more than enough posts about other users having the same problem and this is your answer, sell them another future brick.

About a year later, I had to get it replaced at best buy, and they gave me the 2nd generation. At first I thought it had the potential to be a much better tablet, considering the newer android version and other features. But the first thing I noticed is that THERE'S an ad on the wallpaper. What the heck amazon. I I read later that you made a kindle fire without ads that cost more than the one with ads, but really, why would you even make one with ads in the first place? I'd rather pay a few more bucks so I don't have to see some crappy ad for some kids toy on my screen.On my older kindle, it had a different picture each time you turned it on. I was cool with that, and I liked most of the wallpapers, but there was a app you could download (from an \"unknown\" source) to change your wallpaper to whatever you want. I tried that, but it didn't work... and no, I'm not paying you greedy businessmen 15 bucks to get rid of those ads.Another thing that was bad about this is that on the 1st generation you could install a launcher. For those of you who do not know what this means, a launcher changes the way your home screen looks. You could make your kindle look like an android tablet or an iPad. You would have to install the launcher app from another place besides the amazon Appstore. But now, amazon put more fixes and only one launcher works, AND its very limited to what you could do on the 1st generation.I have to say there are some improvements though. This kindle is much faster than my old one, and the newer android lets me install apps from unknown sources that couldn't run on the 1st generation (suck on that amazon) I am thinking about selling it, as I have a better tablet and I am saving some money.

These issues have increasingly hindered my reading.My chief complaints are the lack of page numbers and the lack of organizational features for books. Although these may seem like petty concerns, they are real annoyances for readers. I read with book clubs and make lesson plans for my literature classes using my Kindle books, and to get a page number for something I need, I have to highlight in my Kindle Fire and then look for the highlight on my Kindle iPhone app. Also, since I read a lot, I have many books on my Kindle. With no way to organize them, finding one can be very difficult if I can't remember the title and author or if I just want to browse what I have in a particular genre. Again, these may seem like small issues, but these are features that other Kindles -- and even Kindle apps -- have. Not attending to such small but significant features even in updates doesn't speak well of Amazon's care for its customers' satisfaction.Overall, if you want the Fire primarily for media, I would say it is a good buy.

It is fine in every aspect except one big one - there is no way to organize all your books into different collections, i.e. genre's or whatever groupings you want to create in order to find what you're looking for quickly.  If you know the book's title, wonderful. You can hit the \"search\" icon and type in the title or scroll through your entire library to get to it.  However, if you are in the mood to read something from your \"classics\" collection but not sure exactly what you want, or can't recall an exact title, you have to scroll through your entire library rather than simply going to \"classics\", as you're able to do in the older versions of the Kindle.  Heck, even my little old Keyboard was able to do that.  If I had known this about the Kindle Fire, I would probably have made a different choice.  The only saving grace is that the Kindle for PC app DOES maintain the collections I previously created on my Keyboard, and I can refer to that - IF I'm home or have my laptop handy.

Yes, you can charge it all day and yet it's only good for a couple of hours before it's turning off with no juice left.I thought one would be able to read a book with a charge, but even a short book, that's not going to happen unless you are a speed reader. And games? Forget about that too, because games just chew the battery up and you will be playing games next to your computer.What a shame this kindle doesn't come with a wall plug that charges the unit. Sure you can buy one, but it might or it might not work on your kindle. And if you buy it from Amazon, it's pricey to buy the plug that the usb cord plugs into. Why on earth doesn't it come with this plug? What a pity.I will probably not buy another kindle until the price either comes WAY down or the battery gets a LOT better. Or if it came with extra battery and a battery charger that isn't dependent on being inside the kindle to charge.... kind of like my digital camera, I can take the battery out and charge it and put a fresh one in while the other one is charging.Moving on. The kindle is much heavier than I thought it would be. It's hard to hold it up with your hands for any length of time.Also the kindle is hard to hold because the \"frame\" around the screen is so narrow. I am constantly having to lay it down to \"flip\" back to the page I was reading because my thumb got too close to the screen and flipped the book back 4 or 5 pages or forward 4 or 5 pages. This is irritating.On the good side, the kindle is easy to use and it's very easy to buy books for it. It's also pretty easy to down load books.One thing I haven't figured out is how to get books that I've already read off the screen on the kindle. They need to just stay in the cloud and not show on my kindle proper. Of course, there's no manual to help with this and that is a shame. I would think eventually I will run out of storage space on my kindle and then what do I do? Buy another one and fill it up? I'm sure there's a way to delete things, but darned if I can figure it out.All in all I love my kindle. BUT I would suggest if you don't need one yet, I'd wait another generation before I bought.

Due to the fact that I bought this device that same day that you made it available to everyone.  My co-workers saw mine and also purchased theirs after admiring mine.

It has a crazy long battery life, terrific picture, intuitive design, and has been completely stable since the day I purchased it.  Fast forward to last month.  My household \"needed\" a second tablet for simple Internet/Netflix use.  I decided to \"save some money\" by buying a Kindle instead of another iPad.  The thing arrives and works fine for the first week or so.  The battery life sucks but I was willing to deal with that.  I mean, plug it in and watch a movie close to an outlet, right?  And then the thing starts randomly \"not waking up\" when I opened the cover for it.  Not every time, but just once in a while.  Fine.  A little quirky, but I can restart it and go about my day.  Fast forward to this week.  Not only does the thing randomly \"not wake up\", but it won't turn on at all.  I did a quick search and found that these problems are alarmingly common with this device.  I did a hard reboot by holding down the power button for 30 seconds and then pressing the button again.  The thing turns back on.  I start watching a show on Netflix and then it powers off after just a few minutes.  The battery was at 89% when this happened.  I hard reboot it again, get back into Netflix, start watching the show and the device suddenly powers off again within a few seconds.  And then I went straight to Amazon (on my laptop--no point in trying to reboot this thing again) to return the device since I bought it last month.  I'm off to Apple's website to buy another iPad now.  Good riddance, Kindle!", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ignored by Amazon - UPDATED", "Author": "Bamazon!", "ReviewID": "R1XULK0IFU0EX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle to try out before investing in the 8.9\" version. It was great, until it died. I contacted Amazon, and was sent a replacement Kindle. That level of customer service is why I never considered any other brand of tablet. The replacement was great, until I realized it wouldn't hold a charge for a fraction of the time the first one did.I contacted Amazon, and was on the telephone with Ellen P. for almost an hour and a half. At first, I assumed it was just a defective battery. It turns out the automatic updates weren't happening, and my e-mails weren't syncing a lot of the time. I was confident that Amazon is going to make sure my problem was taken care of.I was wrong.Ellen thanked me several times for being so patient, and assured me that she would follow up with me by May 6th. She sent an e-mail to document that. May 6th comes and goes. On May 7th, I almost called again, but I thought I would give it one more day. Nothing. I called Amazon again and spoke with Shanique. Worst customer service person I've ever spoken to at Amazon. All she wanted to do was get me off the phone. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she told me there were none available. I continued to request a supervisor, she obviously just wanted me off the phone. Finally, I pushed a little more, and was eventually transferred to a person named Marvin, who said he was a manager.I explained to Marvin what had transpired, and he told me that I was supposed to be contacted by May 10th, not May 6th. I told him that not only had I taken notes, but that Ellen had sent me an e-mail with that same information. He told me that the problem had been sent to engineers, and that they were to get back with me by May 10th. Again, I told him what Ellen had told me, and that in her e-mail she indicated she was setting a reminder for herself to contact me on the 6th. I wanted her to do what she said she would do. I explained to him that regardless of what happened, if she told me she was going to call me, I wanted her to call me. He finally told me that she would call me back, guaranteed. I asked him how he knew that, and he told me he that he would make sure she did.Today is the 11th. No word from Ellen. No word from Marvin. No word from engineers. No response from anyone at Amazon.Perhaps my expectations were just too high.____________________________________________Here's an update: Very shortly after leaving this feedback, I received a call from Ellen! She explained that she had been off, etc., and was sorry she had not gotten back to me. I understand that life happens. Other than not contacting me when she said she would, I have no problems with her job performance.My problem is with this Kindle. Ellen said the event logs from our initial call didn't have all of the information the engineers needed. Today, she was apparently unable to get the event logs to transfer at all. Again, something is wrong with this Kindle. She wanted me to again attempt to do that manually by connecting to my computer.That defeats the purpose of having this device. I told her that I felt like I had been extremely patient and understanding, but I'm past that. I am not willing to spend another hour on the phone, and wait another 9 days. This Kindle is NOT working the way it should.My problem is absolutely not with Ellen. During the course of our conversation, there were a few language barrier issues. I would let her know I didn't understand, and she would try again. No problems there for me. I speak Southern, and that was probably difficult for her.I have a bigger problem with Amazon's problem resolution process.When you place an order with Amazon, the order is assigned an order number, which you can use as a reference for any number of reasons. I think that when you have a problem with Amazon, there should be an incident number assigned to the problem which should be accessible from your account page, and it should remain open until the problem is resolved. In my situation, the only recourse I had was to start from scratch with Amazon's call center. That didn't work for me.Ellen is attempting to get my problem solved, so nothing has changed. If she doesn't succeed, and doesn't contact me, I've got to start all over again. I don't expect that will happen, but...When technology works, it's great. When it doesn't work, it's a hassle. I can deal with that, if the problem gets solved. The bottom line at this point is that I HATE this Kindle and the time I'm spending on dealing with this. I still love Amazon. I'm confident I'm going to love my next Kindle. I just hope it's soon.____________________________________________May 18 - haven't heard a word from Amazon. Getting disgusted. Called back at 7:00 PM, spoke to Bill. He put me on hold, and after 7 minutes I was disconnected.____________________________________________May 18 - 10:38 PM - Called Amazon again. Spoke to Ginger. I gave her a very brief review of the problems with this Kindle. I told her I either wanted a new Kindle or a refund. She looked at my account and said since my Kindle is still under warranty, she would have a new one sent out. I should receive it no later than Tuesday, May 21. She gave me an order number that I can refer to until the tracking information is sent to me. How hard was that?This is the way the first phone call should have been handled. The experience was so NOT what I expected from Amazon. Ginger helped get that bad taste out of my mouth. I'm happy, and looking forward to getting another Kindle that I can enjoy. I've had a Kindle Paperwhite and the related accessories in my shopping cart that I've wanted to get as a gift for a friend, but wasn't going to place the order until this was dealt with. I'm going to place the order tonight.I'm back to loving Amazon, and look forward to loving my replacement Kindle in a few days.

However, it is not a \"stand alone\" product.  You have to buy books.  I believe the books are, for the most part, over priced.  For example, \"Gone Girl: A Novel\" sells on Kindle for $12.99.  That compares well with list price of $25.00.  BUT, Amazon sells hard cover (free two day shipping with Prime memberships, which I have) for $13.75.  That is less than $1.00 difference.  Honestly, come on.  It is an electronic version that flies through the air, no printing costs and no shipping costs.  I realize there is some effort in preparing books for Kindle but new books should be less than $10, max, most should be $7.00 or $8.00.  Older books should be really cheap.  I was going to reread Gregory McDonald's \"Fletch\" series, but they are $9.99 each.  Really, the first Fletch book is about 35 years old.  Sure, they are great books but they should be at bargin bin prices.  There are exceptions.  Laurence Shames Key West series is available at $2.99 a book.  These are great books (you should read them if you haven't, fans of Carl Hiaasen will love them) at a fair price.  More books should follow suit.

I was able to purchase some great games for my kindle fire, phase 10, the game of life, collapse, and this car racing game that I got for .99 from the kindle games store.A couple of things I hate about the kindle fire.Space!!!!!!! I sure wish to god that I could add more space to my kindle fire. It makes me feel soooooooo limited and the only way I can get more space is to pay extra for the cloud for both the files and the music. That really rubs me the wrong way. I also hate that you can't add flash to the kindle fire so some pages don't even load properly in the browser. Another thing I hate about it is the limited apps in their apps market. It totally sucks that many of the best apps in Google play you can't add here. Oh, and another thing. You can add apps from google play, you just have to turn on a special feature in your kindle fire, however; if something happens from the app you upload, you're on your own. Kindle won't support your warranty if you do that. The final thing I hate about my Kindle Fire is that when I bought it, it game with a usb cord and I realized once I got home that I had to purchase a charge base to plug up my kindle fire. Thank god I have a samsung phone! I just plugged that baby into my cell phone charging device and it charges quickly. If you plug it into your pc, it sucks! It won't charge until your fire falls asleep or your turn it off and it charges slow as crap from your pc.Other than that and for the price, I have to say that I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Kindle is Perfect", "Author": "MEG", "ReviewID": "R24UHRMSG927DM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on the two major e-readers and settled for the Kindle.

The next morning, I unplugged it and checked to see if by chance it got charged, and IT DID!!!  So, bottomline, it's been acting up.  There are days it will charge and there are days it wont charge; the battery is beginning to run out faster now than before.

Smid", "ReviewID": "RWNA3LF9Z18CO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought Kindle was just a book reader, until my savvy granddaughter who owns and uses Kindle Fire started extolling its virtues and demonstrated them. I ordered one from Amazon to find out for myself. My first problem was wireless connection - not Kindle's problem - a more updated router fixed that. Next step - to see what it can do: a good basic manual would have helped. My familiarity  with my now retired I-phone (due to high cost of phone service) helped some, my hands-on familiarity with desktops, laptops and notebooks also helped. But, for the first few weeks, Kindle Fire was just a satisfactory experiment with an excellent book reader.I have since taken time to explore its potential - music downloads, apps of all sorts - utility, educational, fun types like many Hangman versions, email, contact lists, photos and more. I am delighted with its versatility - one just has to work with it to learn its functions, how to maneuver within its menu options etc. After downloading several music selections and connecting my high-fi Bose ear phones, I was amazed at the quality sound coming from this small unit! When traveling, I first used a standard size, comparatively heavy laptop - replaced it with a much smaller and lighter notebook, and am now considering to replace that with the even smaller and lighter Kindle Fire on my next trip. I  am not a smart phone whiz, am content with a basic cellphone and therefore prefer something resembling the functionality of a computer - and Kindle Fire seems to fit that bill. One thing I have found lacking that all my computers have - Kindle has a certain memory capacity and limitation - I have found no way to see its memory properties to avoid a showdown with overload.This is not a very technical review  - having had Kindle Fire 7 for several few weeks only, and perhaps not tapped its full pootential, I am very pleased with what it has delivered, aside from its functions as a book reader - and what discoveries may still lie ahead. I repeat, a good basic user manual of its functions and potentials might have made it much easier.

I use it everyday for everything. Once you have connected it to the internet and  you have set up a amazon account on it your perfectly fine. As you know not everything is perfect so I did have problems with my kindle. My original kindle worked perfectly fine for about 6-8 months then it started taking forever to charge sometimes it wouldn't charge unless the wire is a certain way so I called amazon and they shipped a new one to my house free of charge and I returned my original one.  About a year later the same problem happened..... I was mad because its the second time this happened so I called amazon and they said they could ship a new one in 2 days so I returned that one and got a new one. Its working perfectly fine but there are some things you need to know before hand if you are thinking about purchasing a kindle fire....  1) Use the charger they give you and if it breaks buy a new charger from amazon if you use any other charger you kindle's battery is most likely to die faster and take forever to charge and you will end up having to get a replacement kindle.  2) If you can, get a warranty! This is very important I didn't think much about it until my kindle started having problems thank god I had a warranty! In the case that you need a replacement kindle the warranty will give you a brand new kindle compared to the refurbished kindle your going to get if you don't have a warranty.  3) Buy a case and a screen protector. I had a screen protector for my original kindle and I paid over $60.00 for it. I know there are cheaper screen protectors in the market but if I was willing to pay $200.00 for a kindle (the price when it first came out) why would I pay $7.00 for a screen protector that I know will not protect my device as much as a $60.00 screen protector.  When i needed to get a replacement kindle i basically lost $60.00 because i couldn't reuse the screen protector.

Each time I contacted Amazon, they replaced my Kindle Fire with the same model Kindle Fire with the same issues.  I inquired about an upgrade to the kindle fire HD or another kindle device without this problem with the usb charging port no longer working. Dont get me wrong, I love Amazon (I am a Prime Customer) but I feel that after you have the same problem with four different kindles, you should finally get a model that does not have that problem, even if it is an upgrade that costs Amazon a little. I contacted customer support today to replace my kindle, again, and was told that my warranty was over and that they would offer me a discounted price on any new kindle i wanted. This was the only option that was said was possible. While the prices were good, I feel that I was wronged because I am a very loyal Amazon customer (I purchase items almost daily) and they were not going to replace or upgrade their product, which was inferior everytime they sent me one, because the warranty ran out. In the end, I commented that I was pretty upset with these options and the Amazon representative just stated that they would forward my comments to the business division. I love Kindle but to be treated this way pretty much assures me that I will not take the risk to buy another Kindle. I will probably buy a Samsung product now as I have a Galaxy S III phone and have no complaints about it.  It is over a year old now and has never had an issue.  I have heard nothing but awesome reviews about Samsung.  Maybe Amazon should contract with them to build Kindles.  This was a big negative in my book for Amazon who is normally pretty good about customer issues. I dont feel I was trying to take advantage of Amazon; I was just trying to be treated fairly. Every time I rent an movie, buy music, and soon, shop for Christmas on Amazon, I am going to have this experience in my head which may cause me to take some business elsewhere. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. I will think this way everytime I look at this Amazon Kindle \"paperweight\" on which I have spent hundreds of dollars on content. Not good Amazon.Update 2/1/14:I have recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0.  I find this to be a superior product especially compared to the first Geration Kindle.  It is probably the best purchase I have made in a while.  It has much of the features of my Galaxy SIII phone and when you set it up with your Google account, you can basically make it a larger copy of your phone, if you want.  It comes with an inside-the-unit stored stylus for drawing and taking notes.  Kindle does not have that feature.  The display is great, it has yet to crash, and I have all my kindle books on the kindle app.  I use it with chromecast, bluetooth headphones, and teather it to my SIII's data plan.  I know this generation Kindle can do none of this and a dont believe the new one can do much of that as well.  In short, do not regret not caving in on amazon's offer of a discounted price on a new or refurbished Kindle Fire HD.  I hope amazon learns a little about its business practices from all the people that agree with me that the way they handled their customers who they gave an inferior product was completely wrong.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "4th Kindle", "Author": "Michael Lenk", "ReviewID": "R21D8DSPPO9TU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can get enough!

Personally, I would only go for Kindles from now on because of the great way Amaxon deals with it's Kindle customers (never thought I'd praise Amazon) but seriously it's got a number you call and you get amazing service ASAP and their are many apps, you can connect to the library etc. Because it's a wee bit thicker and slightly heavier (the fire) only by an once I think, it fits much better in the cover it was made for, and you actually don't use your finger muscles as much as the Nexus because you use the case more (when put in the tent position) Strange fact. Bottom line: Buy a Kindle. (Or don't have pre-teen boys).", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product", "Author": "Wendy L.

My first Kindle was a Kindle keyboard, but the drawback to it was its awkwardness in surfing the Internet.  I wanted the Kindle Fire because I could do anything on it that my husband can do on his iPad except take photos & videos, & because of its very reasonable cost.  I purchased a car charger & an Otterbox cover for it, & took advantage of Amazon's prime program.  Everything was fine until late June 2012, when the device's battery wouldn't charge no matter what I tried to do.  Amazon's tech support person told me that the device would need to be replaced & since it was still under the one year warranty, it was replaced free of charge as long as I sent the defective device back to Amazon in 30 days or less.  My second Kindle Fire performed without incident until late February of this year, when the battery wouldn't charge.  Amazon's tech support person told me that the device would need to be replaced.  However, I was told that it was out of warranty & I would have to pay for a new one.  I disputed this because this second device failed after only 6 months of use.  Amazon made an \"exception\" in my situation & shipped my third device free of charge.  I sent the second defective device back to Amazon within 30 days.While I love the Kindle Fire, Amazon needs to go back to the drawing board with respect to the failure of the battery.  A friend of mine has had the same problem, which makes me believe that this is a problem across the board.  Amazon's tech support & customer service is first rate.

To that end I have been disappointed, even though this is a good device value wise. However, it seems when I leave it in standby the battery is nearly dead just when I need it after a couple days. The print replica support is less than complete in my opinion. I grit my teeth when I see how much power has been stripped from these titles going from the PC to the tablet, particularly in intra-book links.On top of that I find this poorly setup for \"serious\" use out of the box. For buying videos an  such it is grand. However, I think it should come with at least some basic apps for note taking, a calculator, and a clock app out of the box. I can always choose to use different ones if I wish, but my philosophy is to not get too far from default on a device, particularly a post PC device like a tablet.Other things crop up as well. For instance, I finally gave up trying to write this review on the app and went to the browser because the built in shopping app had really glitchy text input. Diving into settings feels more intimidating than it should, it feels like there is a middle ground view between novice and hacker that is missing.Overall, I would say this is not a bad device.

It was an early gift from my husband and I had been considering replacing my Kindle 2 for awhile but had originally been leaning towards a Paperwhite.  I couldn't really pass up the deal so I bought the Fire instead and hoped for the best.I am so glad that I bought the Fire because I love it!  I thought that reading on it would hurt my eyes or give me a headache but so far I have not had any issues with this at all.  I know that many complain about the free offers but honestly I barely even notice them as they are only on the swipe page when you start up the Fire.  I actually do like the ones that show movies or books and how they link to more information about them.  Another thing that people complain about is the \"recommended for you\" section at the bottom of the home screen, but I actually like this a lot.  I have discovered several good books this way.  I guess you could turn this off, but I wouldn't if you read a lot and are looking for book suggestions.I only gave the Fire four stars because I do feel like it could be easier to use.  For example, who knew it could be so dang difficult to figure out how to turn the volume down?  I don't really listen to music or watch videos on it much at this point in time so when my daughter was playing her Umi Zoomi app, it was insanely loud and I actually had to turn to Google to figure out the volume.  I also feel like the touch keyboard could be a little better as typing on it isn't very easy and I am constantly hitting the wrong keys.Overall, I love the Fire, but maybe the user interface could be tweaked a bit.

The same person who gave me the first Kindle believes enough in Kindle to have given me a Kindle Fire this Christmas.SYNOPSIS OF MY REVIEW  (here you read the basics - for the details, continue reading):*I LOVE my Kindle Fire.*I find Amazon customer service (telephone and on-line chat) severely lacking (READ: I would rather bite my tongue off than talk to Amazon customer service again)*I find it unfair that current books cost the same as books in bookstores (and even more, sometimes,  than new books  purchased on Amazon).*I am very unhappy that I cannot access my favorite Kindle games on this new Kindle.*I wish the Kindle Fire had the same book-managing (filing) aspects that the original Kindle had.*I resent that Kindle Fire comes only with a USB cable hook-up to recharge it from a computer (what if you don't have a computer?)  I think that the electrical adapter, which allows you to re-charge your Kindle from an electrical outlet, and which Amazon sells separately for $19.95, should be included with the Kindle.THE FULL REVIEW*I love having a Kindle. I missed having a Kindle after my last Kindle died.  With the Kindle, it is so easy to get a book when you finish the book you were reading (I am a reader - you won't see me without a book unless some terrible disaster has suddenly occurred - even on September 11th, I had a book with me. I always have a book with me, and sometimes two, if I think I am going to finish the book I am reading before the day is out).*It is so nice to be able to read a sample of a book, and then, if you get to the end of it, and want more, order up the book even in the middle of the night, so you can continue reading virtually seamlessly.I've enjoyed reading a huge number of free books and inexpensively priced books on Kindle (although I still find books cheaper at Salvation Army).  You can go for a long time reading just the free books on Kindle.*For all of this convenience, though, you do pay a price: If you want a current book, you are going to pay pretty much what you would pay in a bookstore, minus the tax.  (many times, you can order a book on Amazon and pay less for it than you would pay on your Kindle, so I always do check on Amazon before I go the easy Kindle way).*I thought it was not very nice of Kindle to sell the Kindle Fire with only a USB cable to recharge it from a computer (what if you are not near a computer?).  The USB connection takes about 10 hours to recharge the Kindle Fire.  You can, of course, buy a converter from Kindle, for $19.95 - that will recharge your Kindle in less than 3 hours.  (and, if you are a bit more savvy, you might find a converter from another manufacturer for a lower price - Amazon says they will not work as fast as the Kindle converter, but, at this point, I don't know how much of that is hype.  I am thinking of getting one that can accept two USB cables at once, so that I can charge my phone and my Kindle off the same adapter. I'll have to wait and see how well that works).*My first Kindles were very light-weight.  This Kindle Fire is quite a bit heavier (if you're holding it with one hand, you might develop carpal tunnel syndrome after a while).  No big deal.*Book managing is non-existent on this version of Kindle (With my earlier Kindles, I could put my books in different categories - the most important being \"already read\".  There is no way to do this with the Kindle Fire, so I am stuck with an amazingly long list of books that I have to scroll through to find the next one I want to read, unless, of course, I want to uninstall read books, which I am not ready to do at this point).*It is impossible to access the games I really liked (most importantly, \"Every Word\") on my earlier Kindles. They are simply not available.  Contacting Amazon/Kindle on this point leads to a time-consuming run-around in a connection with someone from a country where English is not the native language (don't get me wrong - I have no problem with foreigners, but, when I have a problem with something I own, I don't want to have to explain something 60 ways before I can get another wrong answer out of the \"customer support\" agent, and I do get royally tired of people re-wording my requests or complaints into something that is not even similar to what I have said - I talked to Amazon/Kindle so many times that I eventually resorted to doing the \"on-line chat\" just so I could have a record of what I had actually said, to refer to, when the \"customer support\" agent started rewording what I had said into something that was not even remotely related to what I had actually said.)*I have given up on contacting Amazon for support (see above)  I teach English to foreigners for a living.  I don't think I should have to be doing it when I am on my own time, and I find it extremely annoying when I finally figure out what someone is saying when they say \"goo to da scream\", and I say \"oh, you mean \"go to the screen\", and they correct me with, \"no, goo to da scream\" - uh, I should probably mention that I am a native speaker of American English, and I can also speak British.  I am American - no hypnenations, and I am First Family in North Carolina, through my mother.  I have no problem with people whose native language is not English, but it does irk me when they become irritated when I do not understand what they are saying and scream at me, or when they rephrase what I am saying into something that has nothing to do with what I am talking about.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon not clear about internet needs", "Author": "Elizabeth Mason", "ReviewID": "R3HTB5DVMPJ9HE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 76 year old mother who has internet, but NOT wireless.

I think I like the Kindle Fire the best (if I'm doing more than just reading).Here are the reasons I like the Fire:-It is manageable.  I love the size of the Kindle Fire.  Anything bigger and it's just too bulky.  It's the perfect size for packing in a purse or a carry-on bag.  I find my iPad gets way too heavy when playing games or reading.-Lots of Apps.  I know it doesn't compare with Apple's apps but it has plenty of apps for me and they're getting more all the time.  I have the samsung Galaxy S II phone, so I'm used to the android apps, so are my kids, so they don't miss all the Apple apps.-Has enough to keep us connected.  This has plenty of features for me and my kids.  I love the Free Time settings, to be able to lock my kids out of the games, movies, etc if I want them to read.  I really like all the parental controls and use of passwords for purchasing anything.  It keeps my 5 and 7 year olds from buying anything they don't need to be buying.Here are the reasons I don't like the Kindle Fire:-Folders.  WHY?  How long it takes to go through every app when looking for a single one.  My phone can build folders, why can't the Kindle Fire?  I do NOT like the format of the Fire.  I know the Kindle was originally built for reading, that's fine but if they're going to make it more like a tablet, make it more user friendly.  We didn't buy these Kindle Fires just for my kids to read.  We bought them more for a 'tablet' because the iPad is overkill and the iPod Touch is too small.-Accounts.  I know you have to manage Kindles under 1 account but I would like to be able to manage my kids' Kindles through my account too, instead of having to log into my husband's account.-Password Block.  Every time we purchase an app, we have to put in the password, which is fine, we chose to do that, but why isn't the password just automatically hidden?  Every time we put the password in, we have to click on the box to hide the password.  My 7 year old is already leaning over my shoulder to see what I'm typing in.  Make it a *little* harder for her to figure it out!I'm not going to review all the technical stuff for the Kindle because I'm sure that has been sufficiently covered.

This is my first e-reader, and I was originally looking at the Kindle Paperwhite because I figured if I was going to get an e-reader, why not get one with that singular function? I have a desktop computer, why bother getting a Fire that does things my computer does as well? I couldn't have been more wrong!It was the end of November and Amazon ran a special on the Kindle Fire 7\" LCD so out of curiosity, I clicked it to find out more. Like everyone else, I read through the spiel and became intrigued by all that it could do.The more I thought about it, I decided why settle for a simple e-reader when I could have also have movies, apps, and games as well? Sure, my desktop offers quite a bit in that department as well, but not from the comfort of my couch, or bed, or while waiting at the doctor's office!I didn't get the warranty because I figured the price isn't horrible should I need a new one, and by that time I'll probably want to upgrade anyway. I did however buy this case http://www.amazon.com/Defender-Series-Standing-Kindle-Built-/dp/B007Q3YIW0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1356958793&sr;=1-1&keywords;=otterbox+for+kindle+fire which is amazing might I add!When ordering, definitely go with the special offers option! I considered paying the extra because I absolutely HATE ads, but this just shows essentially a picture when you first turn on the Kindle and punch in your lock code. Then it's gone! Really, that's it! Save a few bucks and go with the special offers, you won't regret it. Even if you do, you can always have it taken off later.The design is very sleek and although most people complain about weight, it really isn't that bad. Sure, it's a bit heavy, but I'm not the lay on my back with my arms in the air holding my e-reader type. How do people do that anyway? Doesn't the blood rush out of your arms? Anyway, if you're that type of reader you should probably consider a hockey mask as well because otherwise you're asking for a trip to the hospital.Navigation is a bit confusing (at least it was for me) at initial start up. I saw an icon that said Silk and had no idea that was the internet browser and was scared to click something I didn't know what it was for fear of some download starting up. Once I got past the initial unfamiliarity, I was clicking everything I could find to see what it did!Something cool I've found is that you can store all your apps, books, etc on your Amazon Cloud, the device itself, or both. The cloud can be managed from your Amazon account should you decide you want something removed completely which is nice.The biggest negatives...The fact that you have to have WiFi to do just about anything. I have wireless internet here at the house of course, but I don't always have access when I'm out and about which was annoying at first. I had a television series I had been streaming on Amazon Prime (amazing by the way) and wanted to continue when I got to work early, but couldn't because there was no WiFi! I essentially felt forced to buy the series so that it could be stored on my device and I could watch anywhere. At this point, it no longer bothers me because I've just plain accepted it. That, and the prices really aren't terrible. Especially if you have Amazon Prime. Which you should.What's the deal with the lending library?! I was excited because I'm an Amazon Prime member and thought that I could get as many free books as I wanted on my Kindle Fire. Was I ever wrong. Come to find out, the lending library works like this, you can pick one of their \"free\" books and keep it for as long as you'd like, however you can one have ONE per calendar month! I read The Hunger Games in a matter of days, returned it eager to get the next book, but no. Not until next month. Again, they're making me feel forced to buy things.The biggest positives...I'd like to end this review on a positive note so here it goes. If you have young children at home that you know will want to get their little hands on your Fire, a subscription to Kindle Free Time Unlimited is an absolute MUST!! I can't rave about this enough. I opted for the $2.99 one child subscription with my Prime and my girls (two and six) share an account. It's perfect for little ones who like to press everything and you don't want to worry about what they're downloading or what their viewing. You set a parental password and it locks the Kindle into \"Free Time\" mode so you can put your mind at ease that they can't get into anything they aren't supposed to.There's a lot of variety too! It isn't all little kid shows, there's something for all ages. The books, games, and videos offer hours and hours of entertainment and that's just what comes preloaded! You can always add whatever extra content you'd like and there's no WiFi required! Perfect for trips or when you just need some time to yourself, \"Just take the Kindle and go!\"I very highly recommend this product. One day when I'm rich, or perhaps next holiday season, I may consider upgrading to the Kindle Fire HD strictly for the 4G. Until then, I'm completely satisfied with what I have and I'm glad I made this my first e-reader!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy owner of the Kindle Fire!", "Author": "Carol Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R185MGN66SKENC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the decision to purchase the Kindle Fire after asking friends who currently have products like this.

Siepel", "ReviewID": "R3VCUAD1A2DGLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is less about the technical aspects of the Kindle Fire and more about using the new Free Time App on the Kindle Fire. I purchased the Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift for my son and after a few days of him using it with the Free Time App this is what we found:Pros:1. Setting up the Free Time App and individual profiles is very easy.  With each profile you create you can set time limits for time spent on reading books, watching videos  and playing on apps.2. Once the child's profile is set up, it is easy to add books, apps and videos that you have in your Kindle library or from Amazon. There is one HUGE exception to this, which I will mention in the con section.3. Once you sign into a profile you must use a password to sign out of Free Time, even if the Kindle is turned off and turned on again.  This is a wonderful feature, as I don't have to worry about my son getting out of the Free Time app and having access to my other Kindle books, the web, etc.4. You don't have to worry about your child making unwanted purchases, as there is no ability to shop or purchase from Amazon when logged into the Free Time App.Cons:1. At this time you cannot add any of the Harry Potter books to a Free Time profile, even if you have downloaded them onto your Fire. This was a HUGE disappointment. It has to do something with the agreement Amazon has with JK Rowling and I hope they fix it soon.2. The Free Time app does not allow you to add music or audiobooks to your child's profile. Again, this was very disappointing. One of the selling points Amazon has made about the Fire is the ability to sync a Kindle book you are reading with the Audible Audiobook of the same title. Amazon even highlights the ability to read and listen to a book at the same as a feature that helps with reading comprehension. Unfortunately, you can not use this feature when using Free Time.3. You cannot view books checked out from the library using the Free Time app.4. We have found the battery life to only be about 4 hours.Note: If you are not logged into the Free Time App, your child has the ability to see and download anything in your Kindle library and make purchases from Amazon, including movies. This is very easy to fix using the Parental Controls:1. Touch the top of the screen of your Kindle Fire and a menu will drop down.2. Touch the \"More\" link, which will take you to the Settings menu.3. Scroll down settings menu to Parental Controls. Touch to go to next screen.4. Turn on Parental Controls. It will ask you to set a password.5. Once a password is set, the next screen will give you options of what you want controlled.6. Click on each option that you want, for example you can block web access, require a password be entered before any purchases are made, etc.This does not prevent them from downloading any books, apps or movies you have already purchased.  You can, however, turn off the Wi-Fi, which would prevent them from downloading items.All that being said, I have to say that my son has been totally enjoying his Kindle Fire and overall I feel good about the purchase, even with being disappointed in some of the features in is lacking.

Anyways, the gift was a success and we were able to set her up with her own Amazon account and link the Kindle Fire to it.  So, after a few hours of use the battery was in need of a re-charge.  We plugged it into the computer and it wouldn't charge.  We used my Blackberry USB adapter and plugged it into the wall, and it was charging, but it wouldn't work (the Kindle Fire device itself).  I figured that I would let it charge and then it would be fine come morning.  Well, I was mistaken.  I tried to turn it on in the morning and it wouldn't boot up at all.  I took it to Best Buy and had their Geek Squad look at it.  They said that I was at least the 30th person TODAY with the same EXACT issue.  What was explained to me is that for some reason, the Kindle Fire will not take a charge from a computer via the USB cable or through a wall outlet with a USB adapter.  It has to be charged with a USB adapter while using a surge protector.  They proved it to me on the spot.  I asked why it wouldn't turn on even while not plugged in while I was at my house and they said that it probably had \"too much\" of a charge.  Regardless, it works now and things are just fine.  One other significant item to note is that the Kindle Fire is not provided with a USB adapter to charge, so you have to buy one separately.

Although there's an Android app available for my videos (dramafever), as well as for YouTube and several other apps I wanted, the Kindle Appstore did not have them, nor could I load apps from the Google Play appstore!  It was extremely frustrating and I almost returned the Kindle, but ended up spending two days doing searches & learning to sideload and work around Amazon's built-in disabling of certain really useful apps like GetJar and Go Launcher EX.  Now that I've finally figured out most of the issues, I'm okay with the Kindle but really wish Amazon had made it a more standard Android tablet, or at least be upfront that wasn't the case.PROS:- Price.

I got it as a replacement for the 7\" Zeki that took an unfortunate fall that cracked the screen.  I checked around online, looking for a tablet that had a decent amount of memory and would be pretty durable.  I will admit that I can be rough on my things, which is why I usually buy the accidental coverage on purchases like this.Anyway, I will clear something up real quick before I continue.  I was looking for a tablet to be a cheap, ultra-portable word processor.  I managed to get my Mini USB Keyboard to work with my Zeki tablet before it broke.  I assumed (shame on me) that the Kindle Fire, being a mainstream tablet, would be able to accept a USB Keyboard just as easily.  No.  It can't.  The Kindle Fire can NOT be used to write documents, take notes, or anything that involves a keyboard.  Not with the factory settings out of the box, anyway.  There is a way to change some of the software of the Kindle, but unless you know what you are doing, I would not recommend this.While it wasn't going to work as far as the note-taking was concerned, it worked well for just about everything else.  YouTube videos streamed almost instantly and  keyboard was very accurate.  The unit was a bit on the heavy side, considering how small it was, but I felt it was more of durability thing than anything else.Some of the things I did not like was the ads that smack you the moment the tablet loads up.  It sort of knocks the message home that the Fire is a mode of marketing for Amazon rather than a mini computer you own.  There was also no background to personalize or modify.  Maybe I didn't tinker with it enough, but once loaded up, the Kindle has your apps in your face.  And the icons are HUGE, as if they didn't trust their touch hardware to be entirely spot on.  Finally, the one update I got ended up locking up the Kindle.  I had to check on the Fire Forums to find out that I had to hold the power button for 20 seconds to get it to reboot.Hopefully, this will wave off a handful of people looking for a PDA in this.

Then they pass the fire.  It's a real pleasure having Fire in the car on long trips as it keeps the girls QUIET and content for hours - nothing else has ever been this successful at shutting them up.If you have kids and you're thinking about getting a PC or laptop for them, go to Best Buy and test out some Fire and consider getting them Fire first because kids LOVE playing with Fire.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire 7'', LED display is so muh fun!!!!!!!!", "Author": "jeepstang65", "ReviewID": "R2CWAHDNE53A5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was easy to use, the screan is very clear.

I was startled to see only a USB cable, no separate plug-in charger, no instructon booklet, and not even a simple protective sleeve. It doesn't even have a thin piece of plastic wrap over the screen as a temporary protection against fingerprints. A small black card gave very brief info so I could at least locate the turn-on button. It had about 1/5 battery charge, enough to enable it to promptly connect to my Wi-Fi. For those having trouble connecting.....is your Wi-Fi password protected?  I had to enter my Belkin Router password before it would connect, and then it set itself up fast and smoothly.Delightedly, all the eBooks I've gotten from Amazon for free and downloaded to my desktop computer through their \"Kindle for PC\" option were there waiting for me in the \"Cloud\", and I merely clicked on each book shown, selected \"Download\", and put each one on the Kindle itself.  Since I got this mostly to use as an eReader whenever and wherever I might be, my preference was to have them on the Kindle itself.As for the lack of an instruction booklet, I'm scrambling now to check out help sites (CNet has a good one with walkthrough videos from basic to advanced). That's how I learned about how to access some menus, including the one to see my System info with Serial Number and the place to add a security code. Right now, the thing is turning itself off as soon as I put it down, so I need to find how to set it to stay on until I want it off - and how to turn it off other than pressing the power button (if there is another option for that).  The Help and Feedback area preloaded on the Kindle are less than useless, IMHO.The touch required seems a bit variable, from fairly firm to very light, depending on what area you're in and what you're trying to access, but with practice I'm getting better at applying the right amount of pressure.The screen loves fingerprints!

We have a 20 month-old and we take frequent road trips so the ability to play movies from anywhere was important to us, our daughter really like Caillou.  The first issue we have with the fire is that it will frequently tell us that there is a problem with play back of videos, connect to wifi.  After taking to tech support they say the licences need to be \"refreshed\" ever couple of weeks.  That is a lie, because we will watch a video while connected to wifi the same day and it won't work 2hrs later.  If you do connect to wifi, and play the video it does seem to \"refresh\" the license, but when you are driving and don't have access to wifi you are out of luck (tech support say just stop at McDonald's and use there wifi - not always an option).  Sometimes we have had to completely wipe the video library and re-download the videos.  I have talked to customer support many times about this and all I get is 'this is a known issues, sorry.  We can try trouble shooting.' Tech support hasn't provided any timeline for when it will be fixed.  The second issue the we have with the fire is the native email app will at time send multiple version of the same email while the email is being composed.  The recipient will see an email a few sentences, then another email with a few more sentences, and then the whole email.Bottom line - If you are look for a stable platform for video watching avoid Amazon hardware, which is sad because they have the best digital selection.

Really, I just need something to pass the time on planes.I was gonna buy one of those black and white book-only deals, the Nook, one of the other versions of the Kindle - but settled on this one.

It allows you to download books and read them even in dim light.  It has access to apps and games similar to what you have on your iPhone.  You can watch movies either via Netflix or Amazon (being a Prime member helps here too).So what DON'T I like?  There's no camera, not that I need it.  It's not HD.

Downloading books is all right - but as a Prime member - you can download/rent them for free, but only \"one book a month\" which is garbage.  Otherwise you have to pay for them.

Standard operating system with a silky smooth polished feel .I love the portability and texts are awesome on web on kindle books documents this is first class . The keyboard is very responsive..even though many would consider this .  low-end Kindle Fire because of the price but honestly you will be very very surprised especially after looking around and trying other devices!!Update: The more I use this device the more I love it. I just think it's a no brainer . The display still amazes me and the quality and user friendliness. I am surprised of all the negative adds. The 360 News app is great better than any Iv used because its programmed to headline the topics you are interested in and it has great features.The thing with this Kindle Fire is that it works easily and very well for the price! I actually would of paid more because it is that good!UPDATE: I updated to the Fire Hd model but I still think the Regular Kindel Fire is better than good the HD is great too!!", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon, dont tell me one thing and then give me something diferent", "Author": "Raul \"Raul\"", "ReviewID": "RFTR8QJG3KJON", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought a regular Kindle Fire and I got the 2nd generation.

So honestly, what's the point of having it if I can do the same thing with my laptop and not having to worry about the darn thing charging all day.

When it was functional, it was fine.  During the 18 months of ownership, I actually used it very little, and there were many months of nonuse.  18 months after purchasing it, I pulled it out of a drawer and charged it because my kids wanted to play some games.  It is charged, but it is not functional.  It goes to the \"Kindle Fire\" screen and looks like it is starting up and stays there for about 30 seconds then it goes to the unlock screen. I can unlock it. It stays unlocked for a few seconds (I can briefly navigate) and then it goes back to the \"Kindle Fire\" screen and the process repeats itself all over again.  There is no way to even accomplish a hard reset with it behaving this way.  Powering it on and off does nothing to change this sequence of events.I spoke to Amazon's customer service about this and they could do nothing.  I was told it is a hardware failure on the device and since I am out of the 1 year warranty there was nothing they could do but give me a discount at getting another one (a discount of about 20%).  I expected more from this product and certainly expected it to last longer than it did.  I thought the 20% discount was piddly and I don't feel like playing roulette with another Kindle considering that mine failed after so little use.  On a bright note, customer service did tell me that \"some\" people have had theirs for 4-5 years and \"few\" customers report any issues.  I must be an anomaly.  At any rate, I was very disappointed in the Kindle Fire and equally disappointed that nothing could be done to fix it.  If you have the cash and feel that luck is on your side, take a gamble.

The sales rep told me this one was the same as mine. But it's not. It's quite different. It's as if the whole OS got an upgrade. I've gotten used to most of the things, but there are some that I hate about it.-Downloads. I download something, I see it in the browser menu, but when I tap it to open it, nothing happens. I've tried with multiple downloads and nothing changes. It's quite irritating.-Carousel. I'm not sure if there's any way to turn this off, but I hate how it displays the whole \"Customers Also Bought This\". I don't really care. If I want to see things related to that app or book, I can look on Amazon. I don't even know how but my cat ended up buying a book like this. Thankfully I could return it, but it was some book that I had NO interest in this book or anything like it at all.-Swype. Whoever thought that putting Swype on the Kindle and making it IMPOSSIBLE to remove is an idiot. You're probably going to tell me to get with the times. I'm a 24 year old woman who has had several smart phones and the like and I understand how things work and such. Making Swype a mandatory thing is ridiculous and it's enough to make me never buy another Kindle if they don't implement a way to turn it off. I don't like drawing all over my screen to form words; I tap to type with my thumbs, just like I would on a phone.Overall, I'm quite dissatisfied with my new Kindle.

When the Kindle Fire price was reduced I decided to purchase that instead and see how I liked reading books in an electronic format. I have been very happy with the purchase and thoroughly enjoy reading books in this format.Likes:1. This size is perfect for reading. I can hold it with one hand comfortably and it is light for taking with me wherever I go.2. I primarily use it for reading, but I frequently check my e-mail, browse the web, and use various apps. The overall speed is very good and it is easy to navigate.3. For me, the battery life has not been an issue. I charge it in the evening and don't take the charger with me during the day. I travel with it, etc. and the battery sustains itself through my daily use.4. Cost/Price - the price is outstanding and I could justify spending $150 compared to $400+ for an iPad.Dislikes:1. The apps are not very extensive. I can get a lot more variety on my iPhone, but I still can find the typical apps most people enjoy.2. The charger. This product includes a USB, but a wall charger is an additional product.3. The screensaver is an advertisement and there are other ads (usually specific to Kindle book deals, etc.) that you will run across.

I enjoyed the fact that I could use the kindle for all those things I didn't want to clutter my cell phone with- namely music and games, and it worked very well.. very quickly and almost never a problem.until I bought one for my sister- some of my 5 games had updates installed, which made them basically slow and unplayable...at least not as enjoyable as before.

Now, this does NOT directly involve Kindle itself, but some of the outside software so its not REALLY Kindle's problem, .. BUT if you plan on playing \"words with friends,\" or something like that, you'll see a new \"format\", less options, and a LOT longer upload time to begin play.  If you've never played these games you may not care...but if you were used to a certain speed & playability it is definitely a let down and not as fast as it was.

I can usually wait til I am at a real computer to do these other tasks.I would have given it a 5 star rating last year, but now- unless the software can work better in general, I wouldn't get another.Again, its basically what games/apps you want to use, but beware that most apps don't work as well as they used to.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "RU31H98KM6W1A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Doesn't hold a charge.

After several chats with customer service, the verdict was that I needed a new Kindle. The old one was out of warranty, so I had to pay for this one, but the customer service agent gave me a deal on it. I'm hoping that this second generation KF will not have the same problem.One of the features I like on this KF is FreeTime. It is a parental control app that allows me to hand the KF to my 3 and 8 year old grandchildren without having to worry that they're charging something to my Amazon credit card, answering ads, or trying to read one of my books. Each of them has a partition in FreeTime just for them, with the books or games appropriate for their age.I use my KF mostly for reading, although I have some word games on it too.

My son loves his Kindle and uses it everyday for games, reading, videos over Wi-Fi, etc. I highly recommend the Kindle Fire for anyone who is looking for a less expensive alternative to an iPad or iPad mini and I definitely recommend the Kindle Fire for those who are looking for a high functioning tablet with beautiful and vibrant color. The interface is easy and it did not take long to get familiar with how to use it. The Amazon store for books, music,  and games/programs is also easy to use. I ordered an inexpensive  protective case for the Kindle (totally recommended), and even after a couple of drops (totally unintentional and not at all recommended) the Kindle took them like a champ. I also purchased the wall charger block and I think that it was well worth the money spent. My son charges his Kindle, at night and once a day is usually enough.

I have four kids, if I buy them each 100$ tablet, and one game I am out nearly 500$ plus batteries. The other tablets were either way too much money, or lacked parental controls or both. I am a Nook user, have had one since they first came out and love it. Someone suggested that I look into the Kindles and I was like but but but... I am NOOK person!! Then I heard about kindle free time, and the holy grail... kindle free time unlimited. I could hand my daughter her Kindle after a brief set up and tell her to go nuts. No worries that she was downloading Sons of Anarchy, or 48$ in books, or 300$ in aps. She can download all the kids content that she wishes! She can have unlimited books, games, aps, shows etc for about 24$ a year (I am a prime member). So for the cost of ONE game she can have it all. And I don't have to worry. I love this thing. She loves it. And I am buying two more for her soon to be 7 year old twin brothers! I will be purchasing a 4th for her younger brother when he turns 5. The only thing I don't like is that I can not share one free time account between the kindles. It does mean I pay more, but I still think it's totally worth it.

First let me say, it's durable. My 4 year old cousin washed it off for some reason. We let it dry and all was well. Thank goodness I bought a cover for it. It runs well on a single charge, but seems slow to recharge. My main concern/complaint is two fold. 1st, the interface is poorly designed and clunky. Compared to other Android systems it is light years behind in ease of use. It is usable but only just. I hope a future upgrade will see a total revamp of the user interface. 2nd is availability of popular apps. Amazon has cut itself off from google play, and either charges for popular free games or they only have a few levels and you need to pay for more, or it simply does not offer them. For these 2 reasons I'm  really disappointed and wish I'd bought a brand name tablet for her instead of the Kindle. I'm a computer tech with over 25 years of experience in and around computers.

What I loved most about my Sony ereader was how the screen was a e-ink display and I could read it without hurting my eyes or having a glare.When I was deciding on which Kindle I wanted I was stuck between choosing a Fire or paperwhite.  After much consideration and reading reviews I went with the Kindle Fire.  I wanted something new and something that didn't have as much limitations.  I get a lot of my ebooks at my local library's website. I wanted a device that I could use a search engine and find the books I wanted at good prices or free online.  With the paperwhite... I would have to use a computer to find the books I want online (unless I was using the kindle store) and I felt like I already do that with my old Sony ereader.  I wanted a device that uses wifi and also is equipped to use a search browser... no computer! Which the paperwhite as wifi but not a good functioning web browser. I also can purchase some of my college text books on amazon that only work for kindle fires... not paperwhite. It was with the adds and I got it for $159.  I am very happy with my decision. The adds only show up on the screen saver and homepage.  They are in the bottom corner and don't bother me at all. I signed up for free 5-8 business day shipping and I received my Kindle fire in 3 business days!I purchased an anti-glare screen saver on amazon for a package of 3 for under $4.  With this screen protector on the screen you don't have a glare and it literally looks almost like how e-ink looks.  You can even adjust the brightness and color contrast.Another bonus to purchasing a fire is that all the books have text-to-read so all your books can read out loud to you. So if you're reading a book and want to cook dinner...just push play and listen! The paperwhite doesn't have sound.I am very happy! I would recommend this product to someone that loves to read a lot but also wants a device to use facebook, watch movies, or check emails!

So, I charged it, which took VERY long. My husband played it for maybe an hour last night and then this morning I played it for about 45 minutes and it was dead again. It has been on the charger for almost 5 hours now and it still isn't fully charged. Before we bought this I had the Nook Color and I liked it okay. The Fire is far better as far as graphics go and the apps that are available, but this not holding a charge and taking so long to recharge makes me disappointed. I had several apps on my Nook and we all would play it for several hours each day and I would read on it and it would last a good 3 or more days without having to be charged. It took my Nook a little while to recharge as well, but not nearly as long as the Fire. I am not sure if I got a defective one, or if they just aren't great at holding a charge. It makes me nervous because I was anticipating taking my Fire with us on vacation to keep my children busy on long car trips, but I am not sure if that is going to work out given the short battery life and recharge time. My son has an iPad that his school issued him and he uses it all day for school and we all play on it in the evenings and by bed time, when he finally puts it on the charger, it's usually at 20%.

In October of 2012, two months before the warranty expired, the Kindle quit charging. The portal to plug in the adapter was not even reading that the adapter was plugged in. At that time, Amazon replaced the Kindle free of charge, and I was happy with their customer service. They sent me a brand new Kindle Fire.This past month, my Kindle started crashing back to the Home screen. It mostly does it when I am using the browser, although it also does it when I am using certain apps. It also crashes when I am trying to download a new app or book from the Kindle Store. I contacted customer service and they asked me to do another factory reset. This did not solve the problem, so I called again.Imagine my dismay when they told me that even though the Kindle they sent me in October was brand new, the old warranty dates apply. The warranty on the second Kindle expired in December or January, even though I had only had the device for a couple of months. I spoke with a supervisor, and the best they could offer me was a reduced price on a Kindle Fire HD. They kept calling this their \"best replacement option.\" I told them that they have a really messed up idea of what the word \"replacement\" means, and the very definition of insanity would be for me to give them more money when both Kindle Fires I've owned have had problems. I also told them that I know they make a lot of their money from the content we buy rather than the devices themselves, so it seems like a really bad business idea not to replace the device because then I won't buy more Kindle content from them.I'm pretty ticked off, needless to say. I've had great customer service from Amazon, until now. And it makes me even angrier when I think about them not applying their warranty policies evenly.

I have to say that the Nook line is far superior as an ereader, as the Kindle Fire does not have a method of letting you organize your collection of ebooks, other than sorting the entire collection by title or author, or read vs, unread, whereas, all of my Nooks allow me to create as many bookshelves as I want, so I can have each series on it's own shelf. However, although I have word search apps on both my iPhone 5 and my Nook Tablet, I have to say that I prefer, and grew very attached to, to the word search app on the Kindle Fire, so, although I have no plans to switch my e-reading to the Kindle format, I am considering looking for a used Kindle Fire, just so I can use it for that word search app(but only if I can find one for really cheap, which doesn't seem likely, as the only ones under $100 on Ebay are non-working parts only units, due to the charger ports failing). I've read that the HD Kindles allow you to create \"Collections\" (but only 4 Collections!), so that's a rather poor method of organizing a large library of ebooks, and...., it's rather stupid that Amazon is excluding most of the Kindle line from having even that pitiful excuse of an organization method. I can create unlimited shelves on all of my Nooks, even the first generation, non-tough screen unit. My final verdict: If you want an e-reader, get the Nook Simpletouch Glowlight, and if you want a tablet, get an actual tablet, like an iPad, and put the free Kindle & Nook apps on it. It's also ridiculous that the Kindles don't come with an A/C charger included. You get a USB cord, so you can charge it via your computer's USB port, but if you want a wall charger, you need to buy it separately.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I used to love my Kindle Fire, but the touch screen stopped working after just over a year.", "Author": "Jose Diaz", "ReviewID": "R2RLU6PB5QUX0X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had my Kindle Fire for just over a year now.

This is an option you can turn off or turn on.2) The \"time left\" feature is switched off and on by tapping. The other option shows you the location of the screen you are on in the book.3) The battery life mostly depends on the brightness and whether or not you are reading. If you are reading with wifi turned off and brightness set halfway, you'll get many hours of battery life. If you crank up the brightness and surf videos, you will get less.4) If you don't use a 1 amp charger or above, you will experience slow charge times, and if you have the brightness up all the way with a low power charger, your Kindle might not even charge at all.5) There are plenty of apps you can install outside of the Amazon Marketplace. Pretty much any apk file will work with the Kindle Fire (without rooting, etc) Not all, but most. If you stumble upon strange files, just hide them.6) You can use Flash. Just look for the old version on Adobe's website and use a browser that supports Flash, but be aware you will not get any official support from Adobe if you do, because Flash is considered a dying platform (replaced by HTML5)7) The Kindle Fire will play HD videos with hardware acceleration, but your screen is limited to 1024x600 resolution, so you won't be seeing any more pixels than your screen actually has, so while the Kindle Fire is technically capable of playing those HD videos, even 1080p (with hardware acceleration), the reason for doing so (other than lack of available lower def versions) is pretty insignificant.8) The screen rotates, so the power button does not have to be any particular place, nor does the charge port. If you can't sit comfortably, unlock the screen, flip your Kindle, then lock it again. Everything works in any orientation you choose.9) The Kindle Fire is capable of playing pretty awesome games like Need for Speed Most Wanted (really, it is!).10) There is no webcam or microphone unless you buy the HD one, but I don't think this was confusing anyone.11) The advertisements can be turned off if you pay Amazon through your Kindle management pages on Amazon.com. Otherwise, there will be an ad on the lock screen of the less expensive model. It's not a big deal to me.Personally, I love my Kindle. I keep it safe in a nice squishy zip-up case and take it everywhere. I've had it in my backpack at college and don't think anything of bringing it along to all of my classes. It has been reliable and durable for everything I've wanted to do, including enjoy all the Amazon Prime content available. I'm sure the screen can get scratched, but if you keep your Kindle Fire in a case, and try not to contact the surface with anything but your fingers, you shouldn't have a problem with scratches.Lastly, there are closed captions on Amazon Prime content. If the content has captions, there will be an option to turn them on.

So 6 out of 10Keyboard:The keyboard can be uncomfortable and sometimes lags and on reviews it will keep going back to the beginning.I'd give it an 5 out of 10Apps:Um it doesn't have an extensive app selection but it's ok it has some things like Facebook,Netflex and a few others.Battery Life:You can get about 4hours of straight usage so it's not that good.Overall it has a lot of problems but their fixable and I think they will do a lot better next time  This is your report from Colton Ritchie", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire is junk", "Author": "Helen Glock", "ReviewID": "R3JK12HKGWSPPO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire as a gift.

The original lasted a little over a year when I started having issues with the charging port and occasional freezing.  I contacted Amazon and they did not hesitate to offer to replace the Kindle.  The second one (also a generation 1) began exhibiting freezing problems almost immediately and subsequently developed the same issue with the loose charging port.This time it was replaced with a generation 2 Kindle Fire and I couldn't be happier.  It hasn't frozen once and when I plug in the charger it fits in much more securely than on the previous models.  Download speed is far superior as well.  I often ran into problems downloading on the first two, would have to go the Library to try again and eventually had to turn them off, then back on, to complete the download.In closing, I am thrilled with my latest Kindle Fire.  Amazon customer service, in my opinion, is second to none, so thank you Amazon!.Update:  May 31.  Unlike the first two, the charging port on the Gen 2 is still secure.  It just quit charging today.  So I'm on my way to my fourth Kindle Fire.  Honestly, I'm getting so discouraged I'm about ready to check out the Nook, but I have a ton of books that I'll lose if I do that, and I do occasionally go back and read them again.  At least with the old hardcovers, you had them forever.  With these readers, you only have the books as long as you have the device and all that money spent is gone.  As usual, Amazon customer service was helpful and agreed to replace (yet again!) this Kindle, and this time assured me I would not run into this problem again.  Considering my experience so far, I have no idea how they can promise that!Don't get me wrong -  I love the Kindle.  I use it constantly and maybe that's the problem.  Maybe they're meant to be used only occasionally.  When they work, there's nothing better, but this is starting to feel like some strange version of Groundhog Day.  I'm a quarter of the way into a new book and now have to wait until next week to continue reading.  It would seem that the Kindle's been around long enough for the bugs to be worked out, but obviously they still have some work to do.Disappointed and discouraged, but too much invested to quit now.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "mtjames", "ReviewID": "R3GH2S0L0LE255", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I sought to write this review because I wanted to share how crippling not supporting flash video is to my web experience. 95% of what I use my kindle for is internet-related, and very few websites actually display properly on this device.

I simply wanted a no frills e-reader...okay, maybe a few frills but strictly confined to more convenience in e-reading, no gaming or music capabilities or even web browsing. Our household has many gadgets, more than enough to do everything--Wii and Xbox gaming console, a couple laptops, a desktop, smartphones, mp3 players, etc. My primary purpose in looking into the Kindle Paperwhite was to get my children to reading more and increase their reading level. So it was with mixed feelings that I ended up buying the Kindle Fire, but did resist the saleswoman's urging to upgrade even more to the Kindle Fire HD. I stopped her in her tracks and said I don't want a camera, I don't want more space for games...or this or that--I want an e-reader only!Fast forward a few days of owning the Kindle Fire. Keep in mind, that though I am inexperienced with e-readers, I have much experience with computers, smartphones and many technical gadgets which accounts for my disappointment with the Kindle Fire. Initially, I did my research--on the Paperwhite because that is what I intended to buy so in some respects I have to own up to some fault in my final choice of purchase. After my Kindle Fire purchase, I familiarized myself with the specs and reviews. One spec I'm having a very big issue with is the supposed battery life. Okay, it's based on an android platform--I get that--and for that reason battery life won't be the greatest, but can be improved by turning off Wi-Fi when not in use and getting rid of unnecessary battery draining apps. Yes, I get all that. But, even doing all that my battery drains quickly, even more so than my smartphone. Really, the battery drains frightfully fast--within a few hours. Amazon needs to advertise the Kindle Fire's battery life more truthfully, especially as it is designed to be more than an e-reader.The second thing that bothers me greatly about the Kindle Fire is once again related to the battery and this is the USB cord included in the Kindle package. It sounds trivial, but it is not. Low power charging the Kindle is frustratingly slow and a day later when it had finally fully charged, the battery drained within a few hours. I found that my smartphone wall charger fit into my Kindle Fire and within a few hours I had a full battery again, but once again the battery drained quickly like it just won't hold its charge. This is NOT acceptable. I have done everything recommended to preserving battery life, but the bottom line is that Amazon seems to have stretched the truth about battery life of the Kindle Fire. It is much less than advertised.I don't normally write mostly negative reviews, but after hearing all the hype about the Kindle and then subsequently being disappointed with its performance, I think it's important to let people know about problems such as this in products. By the way, I have researched it and I am not by far the only one unhappy with the battery life of the Kindle Fire. Look it up, Google it, Bing it, whatever research engine you use, the battery life IS a problem with the Kindle Fire.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bought my Fire from Best Buy", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R1ATVPGDBWHU8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "about a month ago.  I have a first generation iPad and previously I have done all my reading on that via the Kindle app.  For reading books though, I think the Fire is a much better choice.  It's smaller and lighter and obviously easier to pack around, to say nothing of being less expensive than most tablets.  I love the ability to make purchases on the Fire which you are no longer able to do in the Kindle app on the iPad.The screen is bright and clear and very responsive.  I haven't done any official testing but I'm quite sure my Fire is faster than the iPad.  The text is very crisp on the Fire.  It's good on the iPad but better on the Fire I think.  The one area where the iPad is probably better is reading magazines, the screen on the 7\" Fire is just too small to do that well.  I expected that going in and so it's not a major disappointment to me, but if you do a lot of magazine reading and don't have a tablet alternative, you might consider one of the 8.9\" models instead.The only reason I don't give the Fire 5 stars is the battery life is, in my opinion, very poor.

We had bought our Mom one for Christmas (the iPad was too expensive we felt) and as far as I know, she loves it. I bought one around the same time since it was cheaper (also cheaper than iPad, but bought on Cyber Monday, so a much better deal than normal). It is definitely nice for books, nicer than the Ipad, however, I am still a fan of traditional books and have only downloaded two books on my kindle thus far. I like to play on the kindle before bed since my boyfriend is averse to any extra light at night. It works fine for internet surfing, however I did prefer the Ipad for this since it had a bigger screen. I sometimes watch Hulu or Netflix on it, however my one main annoyance is that the speaker is on the top (standing up like a book) and when you watch a show or movie, you will most likely tilt it and then the speaker comes out one side. It would have been nice if the speaker went on the side that was the long way, or both on top and bottom. So overall, it is nice enough, but I honestly prefer the iPad for mostly everything less for reading books (which is why most people get it I'm sure). Pros: Small, compact size, great if you use mainly for books, cheaper than iPad. Cons: Small screen size for internet browsing (i know size is both a pro and con), speaker placement, typing on it is not as easy as an ipad since letters are placed closer than normal keyboard (I don't know, this might just be me here). That pretty much wraps it up. Like I said, i mainly use for internet browsing and email, if you want for books it's a go!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "rodney teel", "ReviewID": "R1V0C0Q4B9K0PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG! this is wonderful my husband bought it for me and now he hates it! :)it is his new replacement should have bought one years ago.:)", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "Judith Lackey", "ReviewID": "R1KMS8MFS5E03C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift for my husband.

The biggest advantage that I have found to owning the kindle is being able to access the public library with it. I have downloaded and read at least 25 books through the public library system. I have found that the kindle is quite easy to put public library books on versus the nook(my Aunt owns a nook and I recently spent 2 days trying to figure out how to put library books on it- it was a big pain to do.) I have saved over $200 just using the public library to put books on my kindle. I still am quite happy with the kindle fire, however if you mainly want to read I would purchase the kindle e-reader instead because the battery life is longer.  (Original review)I am now an owner of the Kindle Fire 8GB. After a few days of using it, I have decided that I am quite happy that I chose the Kindle Fire over the Kindle e reader. Even though it cost more I feel that I will be able to do a lot more things with it, such as watch movies, listen to music, audio books and play games that I can download from the app store. I was a little bit worried about the ads that would display, but I have found that the ads are not bothersome at all and hardly noticeable. It downloads books quite fast and I have found that I am enjoying reading on the kindle fire much more than on my tablet. For one it is much lighter than the tablet that I was using. I have also found that the kindle reader works much better on the kindle fire than what it had worked on my tablet. Another thing that I found was that my BHG digital magazine subscription is easily read on the kindle fire whereas I was having problems trying to read it on my tablet. All in all I am very satisfied and I would recommend it. However if you really cannot spare the extra money for the fire and just really want to read than purchase the kindle e reader because you will not regret reading e books from Amazon. They have an amazing assortment of free books and are easily compatible with the library system to receive free e books from the library too. They also do not require a credit card like the nook does.Since I have now owned my kindle fire for a few weeks I would like to add that I am still enjoying it. I have found many free apps in the store that I can use. Amazon also offers a different free app each day. I have also been able to purchase a few books for free that also had the free audio to go with it. I have been able to view movies on it and the picture quality is excellent. I have also been able to use the silk browser which I am satisfied with, but would probably use my laptop to do major searching,ect. For $159.00 I have been able to get an ereader, a browser to surf the internet, games from the app. store and the use of the audio for books. No this is not an ipad, however it does not cost over $300 also. I had debated whether to purchase an ipad mini or the kindle fire for a long time prior to making my purchase and I am very happy that I saved at least $200 with the purchase of the kindle fire. Also only about 5Gb can be used for storing stuff, however that is more than enough space for books and apps, and whatever more space is needed is available through cloud for free. I think that the KINDLE FIRE  IS A GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY SPENT.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thoughts on New Kindle Fire", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3J2PYEAV5GH68", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I started with a Kindle DX, then bought my wife a 6 in Kindle, before moving up to a Kindle Fire recently.

So far, my only complaint, and it is big one, is that I have not found a way to use my Kindle Fire outside.  While on a back patio on a sunny day yesterday, I found i could not read anything on my screen.  All i could see was my own reflection.  I increased the brilliance setting, but was uable to read anything on the screen.  If there is a setting for outdoors or bright su, I haven't found it.  I can see no way i can use my new Kindle Fire at a pool, beach or even a back yard patio.  My son-in-law also has a Kindle Fire and reports the same shortcoming.

My preferred computer is a PC running Windows 7. I used a Kindle Keyboard before this and loved it. Received the Kindle Fire as a gift.I wanted to like the Kindle Fire. I really did. I was tired of the super-closed ecosystem of iOS and also just wanted to try using a new device, especially since my Kindle Keyboard had a habit of freezing up or dropping dramatically in battery level for no reason. In short, it was time for a new reading device. I wanted something that was more of a tablet that I could still read on, so the Fire seemed perfect for me. However, for me personally, there really isn't much good that I can say about this device. It turns out that I would prefer a device solely for reading, so I'm planning on getting the regular Kindle.1) Weight: It's HEAVY. Okay, so it's not like carrying a cement block, but coming from the Kindle Keyboard it's a clunker. I knew it was going to be significantly heavier than the devices I'm used to since I read reviews and watched commentary, but it was still a surprise. I'm a slender guy with not much arm strength...while I could hold this one-handed and read it, it got tiring for me very fast. If you're the kind of person who props tablets up or has them lying on a table then this is irrelevant, but I'm a daily subway commuter and need something to read one-handed when I can't get a seat on the train. The Kindle Fire is not good for this purpose for me.2) Responsiveness: Coming from iOS devices, the Kindle Fire is rather sluggish in terms of the interface. I've found myself tapping icons and menus several times before it would open, and scrolling was always hiccuped. Navigating the device was just a slow process in general.3) Speed: This kind of goes with the above, but you can tell the Kindle is getting to be an old device. Things just aren't snappy, which may have to do with the processor and memory on the device. Wifi is also slow compared to the other devices I've used. If you think you might be downloading a lot of stuff or streaming a lot, you may want to reconsider getting this because it just doesn't seem to be built for heavy media.4) Lack of some key buttons: I knew the Fire didn't have buttons for page turning, but as many point out it also doesn't have physical volume buttons. Which is fine, but having to swipe the menu down each time you want to adjust the volume is a little annoying...especially since pretty much every other device out there has physical buttons. I also found that for me, I preferred having physical page-turning buttons as the page turning via touchscreen was a little TOO responsive. Even a gently tap on the screen would pop up the menu or turn the page, which got annoying very fast for me. The touchscreen volume control is also not very fine-tuned--I found that I had to put it quite high to hear notification sounds, but shrink it back down for other things.5) Display: The Kindle Fire doesn't seem to have auto-brightness...which makes manually adjusting the brightness depending on where you are quite annoying. I found that even at a relatively low setting it was just too bright for my eyes. Even switching the text to white-on-black didn't make much of a difference.6) Battery: Obviously, compared to a regular Kindle the Fire is going to have shorter battery life as it's a tablet. But it's shorter than the iPad, shorter than any other device I've used. I would prefer a device that can last me a few days, so I'm choosing to go back to the regular Kindle.7) Interface: If you're coming from an iOS device, specifically an iPad (even one that isn't current, like the iPhone 4), you will notice that the Kindle Fire is just...meh. I personally found the carousel on the home screen very annoying, and there's no way to change it or remove it. There is no real concept of a \"home screen\" as the carousel simply populates your most-recently used apps or books, based on time. You can add things to the Favorites Menu but it doesn't really replace the carousel as it's still there on the screen. The textual icons on the top can be a little hard to press sometimes, and I found myself hitting someone else next to it because they are so close together.8) That awkward middle ground: This is kind of a summation of all my points. I think the Kindle Fire is not quite a tablet but a little more than just an e-reader, so for me it lies in that awkward middle ground. It's not good enough for me to use it as a full-fledged tablet, but it's too much bells and whistles for me to just read on it. And I'm really just looking for a device to READ on. I found myself getting too distracted by other things on this device while I was reading--fiddling with the brightness because it was too bright, opening and closing Twitter, going into Settings again, etc. I'm sure this contributes to the shorter battery life, but that's just the thing...I thought I wanted to do more than just read on a device, but after using the Fire it turns out I'd rather just have a device solely for reading. The extras on the Kindle Fire are nice but they aren't good enough for me to justify using them, and the reading experience is just not as pleasant. If you're looking for more of a tablet experience I would advise you to stay away from the Kindle Fire and pay a little more for something like the Galaxy Tab 2. If you're looking more to just read, like me, then go for a regular Kindle. The Kindle Fire just doesn't do that great of a job trying to combine the two.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Frustrated with charging port!!", "Author": "Abbey", "ReviewID": "RFKLFO4YFP9QR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am on my second Kindle Fire, and about to get another.

My first Kindle fell in a bathtub and drowned, my second one was crushed by my foot.  I am resigned to losing this third Kindle to something, so I passed up the expensive case, the quick charger and the screen protector.  It might terminate its existence by being eaten by a bear, because I want something small enough to take camping. So I did buy the less expensive case, just to have something to cushion the Fire against pressure.  (It's not an Etch-A-Sketch that can be tossed into the bottom of a fully loaded toybox.)Actually, when the Kindle first came out, I purchased one as a gift for my daughter.  She doesn't get to use it much for her own pleasure, but the children love it. They use it to watch kids' movies and to play Angry Birds.  My daughter recommends watching movies with it plugged in, because video and games drain the power out quickly.  I watched a couple of videos, but had difficulty finding the volume control.  I suspect that the sound quality improves dramatically if you listen with headphones, which are usually hanging on a nail in my computer room, never with me.  I need to charge it daily, but I am reading something every day.Because I'm really only interested in using it as an e-reader, I got a couple of books from my local library and subscribed to Readers Digest.  Love the quality of the pictures, a quality that is not to be had on the original Kindle (I skipped the Paperwhite.)  The RD on the Kindle Fire is a lot more interesting than on the old Kindle and even better than the print version (50 years of reading delight with that version).  Leaving wireless on, one can click on all kinds of interactive spots and do Word Power right there - the answers erase when you leave the page. It's much easier to locate a particular chapter on the Kindle Fire, unlike its predecessors.  To find the beginning of a chapter, select the Go To option and a menu pops up, offering the various chapters by name.All in all, I am pleased.

I mean it was returned, and fixed/re-conditioned for whatever reason (probably the same issue with charging).So after the end of the 7th week, I CALLED Kindle Customer service again. Explained my situation. This time I was given the run around, felt like I got the 3rd degree from AMAZON...\"did you drop it, did you get it wet, did you expose it to the elements, are you using an inferior 3rd party charger\"...it felt like they were not trying to help me figure out what was wrong, but trying to find fault, so they didn't have to replace it. Then I got transferred...not to 1, 2 or 3 different agents, but 5...5 different people, whom I had to RE-EXPLAIN the situation to each and every single one. Every time I was told they were going to transfer me, they assured me they would explain the issue to the new person, they didn't. Finally, an agent said they would replace it. I said I wanted a NEW kindle, not a re-conditioned one, because I FIRMLY believe, that that was the problem. Not to mention, that If I wanted to purchase a re-conditioned electronic item, Best Buy sells them drastically reduced price (i.e.CHEAP) and so does Newegg... the point being... my DH paid the FULL PRICE for a NEW KINDLE...and I was being sent 'like-new' used kindles as replacements instead of a NEW replacement and I didn't think it was fair. If you go to ANY major retailer and have an issue with a product, if it's within a reasonable time they usually replace it with a NEW product, not a USED one (re-conditioned or NOT). In fact, Best Buy was ACTUALLY replacing the defective Kindles with NEW UPGRADED HD's instead of replacing with the exact same model!!!! I'm jealous!!So, finally the 5th rep says that a NEW KINDLE will be shipped to me to replace the 2nd defective Kindle. (This is getting extremely frustrating and RIDICULOUS). The 3rd kindle shows up on Christmas Eve. I was extremely excited until I opened the box and saw yet ANOTHER re-conditioned Kindle. I refused to even touch it/open it.{{Its obvious to see, if you received a new one originally, it came with an instruction book and little pamphlets/inserts and the way it was packaged screamed I'M NEW...(except for my 2nd and 3rd kindle). The generic plastic sleeve (yes there is a difference in the stupid plastic sleeves too) was crinkled and not 'perfect', no inserts, no instructions and a generic charger in a generic cardboard sleeve. (my description was for anyone who can't tell the difference between a NEW/ re-conditioned Kindle packaging)I waited a few days....furious. Waited to calm down. WHY would they send me another USED kindle, when they said they were sending me a NEW one. This time, I tried a different approach, I used the new CHAT feature on Amazon's Kindle service line. I spoke/typed to 2 reps, the 2nd rep, seemed to finally understand what I was so upset about. {{Not to mention the thousands of reviews, such as the one I'm writing (finally) and the Kindle forums that has many of the same complaints I'm voicing here.}}She agreed with me, and actually UPGRADED me to the NEWEST version of the kindle. I double and triple checked that even though she said I was getting the upgraded newest version...was it going to be a RE-CONDITIONED version!!! She promised it would be BRAND SPANKING NEW. I got the Kindle 2 in 2 days. I was afraid, for obvious reasons. I opened the new black box...and sat in silence while I stared at the BRAND SPANKING NEW KINDLE...finally.I've had no issues thus far.BTW...The 2nd generation has a thick plastic sleeve with Asian printing all over it (ALL re-conditioned Kindles come with thin PLAIN-no printing-plastic sleeves. Also, the 2nd generation does not come with an instruction manual as the Original Kindle did...because the manual is downloaded into the kindle itself. The charger is a USB plug, and DOES not come with an actual wall charger, nor does it actually charge thru the USB hub on my computer. So there is a added bonus surprise...you have to BUY an actual USB wall CHARGER, (that is if you want to charge your Kindle)...Its $20...and its the #1 accessory, I wonder WHY....FINALLY...I will NEVER CALL the customer service line again. I will ALWAYS use the CHAT feature. I will tell you why...EVIDENCE of the conversation and PROMISES in writing. I copied and pasted every conversation and kept it, in case I needed to pull it out and use it as proof, to read it WORD FOR WORD VERBATIM as PROOF...CYA. If they say they are going to send you a NEW product...I have proof, if the item does not show up as promised. A-Z CLAIMS should work for buyers with AMAZON, as they do for any other seller on AMAZON. I also was happy to have the conversation, because it had the name of the person I was speaking to, So I could COMPLIMENT them when I received my \"DID WE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION\" email. Which I DID. Thank you again SHEILA for my NEW UPGRADED KINDLE!I do hope this helps someone...anyone.

The parental controls are a joke. All they do is keep the kid from purchasing paid apps. There is no way to filter web content, and no 3rd party apps you can purchase to add the feature. Searching the web with the browser easily pulls up porn sites--if a search string could even remotely hint to being related to porn, it's going to pull porn up first.As for grownups? It's wonderful. I use the tts feature a lot and the voice is much more natural on the fire than the eink versions... it only has a female voice though, and you can't adjust the pitch of the voice--it is a little too high for my taste for listening to books. The touch screen is very responsive which is good and bad. When you just want to pull the menu up when reading, it sometimes takes a couple times to JUST pull up the menu (I generally find myself flipping pages instead) but it's great when you're using apps.All in all, not something for kids (I'm not an over protective parent, I just have a special needs teenager) but for adults it's great... oh... one more thing.. it does NOT play Angry Birds (much to the teen's distress).------------After several months of trial and error I'm updating my review.  While my rating does not change I have a few things to add.  The parental controls are REALLY a joke.  After my 15 year old special needs son kept disabling the parental controls to prevent purchases, I figured out what was happening... all the child has to do is go into settings and UNCHECK the parental controls checkbox... no password, no pin number no nothing to keep the child from doing so. Also, there is no way to keep newly purchased books from appearing in another kindle's carousel, even if the purchase was sent to a specific unit (we have a Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Touch and 2 Kindle Fire's) it will still appear in the carousel of the other units--and mom and dad's purchases are driving my 12 year old crazy.

Hands down winner!", "Author": "Angel", "ReviewID": "R2OIQ83AGO0DXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: January 13th 2013My niece LOVES her Kindle Fire. With the Kindle Free Time App, I set what apps, movies, books, etc and how long she is allowed to either be on the Kindle or specific type (app vs. books vs. movie). The ONLY thing I can say I am rather disappointed in with Amazon is that via the KFT app there is no way to allow the kids to access the Amazon Instant Video library, the only exception is if you purchase a movie and then download it to the Kindle (which i think takes up needles space).  And despite whether you download or not once in KFT the kids can't access music, even the music i want her to listen to. I can just turn it on the Kindle and open the Kindle Free Time and hand it to her and she is off with no worries on my head. And if you don't exit the KFT app before powering down, when you turn it back on again it is still logged in. So she really can't do anything unless I give it to her unlocked. I love it, she loves it. BEST decision EVER! Honestly I can't express how happy I am with her Kindle Fire or even my own Kindle Fire HD. 100% satisfied customer!This review/product opinion is from my blog. but i really wanted to share with everyone because I am just so happy with the purchase. I had posted on November 3rd, 2012.[...]What is the best deal for a kids tablet?Just thought I would share, because I know a lot of you have kids. I have been looking into getting a Kid friendly tablet for niece for a Christmas present. I have done a lot of price comparing & reading reviews, just basic research. I hope this helps.What I had wanted in a tablet was the ability for her to watch movies, play games & read books, but not have access to other apps or accidentally get into settings or something. I wanted something she can grow into as she gets older but simple enough for her to use now (age 4). Some of the key Apps I wanted were:  Netflix, Flixster/Vudu, Amazon Instant Video; Apps I didn't need but were a plus Kindle, Hulu plus, Disney Radio & Sprout.I already have subscriptions with Netflix, AIV (amazon prime) & Hulu plus; and accounts with Vudu & Kindle (with existing content). So I didn't want to get stuck having to repurchase either movies/books/tv shows that I have already bought or can access for free. Many of the \"kid\" tablets out there require you to buy in to their currency and then purchase these items from the special \"store\" for that select tablet. One of the few that I saw actually accessed the android market (google play) was the Kurio Kids Tablet ($149.00).The MEEP! ($149.00) tablet at first seemed good, but again after reading reviews it didn't seem so great. Many of the tablets had horror stories of adults (well adept in using electronics) not being able to set up the simplest of functions on some of these more expensive tablets, if the adults can't set it up how can the kids use it. I also looked into the LeepPad 2 ($99.00) & the Inno Tab 2S ($69.00), again after reading reviews or seeing that still after purchasing i have to sink lots of money in to apps only for that select tablet. Why buy a movie/tv show that can ONLY be watched on this one kids toy? I was beginning to give up, the cheaper the tablet the more you spent on apps and download content (books/movies) and the more expensive you got the more bugs seemed to be in the device. Then as I was shopping for me I found almost exactly what I wanted.The new re-vamped Kindle Fire (not the Kindle FireHD). The new version has what they call Kindle FreeTime, which allows the Kindle to have select user accounts or profiles to log in to and limit what content is available to each user. It even lets you designate the amount of time each user \"Kid\" has. The Kindle has access to ALL of my required apps and SOME of my wanted apps (doesn't have Disney or Sprout). But for the price $159.00, it is my clear winner. Granted its a few dollars more than the more expensive \"Kid tablets\" but much cheaper than some of the better quality tablets out there like the Galaxy or iPad. They have kid friendly cases for the Kindle Fire and as she gets older we can adjust the settings for her and the purchases won't be a total loss as they are useable via other devices. We can rent/buy Barbie on her Kindle and then watch on TV (via Roku or Smart TV) or on my phone or tablet. No horror story in trying to get it set up for the kid to use or having to spend money to buy fake money to use in a special store, and as she gets older it won't look like a \"baby toy\" as my nephew puts it.FYI I gathered most of my reviews from ToysRus.com and Amazon.com, and a few other web reviews that I failed to write down :( sorry", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Difference between Fire and Fire HD?

The whole line is awesome so buy whichever you like, but if you are just looking for a good E-reader/Prime free video watcher, the Fire is just fine.UPDATE: 01/26/2012 -After using the Kindle Fire for a month, I have noticed one giant difference between the 12/2011 version and the 12/2012 version; the battery.  The battery in the older version lasts for months and months without a recharge in sleep mode with frequent use.  The new version the battery will last 1 week with sleep mode and frequent use.  It is also impossible to charge the Kindle with it shut off, it MUST be in sleep mode or on to charge the battery.

I havd a little disable that the HD would take care of very nicely.  That is to read a book with a narrator and the words were lightlighed for me.  I have bought a lot of Wisper-to -voice books.  I bought four of Ken Follet books (the long ones) example, Pillars of the Earth.  It wouldn't download to my HD.  I didn't know it wouldn't so I bought the other three.I spent $57.00 just on the four books not counting the four audiobooks. I'm a great-grandmother and have to spend my money wisely, which I didn't.  So, Audio gave me three credits not 4 and Amazon said they would give me $14 0r $15 only.  I wanted to talk to a mamager but you can forget that.  I bought the Kindle Fire HD 32 and I had to stop downloading because I had only 2 GB left.  I'm in bed a lot and wanted to get thebookd I thought would give me enjoyment during my confindment.  But I'm so disappointed with Amazon and Audio I just don't know what to do. They are ALL so nice but could never solve my problem.  They didn't put in \"buyer beware\"  Buy it it is yours.  So disappointmented.  I have gotten several of my friends to join and gave three Kindles away for Kindle.  I only wanted what I paid for the books so I could buy ones that will allow me to use the proffessional narrator. They want me to use Test-to-speak.  Don't like that.  Sorry, for all the misspelled works just had an operation and can't see well.

It is definitely a great product for personal entertainment.  There were some slight annoyances. When I first received it, I had to get used to the touch screen. It wasn't as receptive as some of my apple products, and I wasn't able to find a setting that adjusts the sensitivity of the screen which was surprising, but I got used to it as time went on.Another issue I had was that there are no personalization features for wallpaper or the screensaver. Instead there are advertisements in place of where that screensaver may have been. I heard there is a way to get these removed, and I plan on doing so.Despite what was said above, this product is great with games and videos. I also enjoy it for the reader, which is the main reason I bought it. I also love the amazon prime on the kindle!

The only thing I liked about it was the ease of returning it.  We bought this for our kids (ages 3 & 6) as an alternative to the main computer which I use for work.  We wanted something they wouldn't easily outgrow and could use independently.  If they can operate a laptop and a iphone with ease, a tablet shouldn't be a problem, right?  Wrong- with this one, at least.  There are two rows of icons on the screen.  The top one is the ones you've downloaded and the bottom one is suggested purchases / apps to download.  I cannot explain how frustrating that is to children or to parents who constantly have to get back to the home screen for them (that was a bit difficult for them as well).  This device also does not support a flash player which was disappointing as well as we had intended our oldest daughter to be able to use the kindle for school reading games.  About the only thing that worked well was netflix (very limited free games for children they are entertaining or useful) and that drained the battery within 30-45 minutes.  Recharging the battery also seemed to take an exceptionally long time.This was just a big let down as a tablet.

Honestly, I have used some generic type tablets and have paid the price. I gave away my 1st generation Kindle Fire to my son back in July because I just really did not think I needed it. I have 2 Kindle ereaders, one is the touch the other is the plain one. I love them both. Use one for the beach and the touch stays in my house by my bedside. This Christmas I really wanted my Kindle Fire back, but did not want to ask my son for it. I tried to coax him into getting an Ipad, but he said he had no use for one because he was loving the Kindle Fire and watches his Netflix on it and reads his books etc. He said he couldn't live without it. So, I purchased a cheapo no name brand and it did not work, so back it went. There was no customer support and from all the reviews it seemed like everyone was having the same problems. I looked at the new Kindle Fire both the plain and HD one and honestly was ready to purchase one or the other. Something stopped me. I really wanted the first generation one. I looked online and purchased a used one. Now, I sit and wait for my Kindle Fire to arrive. I cannot wait. Lesson learned: stay away from no name brands and never stray from Amazon or their superb customer service. I will upgrade eventually, but I want to play a little longer with the model I gave away. Glad my son is enjoying his though.:)June 21, 2013I'm am editing my review. Not shortly after I received my Kindle did it have problems with the charging port. Seems to be an issue for Kindle devices. So instead of going with another Kindle ( out of warranty) I purchased the Hisense Zero 7 Pro made for Walmart which is basically a Google Nexus but with a rear 5mp camera.All for just $149.99!

If you're looking for a tablet that has music, games, books, can search the web (just to name a few of its features) and don't want to drop $400 bucks on an ipad- this is the thing to get, seriously. First I'll describe the features of the kindle, then I'll write a pro and con list for it. From top to bottom the length is 7 3/8 inches and from side to side its about 4 5/8 inches, the ACTUAL screen length though, is about 6 by 3 1/2 inches. The screen is made of some hard plastic that won't scratch or dent easily. On the back you'll see the Amazon logo and in big letters the word \"KINDLE\", so should you ever forget what you're using you can always turn it around. On the bottom of the Kindle you will find a charging port, earphone jack and a power on/off button. On the top are two monster stereo system speakers, perfect for listening to Evanescence or Van Halen. When I first received it, I almost couldn't suppress my excitement, the packaging had no chance. Amazon has the box so perfectly designed that when you open the lid of the package there lies the tablet, glistening. When you turn it on, it will ask for your e-mail and some other information about yourself, just to get the Kindle registered. After it's registered, the main screen will show all your apps on a carousel. There will be options above the carousel for: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, Audiobooks, Web, Photos, Docs and offers. At the very top is a toolbar displaying the time, WIFI connection, and battery life. If you pull town the toolbar there is an immense amount of options that you can use.  There's a countless number of apps for the Kindle, most of them under 2 bucks or free. For the games I've purchased, I have no complaints, everything runs smooth. For Netflix, streaming is also smooth, as long as you have the bandwidth to support it. Let me say really quick that the screen is very bright and easy to see.  Books are very fun, and easy to use. You can purchase them from Amazon (if you have Amazon prime, some books are even free) or if you have a local library it will probably have an E-book library. Renting E-books for your Kindle is just like going to the library and renting a book, but it's swifter, easier, and you don't have to leave the comfort of your home! When your reading a book, there is an option called \"text to speech,\" which is an automated voice that reads the book to you. And if you don't know what a word means, you just tap on that word, hold your finger there, and it will automatically bring up a definition for that word. There are many other options too, like adjusting font size, notes, adjusting margins and line spacing, just to name a few. :)  The Kindle's touch response is crisp, with no delay. It feels solid in your hands and is very durable. With the Kindle case and screen protector I have, I wouldn't be surprised if it lasts for the next millennium (really durable), But that doesn't mean go throw it on some rocks!! The \"Special Offers\" that show when you power it up, or the recommendations that show at the bottom of the screen don't really bother me, but if it bothers you you can get the Kindle without \"Special Offers\", it's $15 more, I believe. As far as any screen bleeding problems, I have experienced none. But if anything happens to your Kindle and it's not like- 2 years after you bought it, TELL AMAZON! I would trust Amazon with my life.  Lastly, the parental controls are excellent. If you don't want your child surfing the infinite web, which by the way runs great on the Kindle, just turn if off! Yes there are many parental controls on this thing. You can type in a password, and access a list of controls: Block the process of buying things, so you don't come home to a child that has racked up a nice bill for you. Block E-mails and contacts. Block any of the Books, Music, Apps, etc. You can also set time limits if you have Kindle free time. Here's that pro and con list I promised.:DPROS!!- Low, affordable price.- Many apps most under 2 bucks, or free- Easy to use, great for children- Nice parental controls- Screen is nice and bright- Can rent books from library- You can access Facebook, Twitter, and E-mails straight from device.- Durable- Can get nice cover for it- Streaming for Netflix and Amazon instant video is great- Unlimited cloud storage- Web is smooth- Stereo speakers!- Long battery life (if you're playing games the battery won't last as long)- Comes with chargerCons (I wouldn't even call these cons- more like downsides. There isn't anything seriously wrong with it)- Large (its bigger than an iphone, which is good because it has a big screen, but you can't just slip it in your pocket and be on your way)- Youtube could have a sharper picture. I guess that's where HD comes into play.- Only two point touch (can only recognize two fingers on the screen)- No cameraThat's really it, like I said, there isn't anything seriously wrong with this product, it's outstanding.SUMMARYOverall the Kindle Fire is exceptional, simply exceptional. Great for reading, playing,and listening to music. Lots of apps, affordable price, durable. It's perfect for the kiddies, and perfect for just sitting on the couch and playing around. This is an honest review conceived by the awesomeness that the Kindle displays. I'm not writing all the good things about it and no bad because I'm blinded by love for it or something. I'm just telling you how it is.

My kids love watching shows from Disney Channel online, but can't do it on the fire because you need FLASH support to do that.  My son has an  iPod touch and that's one of the things he enjoys doing so I thought the fire would be a good gift because the screen is larger.  The original fire supported FLASH, so it's disappointing this one doesn't.  This means, for example, you can't watch YouTube videos.  Anyway, while I don't plan on returning the fire, if I had known this I wouldn't have gotten it, and just thought I'd mention this in case this matters to someone else and they are assuming they could do something as simple as watching a YouTube video or a Disney channel show.Update:  My kindle fire recently just started going to yahoo mobile view even when I select desktop view.  All other sites show up as desktop, but yahoo shows up as mobile.  If I select mobile view, yahoo shows up in desktop view and everything else in mobile.

Product Recall?I hate to say it but the Kindle Fire is \"Big Money Wasted\" in terms of performance and glitches that were not addressed even though Amazon said the new Kindle solved the previous e-reader issues. First off, we ordered two Kindle Fires for two of our kids, and the problems started from the get go with one of the Kindle Fires not charging properly. We did an overnight charge into a wall socket and one of the Kindle Fires did not even reach it's charging capacity. (BTW: We did all the troubleshooting so let me stop everyone in their tracks before I get a flurry of \"fix-it\" responses.) Also, the other Kindle Fire is not even close to the battery life that has been touted. We are getting about 3 hours of battery life instead of the \"up to 9 hours\" as advertised. The processor is no better than our previous Kindles and I also notice quite a bit of hanging when the kids are using any type of app. We actually have to shut down and restart the whole Kindle to get it back on track. IMO One of the absolute WORST products that has been touted as revolutionary. Save your money and stick with the older more reliable models.

It is fast, very responsive and even though it's not the HD model I think the screen is beautiful!! I just got it the other day so I haven't checked out the video or music yet but so far it does exactly what I bought it for. A portable reader that will allow me to get e-mail, do a little web browsing and check updates on Facebook. I'm not a big game player so the \"Words with Friends\", Scrabble and Poker App that connects with Facebook is good enough for me. I also LOVE how easily it all connected and configured and how it integrates with Amazon.The Con's: Did NOT come with a charger included, major fail.  Has a micro USB cable but not the wall connector end for it. Luckily I own a BB and the wall adapter was compatible. Have to do more testing but my 1st impression is that the battery life is not that great, and it is very SLOW in recharging, at least with it powered up. I just powered it down and will see if that helps.Bottom Line - Don't buy this if you are looking for a full featured tablet because it doesn't run Flash and it is not a true Android OS so you don't get all the Android Apps and Games.

Not having the Google Play store is remedied by a lot of side loading, which is not difficult to do. The screen is just the right size, big enough to see everything, but not so big I can't comfortably hold it for a long period. The Freetime feature sold me on getting one for my son for Christmas. The big thing I'd like to have, that I thought was available when I bought it but isn't, is an option for an external keyboard. The reason I'm not rating it more than three is that even though it is good for the price there are more robust tablets out there for a little bit more money. Nexus 7, Gal Tab 2 7 both allow for the external keyboard, have cameras, bluetooth capability, and allow for more freedom of customization.

I have had no substantive issues. With a good pair of headphones (I use Sennheiser) the experience can be significantly better than watching on a big screen. The music app is great - all my Amazon music is in the cloud, ready to be played. I am also very pleasantly surprised by the integration with Audible - all my old audiobooks are ready to be streamed or downloaded instantly!I became so hooked to my Fire that I purchased a 4G hotspot (with metered connection - Ting) so that I could connect on the bus and elsewhere. It works fairly well - the Fire may drop the connection when we are moving at 65 or 70 in weird Houston suburbia, but in general the Fire can handle the hotspot fairly well. The drop may be the hotspot anyway. Also, the Fire seems to be fairly frugal in 4G use - I set the browser to \"mobile page\" and read much of the NY Times with the Fire for little in 4G cost.As a baseball fanatic, the MLB app (with a daily streamed game and all sorts of info) is a great deal, and the stream works passably well.I use Skype a lot and would like to do it on the Fire, but the original Fire is Skypeless. At some point may have to move up to the HD, but for now I'm so in tune with my Fire that I will find other places to Skype, or suck it up and use my cellphone.I'm surprised at how useful and straightforward the mail app is. I have synced to Gmail and over the last year never had a problem. CalenGoo is a wonderful app for syncing your google calendar, which is important for me at both work and home.In short, I was unsure how productive the Fire was going to be for me. I can now say unreservedly that for a scholar it can be incredibly useful, and the pop culture maven and baseball fan in me have not been disappointed.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really love my Kindle Fire.", "Author": "vani711", "ReviewID": "R3ISXPLCSMMTRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love reading and I had been looking into getting a Kindle for some time now.

You can also change brightness, fonts and even add notes next to things you like as you read - this makes my reading experience more comfortable for me but also more interactive. The touch screen is responsive - you don't find yourself having to hit a button more than once because the screen responds right away. The sound is great - much better than I expected and sounds even better when I plug my headphones into the headphone jack. This Kindle is a great purchase. It is easy to navigate and personalize as well as fun for something other than just reading.My only negative is that my Kindle wouldn't charge :( It didn't recognize my mother's Kindle charger, my computer or another wall charger at all. I called Amazon support, my call was answered after I chose the correct opition on the recording and the woman was so helpful, Victoria was her name. She helped me reset it but still nothing. Then I was transferred to Rhonda in digital support who clarified all I had tried and then said they would be sending me out a new Kindle.

This tablet is lacking in hardware as far as external volume controls like you find on most devices. It's frustrating at first to figure out how to adjust the volume. Other tablets and even my Android phone, all have these side button volume controls. Another issue I have had and not tried yet to fix is that when I put the headphones in, sound comes out of both the headphones and tablet speakers and the sound isn't great. Also at max volume it is hard to hear much. I also did not like that the device doesn't come with a charger for your wall, it only comes with the cord. This is the first time I have EVER seen that. I don't want to pay extra for a charger so I am using others that I luckily already had but what if you didn't?As far as streaming goes, I experience a slight lag when I first stream Amazon or other videos but it doesn't last too long, video quality is otherwise great and I like being able to stop watching a movie on the Fire and resume watching on my Roku or PS3. I don't like the Kindle app for reading as much as the ones I have on other devices, it just isn't as seamless.The lack of apps is a bit disappointing and I am finding that some which are normally free on Android cost money on Amazon App store.If you want this device for an affordable basic tablet and for Amazon content I recommend it but if you are looking for something more advanced go with something else like a Nexus 7.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "C.

The speakers are amazing considering their size.The bad: The battery life could be a bit longer, although turning down brightness and turning OIFF wireless helps out. The WLAN transceiver is not very powerful or sensitive, which limits range. The screen is a fingerprint magnet- invest in a bag of cheap swipe sticks (stylus'?). To protect your investment, get a good protective case; mine is from marware and it has helped my fire survive SEVERAL trips to the tile floor of my home  nicely; it also makes up for the lack of a kickstand. Also, the USB port is not very rugged; if you wack it a nice shove UP or DOWN (as seen while looking directly at the screen from above) you will pop the lands from the socket free from the mother board and have no way to charge it.The Ugly: Fingerprints. Also, it's not rainproof; although the back and front are indeed watertight, both ends have holes for speakers and earphones and the micro-B USB cable which let water come right inside nicely, which really should be addressed.YO: Flat printed coil on the inside of the cse for magnetic coupling, and a low power VLF radio hotpad charger dock. just lay the fire on the pad, the weight clicks it on, it charges via induction. stick a rubber plug in the usb socket until soimeone needs to side load something. Stick thin flexible plastic over the speaker ports, and no more rain damage. Stick a rubber plug into the earphoine port like on my cellphone and that's the end of rain problems.

My kids also regularly used it for games. Everything we used it for worked great for us. Then, after having the Kindle Fire for less than two years the charger no longer worked and it eventually died... permanently. I contacted Amazon and apparently this is a very common issue with the Kindle Fire. I had been thinking of upgrading to another Kindle and planned to keep the Kindle Fire for a long time for my children to use, so the fact that after less than two years it was basically trash was extremely disappointing. I never would have purchased it, knowing that it would last such a short time. I contacted Amazon and they offered to give me a reduced price on some of the other devices, however, it did not include any reduction on the 7\" HD, so I basically would get $20 off the closest similar device, and up to $100 of a much more expensive device. Not worth buying another tablet that is going to die in such a short time. After a few contacts with Amazon concerning my frustration they basically said, contact us again to see if we can do something else for you. I attempted to contact them two other times and received the same result. I would have preferred that they just left it how it was rather than having me waste my time contacting them two more times to be told the same thing.

The students use them with me in my small group rotations for language arts, math, and science.  I looked at several different tablets, but only took home a Fire and A Nabi to try out to see how I liked them.  The Nabi had a lot of non educational stuff preloaded that I would not use, also the students would have to page through the Nabi AppStore page to get to the books etc.  I called the Nabi help line and found out you could not relocate it away from kid's view.  That reminded me of candy at the grocery store checkout!  I tested both during our Christmas break and chose the Fire.  I love Kindle's free Freetime (not the paid subscription service).  I  did try out the paid service, but as it was similar to the Nabi's mix of edutainment/games/books so I decided to go with the non subscription Freetime.  I love the way I can use Freetime to tailor content specifically for each of my groups.  I have purchased lots of interactive book apps from Oceanhouse Media......anything they do is top quality!  The great thing is that every book or app I buy from the Amazon appstore then shows up on all five of my Kindle Fires.....Scholastic Storia expected me to by the SAME book five times to get it on all of my tablets!  I have discovered apps for science, math, social studies, phonics, vocabulary, sentence writing, letter formation, reading, drawing etc.  So far I have purchased about fifty apps for use throughout the kindergarten year.  The children are so engaged with the touch technology and the Fires have fast and beautiful displays, plus they are the perfect size for small hands.  I bought bright red rubbery bumper cases from Cellularvilla to protect the Fires. I am very pleased with my purchase of five Kindle Fire second generation tablets and my students love learning with them.Also I love to read and have owned a Kindle reader for many years so the price and quality of the Fires is inline with my prior experience with Amazon.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "janet bidle", "ReviewID": "RIT424K6JRR38", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this prior to going on vacation to use on the airplane.

First off, we ordered two Kindle Fires for two of our kids, and the problems started from the get go with one of the Kindle Fires not charging properly.  We did an overnight charge into a wall socket and one of the Kindle Fires did not even reach it's charging capacity.  (BTW:  We did all the troubleshooting so let me stop everyone in their tracks before I get a flurry of \"fix-it\" responses.)  Also, the other Kindle Fire is not even close to the battery life that has been touted.  We are getting about 3 hours of battery life instead of the \"up to 9 hours\" as advertised.  The processor is no better than our previous Kindles and I also notice quite a bit of hanging when the kids are using any type of app.  We actually have to shut down and restart the whole Kindle to get it back on track.

Customer service was very helpful in this matter and I received my replacement the next day. This new Kindle has not given me a bit of trouble and I am really enjoying it. I love the fact that there are free books available because I doubt that I will ever pay for a book. I've noticed that I really have to move quickly though, because a book that's free today might not be tomorrow.I've had no problems connecting to the web or playing games. The games that I usually play on my iPhone I am now playing on Kindle and it's so much nicer playing on a larger screen.The only negative thing that I have to say is that the battery does not last long. I'm constantly charging it and I'm concerned that in the future that I'll have issues with the port where the charger goes like so many others have complained about.

Purchased for my kids to play educational games. When used as 'designed,' it doesn't work. In the middle of playing a game, it stalls. When streaming music/Pandora, it gets 'stuck' & makes a HORRIBLE, obnoxiously loud stuttering sound (which, of course, wakes my kids back up). I called Amazon & on the PROMPT it says to \"push #3\" if your Kindle is 'frozen.' Um. Hello? If there are so many problems that it's on ur PROMPT, maybe you should FIX it.  Took me 3 hours yesterday trying to fix Kindles we've only used for TWO MONTHS. I went to the store i purchased it from, they directed me to their Help support who directed me to Amazon's Help support who had to escalate the ticket to another support desk.  Once I had the supervisor, she told me to go back to the store!! (i.e.- Product Support?)Bottom Line:  It doesn't stream content without errors/failures/interruption (basic videos, music, etc). You have to turn it off/on 7 times in 15 minutes to reboot!! Although purchased for the express purpose of advancing their knowledge, the kids HATE the Kindles & don't WANT to use them because \"they NEVERRR work!!!\" Save yourself some money and purchase something else. Definitely NOT worth the money, the migraine, or the time investment.Update 12/21: Now the Kindle won't turn on AT ALL. A technician said he hears Kindle problems constantly & strongly advises a Nexus & its Quad-core technology. U can download a Amazon/Kindle app so it will have same look/feel. More FREE apps, better technology, richer screen, better performance, Same price - $199. Amazon is exchanging my Kindle (thanks to $50 warranty I purchased). Hope, the replacements work...but not holding my breath.Update 12/23:  Set up the new Kindle. Within 2 MINUTES(!), it wasn't working correctly!! The attached video shows the same high-pitched 'stuttering' sound. The only way to 'clear' it, is to power down. The new Kindle ALSO freezes & has to be turned off/on to work. It ALSO doesn't consistently turn on. Had it less than 24 hrs.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best new toy for couples that read in bed...w/o lights to keep partner awake.", "Author": "Waldo Pepper", "ReviewID": "ROSU5BF8N33NV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There were two things that kept giving it 5 stars:1.

I wish that you could customize the opening screens and backgrounds. My last Gripe is that I can't organize the book and Apps list at all. I like to use the kindle fire to pick my next book because I can look at the covers, but there is no way to quickly look at a book description without going back into the store and looking it up. I wish I could easily get more information to help me choose my books.The 7\" size is good to take along easily. I did not get used to reading on it, because I don't like to finger swipe the pages. My regular kindle is much better for intense reading. My only other complaint is the battery life. It does not last very long. Overall I do enjoy the apps, magazines and web browsing ability of it.

After speaking to 3 representatives I'm frustrated, annoyed and have a splitting headache but have no idea what they are sending me as a replacement... The first representative told me that they would send a new kindle right out to me, they just needed a credit card number to charge, if I did not return the broken fire and the the charge would be $199. I did not have my card with me so they said to call back and they would mark my account. Number 2 said that this problem was common in this model but it would be replaced with a new one not refurbished, I would be charged $199 if I didn't return my broken Fire and I could upgrade at an additional cost but first I needed to try the newer charger, so they sent it to me. It did not work. They did not call back as per their confirming email, so I called again.  Number 3 said I could upgrade, my warranty had expired but there was an extension because of the battery issue but now I only have one day left, to make my decision. I was then told I would probably receive a refurbished one with a 90 day warranty, but if I wanted to upgrade I could buy a refurbished upgrade with a 1yr. warranty or a new one at the regular price with my Fire as a trade in for $50-$100 and again I would be charged $199 if my fire was not returned!!! I asked for a Supervisor. Number 4 was a supervisor who said there was a misunderstanding with her people and she would speak with them, but couldn't offer me an explanation as what I would get for my  trade in so I asked the Supervisor how much I would be charged if the Fire was not returned so I could insure it and she told me that they would send me an insured mailing label for the return but I would still charged $199 if I don't return it (like I really wanted a broken Fire). Is Amazon going to charge the Post Office $199 if it's lost???? I have no idea what I'm receiving new or refurbished or what model Fire I'm getting so I took the replacement one in complete frustration and going out to look at the other Tablets with a better Customer Support.

WOW! really good of them. The problem is that though its the old casing of the kindle fire, the software is the new 2012 version. AND IT SUCKS!! big time. I cant stress enough, I HATE THE NEW SYSTEM!!My reasons:1. They've laid out all the tabs - ie videos, music, pictures, downloads, etc at the top instead of all under media - the result is that you now have to scroll to reach the 'web' and other tabs that don't fit on the screen.2. You cant disable the swipe function, which randomly decides to take over your keyboard.Really I just hate the layout, which can be dismissed while reading if the touch screen wasnt so sensitive (overtly so).I cant say how long it takes to pull down the top menu to access the volume and brightness, but because the screen is soo sensitive it selects the wifi settings instead and then that starts a whole mess of headaches.When my kindle stopped working i just wanted my old system back, i was hoping that because of the new model being realised that there would be old models ready to replace broken ones, but they're just using the casing.I am currently looking into downgrading my kindle (why mess with a working formula?).Finally what drove me to write this review: my touch screen has gone bonkers! It selects what it wants so it takes 15 mins to get past the unlock screen (which i've had to disable) and if i select a video i must be prepared to watch the wrong vid, be unable to adjust the volume and take ages to use the back arrow. I've reset it and scanned for viruses, but nothing has helped and it really is pissing me off to the point where I just dont want to use my kindle at all, and my kindle is my life.Please amazon again why fix a working thing??!!UPDATE:Even though I was told that my kindle was $159 and I received the second generation kindle costing $159 I was charged the full price $199. for the fire HD.

The only negative thing I have about this device is the area to connect it to get charged. Ever since we got the device, I noticed the indicator light would turn on when plugging in the cord, but once not touching it, it would turn off and doesn't charge the kindle. This is very frustrating. I have to gently move the cord until I see the light turn on and quickly put something like a book underneath the cord to hold in place so it could continue charging. Even so, at times, we leave it there thinking its charging when it really isn't. I don't know if we got a defective device, or if all kindles connection ports are like that. I read alot of good reviews and since I got this kindle for a reasonable price, I didn't think I would need the extended protection. Now, I regret I didn't buy it.

When I saw Amazon's sale price on the Kindle Fire on cyber Monday, I decided to give ebooks a try.Before I tell you what I think of my new Kindle, there are a couple of bones to pick. First, I expected the Kindle to come with a way to charge it that doesn't take over half a day. I only discovered after placing the order that a plug-in, quick charger is optional, so I had to pay about $16 extra to get the charger separately (they arrived in the same Amazon box). You should price the Kindle to include the charger.Second, it is apparently only possible to register the Kindle wirelessly and not by using the USB connection. I don't understand why this should be, but if I were Amazon, I would fix this problem before Christmas day. Otherwise, lots of people who get a Kindle as a gift but don't have WiFi access on Christmas morning are likely to be angry. As it was, my Kindle was delivered late in the afternoon and I had to wait until the next morning to get to my local library to link up, get it registered, and download my first books. (UPDATE: Looks like you have already made wireless registration unnecessary.)Now to the Kindle. It is fantastic! I think I have now explored every part of it (and have developed a very light touch in the process). Overall, it is a technology and design marvel, very much like Apple produces. I have no doubt that I will be doing all of my future book reading on my Kindle. As an important side benefit, I kept working on getting the Kindle linked wirelessly to my iMac and finally succeeded.

My only REAL complaint is there are no instructions.  It comes with a tiny piece of paper that tells you how to charge it, how to turn it on, and how to unlock the screen. That's it.  There is an online help function, but that only works if you're somewhere where you can access wifi, which in my case meant a drive to Starbucks or somewhere like that.  You can also BUY an ebook other people have written that tell you how to do things, but my thought is, it's an eReader! You can't include an ebook version of that online help file? Or an ebook instruction book??  Just automatically included like you include certain apps?It's not that it's excessively difficult to use, but I don't know WHERE to find what I'm looking for, so I fumble around between screens until I find what I want, and then when I need it again, I can't remember what I did to get there the first time, because I had to open and close so many things in the process of finding it.That problem aside, which doesn't have anything to do with the device itself, I LOVE this thing.

I was actually thinking of purchasing a Kindle at the time, but never thought of going for the Kindle Fire. For one, some of the other Kindles were going for a lot cheaper than the KF, and I am a big book reader, so I thought one of the regular ones would be a good fit.I've had a few issues with my KF that have luckily been fixed with a hard reset, so that much I can be thankful for. The picture quality is amazing so there are no worries for those who desire a tablet to watch movies or the latest television shows. Music is also great on here.One thing I don't like is the downloading process for apps. I purchase my apps online through Amazon, and then I go to my KF to download them. But there seems to be a lag or something, so the app is never in my \"apps\" area, and when I go to the App Store it says that I have already purchased it. It is quite the ordeal just to download something I purchased, which is super annoying to have to do every single time.What I don't like is the inability to sufficiently organize the books on this Kindle. You can sort your books in three categories, but that is about it. You basically have a big and open list of books made available for anyone to look at. I am a huge reader and since I can remember throughout my 22 years of life that has always been the case. So I have tons of books. Literally TONS of books and am grateful for that, but at the same time there is no way for me to organize them on the KF, so therefore only a few are on my actual Kindle, which is really sad, but I simply cannot have a lot of books on here at once. For example, I would love to be able to put my books in folders or groups like you can on the other Kindles that aren't fires -- by collections -- but I cannot do that. They are just in an annoying list.Also, if I open a book but change my mind on reading said book, my position in the list refreshes back to the top.  If only I could organize by author or genre. I would LOVE to organize my books by author, but that simply isn't possible, and reading is the main reason I have a Kindle. It's quiet the conundrum and annoyance that I constantly have. I have been in contact with Kindle support about this feedback three or four times, which has been asked aplenty for a long time, but nothing has come from it. It's really disheartening, for at the same time there are some covers of books that I'd rather some people not see (for example my supervisor was thinking of buying the HD and wanted to see the navigation of my current one. I got a little *ahem* worried because it was a spur of the moment request), but if there were some form of organization I would have no issues with anything. Is it bad for me to want to organize my books so I can have some semblance of order? Is it bad that I want to be able to organize my books so I can see what I actually have?

When we had originally bought it, we took it to my Dad's house and registered it, downloaded some apps, etc. Worked fine and we loved it! When my 11 year old daughter brought it to our house, we tried to download some books and other apps, and we kept getting error messages that said there was no internet connection and to check the connection and try later. This went on for 3 days! We have a Verizon mifi 4g LTE wireless internet that we take with us. We have no in home internet, we just use the \"box!\" Way cheaper for us then to have home internet and then have to depend on public internet coverage when we're away. We love it and have never had an issue with this device as my phone and laptop work fine off of it. When I called tech support for the kindle, they told me that sometimes Amazon cannot communicate with a specific internet connection and that's why we can access the internet on the kindle, but CANNOT download ANY apps, books, movies, etc. We were told to take it back to my Dad's  house and try again on his internet (which is Embarq) and see if it would work there. It works FINE at my Dad's so it is an issue with Amazon not being able to communicate with our device! I've never heard of anything so dumb in my life! Why would I want something that we have to find public internet access or tap into somebody's else's internet in order to be able to use it. If she wants to load something at home, we have to make a list and then wait till we get somewhere in order for her to be able to do anything! I was not impressed with tech support because they told me, \"Well, why don't you get a router for your home computer and then it will work\". Why would I have 2 internets just because Amazon cannot communicate??? In the 5 years that I have had Verizon, we have never ONCE had an issue with this device! And the funny thing is, the kindle will hook up to our internet so that she can watch youtube videos or check FB, etc, but you cannot purchase anything from it, including free apps and books. We have decided to sell it to another family member who can get it to work with their internet. I'm looking to replace it probably with an ipad or a nook as these do not communicate with Amazon. I think the kidles are great, but make sure it's compatiable with your specific internet before you waste your money on something you can't use! Overall, I'm disappointed with Amazon mainly. All the technology out there and they can't communicate with a very well known internet provider? I'm tired of all this and she just wants something that will work, so we are just going to go with a completely different device.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my kindle, I really do, but....", "Author": "LittleMissLovelyEmilyBook", "ReviewID": "R23PCLPBQRXUW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me just start off buy saying that I love my kindle fire. it was gifted to me on my birthday (1/17/2012)So i have had it for almost a year. It was my second e-reader, and first amazon product. My first e-reader was a 'Kobo Touch' from Borders, and was purchased when the company was going under.. My kobo was the love of my life for a short while. I found myself reading from the app on my laptop more and more, and using the device less and less. It was not a good experience.Anyway, About a year later, I had been asking warily for a new e-reader for my birthday. I came home that day, and there it was. When I first got my kindle, I was slightly confused about how it all worked, and was again wary. It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to go about purchasing books on the device. After that, it was perfect.But then....A few months after I had gotten my Fire, it began frequently freezing. (Bare in mind I was in not way ruff on my kindle, and had not dropped it.) One day, my kindle's battery died. No big deal, right? Wrong. I plugged in my kindle, and waited patiently for the orange 'Charging' light to come on. It didn't.  I tried restarting my kindle, but nothing would work. I left it for a while, then a few hours later took it back to the store in which it was purchased. I came home with a new kindle, and all was well.A few months later....My Kindle Fire started to freeze again, and I would restart it. Then, similar to what happened the first time, it died. Thus I tried to charge it, and again, it didn't work. Frankly, I was annoyed. After spending around $200 dollars(USD), My kindle was just going to continually fail? There was no reason for it. I again got a replacement for my kindle.AND AGAIN....Only about a month for two later, I needed another replacement. This being my third kindle fire, in less than a years time. This time though, when I was getting my replacement, I was told it was most likely my own fault my kindle failed repeatedly. After this, I became more careful in what I did with my kindle.NOW...I am happy to say I have not needed another replacement, but my kindle STILL freezes at least 5 times weekly. Sometimes more. Maybe this is due to heavy use?? I don't know. Overall, I do love my kindle, but it is buggy, and I find myself annoyed constantly that it is not 3G. I often find myself finishing books while out and about, and then having nothing to read because I cannot get into the kindle store without WI-FI.*SUMMARY* In all honesty, I still love my kindle deeply, but will not be purchasing a new upgraded model. Though i wouldn't hesitate to buy another kindle. (Like the Kindle Keyboard which I am considering.)Reading on the kindle is nice, but it can sometimes skip pages. Often I find myself watching movies or tv on my kindle, and I love it, but it is very grany in close up shots. The internet browser is nice, but not perfect. Overally the kindle fire is a nice starter kindle, If you dont mind the freezing, or it being a bit heavy and laggy.I am giving The Kindle Fire 4 out of 5 stars", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not so easy to use", "Author": "Tinker10", "ReviewID": "R162LGAHF4KLU3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the looks of the new Kindle Fire 7\" but it is not as easy to use as I had hoped.

With my Kindle I can read in a dark corner or a closet, if need be.As to the extravagant claim in the title, I have four herniated disks. If I am not religious about exercising my core, I am at great risk for degeneration of my spine. I work out for an hour twice a week with a trainer and as part of a circuit class.  Then I try to put in at least a mile (sometimes five miles) per day on the treadmill, which is terminally boring.  Absolutely nothing exciting has ever happened in the parking lot of Fitness 19, and for insurance reasons, the gym will not move the \"dreadmills\" backward to an angle which would  allow us to see the tvs.  So my kindle, which fits beautifully on the tiny ledge of the machine, is a life saver.  I don't read books there often because the jogging motion is hard on my eyes.  And anyway, the major inducement to y virtuous hour of aerobics is that this is the only time and place I allow myself to play video games.  The best video games I have found for this purpose are Tetris and Popping Stars.  Popping Stars is best because there is no time pressure.

I'm very disappointed in Amazon, for making a device so bad. They can it's a good price but really, for what you get, it's not. The Samsung Galaxy 3 tab 7inch, 8 gb, is only like $30.00 dollars more, but you get more, like front and back camera, NO annoying ads that you have to pay $15 more to get rid of, and after you pay that you can't even put a picture you like, you get checker board, books and other things for your lock screen, and when your on your main page you don't have a choice of a picture. Plus, the apps are useless, well at least some of them. There's no instagram, keek, flappy birds, and many other popular apps, like 80% of them are rip offs of other apps and useless apps. 15% I know but won't use them and 5% are apps like and played for, even though there free on android. Kindle Fire's always want to be in some way connected with some social media, I hate that. The only thing this is good at is reading, cause that's what's it's for. Watching videos is a no, you have to pay for more if you want HD, listening to music is ok, surfing the web is descent, the web browser is slow, but good. The battery life only last like 3hours reading, on 0 brightness, has no wall charger when you by this, you have to send $20.00 more, when it should of came with it. All still takes 5 hours to charge. Their customer service is great, this perfect for newbies, and grandpa's and grandma's. You can't expand memory like in a android, you can't screen shot pictures, an you certainly can't take pictures. I hate how is so thick, the back has a good grip. Well I have it a 3 star cause it gets the job done, and I got what I payed for.

I really wish it would either support Google Play apps or that Amazon would have more variety in their store. I have also found that to get some of my music on the device I could not go through the upload to Cloud player. I had to put them on directly from my computer.

I would give the 1st Kindle and the 3rd, the Kindle Paperwhite, each 5 stars. This model Kindle Fire product has a short battery life, even with brightness at 50%. I believe it might be an appropriate gift for a youngster's intro to an electronic reading device as well as access to the internet or to check email (if kids even use email.)  For adults who wish simply to have access to an electronic reading device with internet ability this may be a useful choice.  In my opinion this model Kindle Fire is not comparible to more sophisticated and more expensive systems.  Since I am retired and quite elderly, I do not find the Kindle Fire an asset and I am likely to seldom use it except to make a gift of it to a youngster.

Evenly distributed weight. Fairly intuitive interface. Fast. Good screen. Not as crappy a build as I expected for under $100.Cons: Amazon, Amazon, Amazon! Setting up a proprietary app store and refusing anything that doesn't line Amazon's pockets. Going to all the trouble and expense of making it easy, but only if you do what they want and buy what they want and use what they want. Also, no apparently obvious way to use USB memory sticks to increase storage capacity. Proprietary browser is an annoying anachronism. Cloud video has significant limitations, and the tiny memory doesn't help. Also don't like apps that can't be deleted. Assurances as to the security of the device sadly lacking, making me wonder how safe my data and (dwindling) privacy actually is.My biggest concern is that I paid for the damned thing, so why am I required to use it the way they want me to? The people who made my car don't tell me where I can and can't drive, nor do they threaten to brick my car if I install secondary market stuff without their approval. My microwave doesn't refuse to heat non-approved foodstuffs. The idea that I am only borrowing the thing after paying for it is foul.I should be able to open any file that can be opened in Android. I should be able to have all my e-books work without having one easy way from the Amazon store and another complicated workaround for anybody else's. I should not be stuck with their browser.The real problem with the real problems is that they stem from Amazon's insular greediness and their gradual, but hopefully not inevitable, slide towards a day when the customers are the product and the advertisers are Amazon's REAL customer base. These petty little insults to the autonomy of the user all add up to a very bad idea, especially if Amazon wants us to trust them.Pretending to protect consumers while actually shafting them is grounds for revolution.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "We had trouble with the charge connector on two fires but Amazon has made good each time.", "Author": "Frederick W.

I wasn't expecting it to feel \"like a book\" in my hand, but was pleasantly proven wrong.  For what it is and how I use it, I would have given it 5 stars.However, its lack of durability is a big issue for me.  We got the extended warranty (up to two years), and it was a good thing.  Almost exactly at one year (when the regular warranty would have expired), the micro-USB port stopped working (couldn't charge or sync - unit was replaced under warranty, shipping was covered).  Six months later, lockup issues required service (shipping both ways covered).  Five days after extended warranty expired, the screen cracked and unit is barely usable.While customer service was prompt and attentive (while the warranty was valid), this product is fragile.  I now have a device that is barely usable, and no confidence that another purchased unit will be any less fragile.

It is quite heavy compared to the other, but the features of e-mail, internet and other apps overcame my objection.  After one year, my apps began dropping and the battery would only hold a charge for about 8 hours, even if it was turned off.  I rebooted several time, got the apps back, only to lose them in a few days.  Your answer was to send me a new Kindle which is most likely the one you want me to rate.  I loaded the e-mail but was unable to load any of the folder information and we have about 20 folders with quite a bit of information.  After at least four contact calls and e-mails telling me the technical specialist could fix it, nothing was accomplished.  I was finally told to keep both at no charge.  As nice as that is, it did not solve my problem.  I now have one defective Kindle that has the folders and one that I cannot load the folder information.  I am not sure of the resolution, but am not happy.Any ideas????  Cindy and Jim DavidsonAccount is James D.

My first complaint is that there is not an actual charger included with the purchase of the Kindle.  It only comes with a USB cable, and trying to charge the device from a computer takes a ridiculously long time.  I've concluded that perhaps Amazon doesn't include a charger because there's no such thing as one that works properly with this device for the long haul.  I've tried a lot of different chargers, thinking that perhaps it was just a matter of finding the elusive perfect charger to keep this device working.

However, now the replacement one is also having the very same issue, and now, of course, the warranty period is up. So my son has no kindle. I believe this has to be an internal defect with this particular model. There is no way we would have two tablets do the same thing.

Stone \"Rolling Stone\"", "ReviewID": "R2AFANNFWOHEDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many pluses for this kindle, several because of Amazon, and several because of the availability of e-books from many sources.  Since owning my first Kindle Fire, my reading habits have changed considerably. Now I read a hundred or so books a year, up from about 25, and I choose very fine books instead of relying on what is available in airport bookstores, which is usually of marginal quality.Here is where I get books:1. Amazon web site:  An amazing collection of ebooks.  All genres, and very high quality (as well as some pretty poor reads -- you have to be selective).  Enough great reading for a lifetime, and continually growing.2. Download the Calibre program to your computer, and browse the world's bookstores and libraries for ebooks of your choice.  It can convert non-Kindle format into Kindle format in some cases, if you don't have an app on the Kindle to read the non-Kindle format.  It has access to free collections like The Guttenberg Project, as well as to web sites that charge.3. Access your local library through the library web site using Overdrive.  This works extremely well, but is only as good as your library's collection.  The quality and breadth of available library books varies widely with municipality.4. Borrow from Amazon Kindle lending library.  I have had varying success with this.  In a few cases, the selections were very good.  Many more I left unfinished, usually because the writing was inept or uninteresting.Bottom line:  The most reliable source for great reading is Amazon, Calibre is great for obtaining the classics at low cost or free.Other issues:  Kindle Fire First Edition is not particularly easy to use for web access to surf the web.  Kindle Fire Second Edition is much improved.  I have other ways to access the web, and feel that using the Kindle almost exclusively for books more than justifies its cost.I had a Kindle Fire First edition for two years that eventually reached a point that it would not fully charge any more.  While this was disappointing because I expected longer useful life, Amazon's service made up for the inconvenience. Within two days I had a replacement refurbished Kindle Fire Second edition at a big discount from full retail.  All of my books were already available on the replacement.  Dealing with Customer Service at Amazon was unbelievably fast and efficient.  My first call was put on hold for no more than 10 seconds, and there was no second call necessary.  When the Kindle failed, I had misgivings about getting another one.  But having gone through the replacement experience, I would not consider an alternate e-reader.My impressions of other readers, like the I Pad or Nook, is that each has particular characteristics that differentiate it from the Kindle.  Each is probably superior to Kindle is some aspect or another.  Since my main use of the Kindle is for reading books, I believe that the Kindle is far superior simply because it has instant access to an enormous library of quality books.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for older people.", "Author": "SMM2571", "ReviewID": "R1U8YFS1TH8QGK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my Dad one of these a few months ago.

If you have a Prime account you can \"borrow books\" to read without paying for them. (that and free two day shipping on thousands of items, TOTALLY worth it) We have no previous experience with Kindle's or anything like that but this one as a starter has made an excellent impression and will get tons of use I'm sure. The layout is super super simple and it's linked to your accounts directly [Facebook, Pinterest, Gmail all that good stuff] and makes everything really easy to use. The only thing that I guess I was not even disappointed in, but expected maybe a little more from, is the main screen itself and the lack of customization as far as the background when you pull it out of sleep mode and it really doesn't have much of an interface option.

The WiFi access to our internet service works great, facilitating browsing from anywhere in the house.  The screen is crisp and bright, easy to read under all conditions.  Performance is good and the host of applications that are available at little or no cost opens up practical uses such as cataloging recipes and bringing them up for use in the kitchen.  It's nice to be able to download recipes directly to the device and never have to type a thing by hand.  I love being able to access multiple translations and paraphrases of the Bible on one compact device while I am in church or studying at home.  Access to e-mail is helpful and convenient.  Access to books through my public library is also convenient.  Battery life is amazing on this device, as is the technical support from Amazon (which I only needed on the defective Kindle Fire I originally bought through a third party reseller of \"refurbished\" products - stay away from sales except through Amazon directly!) .  A far cry from an iPad with a data plan for use anywhere, this is a very nice compromise for most of the things I do at home or without internet access.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Photo Girl", "ReviewID": "R2DBROL28GHYDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works like new.  Bought a new one last year for my middle daughter.  I really didn't want to spend $149 on the LeapPad for my 5 year old because in a couple of years she will grow out of it.  I love the Kindle fire because of the Kindle Free time app.  My kids can use the app with age appropriate content and I don't have to worry about it.  Also with free time I can set parameter like how long they have to spend on educational applications before they can play their other games.  This is an awesome product and I am very happy with it.
