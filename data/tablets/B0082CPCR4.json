{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Forget The Big Red Fruit", "Author": "J. R. O. Neal \"Islidur\"", "ReviewID": "R2TEVTJ5Z1XFBO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome tablet. Extremely powerful and versatile. Some purists will say the display isn't up to par, but that's ridiculous. This is a stunning display even if it falls short of the highest pixel count available. The performance is better than the iPad 3, it's a beautiful device and it offers the unique ability to pop into a keyboard base and \"transform\" into a laptop. Combine that with it' s low price and Apple is outdone and forgotten. Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself. Ease of use, convenience, portability and awesome power make it a better option for me than my laptop.The unit is made of plastic, but it's very sturdy and I feel it will last quite a while, I did order a leather case for it though. As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says. I have poor eyesight, but I can clearly read the screen even with full sun shining on it. I tested the GPS with the unit tethered to my iPhone and it works flawlessly. Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there. There are litterally too many features on this tablet to list individually and I know I haven't even found all of them yet. So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up. I think this is a problem with ICS and will probably be fixed with the next update. Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy. I was constantly hitting backspace while writing lengthy messages because it would misspell (even though I hit the right key) and would put spaces in the middle of some words. I haven't tried the Google keyboard yet because I decided to just use the dock from now on for long messages.One more note. I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released. The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon. But, it's good enough now for us to thoroughly enjoy these tablets and has given me a reason to ditch our iPhones and go with Samsung Galaxy S's as well.UpdateHaving spent an extended amount of time with the tablet, I've got a few observations.First, there is some light bleed on the screen edges, but under normal circumstances it's not noticable.Second, on top of shutting down occassionally the browser is very slow to extremely slow. I believe this is more an Android issue than a tablet issue and I hope it will be corrected with an update.Third, the tablet has 3 performance settings. Initially, I left it on the default balanced setting. I've discovered that MANY times video will not play unless I switch to the high performance setting. I've decided to just leave it on the higher setting and sufffer the battery drain.Fourth, for some reason, you cannot use a usb extension cable. It won't work for power or data with any cable extention. This is dissapointing as I'd like to sit on the couch and charge at the same time, but the stock cable is too short.I still believe it's a great tablet and will only get better with software updates, but right now it suffers from glitchy, slow apps and OS. I've dropped my review by 1 star due to the software issues.UPDATE***I've spent many months with the tablet and thought I'd share my thoughts now.The new JB upgrade and subsequent upgrades to that have really helped. The keyboard works great now. For the browser, I switched to Chrome and have had no issues, just have to go to the stock browser for flash related content. Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use. And, about another 5 hours if I add the dock, very good in my opinion. A user commented about the extension USB issue and rightly informed me that it has to be USB 3.0, I was using a 2.0 cable.I use the tablet every day and it has become a necessary part of life. I use Kingfsoft office for word docs and spreadsheets, scribble pad for notes to myself and during meetings, play games, do email, take videos, navigation, weather, etc. I've also installed Splashtop on my PC so I can do remote desktop, works great.It's still the best Android tablet availible at this price point and will be a viable option for some time.I like the tablet so much, I bought one to give away to one of my employees during my company Christmas party. The lucky winner is very happy.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything I dreamed it would be!", "Author": "Katherine G. Carr", "ReviewID": "R23OYHLBN0PPMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my TF300 a few days ago and I love it! I really wanted to wait for the Transformer Pad Infinity because of the nicer screen and the metal casing, but for $200 less, I felt that the TF300 would be a great deal and it is! I haven't tried to use the tablet outside, but inside the screen is bright and crisp - I have zero complaints about it.Some of the best things about this tablet:*It's able to run Flash programs*Full keyboard dock*customizability (Apple doesn't want you messing with anything except maybe where you put the apps on the screen)*The ability to print on most printers using Google Cloudprint (Apple airprint lets you print on certain printers, but the list is short)*Comes with Polaris Office (like Microsoft office and compatible with office and excel and power point)*Much more compatible with a PC*You can remotely control your PC using this tablet (really cool!)*Way more apps than I thought there would be with all the hype about Apple's App Store having more - I have an iPhone and so I know there are gazillions of choices there, but if I didn't know better, I wouldn't have noticed the difference.* You can use your PC to download apps directly to the TF300 without connecting it or anything.*There's a widget you can use to kill all the running apps to save battery power.As for the unit itself, it feels nice in my hands - the plastic doesn't feel chintzy, but I have nothing to compare it to. The touch screen is very responsive, the apps and browsing are fast and smooth (even with some really cool live wallpapers running in the background).So far, I have no complaints at all. Part of me still wants the Infinity just because it will have some things that are really cool, but I'm not sure they are worth $200 extra when the insides of the two are pretty much the same.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have so much love to give :-( REVISED AGAIN", "Author": "Mikec717", "ReviewID": "R8OJCZE9LZ12F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3:  Please check each individual section in my \"PRIOR REVIEW\" for updates on those particular items.  I will do one more small update later.UPDATE 2:  This is just a short update just to let everyone that the replacement TF300 has for all extensive purposes been a home run.  This is the tablet I wanted to love and it keeps giving me reasons to love it more.  I will do a more in depth update later in the next few days but for now just let me say BUY THIS TABLET.  I'm very happy I just got a defective unit the first time around.  No strike 2 for ASUS.  I'll leave my prior review in place just in case someone gets a tab that was doing the same thing.UPDATE 1:  Just to keep those interested in buying up to date.  ASUS responded very quickly to my review (see comments) and after a few emails back and forth they also think I have a faulty tablet.  For those interested I'll post some excerpts in the comments, I do go into a bit more detail on some of the errors.PRIOR REVIEW:Well, I'll get right to it.  I want to LOVE this tablet.  I did a lot of research and knew this was it for me.  I received my tablet and started putting it through the paces.  All was well for about a week, then it started rebooting over and over again.  First it was rebooting after every song on Pandora.  So I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it.  Ok, problem solved.  Not quite.  Angry Birds Space froze, tablet rebooted.  Now I'm getting suspicious.  Pandora made it reboot.  EVERYTHING made it reboot.  Keep in mind all this was yesterday that it got all kooky.  I am on the latest firmware.  I did a cold boot (power off, unplugged, power button+volume down) and was hoping for the best.  Nope.  Getting my google play on and then silence.  Look at the tablet and it's rebooting.  So I start opening apps to test again.  I open Dolpin Browser, Gallery, Super Note, and My Library, all but one come PREINSTALLED on the tablet.  I go to open Pandora and don't even get to touch the icon before it's rebooting again.  So I want to run that scenario, open the same apps, it's fine.  I have the tab in the keyboard dock and I go to open Netflix.  The screen goes to portrait then back to landscape and nothing happens.  So I say screw it and put Google play back on again.  I let it play over night, it did not restart, but the music did pause.  Fine.  I hit play in the morning and like 15 seconds in it restarts.  I am returning this tablet and hoping it's just a defective unit.  From the reviews it sounds it is.  But I will make some comments on how it was when it did work.DisplayPeople say it's not as nice as the new IPAD.  Well it's not, IPAD is a premium unit sold at a premium price.  I'm not gonna compare a Hyundai to a high end Mercedes.  Is a super duper HD screen really worth THAT much more?  Not for me.  Compare the Transformer Infinity to the IPAD.  That said, the screen is great.  Reading books is no problem, my pictures look awesome, games look very detailed.  LITTLE bit of bleeding on the bottom (landscape) but as others have stated, only on black back grounds and really it doesn't take away from anything.  It's not burn your eyes out bright as the Prime, but it's plenty bright.  At home I usually keep it at 50%, in my office I might max it out, but in my defense 3 of my 4 walls are windows really so I get a lot of sunlight in here.  It's plenty bright.  I sort of think we've all been pampered and spoiled by gorgeous screens and I can honestly say this is one is just that.  It's just not super duper IPS HDx400.  Stop, it's great, plenty good, especially for the price.  I've thrown some HD video at it looks awesome.  And I'm a little snobby when it comes to these things, I'm happy with the display.  It's also (when it works) very responsive out of box.UPDATE:  Not much to add to this.  I still feel it's plenty bright for the average person.  Resolution is fine, HD video looks great.  HD games and apps look great.  Non-HD apps are a little pixelated but that's not a display issue, that's an android issue because (and apple does do this better) not every app is made to be displayed on tablets.  Great, solid screen that is very responsive.  Really my only gripe is a gripe about ALL tablets is that they are finger print magnets.  I was given a stylus that I thought I would never use, but I gotta admit that I love the thing.  Since I use it so much it sort of solved the finger print issue.PerformanceMeh, can't comment on this until I get the replacement unit.  It started off pretty snappy and just fell apart.  Graphic intensive games were nothing to it.  No lag at all.  My bigger problems were the simple things which is kind of odd.  I do love the option of low consumption, balanced, and performance.  You can change between them quickly and there is a definite difference in battery life (and performance).  I don't need 5 cores to do most things, i'm usually on balanced and it (when it works) was plenty fast.  I think my unit is defective so I'll hold off on this part.UPDATE:  Now I can comment on this.  GREAT tablet.  This will probably be one of the most important sections for most so I'll try to be thorough.  I'll break this up into subcategories to make it easy.MULTITASKING UPDATE:  This beast is amazing.  Let me take you through a normal day.  I get to the office and throw on streaming music or put a movie for back ground noise.  I gotta prep for some meetings on Evernote, review some documents on Google Drive.  Meeting time.  We have a lot of internal documents in pdf, no problem with ezPDF reader (two bucks, buy it) where I can pull it up and ohhh look at that, yes I am annotating the pdf file with my own notes, text, drawings and pictures. I work at a large facility, someone in the meeting just asked about a certain area of our property.  it's Maps time!  I remove my tablet from the keyboard dock (which always is met by a look of surprise, then \"oh how cool\" then questions about the tablet) and scroll smoothly from side to side and zoom in and out with no problem (AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FAST WIFI!!!).  Another question and I have to look at a website for a quick answer (like I said in the internet browsing, it's not that bad, just not a desktop experience on the speed) and now they ask to see some pictures, up comes the gallery where my pictures render quickly (performance mode is your friend, ladies and gents).  Another question that I know can be better explained with a youtube video and back to my notes.  Is Thursday good for a follow up meeting?  Let me pull up my calendar....how were your numbers last year for this....let me open the file manager and pull up my excel sheets.  I do not close any of this stuff down and only once has maps frozen and shut down.  I do this almost every day to that extent and do not close apps between all this bouncing around.  It handles it with out breaking a sweat.  This machine is a multitasker.  Quad-core?  Yes please!PERFORMANCE GAMES UPDATE:  I did not purchase this tablet to play games.  That said, holy jesus I love playing games on this thing.  Your normal Android game (i.e. angry birds, Fruit Ninja, Ninja Chicken, TnT, Temple Run, Brave Temple Run, TripleTown (I saw the cutesy graphics and was going to bail, 3 minutes later I'm buying this insanely addictive game) all look and run beautiful.  The graphic intensive games that should show off the processor might does just that.  Max Payne, NOVA 3, Six Guns, ShadowGun and Biohazard 4 (korean only release, I don't know what the hell is going on in it) all look great, run smooth, and do it all with a high frame rate.  I did have Shadow Gun shut down on me when I connected it to my 50' panasonic along to my PS3 controller, but that was after I played it for about half an hour with no problems, turned it off, and went to play it again.  That was yesterday and I haven't tried again.  I'm getting used to playing the higher end games on the tablet, it was a little weird at first with out a controller.  I'm still a little clunky at it but I'm guessing I just need to practice.  Overall I'd say the tablet has exceeded my expectations on the game front.Internet BrowsingAt times it's brilliant, but it's buggy. (right as I wrote that my tablet restarted...again with pandora)  Anyways, not the smoothest web experience.  But i think that will get better.  My personal experience is that Chrome Beta seems to be the most unstable, it shuts down a lot.  Dolphin seems pretty good as does the stock browser.  I honestly have not put in enough time browsing the web to make a fair judgement on this.UPDATE:  I think this Internet Browsing might be the weakest thing about Android (not this tablet, it's really more of a software problem)  It's not as good as desktop browsing, but it's a pretty new OS so there's going to be a lot of improvement on this front.  It's not awful by any means, but it's just not that normal desktop experience.  Some sites load just fine, no problem at all.  Others that are flash heavy or have videos tend to take a bit too long to load.  Nothing unbearable mind you, but definitely has room for improvement.  But I might not have the right browser.  I mainly use the stock browser.  Haven't used Dolphin HD much, the chrome browser (beta) was god awful and unstable, and Firefox just came out and I have not tried that out yet.SoundNot bad, not oh my god amazing, but not bad.  I watched Iron Man 2 on netflix with my Onkyo system hooked up to it, it did surround sound pretty damn well actually.  Didn't really expect that.  With out assistance I would say the sound is above average.  It's actually damn loud with Ninja Chicken.UPDATE:  I use it in my office all the time, no problem hearing music or movies over the stupidly loud AC.  I use headphones a lot, they sound good.  I would like an equalizer but that's a software thing and I'm sure there's on in the market place, haven't looked.  But really that should be standard for any OS.  I also connect it for music and movies to my Sound System and it sounds epic.  Don't expect to put this thing as your sound source for your party or anything like that.  One somewhat big gripe is the speaker placement is stupid.  If I'm holding the speaker landscape laying a game like NOVA 3 I cover the damn speaker with my hand.  Why ASUS put two speakers on one side of the flippin' thing is beyond me.  The speaker quality itself isn't bad though and the placement is more of an annoyance than an actual problem.MEDIA PLAYBACK UPDATEMusic:  No problem.  I use Winamp myself and have had no problems.Moves:  Ahhh!  Here's where this beautiful creature shines.  First, as stated several times in this review, get the MX PLAYER.  It's awesome.  HD looks great.  The intro to Dark Knight, Hugo, Final Fantasy Advent Children and African Cats all made me give a little \"wow\" and I was playing them.  But it's not just HD that look good.  I threw Batman the Animated series and Batman beyond on this tablet and was a kid again watching them with no problem.  I've thrown a lot of formats at it, avi, mp4, mkv (my personal favorite), mpg, all play no problem.  The only thing that makes it jam up a bit is the M2TS which I actually never heard of until recently.  Aside from that all video files have played back with no problems.HDMI Playbackit pretty much mirrors what's on your tab.  Looked good but subtitles are a bit of a let down.  Playing netflix movies subtitled will not display on screen.  It'll show the movie on your TV but the subtitles only show up on the tablet.  There's technical reasons for this having to do with HDMI, but it's disappointing because in my situation (my wife has english as a second language) it really does help.  Other than that the quality is good and the sound does carry through the HDMI in case anyone was wondering.UPDATE:  Loving the HDMI playback.  No stutter, no slow down.  I have quickly amassed a large digital library and it's great.  Picture and sound are not problem.  The subtitle thing for NETFLIX is a no go, but when playing a movie from your tablet on MX PLAYER (highly recommended) the subs on that show up just fine on the TV.  I go into more detail on this in the comments section.WeightYou don't really realize how much a pound is until you are holding it for a while.  I'm ok with it, my wife on the other hand did complain after a short while that it was a little heavy.  I think it's fine, you'll really get tired holding pretty much anything for a while.UPDATE:  After a few weeks I think I'm just used to this thing, weight doesn't bother me at all.  I can and do hold it for long periods of time.  My wife hasn't complained about it again either so I think she's on the same boat.BuildIt feels sold, keyboard dock does too.  Not poor quality at all.  I actually like that it's a littler thicker than the prime, it makes it more comfortable.  There is such a thing as too thin sometimes.  (And my tablet rebooted again, just FYI, this time with google play)UPDATE:  Ah hell, I dropped it.  It did have a case on it but parts were exposed.  It got dinged up a bit because it was right onto asphalt, but it took it with minimal physical damage.  Probably would have dented an aluminum housing, it was sort of a rough drop.  But it's fine and very happy with the build quality thus far.BatteryGreat battery.  Tablet with keyboard dock lasts me about a day and a half of fair usage, streaming music (as I keep trying to do), playing games, reading documents, always connected to wifi, brightness at full in my office, multi-tasking.UPDATE:  I use the thing a lot and almost exclusively on performance mode (I paid for all those cores, I'm gonna bloody well use them).  I do try to adjust the brightness to my surroundings (more proof that it's plenty bright) and keep the GPS and bluetooth off.  After a day at work with me, games, movies, and streaming music I usually have about 30% left.  Once it was at 23%, never has it died on me.  I do have it in the keyboard dock most of the time.  I don't need it to go 3 days with out charging.  I am confident that if I had a super long flight or something that if I turned off the unnecessary items (wifi, gps, bluetooth, etc) and adjusted the screen brightness I can get between 12-15 hours out of the tab with dock and probably about 10 hours tab alone.  For my personal needs it's more than enough.WifiNo problems with wifi.  two seconds to find and connect to my home network.  My work network is hidden.  I just punched in the info and away I was.  I have not done speed tests yet but I will with the second unit.  I have fios so it should be interesting.UPDATE:  No problems at all.  Good range, stays connected.  Fast downloads.  Just used the speedtest dot net app and I red lined download at 20284 kbps and upload at 18317 kbps.UPDATE EXPANDABILITY:  Yet another area where this tablet absolutely murders the IPAD.  On the tab alone I ordered (have not received) a 32GB micro SD card.  For the keyboard dock I have already slammed in a 64 GB SD card and I can equal that in USB flash drive at a reasonable price.  But I have an 80 GB ipod that has a busted something or other and I get no sound.  Kind of useless to me...or is it?  Yup, reformatted and plugged in via USB port...HELLO EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE!  Also had a spare 80GB macbook drive that I reformatted and it read it no problems.  So let's do some math.  32GB internal+32 Micro SD+64 GB SD Card in dock+80 GB external drive=208 GB.  Suck it IPAD, suck it.Final thoughtsThis tablet is filled with potential and I really really hope it's just a defective unit.  Android has come along ways and ICS is great.  Still has it's bugs, but I think it'll give iOS a run for it's money sooner rather than later.  Don't be cheap, by the keyboard, it's really handy and good build.  Easy to type on (and I type pretty fast).  I'll hopefully be changing my rating to 5 stars with the second unit.  Any questions or tests you would like comments on just leave a comment.  I'll get to them when I get my new tablet in hopefully the very near future.  By the way, exchanging on amazon is painless.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Until Asus works out several bugs, there are better tablet choices", "Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R2NGT7PK0T2EVP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Tablet!", "Author": "threeofsix", "ReviewID": "R1QPSHVIRKGAKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my tablet for about a week now, and can say I'm very pleased with the device! I was happy to find that it has nearly the same specs as the Prime, but is priced at $100 cheaper. Personally, I've found the screen brightness to be just fine and the speed to be very impressive. I do wish there was flash on the back-side camera, but I don't expect to be using my tablet as a camera very heavily.Other users have had complaints about \"light bleeding\". I haven't found this an issue at all on mine, and I'm usually one to notice these things. After watching a video of someone showing this light bleeding, I took the tablet into a dark room to look for it and it does show up...if you really look for it. Now this has been a more serious problem for some users, but I haven't had any problems here. On the other hand, I have noticed that the colors don't seem to be quite as vibrant as on my PC or my Evo 4G, although this isn't a very significant difference. The picture is very crisp, and I don't have any complaints here.I'd also like to comment on the speaker quality. I was very, very impressed. Honestly, I think this thing has better speaker quality than my laptop, and can go to higher volumes. On the other hand, however, the speakers are placed both on the right side, removing any stereo separation. Really, it's hard to tell whether there are two speakers or just one amazing speaker. Either way, I still found the quality very impressive.Although it is slightly heavier and thicker than the Prime, it certainly doesn't feel like a bulky device by any means. Even at thicker than the Prime, it's still only 9.9mm thick (thinner than the Evo 4G at a *massive* 13mm thick!). And, the weight is still less than the Acer tablets.I tested the microphone with Skype, and it seems to work well. Of course it's not anything like a headset microphone, but as far as built in microphones go this does the job. I haven't tested video calls yet, but the pictures I've taken with the front facing camera look as good as any other device I've used.The plastic finish is very solid. Now this is my first tablet, and I haven't played with the aluminum tablets to compare with. But, most laptop and phone cases are plastic and this case is just as sturdy as any other, so I see no reason to have anything different here.For game players out there, you'll be really pleased with the gaming performance of the tablet. I've installed probably 3 dozen games and have been quite impressed with the performance. In fact, I can't play 3D games on my Evo 4G anymore because I've come to realize how terrible its framerate is. Unfortunately, Tegra 3 optimized games are new and still a bit buggy, but they're getting better every day. If you're looking to show off the gaming performance, I'd recommend Riptide GP or Dark Meadow.The battery strength has been decent. It lasts about one day through heavy use (reading/writing emails, gaming, watching videos, web browsing, and downloading).Overall, the TF300 has some strong pros, and a few (relatively insignificant in my opinion) cons.Pros:- Very fast, the 1.2GHz Tegra 3 handles everything without issue.- Ice Cream Sandwich runs very quickly and smoothly- The speakers are ridiculously good- The picture is crisp- Expandable microSD card slot, plus a microHDMI out and Bluetooth- Strong and consistent WiFi and GPS reception- Still light and sleek, even if not as much so as the PrimeCons:- No flash on back camera- Screen colors aren't as vibrant- The speakers are close together, removing stereo separation- Tablet and/or Tegra 3 optimized apps are still relatively new", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Pad TF300. Good hardware, shady software.", "Author": "Ronnie \"Ronnie\"", "ReviewID": "R151KD3FYAZH8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Transformer TF300 disappointed me a bit. It wasn't the hardware but the software that was disappointing. The TF300 does indeed have great specs and its benchmark performance is high. Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently. My tablet suffers from random unresponsiveness and lag when browsing the web,  running certain apps or multitasking. I get the option to close the browser/app or wait for it to respond. Usually, right after selecting the \"wait\" option, it becomes responsive again. Using a different browser to at least remedy the web experience only makes it worse. Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly. A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem. These issues are unacceptable for a next gen tablet with such good specs. However, the tablet is still new in the market and I expect Asus to patch these issues in the near future.I'm very pleased with the TF300's hardware and construction. Yes. You're going to get a plastic shell. This isn't Asus' Prime series and it's not an iPad. This is the Asus Transformer TF300 and sacrifices had to be made in order for the company to sell it at a lower price than it's competitors. Fortunately for the buyer, the TF300 doesn't sacrifice too much to keep its low price tag. If you compare it to its more expensive predecessors, it actually gains in some areas.In conclusion, the TF300's performance is held back by it's poor implementation of software. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by software updates. I'll be keeping my TF300 because I'm hopeful that these issues will be patched and, once they are, I'll be one very happy consumer.P.S. Would you like to see your problems fixed? We can ALL help get these and other issues fixed faster by letting ASUS know. Contact them via their webpage and tell them what's wrong. The process is very easy and they do listen. I did it:)UPDATE (5/14/12)I received a reply from ASUS concerning my tablet's issues.  They recommended a factory reset followed by a cold boot.  I did as they recommended and the tablet did in fact become more stable.  Occasionally,  I'll still get an unresponsive browser.  This mostly happens if I try to scroll the page before it fully loads so it doesn't bother me. Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.  This is no big deal as the games only need to be patched up.  There is,  however, one persistent issue that drives me mad.  Sometimes,  for no apparent reason, the browser will close by it self. I'll make sure to follow up with ASUS about this.Update (5/24/12)ASUS released an update for the TF300 on May 10th 2012. First of all, I would like to mention that this firmware update fixes the FLICKER issue that some of us have experienced. Since the update, I've also noticed a better web experience. However, I still suspect that the WiFi receiver is kinda weak. Also, it could still use some more tweaking. You can look over the fixes provided by the firmware on ASUS website. If your tablet didn't update automatically (mine didn't) do so manually under Settings/About Tablet/System Firmware Update. I'm raising the rating from three stars to four stars because of the current fixes and ASUS' quick response to consumer complaints.

I bought the Transformer Prime and would have loved it, but the Wi-Fi issues were as bad as everyone says. It is a shame, because other than that, it was a great looking tablet and I loved everything else about it. I returned the Prime for an iPad 3 and was really not happy with it at all. I had the 1st gen iPad and loved it because it was it was new and different. The New iPad felt like the same exact product with a crisper screen. A week after buying the New iPad I heard of this being released and returned the iPad immediately. I ordered this off Amazon and had to wait a week for it to ship due to grouping it with other items that were not in stock. Best decision I could have made. This tablet is really fantastic.The TF Pad 300 is basically the same as the Prime, but the Wi-Fi works. I don't care about the camera not having a flash, that is what my camera and Galaxy Nexus are for. There is the occasional hiccup while browsing, but I have found that using the task manager widget that comes preinstalled by Asus resolves this issue every time. I also have widgets on every screen that are updating constantly (weather, email, Facebook, twitter, G+, etc.) I am sure this is the cause. I have tested this by removing all widgets and just placing app icons on the screen (like the iPad) and the performance improved greatly. However, I love the customization with the widgets, so I just run the task killer occasionally to fix it.I also bought the keyboard dock. I have used it a bit with the keyboard dock and it works very well. I do not see myself using the keyboard a lot, but I like having it if I want to type a lengthy email or document.  Also is great for long trips due to increased battery life. I will write a separate review for the dock.Also, if you do buy this, or any Android tablet for that matter, be sure to download Tablified Market from the Play store. It finds apps in the Play store that are created specifically for Android tablets. Trust me there are a lot more than you think there are. I do not know why Google has not implemented a tablet apps section in the Play store yet; it might really help their sales of Android tablets.Also, playing NES and PlayStation ROMs is awesome. These are bit trickier to install on a tablet than a phone, but you can do it easily with ASTRO manager from the Play store.Pros:Great looking screenCustomizationPolaris OfficeUSB ports (Dock only)Micros SD slot (Up to 32 gig)Keyboard dock (Sold separately)Useful widgetsTegrazone (Games are fantastic)Ease of setupPriceCons:No flash on camera (If you care about that sort of thing, I don't)Placement of power button (Top left)Semi-Con:BLOATWARE - There are quite a bit of preinstalled apps and widgets on this table. However, I am not adding as a con, because frankly, most of them have turned out to be very useful. Also, most of them can be removed. You definitely want to keep the following BLOATWARE MyCloud (8 free gigs of storage, MyLibrary and MyNet, Polaris Office, Nvidia Tegrazone.)I hope this helps those of you that are on the fence.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problems, but nice overall", "Author": "Steve H.", "ReviewID": "R6RC73K6ALXW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay.  I had a Nexus 7...bumped it into the toilet...DOA.  After tasting Android 4.1 on a tablet and loving it (that tablet was great, btw), I decided to go with ASUS again (despite horrible customer service once) and get this because it also has Android 4.1 (you'll have to upgrade using your wi-fi when you open it up, it comes with 4.0.3 on it.  The upgrade took it to 4.1.1...UPDATE:  Now updated to 4.2.2 in the US).The tablet is pretty nice and comes with some nice additions, most notably, a well integrated version of Splashtop Remote 2.0 which controls my PC perfectly!.  The screen is beautiful.  The machine runs things pretty well...once they get going.  Clicking on the clock takes you to all of the quick settings I would want.  Brilliant little interface tweak there.  (This interface tweak is now optional with the new Android 4.2 update...it now has two drop down bars on the top of the screen...stock Android 4.2...it gives you the option to keep the 4.1 interface if you prefer).Here's the issue:  LAG!  This thing gets laggy and misses touch presses too much.  It really detracts from the experience (but it also registers when your hand is close, even when you don't touch it).  You might be happier with the Nexus instead which was really smooth without a single issue.  Maybe the lag is noticeable because I switched from the Nexus 7?  Who knows.  (UPDATE:  I can now say that, with the Android 4.2 update, I no longer worry about the lag.  This baby screams.)I did a bunch of research and it's a common problem complained about online.  I found a solution that seemed to help a bit:  Completely factory wipe the machine 3 times and start over.  That seemed to clear up the laggy nature of this machine...UNTIL...I installed Swiftkey X Tablet on it.  Then the lag came back.  Now, I've used Swiftkey on three other phones AND the Nexus 7, and had no problems with it.  The stock keyboard on this tablet is TERRIBLE.  Can't decide if I want to stay with this tablet or not because I LOVE Swiftkey and HATE the on-screen display on this machine.  *UPDATE*:  No longer applicable with subsequent software upgrades.As for ASUS, they make rock solid PC parts, so I was thinking this would rock.  A little disappointing.  Do yourself a favor and get something a little nicer or save money and get a Nexus 7.  BTW...I called ASUS twice about my damaged Nexus 7 and, of the two calls, one guy was great, the other was a complete pain in the rear...antogonistic, belittling, and didn't want to do the work.  He demanded a serial number for my Nexus before he could \"help\" me, when I read it to him, he replied, \"that's not a serial number\" and refused to help me.  Told me to go back to the store I bought it from.  I called Google and they verified the serial number and called ASUS with me on the line.  That call had great, helpful service.  I wish I knew who was the pain.  I couldn't catch his name because the line was so scratchy (on every call to ASUS!).  If you need service, this is something to be wary of.UPDATE:  After my last wipe and reinstall of everything.  The lag has not been noticeable.  It's running pretty smoothly.  Not exactly the most user-friendly thing to do out of the box.  Interestingly, after the factory wipe and reset, the set-up screens changed from the ASUS setup to the stock Android set-up.  Very odd.  Overall, I am now happy with this purchase and am upgrading the review from 3 to 4 stars.By the way, something to consider:  The keyboards are hard to find in red (I got a red tablet) and, when you do find them, they cost $20 more than white or blue.  Do yourself a favor and get this in white or blue.  I'm going to get a white keyboard to go with the red tablet.  Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.  It works really well and thumb drives pop right up, just like in Windows, when you pop one in.  Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!  Be warned that you will have to use only chargers exclusively designed for this tablet.  Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).  This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.  Just a helpful tip for those that may have or buy one of these.***UPDATE*** 3/4/2013:  Just installed the Android 4.2 update to this thing and it rocks!

This tablet has a faster processor, better camera, and more RAM.  Does an iPad run a little smoother yes but keep in mind that Apple is extremely strict about the apps and software that they allow on their tablet and they make sure it is all optimized.  If it doesn't run well on their tablet, guess what they don't publish it.  In comparison Google does not monitor every app to make sure it optimizes their software and tablets.

After several returns of the new Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 I got the TF300 and love it. Ive only had it about a week and already there has been 2 updates to the firmware. This is a nice change from other companies delaying updates. I also have an Asus laptop that I am writing this review on and I love it also.

Suspect software updates from ASUS will only improve performance.HW Features:When hinged with the dock, the audio cable is plugged into the top of the tablet. This is not ideal considering the tablet is top heavy and prone to upset. The audio cable does not help.  Would like to have an 3.5mm audio output at the bottom of the tablet or on the optional dock. This is really a dock complaint. But at $380-$400, who can complain?MicroSD is great for loading Gigabytes of Movies and Music.Get the Dock for the full-size USB connector..great for USB memory sticks.I don't like the charging connector. ASUS should have used USB, at both ends, for charging.Software:Firmware update was happening just minutes after connecting to my WIFI. Bundled ASUS software is nice, not annoying like many packaged applications. ASUS cloud app, file manager and dock/tab battery widget are great. Stock launcher is okay, I recommend APEX or NOVA. The TF300 is stable. No random restarts.

This is once a day with different applications. I will not remove a star for this. This is android, not IOS.Build Quality:The plastic back is solid and not slippery. The TF300 is a solidly-built device. Glass and metal are not the answer to build quality. It feels great. Dock will protect the screen when not in use.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R20QUXHFFUL4B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is only an initial report, as I've only had the TF300 for about 4 days.  At first I was concerned, as when I took it out and started it up for the first time, it hung at the language choice screen.  Bummer.  But being someone who uses computers often and is aware of their quirks and issues, I simply turned it off, and then back on again.  The second time's the charm!  Booted perfectly, did a firmware update, and I was off.  Entered my email address and it downloaded all the apps I have on my phone automatically.  A little weird and creepy, and I certainly didn't want ALL those apps on my tab, but okay.Then I started using it, and can now safely say that I'm falling in love with the little guy.  It's very smooth and quite fast in general.  Never having used the Prime, I don't really know what I'm missing; and though I'm sure it's faster and has a brighter display, etc... this one's cheaper!It doesn't have a metal housing, but truth be told I think the plastic looks quite nice.  It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.  I can't imagine any issue with the brightness unless I was outside in direct sunlight.  Not a concern, at least for me.I dinged the TF300 a star because of the start up issues, and occasionally an app stops responding properly.  Whether this is a fault of the machine or the apps themselves, I cannot say.  It hasn't bothered me much, as I simply restart apps when they hang and they work just fine.  Only a few apps I've found exhibit the behavior, like the Netflix app for instance.Other than these minor glitches, the tab is great.  The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.  Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.  I've only watched a couple of HD videos, but everything's pretty smooth.  Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.  It does exactly what I want it to do, and quickly, with only a couple of very minor issues so far.  I have ordered the TF300 dock, and will add to the review once I've used them together.***Update***So I've been using the TF300 with the dock for a couple of weeks now.  The tablet itself has continued to function as was stated previously, meaning it is for the most part a great joy to use.  There is still sometimes lag with browsing and certain apps stop responding very occasionally, but as I've previously stated, this is not so different from any Android phone I've ever used, so it's not all that surprising.  Android (especially for tablets) is still really in its infancy and thus I expect a certain level of random behavior, which often is related more to the apps themselves than even the OS, which on its own functions pretty well.As to the dock, it's quite simply wonderful.  It adds so much to the functionality and ease of use of the device that it simply cannot be overstated.  Even just the additional battery life is a thing of beauty alone, as I now always run the device in performance mode (which helps to cut down on lagginess), and still get good battery life.  I own a 12\" laptop, and this thing is a dwarf in comparison.  It folds up perfectly, fits in a very small space, and is extremely easy to tote around.  The keyboard is very responsive, the mouse trackpad works great (though sometimes it takes it a moment to pop up when it comes back from sleep), there are lots of helpful hotkeys, etc, etc.  It's awesome.A couple of things to be aware of though:People with large hands beware.  Though you should be aware of this before you buy such a device, take care to remember that this is not a full-sized keyboard and people with large hands may have trouble using it.  That said, I wear size large gloves, and while it did take a small period of adjustment, I'm now almost as quick typing on it as I am on my laptop.  One of the tiny shift keys does give me some grief from time to time, but it's really to be expected.Also it's convenient the trackpad has an on/off button, because when you're typing, you will inevitably run your palm across the pad and create all kinds of annoying issues at random times.  This to me was not really a surprise, since I knew how small the keyboard would be, but it's something to be realized before purchasing.  But just turn it off when you're in full on typing mode and you'll be fine.So, a few weeks out with my TF300, now with the dock, and I'm loving it.  It's one of the most handy devices for media consumption I've ever used.  The wifi is very strong, and the thing is really a joy to use in general.  I do wish there were a more full-featured office program, as even the one I paid for-- Office Suite Pro-- still leaves a lot to be desired.  It's not much better than Polaris, which comes with the TF300.  *sigh* So I'll simply wait for updates.  Certainly not a fault of the tablet itself.Overall really a wonderful buy and a great product, especially with the dock.

So I quickly bought an expensive screen protector since I was sure I would keep it. But as soon as I restored my account and opened gmail (white background) I noticed a gradient in the \"yellowness\" or warmth of the screen from top to bottom! I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me. So that one goes back too! And I don't think I would get another one from Asus.

I have looked at the Transformer Prime/Transformer (and the Infinty 700), Acer Iconia 510, Toshiba AT305 and the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  Each and every tablet has its pros and cons.  I have found that the Asus 300 was the one for me.  I was impressed with the colors on this device as my initial thoughts they were washed out but when you look at it in a store will bright lights that can happen.  Movies played crystal clear and without issues.  Music also played well  I did download Riptide GP as I wanted to see how the Tegra 3 graphics and I was impressed.  Asus could have done a better job with speakers but they sounds fine.  I will end up using my headphones anyway if I am listening to music or videos.  The camera took nice pictures but I didn't get the tablet for that reason.  I have seen people complaining about no led flash, come on we have our wonderful smart phones or digital cameras for that.  Can you imagine people taking there tablets to Disney and taking pics with that?  I did however have a brief display issue where I did see bars on the lower left side but that only happened once.  I have seen reviews complaining about this on another forum but it appears to be a software issue which I know Asus will fix or else Amazon will get alot of returns.  If this should happen again and not get fixed before my 30 day return window I will return it.ProsNo light bleeding as I have seen in the Toshiba AT305My external drive connected flawlessly and able to read all files.  Copied a 5 gig files in several minutes.Wireless works very well.Plays MP4 files greatThanks to the docking station you don't have to hold the tablet for a long time as I have heard with some people it can get tiresome.  Also works great to protect the unit.Browsing worked well but I have seen it \"hang up\" Not an issue for me.ConsSpeaker placement could have been better but not a show stopper.Browser pauses sometimes but I believe this to be an android issue.Overall I love the unit. for the fact that you have a docking keyboard with battery as this is one of the main selling points for me.  I will update further if I have any issues.Why I didn't chose other tablets:From a Toshiba review on Amazon\"Toshiba tech support from my limited experience with them is awful. I called about transferring files via the supplied cable and they were no help.I also had an issue using the USB host functionality trying to use an external hard drive and found via their tech support it will only support drives formatted to exFAT, FAT or FAT32. DOES NOT support drives formatted to NTFS.\"I find that very interesting considering all my drives are NTFS and I don't have a spare to format to exFATI also eliminated the Toshiba due to high cost of 529.00 for a 32gb tablet.  In fact I ordered this first but in good conscience however I cancelled it.  For that price you can get they Asus 300 with the keyboard as I did.Eliminated the Iconia A510, nice battery life however it does get very warm and $50.00 more than the Asus.Eliminated the Tab 2, nice unit but it was going a step back to dual core and also the Asus was the same price for Tegra 3 Quad and 32bg memory.Eliminated the Prime due to wireless issues and the Transformer due to pricing of $30.00 more you can got the Asus 300.Eliminated the Asus Infinity 700...who knows when the US release will be and also how expensive it will be.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asu TF300 If your in the market:  Buy It.", "Author": "Desert Hiker", "ReviewID": "R1AS9UMQ7PA1SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a mail order item direct from Amazon.  Delivery was faster than either of us expected.  But even better is the Asus TF300.  I was concerned about the comments in some of the reviews regarding the display and display brightness! Man, what a waste of energy, this tablet is perfect. I have owned both the Toshiba Thrive and the Acer Iconia A500.  The TF300 beats them hands down.  I like the thinness of the unit, the low weight, the incredible bright crisp display, Ice Cream Sandwich already loaded, and the feel of the unit.  Touch response is fast and accurate.  I was planning to upgrade to the TF700 when it became available, but not anymore.  This one is a keeper and the price was right.  It took less than an hour to set it up including an \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" upgrade and a few other downloads.  Be sure and check out the TF300 if you are in the market for a tablet.

For example, I'd totally forgotten I'd enabled MAC Address Filtering on my wireless router, so couldn't connect the ASUS at first until I wised up. Duh. I also struggled a little with the new environment of Android 4 as I'd only ever used Android 2.0 before, although a within an hour or two I'd got up to speed with it and now it's second nature. The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted. I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts. I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated. I've already found that I no longer use my PC as much as I can do pretty much everything I need to on the ASUS. The slight tweaks ASUS has made to the vanilla system are fine, although it would appear users are locked into using the ASUS file manager which may be off-putting for some. I can't say I'm that bothered though, their File Manager works and does what I need.Many people have commented on the screen quality being a little dull compared to more expensive alternatives. I don't find this a problem at all. The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it. I doubt I'll ever need to use the tablet outside in bright sunlight, so I have no complaints other than the fact that there are two odd several inch horizontal smudges on the screen. When the screen is totally polished I cannot see them, but finger print oily deposits adhere to them differently than the rest of the screen and they soon become visible again, but only when the unit is switched off. As I can't see these marks when the unit is switched on, I'll live with it. The screen doesn't appear to be scratched or physically damaged; the texture is totally smooth, so I'm perplexed as to what these marks are.The unit comes with minimal documentation so users might want to go to ASUS's website and download the full comprehensive manual in PDF format. This manual offers further assistance with the ASUS unit itself but also includes a useful Android user guide for those who aren't familiar with this operating system. I certainly learned a few things and found it useful.Overall, I'm overjoyed with the unit. It's amazingly powerful and very well priced for the features it has. I absolutely love it and am very happy with my choice. I toyed between several alternatives for a week or so, (i.e. the new Samsung Galaxy, the Acer Iconia among others), until plumping for this ASUS and I'm glad I did.EDIT: July 27th 2012Unfortunately, my unit's screen totally broke on July 16th. A crack appeared during normal use. I had never mistreated or dropped the tablet. I suspect the screen was warped or weakened in some way after the device was put under duress in shipping due to the daft way Amazon packed it with the screen under pressure by the outer box with the device itself mounted right at the top of the inner (ASUS) box, (it was pushed upwards under duress due to air-pocket packagaing in a too small box.)Any other boxes that were sat on top of my delivery during transit would have transferred a good deal of their weight directly onto my screen due to the way the tablet box is constructed and the way this box was packed into an Amazon outer box. Amazon were sympathetic but wouldn't help due to my being outside the first 30 days so they gave me ASUS's details to deal with directly. ASUS replied to my email promptly but stated that my warranty didn't cover physical damage. (At this point I was kicking myself for not reporting the unit DOA immediately upon delivery.) Reading other comments from other users that suffered the same fate I saw that this would likely cost $200+ to have the item repaired through ASUS. Thankfully, I also bought a Squaretrade warranty for my unit at the time of my tablet purchase so I contacted them and they are currently processing a full refund for me after receiving my unit and stating that a repair is not possible.If I buy a replacement tablet, I'll be sure to buy a tablet with Gorilla Glass such as the ASUS TF700 Infinity or perhaps something by another manufacturer. I've learned my lesson though by buying something that appears too good to be true. I paid for the omission of Gorilla Glass. It's a real shame as I truly adored this tablet! When it worked it was wonderful but too many corners have been cut in the manufacture to meet the sub-$400 price point.I feel I must mark down my 5 star review to an \"average\" review, but take no pleasure in doing so. The TF300 was an incredible piece of kit when it worked, but my confidence in the materials and construction is gone now. I'm still tempted to buy another, but the TF700 with its Gorilla Glass inspires more confidence. At $500 minimum though, I really don't think I can justify that so may wait a few months and see what units appear on the market.UPDATE: August 30th 2012I missed having a tablet more than I anticipated so I decided to buy an ASUS Infinity TF700 and received it on August 7th. The TF700 is fantastic and well worth the $100 extra over the TF300 in my opinion. The new IPS+ high resolution screen is superb, the faster processor is welcome, the TF700 feels better constructed overall than the TF300, (partly due to being primarily made of metal), and having a built in flash for the rear camera is a nice extra too. However, the main reason I chose the TF700 over another TF300 was its inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass. As my TF300 screen cracked during normal use and was never dropped or mishandled, I was wary of the same thing happening again, (despite my suspicion that the glass in my original TF300 was faulty from the start as the screen did dip slightly and have permanent marks on it right out of the box from new. I should have returned it immediately, but didn't as the marks were invisible when the unit was switched on and it worked fine. I probably would have returned it but for the fact I had a Squaretrade warranty that I knew would sort me out should the fault have got worse. I was probably just unlucky to receive a damaged item, but it still turned me off a little from buying another TF300 a little.)However, after having used the TF700 regularly for a few weeks now I am still overjoyed by my decision to spend the extra for the TF700 and am glad I didn't wait any longer.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good choice of tablet", "Author": "Jesse Phillips", "ReviewID": "RP3RHAT1B3RF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this tablet. I have not had problems with the hardware as other have described (light bleed). Nor have I found some of the other complaints to be an issue. Performance is great, even the auto light sensor is usable (power saving mode actually causes it to take a lower setting, though I can't say it is always perfect). Pretty much everything else is as expected and stated elsewhere, it doesn't feel like a tank so I wouldn't want to drop it, but the build is just what I'd expect. Since there are some many reviews on the hardware I'll go over to the Android/Software side. This is a Google product, I do not know what it is like to use this without a Google account \"attached\" to the device.One thing that takes getting use to is not closing applications. Things are just left running, though usually this means the app is stopped and won't do anything until becoming the active app. While many times you can switch from one application working on something to another, there are still times when an app will cancel what it was doing when being backgrounded.Android 4 uses the MTP and PTP so plugging the device into the computer will not provide you with a standard USB media device. This was chosen so that there was not a separate app drive from the system drive, and maybe more.I love the customization Asus did with the notification area. It gives quick access to a clock, power controls (wifi, bluetooth, gps), screen brightness, and performance settings.While Asus gives 8GB of webstorage, Google has turned their docs service into Drive and provide 5GB of webstorage. So good for all of us. The splashtop software is also very nice for those running Windows, it will forward your Windows desktop to the tablet and on a local network it is very usable. I don't have any comment on @vibe or Kindle or Netflix. I can say that Google actually provides two navigation software. Maps provides the ability but it isn't spoken directions, while Navigation is more of what is found for a GPS device. And if listening to Google Music (probably others) it will turn it down to make its statement.I would like to mention that text input comes in many forms and can downloaded if you want a different keyboard. One text input that comes with Android is \"Google voice typing.\" Just be warned, dictating long messages isn't easier than typing. One thing I haven't figured out, the Asus keyboard has swype functionality, but not always (and it is actually a good keyboard).I do think that there is a slight security risk with this thing. I recommend using a screen lock that requires some code, even the basic kind. On top of that I've found it way too easy for purchases to be made, so I use AppLocker (comes pre-installed) to lock the Play Store, nothing complex, just to give that extra step. You can go into AppLocker and disable it if you're going to do a lot of switching. I do not like that AppLocker takes up a permanent spot in my notification area.Some other tips.

However, after several weeks of usage I did notice a few things that made me wish for better design.First I do get a little lag every now and then, even a little freezing of apps.  I'm trying to ignore this hopping it'll fix itself.  It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.  My main gripe about this pad is that it is PLASTIC arghh#$%@!.  Why is this my big problem?  Becase when you lift open the pad from the closed \"laptop\" position I notice I sometimes pull away the plastic edge near the camera.  Also at the base of the charge port is the same issue with the skinny piece of thin plastic covering.  I'm noticing this almost on all edges.  This continues to be an issue with my excellent Poetic case (Poetic HardBack Protective Case for Asus Transformer TF300 Black With HandStrap with Built-in Folding Cover - Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)(Has Open Slot for Charger Port)(Speaker Hole is Completely Opened) (Intergrated HandStrap)), because the pad's cheap plastic covering keeps getting ripped appart along the edges.  Now i have to be extra carefull.I Just wish this TF300 pad had a nice solid metal body like the Prime and others.  Asus, why can't we have our cake and eat it too.  Why can't Asus produce a nice sturdy Pad like the Prime without it's inherent issues with the metal body?By the sound of this review you'll think I'll give this pad a 2-star or something, but I still love it but wish it was constructed better like the Prime minus the inherent issues I can't live with.  But for a 32GB at $399 shipped (no tax payed, free shipping, from new egg)it's a no brainer.  Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the \"Netbook-Like\" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support", "Author": "Mihir", "ReviewID": "R2MAANKSMTS0C4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TF300 ReviewI got my tf300 on May 17th have used it for about 6 days now. In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet. If you are an android user and enjoy the freedom of android then you will definitely enjoy this tablet, but if you rely heavily on iTunes and the easiness of backing up and syncing, and the simplicity of iOS then this tablet might not be for you, more specifically android.Physical Aspect  - The plastic back body does not feel cheap even though many have complained about it. The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy. Some have said that the plastic does bend inward which is true but it is not significant enough for it to be a real concern. You will not notice the plastic bending unless you actually look it. In the end I know that the back was made plastic to increase Wi-Fi/GPS reception which now works fine.- The only major problem I had for the tablet build was the fact that they decided not to use gorilla glass and went with hardened glass instead. The glass they used does not feel slick when sliding my finger across it like in the iPad 3. Also it is a fingerprint magnet which can get annoying. Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.- Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode. When listening to audio/video in landscape mode it feels awkward because my right ear gets a higher volume than my left, but it isn't that big of a problem when in portrait mode. Although I won't complain too much about it because the speaker is better than that of the prime and is very clear even at the highest level.Display Quality- video quality seems fine,  I watched a lot of YouTube trailers in HD and even watched Sherlock Holmes games of shadows in 720p and Avatar in 1080p and so far video quality seems fine to me and the tablet did not even hiccup. I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.- I know a lot of people complained that Asus did not put in a Super IPS+ display with 600nits of brightness in this tablet but the fact is that this tablet's 350nits is plenty. Not to mention that in my house I only use about 10%, yes 10%, brightness and the 600nits is only for outside use and will take a toll on your battery. I have actually used this tablet in sunlight, but in order to see clearly the sun must be at an angle, the screen at max brightness, and the background preferably in white or light color.Operating System (Ice Cream Sandwich)- This is my first android device and all I can say is Wow, kudos to Google. I know many people have said that Android is confusing or too hard to use, but I got the hang of it within a couple of hours and there really isn't that big of a learning curve as people say there is.- in the reviews I actually saw that quite a few people got lemons and when I ordered mine I had my fingers crossed and hoped for a good working tablet. Luckily my tablet was and is still okay. Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down. A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing. To those that do have crashes and reboots I would suggest upgrading the firmware or trading it in for another one and definitely give the tf300 another chance.- I have also read in the reviews that many people have had the wait/close message many times while browsing and my case is no different, I would suggest using another browser like dolphin which is a lot more stable and less likely to crash, my dolphin has yet to crash. Also if the wait/close message does pop up just press wait and it will start working again immediately, to avoid wait/close error just be a bit more patient and let the page load completely.- The OS itself is very stable and responsive with a few glitches here and there. If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.- The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like. This is not a digital camera replacement but I know that if I ever needed a camera that this tablet can take decent enough pictures for me.- the webcam is also okay,  does not work too well in low light conditions but is good in adequate light levelsProcessor (tegra 3)- I'm so glad that Asus went with a quad core processor this to me increases the longevity of the tablet and the dual core processors in other tablets would have only lasted so long. I recently heard that Microsoft and NVidia were working together to make an Arm based Windows 8 running on Tegra 3 which they actually debuted and it worked perfectly, just goes to show you that the Tegra 3 is a quite powerful processor and it will last for years, sooner or later developers will start taking advantage of the 4 cores.- Apple claims that the A5X is more powerful graphics wise and is 4 times better than the Tegra 3, now that is true the A5X is 4 times faster, but once the iPad's retina display turns on the A5X has to use up more resources to power that and only leaves enough power as the Tegra 3, also with screen turned on. So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same. If you want to see the benchmarks in detail then here is the link ([...]). In terms of raw CPU output not graphics, the Tegra 3 obviously is better with its 4 cores.Tf300 vs iPad 3- When people compare Android tablets vs. the iPad I think they should only focus on the software not the hardware.- To be honest the iPad does not give you any hardware features that it should, the tf300 has micro-hdmi, micro-sd, and you can buy an usb kit for the transformer to attach ntfs hard drives or keyboards and mice.- The only thing the iPad has better than the tf300 is the app store in my personal opinion, don't get me wrong the iPad is an awesome device and they only problem I had was for $499 they still only give 16gb which was not enough for meICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) vs iOS- So a thing about iOS is the closed environment of apple. Unless you jailbreak the device and void the warranty you cannot customize the iPad with widgets or better security features. It also lacks true multi-tasking. Another problem is app to app integration. For example, I have a word file in my Dropbox account which I want to edit. In the iPad I can't edit it, but in Android I can click on it and have the option to open it in Polaris Office and edit it and save in to the tablet. And if I wanted to upload it back into Dropbox.- The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive. I can freely add and remove media files without having to go through an application like iTunes, although to be fair I actually like the easiness and organization iTunes has and wish Android had a free and better program like iTunes. The only problem with iTunes is its lack of many different video formats which is annoying, Android has a awesome array of format it supports without the need to convert which I love.- I won't keep going into detail about why I like android better but wicked4u2c on YouTube has made a 5 part mini-series about why android is better using ICS and the iPad. Although to play fair he did say he preferred the iPad as the better tablet, but once again that was based on the mainly the lack of true tablet applications for android tablets.Wicked4U2C channel -  ([...])Part 1 - [...]Part 2 - [...]Part 3 - [...]Part 4 - [...]Part 5 - [...]Bonus - [...]TF300 vs iPad - [...]Feel free to comment and ask me questions below all opinions welcomed.UPDATE:So apparently I can't display links so you guys would have to find the articles on your own.For the CPU benchmarks: Google keywords,-Redmond pie, a5x, tegra 3,For Wicked4u2c: YouTube channel called wicked4u2cThe ICS vs IOS videos called \"Android vs IOS the truth\" - that's part of the nameFor tf300 vs iPad YouTube search both tablet names and look for the video made by wicked4u2c.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Quite 5 Stars", "Author": "Blu-dog \"Peace like a river\"", "ReviewID": "R39NE784YGIHIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well it's been a week since I got this tablet and overall I'm happy with it, but not completely satisfied.

Never without it. So far two occurrences keep me worried about this issue. Hopefully a new firmware update will get this fixed, but in order to happen we have to let asus know about this, is not enough to go to forum as xda developers and post our issues and concerns there, we have to report this type of incident directly with Asus.Wake up issue when dock attached: it doesn't wake up the unit if you use the touchpad or the mouse buttons, finally I realized the tab key on the dock does the trick as long as option called \"mobileDock battery saving mode\" is disabled. however once I did this my dock drained out in 3 hours in sleeping mode. I got this fixed simply installing the app \"juicy defender plus\"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds. but tf300t touch controls remain responsive.Overall I'm happy with my unit, my expertise level as a system administrator (IT director) allow me to get around these issues quickly, but I cannot imagine an end user dealing with these annoyances. Must be frustrating for them. hopefully Asus will get those issues fixed in time, eventually.Shame on Asus for such poor quality control in their tablets line up. this is a 2nd generation tegra 3 product, they had plenty of time to learn from their mistakes w/ tf201(prime). It's unbelievable how a company release a product in such poor working state. my tf101 was RMA twice, my tf101 dock once and those were bought brand new. my tf201 preorder was never delivered, got charge twice and waited for 45 days with no success, apparently wasn't asus fault, despite the fact \"worst buy\" directly blamed Asus for short supply.

Reason: the software for all tablet devices is too unrefined at this time to support such tasks.The machine is well suited for reading and sending emails, reviewing documents and photographs, doing Internet tasks, making on-line purchases, video communication, etc.  I do not play video games and can not comment on same.I am writing these comments on my tf300 equipped with the docking station (keyboard), 32GB memory card , carrying case (all purchased at Amazon last week for $752). Add $6 for a better email program (Kaitan Mail) and a spell-checker (ABC Spell Checker).Hardware - no complaints. My machine is rugged enough - nothing flimsy. The docking station firmly latches onto the tablet and provides a solid work platform. When folded together, the dock and tablet protect each other. Excellent keyboard.  Keys have a good touch.  The special keys on the top row are well thought out.  I spent $13 on a neoprene case, which pulls over the unit like a well-fitted sock.Wi-Fi reception is greater than 300 linear feet. I sat on a chair across the street from my house watching a T-Ball Game two hours ago and had 100% linkage with my Fios router. And, the first floor walls of my house are 18 inch thick solid granite rock, which acted as a barrier between the machine amd the router.With 64 GB of storage, I have more than enough space for everything. I archive my photos, documents and financial data in a 750 GM Western Digital Remote Hard Drive. I hooked that drive up to the machine's USB port on the dock and transferred about 2 GB of photos to my memory card in about 2 minutes.The batteries in the tablet and the dock will give you at least 9 hours of heavy use without a re-charge.In summary, I feel that the hardware is solid.The limitations for the device are software based.First, you MUST spend the six dollars to get a decent email program and spell checker.  Now, my personal computing days started in 1980.  Back then, the spell checker 5-1/4 inch diskette for my Syntrex Computer cost $600.00.  Every upgrade was $600.  The word processing program was $600.  So was the spreadsheet program.  I write this because I spent from 1980 through about 2000 living through the hell of terrible software.  The hardware was always more sophisticated than the software.  30 years ago, you had no choice - either a $12,000 primative Syntrex computer with 5-1/4 inch diskettes - one for data and the other for the program you were using.  Or, an IBM Selectric Typewriter retrofitted with a card reader - one card for each page of text.I have spent about 36 hours with the Asus Transformer tf300.  I am more than just plain satisfied with it.  The machine has plenty of horsepower.  What is sorely needed is better software.I have experienced zero breakdowns - either hardware or software.  The machine came equipped with the Android 4.03 operating system.  I have found it to be reliably stable.  But, this is not Windows XP, which I run on my other machines.The first thing that I did was connect the tablet to the dock and plug the dock into a wall outlet.  Only after I got the green light (the change from orange - charging  - - to green - charged) did I attempt to do anything.  I read too many comments written by folks who did not charge their machine fully and experienced problems.The next thing I did was download all of the software updates.  Then, I installed the same password to unlock this machine that I have will all of my other computers.Email - forget the generic email shipped with the machine.  It has no spell-checker.  And, you have to delete the garbage in your \"trash\" folder one item at a time.  Spend $5 and buy Kaiten Mail.  You must spend one more Dollar to get ABC Spell Checker.  You write text of your emails in ABC and then press the send button to ship the email via Kaiten and your email server.Because of software limitations, the machine is inefficient.  Ok, you can read everything without a problem.  But, go ahead and try to write something.  Cutting and pasting text - for me - almost impossible.  Creating macros - for the expressions you use all the time - your name - address, etc - forget it.  I have searched for such programs - they are too primitive.Yesterday, I took the machine to a 9 hour seminar.  I was able to retrieve and read all things important to me on the Internet and collect and read my email.  The keyboard is excellent - again - the hardware is excellent on this machine.I feel like I am reliving the 1980s of the computing world.  This machine could replace my notebook after many major improvements in software.  I am biased towards Google.  I don't own the stock, but rely heavily on Google's programs, such as its Chrome Browser and Picasa.  The better software will come.If you want the convenience of a small computer to handle the basics of your computing needs, then this machine offers you excellent value.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor technical support", "Author": "Lucio Da Silva", "ReviewID": "R3VUEML49YHJ6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am an IT professional and use the tablet mostly for professional purposes.I purchased this product about 10 month ago and about 3 month ago the screen started flickering.I contacted ASUS and sent the tablet for technical support.

I researched Android tablets heavily for the last 9 months and was even skeptical about the TF300 at first. I had read some having screen issues but they were clearly software related and Asus fixed them. I had read other complaints but decided to take a chance on Asus after reading more good reviews than bad.I'll first say that I almost bought the Transformer Prime when it came out but after reading about the flawed design with the metal backing blocking the GPS and Wi-Fi I decided it wasn't worth it. ASUS has fixed that problem with this tablet! Don't be scared away by the blue plastic back. It is NOT cheap and doesn't feel weak like some people have said in these reviews on Amazon and other sites. The tablet feels like a solid build all over. I think internal function and performance is more important than an external piece. I don't know why many desire this aluminum backing. Who cares?! This tablet delivers on it's promise with the hardware!I fired it up, plugged in my Google account and it synced everything I wanted it too and the few things I didn't want to that weren't necessary. FIRST IMPORTANT thing to know about owning an Android phone and then getting and Android Tablet. DO NOT EXPECT ALL OF YOU'RE ANDROID APPS ON YOU'RE PHONE TO WORK ON YOU'RE TABLET! This is where many people are disappointed wrongly. Good news is the tablet will not download all of your apps from you're phone when you launch the Google Play Store for the first time. If it does for some reason, just manually stop it. Then go down through the list and only download apps that you know are optimized already for the tablet. When you click on an app it will even tell you that it is not optimized for the tablet so it helps you out! Then browse through the Google Play Store and look for the section that has \"Staff Picks for Tablets\". Those are guaranteed apps for tablets. Most other apps are already optimized but you'll usually find out when you first start an app if it was made for tablets or not. If not, just uninstall, don't complain and blame Asus or Android. Blame the developer.Performance:I was really glad that ASUS put the Tegra 3 1.2Ghz Quad-Core CPU in this! And boy does it fly! I have seen VERY LITTLE lag and that was while only in \"Balanced mode\" and if you put it in \"Performance mode\" then you will see no lag at all! Google Maps and Earth run so fast and smooth it's an amazing experience! The NVIDIA Graphics in this is a great pair with the CPU because together they give you zero lag gaming and graphics display. Download Riptide GP, it's a paid app but it's worth the money to showcase the power of this tablet! Running Live wallpapers and doing other intensive tasks doesn't even begin to slow down this tablet!Screen:Many people have said they are disappointed with the display because it's only 1280x800 and only has 350 nits of brightness and it's not as good as the Transformer Primes 600 nits and Super IPS+ but they have the same resolution so I don't know what the big deal is. This screen is amazing! Don't let the bad reviews fool you! At the highest brightness it is uncomfortable to look at for more than a few minutes! Ideally 50% brightness is the better setting but I keep mine down around 30-40% on the brightness fader even when I'm at home or work and it's fine! Colors are crisp, everything displays great so trust that the screen is fine with the 'super' in front if the IPS. :)Camera's, Mobile Dock, etc.The 8MP camera is not that bad. The pictures are of decent quality. But who really is going to use it a lot on a tablet? That's mostly reserved for your smartphone nowadays. And anyone taking photography seriously will buy a real DSLR camera. You don't buy a tablet for it's camera, it's just kind of a convenience. The 8MP on my Samsung Galaxy S2 is much better than this 8MP but that's okay because I know that for this price point the camera sensor quality wasn't a huge priority probably. The front camera (and back) is good though for video chat like Skype. That's probably the most valuable role the cameras will play.The mobile dock is worth it! I know it's an extra $130+ but it's a huge part of the whole package that ASUS designed. I really like it and when it's docked you get extra battery life and full keyboard functionality. I know there's a track pad but I still find myself using the touchscreen even when docked. I find I can execute commands faster than using the track pad.I really like Android 4.0. This is my first experience with 4.0 and I like it. It's kind of a learning curve a little coming from the phone version of Android, of which I'm running 2.3 on my Samsung. It's nice having 5 homescreens on the tablet. Live wallpapers look and work like a dream on this! Thanks again to that Tegra 3 CPU! Navigating the app drawer, the settings and other menus are a blast. Everything flows smoothly and works as it should. I haven't found any flaws in the OS so far. The only thing I could say is that sometimes web browsing can lag but that is all depending on which browser you are using! I have found that the best Browser so far is Dolphin Browser HD. 2nd best would be Chrome Beta, then the stock browser, then Firefox. I haven't experienced any other problems with apps. Just be sure it's optimized for you're tablet and you'll be fine!In closing, I got the 32GB version, with the Mobile Dock, and added a 32GB Micro SD Card that I purchased for only $30 from another online vendor because they're prices and selection were better. (Sorry Amazon!) So for around $550 you get what would cost over $700 for an iPad 3!

I really like this tablet, the feel, the interface, the operating system.  ASUS has nailed this one. Is this the IPad beater?  Maybe, but it doesn't have to beat it to be a good tablet.  Admittedly I'm an not an Apple fan but I have played with a few and I do like how the IPad feels in my hands.  I'm just not a fan of the interface, kinda clunky and dated.  Now the TF300, it feels great in my hands, the texture on the back makes holding it very easy in either landscape or portrait.  To me the interface is modern, intuitive, slick.  I have an Android phone and I'm sure that's why I feel comfortable in the interface.  I like how the various screens appear to rotate from one to the other.  The transition is smooth and attractive.  Google has done a nice job with  Ice Cream Sandwich, I hope to get it on my phone someday.  I guess any review comes down to just  two questions.  Am I glad I purchased this?  Yes, I am very glad I bought the TF300, it does everything I want and looks good doing it.  Would I recommend this tablet to friends and family?  Most definitely, if they want an Android tablet then this is one to get.  Look no further, this is the one you want.

All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches. The iPad is a solid performer in the hardware and software aspect but is made for people that like to be told what to do and not do with their devices... Apple has a sick way of doing that and they always leave you wanting more when you know they could have provided all those things they intentionally left out so next year they can introduce it in their new iPad and have you go crazy for the new little feature that your old iPad should have included for the premium you paid.Then comes a solid company like Asus and comes up with a brilliant idea of making \"Transformer\" tablets, no tablet is perfect and Asus is no exception but the TF300 is everything I want a tablet to be with some room for improvement but not so much you'll cry about it because other have it and you dont. ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer. The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is \"optional\" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10\" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life. I use mine with a wireless USB mouse and it feels solid and reacts just as good as a good high performance notebook while performing many different task including watching HD movies. The combination of a touch screen and a \"real\" keyboard and mouse is a very awesome experience.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it does have it's minor software glitches and the screen could have been better but all the pros overcome the cons very quickly and I would not change it for anything else at the moment.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "iWhat??", "Author": "Hobbes", "ReviewID": "RA6LJKS8TN2OA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the iPad2 and the Asus TF300T.

I have to say that I couldn't be happier with this tablet's performance. Specifically:Operating System: 4.5/5Android Ice Cream Sandwich runs beautifully on this device. I may have an app close on me once every 2 or 3 days. I know apps crash significantly less often on iOS, but you also have to deal with iTunes which I personally find sluggish and heavy. Homescreen and app drawer transitions are very snappy, I never experience any lag. You can fully customize your homescreen with useful widgets like Gmail and weather that automatically updates you without having to open any applications. I always liked Android more than iOS, and it's because of the customization availableSpeed: 5/5This tablet runs applications and videos for me without missing a beat. I've tested it with several Youtube videos, as well as in-browser Amazon Instant Video streaming and I don't experience any lag, even just on balanced mode. I've also run multiple apps at the same time, often switching back and forth between a couple of games and Google Chat, and the processor handles it perfectly. I've had no problems with internet browsing being slow, but I did immediately download Dolphin Browser for Android, so that may have something to do with it. Web pages load almost as fast as they do on my computer. I have no complaints about the speed of the tablet.Sound: 4/5There is one speaker towards the right of the device (when holding in landscape) that is slightly awkwardly placed. However, the sound quality is still much better than adequate. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality when using it to watch shows on Amazon Instant Video. You can hear clearly words and music.Portability: 5/5The tablet is not heavy, I can hold it in one hand for a long enough time to do what I need to do, and holding it with two hands (while browsing or reading PDF documents for example) is very easy and feels natural. It's a light device that is easy to carry around, and feels sturdy enough so that I don't have to worry too much about damaging it as long as I'm just somewhat careful (it's not like you're going to purposely smash it on the floor or even let it be in a situation like that). The battery life is great as well, I often go 10 hours before needing to charge the tablet, maybe 8 and a half hours for heavy use.Feel: 5/5There are some complaints about the plastic back, but I have absolutely none. I love the feel of holding the tablet, the plastic back feels sturdy to me, and it is pleasant to the touch when holding the device. Also, because of the plastic back, I always get excellent Wi-fi reception, and GPS signal is very strong for me. It found me in less than 30 seconds the first time I tried using it, and it updated my position in real-time in a satellite view while in a car.Display: 5/5*The display is very bright for indoor use and more than meets my needs. I have only noticed light bleed on the bright black boot-up screen of the device, but if I had never seen the device boot up, I wouldn't have known that there was any. I can never tell when I'm playing games, browsing the web, or reading documents. It's bright and displays colors wonderfully, I have no qualms from the display.*-the device is difficult to use in direct sunlight. This isn't affecting my score for it because I don't need it or use it in direct sunlight, but you should know if that's what you want to use it for, you should get the Asus Transformer Prime or wait for the Infinity TF700 for a better screen that's made to be viewed in direct sunlight.Overall: 5/5I love just about everything about this tablet, and would recommend it to any of my friends and family. For the price of $400 dollars for this tablet with 32gb of storage, you're getting a light sleek tablet with a quad-core processor and excellent battery life.

At first, I thought it was awesome.  It performed as I hoped it would and exceeded some of my expectations.  However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.  Then matters got worse.One day, I noticed it wasn't charging.  There was nothing wrong with the dock, or the charging cable.  I know this because my wife has the same tablet and I tried using her charging cable.  My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.  Similarly, both chargers could fully charge our keyboard docks as well.Eventually, the battery in my tablet had completely drained and would not charge or turn on.At this point I knew it was already too late to pursue a return with Amazon, so I contacted ASUS support to request a repair.  It quickly became apparent that ASUS doesn't care about their customers at all.  They generated an RMA and sent detailed instructions on how to ship the tablet to their repair facility in Texas.  I was told that once it was received at the repair facility I would get a notice within 24 hours and that the repair would take no longer than 5 days. I was also told I would be able to track the repair status online.  I got tracking confirmation that the tablet had been received, but I was not notified by the service center as expected.  When I tried to use their online utility to track my RMA, the website returned an error saying \"THE RMA YOU HAVE ENTERED DOES NOT EXIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM\"Needless to say, I got a little panicked.  so I called ASUS support by phone.  They told me it was at the repair facility but had not been received.  I asked them if they understood the definition of \"received\"  It was explained to me that they don't consider the repair as received until it is picked up by the repair technician who begins the repair.  over the next few days, they would not take my calls, nor would they respond to any requests for status on my repair.  and about another week later, my tablet showed up on my doorstep.  Apparently they did manage to charge the battery, they completely wiped the operating system, and sent it back to me.Since it seemed to be working, I started downloading and re-installing my apps within a few days it once again stopped charging and eventually shut off again.At this point I'm fuming mad. Clearly they sent my tablet back un-repaired.  Continued contact with their customer service indicates that they WILL NOT EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.  They will however generate another RMA and continue the process of sending it back for service, where in my opinion, they have already shown their ineptitude.

I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.  With the exception of one application, this is a fantastic device to bring while traveling, and for most things more useful than a laptop.  Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.  Reading and commenting on technical documents - I treat dropbox as a briefcase, and put work documents there for a trip.  I can comment on them with a pen, and can send them to others by email easily from the tablet.2. Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.  Adding notes is easy.  The one problem, which is kindle related, is that there are not folders to organize the many books I carry around with me - a whole library in a very small package.3. If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4. I have to do work on a linux server - very easy to ssh to servers at work, and run serious programs there.  Droidedit makes it easy to edit programs on the server.  With vnc one can run X-windows on a server.5.  One has all the word/spreadsheet programs needed.6.  I use latex for most documents - here the support is not great, but Droidedit has syntax highlighting and one can compile on a server or use scribtex.7.  Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.  When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.  One of the most fantastic features is with the keyboard one has 12 hours of battery life and holds the screen in a perfect position for watching movies.One can wait indefinitely for the perfect machine, but I have found that the ASUS TF300T is really a great tool, and at this price point it is definitely worth having in addition to a laptop.  My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well. I find that the one thing that makes this really worth having is the keyboard that allows me to do short trips with not laptop.  Without the keyboard, I would have to bring a laptop, in which case the tablet might get left behind because of weight.  I find that for short trips and meetings I always bring the tablet with keyboard.  A super useful device.  Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.  Using vnc is a bit of effort and so for my purposes 4 stars.

The battery drains faster than advertised even with light use, and sometimes even overnight with airplane mode on.4. When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5. The screen is inferior to both the Transformer Prime and the Apple Ipad 2 (its nearest Ipad competitor).6. My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7. It does not have gorilla glass like the Prime or whatever type of specialty glass Apple uses (both from Corning btw). Certainly a cost issue.8. The glass is a smudge and fingerprint magnet.Pros -1. The price is hard to beat for what you get.2. It's android.3. I like the build quality. Even though the back is plastic (to help with gps/wifi), it feels solid with little flex.4. Sleek design, slim and light.5. HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6. Even when it freezes up in an app the OS remains stable.7. Decent sound.8.

One of the tablets turned out to be defective (I guess there have been some issues with displays), so I started the process for replacing it on Amazon's website.  This was a Thursday evening at 8pm, so I figured it might be the following week before my kids would have their tablet back.  Amazon's customer support, in my opinion, is absolutely amazing.  They responded almost immediately (with what did appear to be a standard, \"We're so sorry...\" email), but that was followed up very quickly with another email, obviously personalized.  This one said that the new tablet had been shipped with Saturday delivery, at no additional cost.  Well, turns out they didn't have to do that, as UPS was out the very next day delivering the new tablet.  The return process of the defective tablet was equally simple.The tablet itself is great.  It's fast, the graphics engine is amazing, and I haven't noticed any light bleed around the edge of the screen, like I've seen other people discussing.  And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.  And since this tablet comes with an \"office suite\" already preinstalled, that's just one more perk.

This is my first tablet and I'm impressed with it for the price paid--$390.I've played with the Ipad and this, to me, is better. Maybe not on overall specs, but you can do so much more because of the Adobe Flash and the open operating system. It purrs along.I had a minor glitch connecting with Wifi though. Turns out, I input the wrong WEP key code and after I input the code, the tablet does not tell you if the code is correct or incorrect. It simply does not log on. Being my first tablet, I did not realize the code was wrong. A warning or prompt from the Wifi connector screen would be nice for novices. It took me a day to realize this until I tried the other code. But, since then, all has been great.Wifi is strong all over the house. There are a TON of apps. Don't be fooled into thinking there aren't a lot of apps for Android tablets. There are. And virtually every good one on the Ipad is available on Android tablets too.Music is great with a ton of apps. The speaker is a bit metallic sounding when cranked to its highest setting, but overall, it still sounds good enough and the volume is more than adequate.The screen is a magnet for fingerprints though and you will find yourself cleaning it off a lot. I clean mine constantly and am looking into buying a screen protector. I'm just waiting until I find one with good recommendations.The touchscreen is very responsive. No lag on mine at all. Its quick. The back camera is awesome with many different settings and fun things to do and try, including a panorama shot. Surprising because my high-end Kodak camera has that too.The front camera has less pixels and isn't as great, but is perfect for video calls and gets the job done.I definitely would recommended this tablet for the price. I think it is a solid deal at $390. It has so many great features and extras like free Cloud Storage and Polaris Office. I'm just now beginning to discover them.  Just an FYI, the Google Sky Map app is simply incredible!! I highly recommend downloading this free app.I hope this review helps others because I spent a few months debating and researching which tablet I wanted.

But this ones great. Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go. It's not just running ics 4.0 its running ics 4.0.3. The same version my galaxy nexus is running. Asus has just released a bootloader unlock tool. Which makes it as wide open to hacking as my nexus. Its also about as close to vanilla Android as it comes wth out being a nexus. Asus has just added some widgets and apps. They did change the task bar out with a custom one. But you can even switch back to the default one in the setting.  Now the reason I took a star away. I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port. I have the USB adapter but its not great. The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode. Its located on the top if your holding it in landscape mode. Which means you have to hold it at a weird angle if you don't use it in landscape. To make it worse most video chat apps seem to be made for portrait mode. It also has a bit of a problem surfing the net. It has a slight lag here and there. Setting flash to not load by default seems to help. But this lag is the least of my worries since Asus is pretty good at updating. And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.  But all and all I like it its a good price.

Based on reviews here, I'll start by stating what I have and have not experienced based on other's feedback.I have not experienced the screen flickering issue.I have not experienced the volume of force closes like most people.I have experienced issues with Google Play (Market) not responding.There is a little bleed at the bottom corners of the screen, but not as bad as others have stated.The back of my tablet has very little give, so maybe those who can bend it had ones with manufacturing defects?The screen does show finger prints/smudges after use, but what smartphone/table doesn't?  My fix for this was to put a matte finished screen protector on.  Reduces glare too.Yes, very little accessories for this guy, but cases will be coming out soon.  I pre-ordered the TF300 dual view rooCase from Amazon.  Really all you need is an extra charger, memory card, and the keyboard doc if that suits your needs.Here are my pros and cons:PROS:1.  Great value for the price.  Can't beat what you get for $390.  Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 doesn't have the same horse power as the TF300.2.  Screen is great from my perspective.  720p native screen, good resolution.  Didn't have issues with video or pictures and no color saturation.3.  Volume rocker and power buttons are in the right place with the right exposure and feedback when pressed.  You'd be surprised how many other tablets do a crappy job with wobbly buttons or buttons that are not exposed enough.4.  Battery life is superb.  With 2 hours of usage watching live tv, doing work email, calendar updates, downloading apps, and customizing the tablet, only 19% of the battery was used.  Screen brightness was set to roughly 40%.5.  It's fast.  If you want to compare how fast it really is in person, go to Best Buy and send 2 pictures from your smartphone via bluetooth to some other tablets.  Open the gallery and look how fast it renders your pictures for the first time.  Then repeat on the TF300.  I didn't find anything out there that really compared.  Picture/Video rendering is one of the most processor intensive tasks you can do on a tablet.6.  GPS WORKS AND PINPOINTS YOUR LOCATION QUICKLY.  A co-worker of mine tested in the car while we were driving and tethered to a Galaxy Nexus for data.  It took 28 seconds.CONS:1.  After booting up, it takes roughly a minute for everything to become fully responsive.  Pretty annoying.  I know this can be fixed in a software update.2.  Google Play app force closes and waits too much.  Should be fixed in a software update.3.  Stock Email widget doesn't work.  Says App is not installed when it is, it's part of the Android OS and the Email app works just fine.  Should be fixed in a software update.  Big issue for me.4.  Not much bloatware, but there are still a few apps like Zinio that I want to uninstall (not just disable).  Should have the option to do that without needing to root.Few other pointers:1.  CHARGE IT FIRST.  It doesn't need to charge a full 8 hours, but at least give it 3 hours before determining if it is dead.  Mine arrived with 13% battery life.2.  Before you do anything, turn on WiFi and download the latest firmware update.  It's available for a reason.All in all I really like this tablet.  I've been in the market to buy a tablet since November of last year and skipped out on the Prime.  I believe I made the right choice.  4 stars because of the stock email widget not working out of the box.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 even with the minor issues I've had.  Read other tablet reviews, you'd be amazed at how crappy other company's release software for their tablets.UPDATE: A new firmware update rolled out today May 18.  Fixes Google Play issues and overall performance of the tablet.  I am updating this review from the tablet.  Much smoother. Email widget is still broken so 4 stars still.UPDATE 2:  Factory reset fixed the email widget problem.  Thankfully I had Google backup turned on so everything restored quickly and effortlessly!

HDD > powered usb 3.0 hub > USB kit ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets > the tablet) and it played the movies from it as well. Tested AVI, MKV, M4V, WMV, MOV with no problems.*With the harddrive connected, I was able to connect a keyboard and mouse too!*The stylus which I already had, works as expected. Makes Draw Something a bit easier.*Battery life is better than I expected!!! WITH all the things I had hooked up to it, played about 4hours worth of movies and when all sudden done, not even half of the battery was drained!*Tegra 3; the graphics are amazing! But there is a lack of games that are any good. Id like to see a good ol RTS instead of some sort of castle defenders type game.*Sound quality is OK with the inboard speaker, but with headphones or audio output thru HDMI is NOT lacking at all!! the M4V bluray digital copy of Iron Man 2 was FANTASTIC on this device!*Security: It has the option to encrypt your data and have you enter a pincode when you boot up to decrypt the data. Also options when you lock the screen for pattern/pin/passcodeCons:*The Web Browser, yep, just like everyone else, and with every android device just about since 2.3, its a bit sluggish on here too. Its not enough to be a deal breaker for me, but it does get frustrating when it crashes.*Glare, the screen has a horrible glare when your outside or there is a light behind you. Does give it a nice sleek shine.*A few older apps crash, only because they haven't been written for ICS so that's not a deal breaker for me.*System slows down when multiple apps are using resources. IE AndFTP transferring files while Pandora, Facebook and a game are running. I suspect it has something to do with the I/O handling. Dunno if its hardware or software side tho. Not the greatest at multitasking but were past Windows 3.1 or Android 1.2 ;)*Lack of Accessories. I'm waiting around for a good hard case to put this thing in as I'm afraid to break it!

Ive read that this tablet does support a wide variety and a few, VERY few reports that the xbox 360 gamepad for windows DOES work on the Transformer series.ODB2 diagnostics and a full fledged in car setup.Anything else, just ask and I can test it out.As the writing of this, there is no support for Windows OS as the bootloader is locked. Microsoft is working on support for the Tegra 3 processor in Windows 8 and ASUS has unlocked bootloders for the past Transformers.

Was super excited and at first loved using it.After about a week, the touchscreen would occasionally freeze and require a reboot to get going again.  Annoying, especially on a brand new device, but not critical.  However, the touchscreen issue became more frequent.  Before long, a reboot wouldn't get it going again and I had to cold boot Android.  That did work, for a while.Three weeks in, the touchscreen froze completely and no amount of rebooting, cold booting, or even letting the battery drain and recharging it would get it going again.  What I didn't realize was it was already past the return-by date.  Yes, you only have TWO WEEKS to return a defective unit, after that it's send it for repair and hope for the best.  I must have missed this when they didn't include a copy of the warranty in the box and when the link to the warranty for my product in my region was broken on their website.I called Asus customer support and they gave me an address for a local repair center.  I was willing to try, so I went and they took it in.  The repair took twice as long as they said it would, but it was returned with a replaced main board in apparently working condition.  Kind of a major repair needed there on a three week old product, but okay.Got it home and noticed two weird things: 1, it was running some kind of diagnostic ROM (it had diagnostic apps on it and there was a red border flashing around the screen sometimes.  Looked in the settings under tablet info and it said the system was running something called open-english-epad-a-bunch-of-numbers-testkeys instead of Android 4.0).  The next day, the battery stopped charging when plugged in, and the day after that the frozen touch screen issue recurred.  Totally dead, unusable device.  Again.I wrote to the Asus customer loyalty email address describing exactly my customer experience and increasing lack of loyalty to this brand and received a phone call recommending I take it to a different repair center.  They were also going to call ahead and tell them I was coming over.I took it to repair center #2.  They were indeed expecting me, they took the tablet in and asked if they could do a factory reset.  I said sure, but asked that they make sure to reinstall Android 4.0 ICS and NOT update to Jelly Bean because I'm not sure I want it yet.  OK, no problem, they said.I waited half an hour and they reset it and said it was working now.  I looked at it and checked in the settings, finding they had updated it to Jelly Bean even though I'd asked them not to.  They told me it was ICS that caused the problem and to accept the update.  I said no, I would update it if and when I chose to, and it was not their decision.  Besides, why would ICS be causing the problem when thousands of TF300s are running ICS just fine, and this particular device failed while running ICS AND their weird diagnostic ROM?  They finally agreed to roll it back for me and took it back in, returning 15 minutes later to say it was going to take 5 hours to download and flash the original ROM back to the device and could I come back tomorrow.I returned the next day and was told that the touchscreen failed again before they could reinstall ICS.  So, not exactly the ICS software issue they thought it was, huh?  Now they were going to order a new touchscreen and install it.  Right about now is when even the most patient customer is looking for a replacement device.  By this time I was getting pretty skeptical about their ability to perform a successful repair, but I agreed again to let them try.  They thought they could get it done by the following day and they would call me.The following day they did not call me, so I called them.  The lady told me they had not replaced the touchscreen, that they still believed it was a software issue and that they wanted to send it away for extensive testing.  Essentially they had no idea what the problem was, they also had no idea when the unit might be returned to me.  I said no.  I was not going to accept this software theory. It was obviously a defective device with hardware problems.  I said please repair it correctly ASAP or give me a new unit.  I was TIRED of waiting to use my tablet and TIRED of this seemingly endless servicing.  She said she'd call me back tomorrow.Again they did not call me back, so I went in today and asked them what was going on.  Now they're back to replacing the touchscreen, supposedly today or tomorrow.  Who knows whether or not this one will work.  I've asked them repeatedly to replace the device, but apparently that window closed two weeks after I received it.  No exceptions.  I'm left feeling that, even if there are an additional hundred failed repairs, they will not stand behind their product and replace it.I have had this device now for two months.  It has worked correctly for about 10 days.People have said that we should rate the device, not experiences with duds etc.  But I feel this experience is important for people considering purchasing this product.  There's some pretty serious evidence on this site and others that suggest this tablet has unusually poor quality control and perhaps is made with unreliable parts.  Even still, the specs are good and those without hardware issues love their TF300s, so cool.  No big deal.  This might be a one-off.  I'd probably agree, but with a customer service department that has no problem putting people in repair limbo and will not, under any circumstances, replace a defective unit returned less than a month after purchase, are you willing to take the risk?  In my experience, setting fire to $400 would have been faster and less frustrating because I sure haven't received a device I can use yet.I recommend you don't buy a TF300.  If I had a re-do I'd buy a Samsung.  Possibly it might be smart to stay away from Asus altogether, I can't say for sure.  All I know is that I won't buy any of their products in the future.Good luck,DeePS:  If you already have one and it gets glitchy, return it ASAP and hope it's soon enough to get a replacement under their micro-warranty.  Also, hope the new one isn't sketchy, too.  If it failed after 14 days and you have to go the repair route, all I can say is good luck.UPDATE:The screen has been replaced and is now working (mostly) normally.  There's a bug here or there, like a minute ago when I was typing and long strings of \" P\"s were randomly being typed into the body of my text.  I'm just going to pray like crazy it's no big deal because I REALLY don't want to go through the glacial service process again.Should I ammend my review?  Add stars?  I really don't think so.  The time between purchasing this device and being able to use it was two and a half months.  That's a serious fail.  And, I paid full price for a new unit and the one I received is now refurbished with at least two major parts having been replaced in some dusty Chinese repair bay (not racist, I live in Shanghai).Poor quality control, barely adequate warranty, difficult service scheme, really poor customer experience.  My review stands.  They should have replaced the unit for me after the first failed repair.  I don't recommend you take your chances with this device.If I had a do-over I'd go with Samsung.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "I really really like it. Not love, but like.", "Author": "Keith LeDuc \"leduckut\"", "ReviewID": "R3CEAWBWWO4ZME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok. Here goes.First of all, I am going to do a comparison to the Toshiba Thrive because this is the only other tablet I have owned and have previous tablet experience with.Second, I have only played with the unit for one evening, several hours, but only one evening so far. But, that said, I feel I messed with it enough to dispell alot of other reviewers complaints about the unit.Do you realize that alot of you are just too darned picky for these electronic gadgets these days? You expect that they should all be just perfect and perform to maximum specifications, especially if you have to pay say over about $200 for a product, you expect it to be GOLD! Come on people.I have now experienced what most of you are complaining about concerning \"light bleed\" and I can't believe that some of you actually returned the unit just fot that alone. Again I say...come on people. To compare it with the Thrive, which had no light bleed to speak of, I only noticed it when the screen first came on and is at it's brightest but once the background loads and the rest of the icons, the screen is beautiful! I don't get why so many of you return  your units just because of this issue! As long as there is something being displayed on the screen, and I kept mine set about half the brightness in doors because really, it was too bright beyond that. I tried letting the auto brightness configure it but in my darker bedroom, it kept setting the screen too dark and I found it much more pleasant being able to set the brightness manually. Now, with that said, alot of you complained about the colors appearing washed out compared to other units. Huh? I compared the screen with my Thrive...noticed NO difference. One has to remember that if you crank up the bightness all the way, then it tends to brighten the colors to a point where thay may appear to be washed out. So, maybe most of you need to not be so critical and just deal with turning the brightness down a little. I have yet to try it outside in the bright sun but as I have mentioned in other reviews, ANY LCD/LED device these days that is trying to be viewed out in the sun is almost impossible. I have my smart phone set to auto brightness so that when it is in the sun, it brightens the screen all the way up so you can at least see it enough to tell what is going on. But, you are talking about a brightness that causes warmth to our skins and can cause fires in other areas of the world and can give a person 3rd degree burns. So, my question is, how in the world does anyone expect their electronic devices to be able to withstand offering enough brightness to beat out the power of our sun??? Again...too critical.So, enough on the issues of the display for now.When I plugged the unit into the charger which by the way, mine came with about 5 feet of cable, as most of you were complaining that it only came with a 2 foot cable, when 5 feet is about standard people, anyway...the tablet automatically came on, booted, and after entering various information on the screen, it went immediately into a system firmware update. I was happy about that being all the reviews I read on problems with earlier firmware. Then once I entered my Google information, it immediately downloaded and updated all my google apps from the Google Play Store. That was kind of cool except I don't necessarily like all of them but I guess I will manually uninstall the ones I don't use at a later time.As far as the re-booting and problems with apps running, I must have used to tablet for a good 6 hours just clicking on and playing verious apps and didn't have a problem with not a one! I even did some internet browsing with the standard browser and really didn't see a hitch or a glitch that most of you mentioned. The only other thing I wanted to mention is I found the charger seems to get awfly warm. I hope that isn't a future issue as well. So, maybe it's just my luck and I ended up with a good tablet and not a malfuntioning one or maybe, as the days and weeks go by and I have a chance to check it out more, then I will come back and update this review.As far as the person or people complaining about the speaker? WOW! I mean, I am disappointed that it, they, are only set on the right side and not split on both right and left sides of the unit. But, with that said, even as tablet sound or specially compared to my Thrive and my cell phone, I found the sound to be full and rich much like a full sized stereo speaker. I was shocked but amazed at the sound. Asus really excelled engineering the sound to come out like it does. On the Thrive where the two speakers are seperated at the bottom of the tablet and especailly if you rest it on your body like lying on your bed with it on your stomach, the sound gets muffled and distorted. It also is very tinty and very cell phone sounding. But not on this tablet! Very full sound for a tablet and I can't complain at all. As far as the person complaining about covering the speaker(s) with your right hand...well for one, don't hold it that way. For another, I found that if you are able to hold it in a way that you can cup your hand around the speaker, much like I do with my cell phone, the sound is trajected towards the front and you can get really good and louder sound that way. But with this tablet, it truly isn't necessary.I hope I don't end up with a tablet, as some of you mentioned, that ends up rebooting all the time and has apps that can't run after some time. That is the worry that almost kept me from purchasing it. I wished at times some of you more critical people wouldn't write reviews because your opinions aren't close to how the unit actually functions and other people can't get a good idea of what the possibilities of the unit may have beyond a LITTLE bit of \"light bleed\".I'm only annoyed a little bit by the lack of instruction manuals these products provide for the consumer these days. The only thing included in the box is the tablet, the charger and cable, a soft cloth for the screen, and two small pamphlets, one in english and one in other languages. And, for a tablet with no media drive, you can't load a CD with a PDF file inside to read. No, you have to find that on line and download it and then make sure the Adobe Reader is up to date.I will miss the idea of being able to pop off the back panel, as with the Thrive, and change the color or being able to replace the battery. Actually the cover on the Thrive was a little difficult to pull off but once you did, snapping it back on was pretty easy. The Thrive did also offer standard USB and HDMI ports but to connect it to a computer, it could only be read when connecting it to the mini USB port so I guess, unless connecting it to a USB drive, the full size USB isn't really necessary.Other than the things I mentioned above, I feel it's a good solid unit. People complain about it being made out of plastic instead of metal. Again....WAY too critical. I didn't feel it felt flimsy at all and it was easy to hold onto. What isn't made out of plastic these days??? Even an item that is made or coated to look like metal...ISN'T METAL! I actually tried to bend it as some of you said mentioned could be done and I felt you must have had a way too tight grip on it because it doesn't really slide out of your hands that easy. Again...do I need to say it? If you are holding it so hard that you are actually squeezing in the corners, as I felt it wasn't really that easy to do, then you have some big hands and need to loosen up a bit!And to the person that complained about it being a fingerprint magnet? CLEAN YOUR HANDS before use! Have any of you owned any touch screen devices before? You either need to use a touch pen or stylis to avoid fingerprinting it. I found that this tablet doesn't show the fingerprints any worse than touching the Thrive or my smartphone, and that is after extensive touching icons and extensive sliding and moving my finger around. Besides, it does come with a soft screen cloth. Take a minute and wipe it off. It's either that or get a screen protector that doesn't show the fingerprints as much. But, be careful with that because, as with the Thrive, the Toshiba branded screen protectors, when removing them leave an indefinite sticky film behind on the glass which is very difficult to clean off. I ended up bringing mine to my work where they used and soaked the screen in the product Goo Gone and I don't know what else to clean it off. After a few hours they brought it back to me like new. Needless to say, because of that experience, I WILL NOT be using a screen protector on this unit, as long as I can stand it.Other than those things, I say I would recommend this table to a friend. Go ahead and buy it and try it. You just might like it. (Provided you get a good working unit, that is!)UPDATE! I know this was already a long winded review but I just wanted to leave a short update.I have used to tablet for over a week now. Other than the issue with the original browser now crashing, even after a system firmware update, I still feel the tablet is awesome. I did download Google Chrome Beta which seems to work just fine. A note to ASUS, I don't feel it's right for the company to expect users to download another browser if they are having issues with the stock one crashing. They should be doing the right thing and researching a fix for this issue. For me, updating the firmware didn't work. I thought it was going to be stable but the browser still crashes. I haven't had any issues with other programs crashing, even ones I used on my Thrive, with the older Android system, 3.2 I think. Everything seems to be golden, except for the browser. I also don't feel I'm getting the full usage out of the battery as advertised. That is even with some days of not very much extensive use that the brightness on the screen set to auto to dim in low light situations. Which I feel the video hardware should work oposite that way....the screen, to me, should lighten in low light situations and darken in very bright lighting situations. But, as I stated above, you also need a very bright screen in the sunshine in order to see the screen. Who knows.

I used to use an ASUS netbook for school, and it was replaced by this tablet/dock combo.Performance: The tablet performs exceptionally well, and it hasn't really had a problem running any program I throw its way. Great for playing games, and all of the regular social networking stuff (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flipboard, etc). I also used it for school work, and never had a problem. I used open-office or Polaris to open PDFs, powerpoint slideshows, and word documents with no problems. I typed up reports and was even able to edit notes in powerpoints during classes and I never really missed anything. I've even used this thing for a few presentations and it has never let me down (Micro-HDMI port and those cables can be cheap if you know where to look!).The real benefit though, is the battery life. With the dock, this thing can be used for about 14-16 hours continuously without having to charge. This is, to me anyways, unheard of! I have NEVER had to take the charger out of my home when taking this thing around with me. Even if you forget to charge it the day before (or even 2 days), you can squeeze out a 3rd day of heavy usage at times and you wouldn't have a problem.Wifi is pretty good, and can sometimes pick up a signal as good or better than my phone (I've used iPhone 4s, GS3, GS4, HTC One S, Z10, etc). Speakers also work really well, and can be fairly loud. When I go on trips, my friends use this to play music and we're never left wanting more.Good but not great: The screen. Great resolution, clear and bright colours. BUT, when you take it outside (or it is in direct sunlight) it can be difficult to read. For indoor use, this isn't really an issue, but for the rare and odd time I'm outside and happen to want to use the tablet, it isn't quite as bright as I'd like it. Still usable, but maybe could be better. I'm sure for the higher model (Transformer Prime), this isn't an issue, so this isn't really a complain as much as a wishlist item / suggestion.After a year of constantly clicking in and out of the keyboard, I haven't noticed any signs of wear. Still clicks in cleanly, and removes just as fast. The switch mechanism is flawless, and I can't think of a better system. Even holding from the screen and dangling the keyboard, there is really no give; great job on the design there!Keyboard is pretty good for the size, and I've never had a problem with it. This may be because I've used 2 netbooks prior to owning this tablet, so your mileage may vary in this regard. I would recommend trying it first if you've never used a keyboard on a 10inch laptop, because I'm sure some people out there may not like it or find it usable. You can also disable the trackpad, which I do on a regular basis, because sometimes just reaching out and touching the screen is faster. That being said, the trackpad does support gestures for scrolling and what-not, so if you feel like keeping your screen finger-print free, that's a suitable alternative for you.One thing that deserves special mention, however, is ASUS constant support for this tablet. In the year that I've had it, this thing has received updates REGULARLY! Something that is unheard of in most of the Android community, but something that I would commend ASUS for. Whenever a new version of Android comes out for the new nexus device (Nexus 4, 7, whatever) it seems like only days later the update will come to this tablet. Absolutely phenomenal support from these guys, and I would not hesitate to buy more devices from them in the future. In fact, I will probably almost exclusively buy devices from them now, seeing as my 3 year old netbook is still being used everyday by my little sister and has yet to have an issue with! There are already about 900 reviews for this product on Amazon, but ASUS earned my support here so I have no trouble in recommending them to friends and family.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 10-inch tablet for one of the lowest price (ASUS TF300 vs. Nexus 7)", "Author": "D. Yanes \"ChowKaiDeng\"", "ReviewID": "R2LF1OYB9J6I0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is almost a 1 year later review. I've got one of this for my wife and a Nexus 7 (v.1) for myself. We both use Nexus 4 smartphones, so this house it's pretty much full of Android devices. Many of my comments will compare this tablet against my Nexus 7 since they are both very similar tablets: except for the screen (similar resolution but the Nexus 7 has more ppi density than the ASUS TF300), the both have the same RAM and similar CPU/GPU speed and performance.OVERALL DESIGNAlthough I prefer the Nexus 7 smaller form factor, the ASUS Transformer it's definitely better for watching videos. The speakers on the ASUS TF300 are WAY MUCH BETTER than the Nexus 7 and the screen size is really great for this kind of tasks.Screen is very responsive but I feel that the plastic/glass surface is placed too far away from the LCD screen, so the touchness is \"different\" from other tablets or smartphones that I regularly use. Of course, this is a very personal feeling and it doesn't interfere at all with the responsiveness of the screen.The body of the tablet is very comfortable (rounded corners and smooth lines) and has a very decent design. Materials are good and resistant and is very well assembled (the Nexus 7 is not assembled as well as this). The tablet itself is not too heavy.The surface on the back has a concentric circles pattern which is really cool for improving the grappling, but is not nearly as good as the back of the Nexus 7 that has a different kind of material which emulates the feeling effect of a driving glove. My wife hates the back of the ASUS TF300 (we all have our obsessive-compulsive disorders) because of the noise that their fingernails make against it, but nevertheless, if you are like us and buy your device along with a case (strongly suggested: for this tablet, we got the Poetic StrapBack Protective Case for Asus Transformer TF300 along with a MoKo Invisible Screen Protector Films for ASUS Transformer Pad TF300) you won't notice any of this since the case covers the back of the device.Buttons are well placed and very easy to press.Charger is small and cable is long enough (another improvement over the damn short cable of the Nexus 7) to use the tablet directly hooked to the wall socket.SPEED AND PERFORMANCEFor a tablet originally released on May 2012 (I'm writing this review on September 2013) its overall speed is very good but not the best on the market. I'm talking about 1 or 2 seconds (sometimes) while loading apps or half a second while switching apps. Maybe it's a software issue, because this ASUS TF300 is currently running Android 4.2.1 (still, one of the latest) while my Nexus 7 it's a little faster (just a little) and runs on the last 4.3.Just to make sure: this IS NOT A SLOW or crappy generic tablet. It's a very good one but is not the fastest you could get. Comparing the ASUS TF300 with My Nexus 7, I feel the same as comparing my Nexus 7 to my Nexus 4 (the Nexus 4 is faster than both tablets).Videos and typing tasks run smooth. No lags and it doesn't hang. We don't play too much games on our tablets, but they run smooth as well (even heavy 3D games).HDMI, CAMERAS AND MICRO-SDFor me, the three main features of the ASUS T300 over the Nexus 7 are the Micro HDMI port, a rear 8MP camera and the Micro SD slot. I can't talk about the Micro HDMI port and Micro SD slot because we haven't used them, but it's really great to know that you can get more of your tablet, like connecting it to a Video Beam for a lecture or presentation (or just to watch a movie on a bigger screen).We got the 32GB model, that is more than enough for most of the tasks that you'll want to do on a tablet (that's the reason we haven't tested the Micro SD yet). Compared to the Nexus 7 8GB, this is a major diference: I'm constantly out of disk space with my 8GB tablet and have to clean old files / unused apps constantly.The rear camera is the second major improvement over the Nexus 7 (v.1) that doesn't have a rear camera at all. Of course, this kind of devices are not made to use them as photo cameras, but you can certainly take pretty decent photos and record HD videos. The front camera in both devices are pretty much the same low quality and work mostly for videochats.BATTERY LIFEMy wife is not a heavy user as me with her tablet, but the ASUS TF300 definitely has a great battery life. She never runs out of battery while on the street, neither do I with my Nexus 7.ADDITIONSIf you type A LOT in your table and use it for work, you could get the ASUS Transformer Pad Mobile Dock TF300T which is phisycal keybord that can be attached to the tablet, converting it on a full Netbook (and extending the battery life as well). We didn't bought it (it's on our Wishlist), but the reviews are pretty good.OVERALL CONSThe first thing I really don't like about this tablet is its lack of a standard Mini USB port, both for charging and connectivity. All of our other gadgets use the same USB port, so it's very easy to exchange cables or even chargers, and if you are somewhere else and need to send a heavy file to a desktop PC, it's always more comfortable and fast to do it over a MiniUSB-to-USB cable that most people have on their desks, rather than WiFi. Of course, you can always carry your own cable and charger with you.The second thing that this tablet could have, it's a magentic sensor to turn off the screen while using protective cases. My Nexus 7 has this function and it's really great to be able to close the case cover that automatically turns off the screen. With the ASUS TF300 you have to manually switch the screen off (or wait until it goes off automatically after a few seconds).CONCLUSIONRight now, this tablet it's still a pretty good deal if you wan't the save some money. Compared to the Nexus 10 -which is somewhat  on the same price/specs range- the ASUS TF300 it's about 20% cheaper, and compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 it's still cheaper (and with better specs). I think ASUS made this tablet to last for at least a good 3 years.This tablet is really goodfor reading, browsing the web (always over WiFi, because IT DOESN'T HAVE A SIMCARD SLOT FOR 3G ACCESS), typing and watching videos. You won't be disapointed.If you are more towards the Nexus 7 idea, then you could save even more money. But, in this case, after 1 year of use and the lack of rear camera and limited disk space / no micro SD slot, I strongly suggest you to get the new Nexus 7 v.2 (FHD), which solves the camera and disk space problems of the Nexus 7 v.1. Just notice that if you are accustomed to 10-inch tablets, you may feel the Nexus 7 too small. Personally, I like it over any 10-inch tablet, precisely for it's easy to handle size and lightweight.Most important: anything yo do, just don't get one of those cheap generic tablets.

I am not experienced in technology or computers/tablets. But you must get this tablet if you are tired of sitting at the PC all the time and especially if you are like me and tired of looking at the tiny screen on your Blackberry (yes, I said Blackberry). I am anti-Apple after having read an article in Playboy about the company and their financial shadiness. This was previously compounded by my personal desire not to follow the herd and rumors of Jobs' trying to monopolize the ebook world.The only thing that I do not love about this tablet is that I have not figured out how to get the Adobe Flashplayer to work on it. (and yes, I don't want to use GOOGLE) Of course, I have not enlisted the help of any tech guru's on this matter, yet. So I am still holding out hope that it can be accomplished.I bought the matching keypad...LOVE. (Great screenshot button on it!) I also bought a matching case that seperates for the keypad detachment!! Of course i also purchased a wi-fi router for the home and a usb stick (TONS OF MEMORY! on the stick and tablet capability)I pretty much keep my tablet on the cord whether the keypad is on or off, so I can not speak of the battery life. But I am betting that it will do the time specified in specs.I have not seen any \"light spots\" on the screen. I do not even notice the fingerprints on the screen until the tablet is asleep or off. (It did come with a little wipe rag, which does the trick with a few swipes)The tablet was easy to connect my MSN and Hotmail accounts to. I also found it easy to set Bing  (blasphemer!! lol) as my internet search engine.  I have not figured out how to get rid of bookmarks that I don't use or care to, but that may just be my technical savy at work.The apps are constantly improving so there a few pesky updates, but they all download quickly. My co-worker gushes aobut how he can control his entertainment center for his home on an Android app so i bet that you could too!) I am not big into games but a few days after getting the tablet I was shooting zombies and feeding JAWS! But I still tend to go to socializing and other internet sites on the original pages instead of using the apps...Basically, BUY IT! You won't be sorry, I'm betting.  lol (oh and PS there is a previous reviewer named Micheal who seems to be very skilled at answering any questions you have :)  )***EDIT 12/23/2012***[...]*scroll down to FLASHPLAYER ARCHIVES FOR ANDOID 4.0* select the first link to 11.1 for ANDROID 4.0 (11.1.115.34)*downloadI believe this did the trick. I dont remember what i was trying to use the flashplayer on. but i believe it was a website with a video on the page. And that worked after i downloaded this player.:)On a side note, it took quite a while to figure out how to cut-n-paste the link here. *phew* That could be a bit easier. It is a combo of using the mousepad on the detachable keyboard and selecting copy or paste from the scree.  aaargh. But of course i am used to windows cut-n-pasting with the mouse. Just have to do it a few times to get used to it, probably. Also, note that my capitalization lacks a little...keyboard it a little hard to get used to after having mostly only used a full sized PC.

So it definitely has to be a hardware issue. Having not treated the tablet roughly and having had it in a case since I started using it I would have to say that I just got a ticking bomb that just went off.If I rest the tablet flat with my hand in the middle or on a table it seems to freak out. If I hold the bottom left corner (when horizontal) it seems to function fine. However I can't hold it like that for long as it isn't comfortable. Once I release that corner it freaks out. Faulty manufacturing has to be the issue here.Asus customer service (after jumping through a few hoops) can't guarantee the will fix or replace it for free so having to ship this device back to the US via FedEx with damage insurance and then paying shipping cost back seems like a big gamble. The money would likely be better spent buying a new a completely different table from a different manufacture in the near future.That said I cannot recommend this or any other Asus product to anyone, *especially* if they live outside of the United States. The review is left at two stars because I purchased two of these tablets. One for me and my girlfriend and her's seems to still be working fine for now.-------------------------------EDIT 26/2/2013: For the last week the tablet has suddenly decided to launch applications on it's own or even type random letters while I try to use the keyboard to send a message. It's not limited to any one application as it even tries to re-size videos while I am watching them through MX Player. Even after doing a factory restore with limited application icons on the screen it will now try to change the wallpaper, which is suppose to happen when you tap and hold on the home screen. Seeing as I am not doing this it just seems the tablet has started to freak out.On checking forums it seems many others have had this issue after use and also straight out of the box. My tablet has not been dropped or damaged in anyway recently, so there is no known cause for this other than possible hardware issues. It has had the latest firmware update for a while with no issues until now.Thankfully I have not had the cracking screen issues some warned me about, but with the tablet randomly acting up after just a few months of use I can't safely recommend that anyone buys this or any other Asus tablet until this issue can be resolved. Unfortunately in checking with Amazon's return policy I am only able to get a partial refund, which could be nothing much at all.-------------------------------OLD REVIEW:Everyone loves the new iPad(3), but not everyone can afford one. Also some people want to do more with their tablet than Apple allows. You know stuff like connect external devices, transfer files, watch various video formsts and add more storage space. If you fall under that category then the Asus Transformer TF300 is the tablet for you.The TF300 is the budget version of the Asus Transformer TF700, which is their premium tablet. However the most major changes are that the back is made of a very sturdy and ribbed plastic rather than metal and the screen is not as bright as the TF700. the TF700 is 600nits of brightness and the TF300 is 300nits. What this means is that it's difficult to use the TF300 outdoors or anywhere that there will be lots of glare. The screen resolution is also slightly lower on the TF300 at 1280 by 800, but it's no slouch buy any means. The screen quality is beautiful and you can easily use it indoors at half the brightness. However if you feel a strong need to use your tablet outdoors in the harsh daylight you will need to fork over an additional $100 for the TF700.Performance wise you honestly won't have to go any higher than the balanced setting if you are playing simple games, reading books, playing music and surfing the web. However you can switch over to high performance for graphic intense games and other apps but your battery life will take a hit, depending on what you are doing. There is an energy saving mode, which by default the tablet switches to when the battery power gets to around 15%. This option I wouldn't recommend as it can cause the screen to flicker various brightness levels while watching video. Some people have complained about this tablet flickering and honestly this likely is the reason why. Thankfully you can choose not to use that setting and also set the tablet to not go into that mode when the battery is low. Battery life seems to be more than enough to go two days before charging it with light use. Heavy users that game, watch videos use wfi, bluetooth, GPS and connect external devices (like hard drives) will be able to make it through the daylight hours before they need a charge if it's set to balanced power setting. Having not tested high performance I cannot honestly say how long it would last.Currently this tablet comes with the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS, but once you connect it to a Wifi network it will automatically download Jelly Bean. Thus far under Jelly Bean there have been far less issues with how the tablet performs and the OS is much more user friendly. That said the default web browser can crash and I've experienced this only once so far, but closing the browser app an resuming takes seconds to solve that issue. However I can't say if this is an OS issue, a buggy app or a  bad coding on the specific website. That said you will find that some sites will still default to mobile versions, which has nothing to do with the tablet and all to do with web developers mainly focusing on building pages for the iPad experience and not Android. Hopefully they will correct this in the near future.The build quality seems to be very good. It feels sturdy and the material used don't feel cheap. Even the plastic used on the rear of the device feels well crafted and not cheap. Plus the tablet will likely be put into a case for protection so any complaints abut the use of plastic rather than metal are trivial. Much like the folks who complained abut the iPhone 5 metal casing being easy to scratch. Protect you investment with a case and you will be fine.The 8 megapixel rear camera is a decent performer, but don't expect photos and videos to be as crisp as ones from a DSLR or a point and shoot. It's basically great for quick snapshots in fair lighting conditions. If it gets to dark or of there are very bright and dark areas that you are photographing you will see the camera's limitations. That said if you can get a hold of and HDR app you should see better results. There is no LED flash so low light photography is a no go. With the 10\" tablet form factor taking photos will seem a bit clunky. 7\" is more ideal, but as always a DSLR camera is what you use when you are more serious about getting that winning shot.With the USB attachment you can connect external drives directly to your tablet and transfer files back and forth without the need of a computer. The Android file directory makes it very easy to copy and paste and create new folders. Also if you are the kind of individual who loves to customize your device then the TF300 with it's vanilla Android OS will fit your requirements like a glove.So if you are in the market for a price friendly 10\" tablet that doesn't cut corners to get the price down, and delivers quality performance, then the Asus Transformer TF300 is the most ideal solution for you.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for the Buck!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2707SH3KZAYFI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd ordered an ACER 700 but returned it because of heat issues and the fact the HDMI port didn't work.  Seeing as this is a present for my dad, I needed another tablet quickly. I decided to order the Asus.

Quad cores are sweet especially for surfing the net.  Compared to the ACER, this is much quicker and snappier.Owning a Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Asus feels flimsy, you can twist the body on this thing quite easily.  Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.  Or in my case, I used the USB adapter to hook up a Logitech combo wireless mouse/keyboard adapter, works perfectly.If it weren't for what I consider flimsy construction (compared to other tablets I own) I'd gladly give this tablet 5 stars.

I have seen several reviewers stating that the tablet is good for a first time buyer, but that any buyer who \"knows\" will think that the TF300 is flimsy and cheaply built.I agree with these reviewers - while in general, I love my TF300, the thing feels pretty flimsy.  If you grip the thing in both hands, its WAY too easy to flex the entire tablet and make the LCD bleed light.  While I don't advocate for flexing the tablet just to see the light bleed, I'm not happy that its pretty easy to do.  Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.  However, with as flimsy as the TF300 feels, I don't feel like its a smart move to use this tablet without a good hardback case.Done with the bad.  Now for the good.I love this tablet!  The TF300 has great hardware.  While the screen is not super IPS and thus is a little bit hard to use in direct sunlight, the screen is more than bright enough for easy use in every other situation.  In fact, the screen is downright gorgeous.  I've compared my tablet directly to a coworker's iPad 3, and actually prefer the black contrast better on the TF300. The Tegra 3 processor is also very zippy - the only slowdowns I have had with the tablet have been internet connection speed related.  HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.  For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.  I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.  While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.  The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.  I upgraded from the preinstalled Polaris Office to Office Suite Pro when Amazon had it on sale a few weeks back and have been very happy with my ability to edit legal documents and e-mails on the go using the TF300.  I also love the fact that I can work the entire day using the TF300 without needing to be plugged in.In summary, the TF300 is a great little tablet and is an impressive multimedia tool.  Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.

I can only assume that Dilbert's company actually made such a piece of equipment without testing GPS.Anyway, this review is for the TF300. It's pretty much like the TF201, except that the CPU is slightly slower. If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference. It is a dual CPU computer (therefore providing 4 core). In case there is confusion between cores and CPU, it's like an i5. I don't think performance is an issue. It has always been very responsive.I have the 32GB version (don't know if there is less). So far I have not bought an additional micro-memory chip to put in it. There is room for 1. The only other connectors it has on the tablet are the proprietary power/keyboard connector, the micro-HDMI (which I have not tried yet) and the headset, which accepts and uses the model with integrated microphone (or without). Using netTalk, I have been able to make phone calls from the tablet, over wi-fi of course. I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that. If you don't want to use a headset, you can because it does have an internal mike. As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side. Even if there were 2, there is no way you could get stereo sound with speakers so close together, so one is enough.I decided to buy the matching keyboard for it, and now when I show friends my purchase they say \"Oh! You bought yourself a notebook.\", an then I take it apart and their eyes express surprise and they says \"It's a tablet! Oh wow.\" A friend of mine, pretty much sold on iStuff, said he wished he could have a keyboard that attached to his phone, because my keyboard also has its own battery, and as you use the tablet, it sacrifices itself in order to transfer all its power over to the tablet. The tablet itself has enough power to work decently all day, but with the extra provided by the keyboard, you pretty much cease to check how much you have left because you know you won't run out before you have a chance to recharge it. Charging is relatively fast. That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB. If would still be better than nothing if you didn't have the transformer with you. Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone. What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB. That is a flaw as far as I am concerned, because if the tablet screen times out and turns off, you lose USB power. The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth. I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port. I could have connected the tablet to the TV, and controlled it from my sofa. I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too. The keyboard also has room for a regular SD card.As for the software, ICS, I didn't notice much difference between it and Honeycomb I had tried about 2 years ago. That is not a reproach. I hate it when you get a new software update and you can't find how to do anything anymore. The major difference it has, which I didn't think it did not exist before, is that the tablet can be rotated 360 degrees. It will adjust the image in 4 different positions; portrait, portrait upside-down, landscape and landscape upside-down. (The upside-down is relative to the tablet of course, to the user it always looks right-side up.)That is pretty much it. Overall a purchase that should last me a few years. (Particularly since I also decided to buy the accident warranty for 3 years.)Addendum: The first thing I tried is the GPS. It works fine outside a building and inside a car (we have a mini-van so lots of metal around). Inside the house, it's picky, but then, I do know where I am anyway.I did some Wi-Fi speed tests too. I have a Fios home connection with 25/25MB promised and in general I get what has been promised. Here are some results (all numbers are in kilo bits per second):1) About 3 feet from the router: download - 16016, upload - 188742) In living room, one wall separating: download - 15509, upload - 183183) Other end of the house, 3 walls: download - 15779, upload - 183154) Far end of the back yard, one cement wall: download - 15516, upload - 193655) Outside the house, next to the garage door: download - 13206, upload - 174266) Outside, in front of the metal garage door: download - 1949, upload - 2693As you can see, Wi-Fi works. If you are in a commercial building with metal walls, it might not be very good. But for everything else, it is very acceptable. I had no issues with it, even in the back yard. (I can't explain why the upload is faster than the download, but it always is on all my devices.)Power cable is a decent length (about 6 feet). I could use the tablet connected to the power constantly while sitting on my sofa, because I ran an extension cord from the outlet to the coffee table. But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient. However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it. It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet. And since one end of the cable is a true USB connector (the end that goes in the transformer) you could buy a USB extension cable (male/female) if 6 feet is not enough for you, and you don't want to bring an electrical extension cord closer to you.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tablet for the price!", "Author": "Bertman5050", "ReviewID": "R2ATQAGSOXHF5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet on launch day and have waited to review it. The speed is fantastic! Tegra 3 is a beast when it comes to games. I have ran emulators on it and it seems to run anything I throw at it. The design is also great. Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back. Some people have been saying because its plastic, they have been getting a little bleed through on the screen. Only time I have ever seen that is when I intentionally push hard on the front or back. If you're handling this tablet as any normal person would, you'll never see any bleed through. Now, ICS and Tegra 3 are beautiful together. It is very smooth in all 3 of the Asus processor modes. The battery life is about average for a tablet. I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it. I do wish there was a deep sleep mode, so that when the screen is turned off it would shut the system down. But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off. It seemed a little buggy on launch day, but Asus has already released two updates which seems to have fixed all the minor issues.

I purchased a Transformer Prime from BestBuy, (the one with the nice spun aluminum back), and found many issues. This newer model Transformer TF300 may show the specs a bit less than the Prime but from point of view the TF300 does a lot better! Most notably, the GPS actually works!!! I guess since they made the back panel out of poly-carb, the signal isn't blocked. Very accurate and works great with Navi apps. The speaker port looks small but don't let that fool ya, it delivers a LOT of sound (louder than my iPad3), and I am very happy about that. The Wi-Fi is one of the most sensitive I've ever used, picks up signal I never knew were around me. I wish they included dual band 5GHz (802.11a). It is very thin and should be used with care. I recommend a nice protective case with built in screen cover like the Otter Box. Rear Cam is 8MP (no LED Flash like on Prime) and 2MP front Cam, both do a very nice job. My favorite feature is the Micro SDHC card slot. It accepts up to 32GB of additional storage space. Note: BestBuy sells a version on the TF300 that than ONLY has 16GB for same price as amazon. The one here (at amazon) comes with 32GB internal storage, a much better deal. Can't go wrong for the money!

I definitely recommend this tablet. Im an AutoCAD user and when I saw the AutoCAD WS APP i had to try it. This is where the quad core cpu and 1G of DDR3 ram show its power. There are some sample drawings that are full 3D renderings and you can use the touchscreen to rotate and zoom in and out and there is no hesitation.

I had to ask for a case number because they don't keep records of calls, and even with that, I had to keep repeating myself every time I called. Then it finally quit completely, and I had to pay $25.00 to send it back as per their specific instructions for packaging.They had it for 2 months. 2 MONTHS!! They told me I had to pay a little over $200.00 for a new motherboard and labor. The tech who emailed me with the price for repair, wouldn't respond when I tried to tell her that my tablet was still under warranty and I had a case number from when I called (she already had that info). Once they have your product, it's nearly impossible to obtain help by phone or to get help online. Anyone I reached, told me that they couldn't address the problem. Supervisors were always unavailable and I was put on a \"call back\" list. I was finally called back on the 3rd try by phone (no response to emails), but it still took several days for that supervisor to respond. He couldn't help either but gave me the info on how to contact (by email) someone who might be able to help. He said tech support was very backlogged. When I finally reached the customer service dept. for resolutions he referred me to at headquarters, they were told by tech support that I had to pay for repair because I attempted to do an encryption which was not covered by warranty. I replied that I only did as instructed by tech support on the phone and didn't even know what an encryption was, let alone attempt to do one on my own.Finally, they said that as a \"one time courtesy\" they would repair the epad at no charge. How generous of them!! After 2 months of nothing but problems with lack of response or help, and while the TF300t was still under warranty, they made it sound like they were doing me a big favor!ASUS is supposed to have a good reputation, but if you buy their product, hope that you never have to deal with tech support or customer service (or lack thereof). It is the worst I have ever encountered. I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.

I never write reviews unless I am blown away by either awesomeness or sheer uselessness of a product. I previously used a motorla xoom 32gb with the Ice Cream Sandwich os update so for the most part my review will be based against my impression of that tablet.  To be honest i truly loved the Xoom which is why i decided to upgraded heck if 2 cores are great 4 must be incredible.  In that assumption i have not been let down.  I bought the madden football game to play on the xoom but, unless i scaled the graphics back to low it was virtually unplayable due to lag times(tackled before i even say the computer coming at me.  As far as the display is concerned it is crisp, clear and the colors are beautiful.  I realize that some people feel that the new ipad and transformer prime (and upcoming infinity ) have better graphics but, to my way of thinking it is like trying to see the difference between 720p and 1080p on an HDTV.  I just dont see the reason behind paying 150 dollars or more for that.  The TF300 is so so much clearer and  brighter than my previous tablet as too leave me blown away.  When i was looking at a new tablet i had a few considerations in mind based on my experiences with the previous tablet.  Firstly i wanted something that would let me play all my games as they were meant to be.  I do a lot of flying and i have adhd so anything that can keep me amused for more than five minutes is a beautiful thing for both myself and the people stuck around me. I looked at the upcoming toshiba as well as the prime and this tablet. The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).  That really narrowed my choices down to the tf300 however my second issue was battery life.  Might not seem like an issue however, when flying from doha to chicago on planes without outlets 10 hours of video or game usage goes quicker than you might think.  Thus i was back to the toshiba and tf300 having already ruled out the prime.  toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.  The tf300 like all asus transformers has a keyboard accessory which has added the advertised 5 hours to my usage time. The keyboard also adds quite a few other features which i find i like.  The keyboard itself is easy to use and has a number of shortcut keys like volume and brightness control which i find very useful.  Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.  The touchpad is useful but, i am finding that it is about 50/50 whether i use it or the touchscreen so not as big a selling point as you might think.  Also using the keyboard allows me to leave it plugged in and charging while i am using it without worrying about crimping the power cord or yanking it out of the wall socket.  So far the one negative thing is that it only has one speaker.  To be honest the speaker sounds amazing but, having sound come from only one side kind of puts it out of balance for me.  One last note,  a lot of the reviewers seem to not like the plastic case or at least have some issue with it.  I dont see the problem as most people are going to buy a case for the tablet to protect their investment thus rendering most tablets build materials a moot point ( hard to see the tablet case through leather or hard plastic).", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product.

I bought my Asus Transformer tablet about a week ago, and love it, owning a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0\", and my Samsung Galaxy S II..the Android OS really isn't a problem.  I had been looking..looking for a tablet PC not the iPad, or any of its subsequent off springs, didn't want another 7\" tablet either, mine is great, I use it daily, but I wanted something that had not just great computing power,something that can handle a ton of apps too.  More to the point..amateur radio apps..I am a ham radio operator, and after giving my pristine Acer 10\" netbook to our adopted daughter as her laptop died a horrible untimely death.  So..for her birthday I gave her my 2 year old used maybe a dozen times a pristine Acer One 10\" netbook with an external CD drive for her 28th birthday.But I digress..this is about the Asus TF-300 Transformer tablet, not about Acer netbooks is it now.  What I like on my TF-300 tablet..the screen size..its the same size as my netbook, I can get the multifunction docking station for my Asus TF-300 and in all actuality have a high end net book PC.  Just because it works on the Android OS doesn't make a bit of difference.  Another like..man..I can sync this up with not just my phone, but my other 7\" tablet, and I can add files from my Windows 7 laptop to my Asus TF-300, or vice versa.  So I can be in the know..every where I go.One of my dislikes, and I know its minor..but there is no 3G capabilities with these type of instruments.  When OH when will the manufacturers of these new high end tablet PCs add in 3G capabilities?  It wouldn't take up any more room, there would be negligible additional cost, so I ask..Hey Asus, Sony, Lenovo..all the rest of you makers and shakers, when ya gonna add 3G to these tablets? There..that is my nit pick, I really have no other issue with this tablet.  I will say this..I loked at the TF-300 Prime and wasn't impressed.  For an additional $200, you get a metal case, a bit better in the graphics department, some software upgrades..thats it.  Can't do it, not on a day when the flesh is weak, I buy and sell ham radio gear..the consumer electronics biz..isn't.  I have a feeling and after more than 10 years of buying and selling electronics..I kinda know what stuff is worth.  True..for the most part, if you buy from the nice folks here at Amazon..y'all can get a hell of a deal.  But, if you go to the mall, or any of the big box stores and get one..like I did, I gave $399 for mine at Best Buy, and was very happy to do so.For all intents and purposes, the Asus TF-300 T, the multi-function docking station you have a very, very well equipped net book. With all the wireless printers, the printer apps you can find at the Google Play store, plus Cloud printing, web hosting, PC/phone syncing, you will have in your hot little..or big..depending upon the size..hands a great tool, movie house, gaming arcade, word processing, and any other use you may find for it.  So..go to your favorite brick and mortar store, find a tablet you're interested in..take one for a spin..you might just like it.I will offer up a bit of advice and then I will let you kind folks get back to what you were doing before I came along.  Its this..in real estate, in buying or selling its location, location, location. With tablet PCs..its research, research, research.  Research what ever tablet your heart desires, pick 2 or 3 other that most closely meet what your expectations in a tablet are.  Compare each of those to the one you want, you may find that what your original idea of a tablet was..may change, for maybe an additional $50, you might be able to get an even better tablet than what you had first planned on.  Do your research, it took me 6 months of looking reading up on, playing with different tablets, I looked at Samsung, Lenovo, Toshiba, tablets, but when I found this Asus TF-300 it blew me out of the water.  I knew of Asus, as I had built PCs before using Asus motherboards, but never knew they were into the tablet scene.  Took my Samsung Galaxy S II out of my pocket looked up Asus tablets and their ratings on CNet and was even more blown away..WOW Asus has tablet PCs..and they're good..people like em.  All I'm sayin..do a little research folks, it well could save you a good deal of cash.  Last item..most of y'all have seen these..for lack of a better word..tablet pc..the price tag is any where from $99.99 to $119.99.  If all you want is an e reader  it may be all right.  But for anything else..do yourself a favor, put another $100 into the pot and get yourself a real tablet..not saying thy're not, just saying.  If you have to save a month or 2 longer to get what you need, then save another month or 2.

Denetclaw", "ReviewID": "R3GA24GZHX5KFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a windy review...  The TF300 is a excellent tablet for many reasons.First of all, I'm thankful for purchasers that have submitted reviews to give me a grasp of what to look for in a tablet (both good and bad).  I spent some time reading reviews of tablets that were out there to get an idea of what qualities to look for.  My wife has a Acer Iconia 100a which is solid but already a generation out (at least).  At first I wouldn't even pick it up because the idea of apps was so foreign.  I'm still in my PC world. Within the last 6 months I began seeing the value in being able to load books, articles and documents onto this kind of device.  I also saw the value of a camera that takes decent pictures.  I did enjoy the interface with my car's USB for music and audio books.  Oh and kids...  Childrens games that are interactive are invaluable.  I was won over to the idea so I began exploring.I'm in my 40's and things are changing.  The 7in screen is getting to be too small, so I started my search in the 10in screen.  I saw the Xoom and was contenting myself with the idea but my nephew told me ASUS was the way to go, so I switched gears and began to look at what was there.  There was Samsung, Toshiba, Motorola, Acer and Asus in the android running.  So many options.  I decided to open my eyes to the Ipad since the last generation is now in price range.  I read a little and decided I was too old fashioned and settled into the PC mindset.  I've got a laptop (w/vista) at home and my phone is pay-per-minute w/a querty keypad.  Android was more familiar and closer to my computer logic.  See you later Ipad.  The Kindle HD had a huge discount and was very tempting, but the lack of gps and camera on back lost that idea quickly. I like gadgets with lots of optional gadgets.I began researching and words like IPS, 'rooting', nits, and ICS intimidated me.  I didn't let that stop me because if it is important, I will persevere.  I hit online reviews at Cnet and Egadget to help me along the way.  After a point the running came to current technology.  Which chipsets and processors would be around for the longest?  I narrowed my seach to the quad core offerings because each of them had the 'ice cream sandwich' operating system (OS) and were upgradeable to 'jelly bean'.  Upgradeability.  My wife's Iconia was upgraded to 'ice cream sandwich', but is not upgradeable to 'jellybean'.  Product support for a few years to come is an important aspect.  Price was also very important.  I like the convenience, and that is what these devices are, convenience.  At $500, I began seeing replacement laptops for my antique of 2007.  No, no, I won't go there.  So in the running were the Acer A700, the Toshiba Excite 10, the Asus TF300; ...and the ASUS TF700 and the NEXUS 10...  Oh wait a minute where did that $500 thing go.  The new generation of vivid screens and memory and power were starting to blur my vision.  Getting back to the three nice priced Tegra 3 quad cores.  All seem similar on paper, the Toshiba Excite has a flash for the camera and two speaker stereo sound and gorilla glass.  The Acer A700 has the vivid 1920x1200 display, no flash and two stereo speakers.  The Asus TF300 has a 8.0MP camera, only one speaker and no flash, but is $50 less than the competition.Getting into some details, the Acer was reviewed to get hot, and the Excite and Asus were very similar in their offering, so price won out in that case.  I read that the ASUS is has less preloaded apps to deal with.  I also read that the Asus was faster at processing that the other two on various apps.  Battery life, they are all reviewed around 8hrs.  All of these shaped my understanding of what was there.  In the end price won out for me.Now for the driving...I got my tablet, immediately charged it before turning it on.  I then affixed a purchased screen film protector and slid it into a leather case to protect it.  I powered it on and watched and waited.  It took nearly a minute to power up.  My wife's starts up in similar time.  Once it started, I input my wi-fi passwd and when it got signal it almost immediately began downloading new firmware.  No issues with connecting with Wi-fi, almost immediate.  This took nearly 20 minutes and with a restart the 'ice cream sandwich OS' was gone and I had 'jellybean'.  I had read reviews about 'ice cream sandwich OS,' and it having issues of freezing up and the loaded browser freezing up and asking you to wait or cancel.  I also read of the virtual keyboard not being as attentive.  I have to agree with these assessments as my wife's tablet suffers that.  The 'jellybean' does correct a lot of those issues and the browser is quicker and doesn't freeze up the same way and the keyboard is attentive.  I did as others suggested and loaded another browser - Chrome which helps the 'ice cream sandwich' a bunch.Touchscreen and SD CardThe Asus TF300 has a very good touch interface via their WXGA-IPS... display.  I like how easy it to select, click on and move items.  I can't speak of the Toshiba or Acer A700, but it is worlds better than my wife's tablet.  My age comes out here, but I couldn't get the Micro SD 32 GB card to work.  There was no selection to send pictures there, on downloading, there was no option to select this.  I online chatted with Asus (it does take some patience, so be ready) and they got me to my solution quickly.  There is a 'File Manager' app which lets you look at the tree menu of your tablet and SD card.  You have to find the file location and manually move from your tablet to the SD card (the file tree was similar to that of the pc system).  Initially I thought it was inconvenient, but quickly recognized the value and ability of being able to customize your files.  I like that.  My wife's doesn't let you do this.  In moving files, no matter where you move it, the tablet recognizes the location.  In my exploration I found the loaded Polaris Office to be an excellet app and I found that the Book app renders downloaded .pdf documents clearly. Other apps brought them in faded and grainy.Viewing and soundI adjusted the brightness to see just how bright it could be.  In comparison to my wife's it was quite alot brighter.  In reviewing it was supposed to have 400nits of brightness (I'm not sure what that is, but I understand it to be brighter than average).  It is quite bright and in the evenings I usually dim it down for comfort.  In direct sunlight it is hard to see, but is visible.  Clarity, it is clear enough with details showing through on movies on netflix (won't try to compare with HD level of the Acer A700).  I would say it is clearer than my 720p HD 42\" flat screen up on the wall.  View angles, it is viewable at almost all angles up to nearly 180 degrees, but it does decline in clarity as you get away from 90 degrees.  My wife's is only viewable from 3 sides, the 4th goes nearly black, yet on one of those sides it stays clear and sharp nearly to 180 degrees.  Interesting.  As far as light bleed on the edges like others have said, it is almost non-existent in darkness, so no bother there.  The sound, it is louder, clearer and fuller than my laptop computer; not in stereo (as claimed), no bass or treble control, no surround sound (my wife's has Dolby with surround option and bass/treble control).  Nothing to brag about, but pleasant when listening to, much like the sound from my cell phone.GPS, camera, and wifiI turned on the GPS in my living room and it picked up our location within 30 seconds and was accurate to the room I was in on the map.  It is as quick as my office garmin and fairly sensitive.  The wifi is quick and has decent range and can detect out to about 1200ft away.  The camera is nice and takes good pictures.  Clarity depends on the amount of light.  In incandescent lit rooms it gets grainy.The app worldI'm learning everyday what is out there on google store and amazon apps.  It is nice to be able to install an app and if I don't like the entire app is removed, as shown by the memory storage decreasing.  Unlike on a pc, where it removes the program, but the software is still in your computer.Overall it is fast, about as fast as I can click.  It has 3 performance modes that are easily accessable.  I don't do any gaming so the economy mode works well enough for me and saves on battery life. I'm going to enjoy my tablet and have already loaded books, articles, bibles, music, pictures, and maps.  I'm ready to take my show on the road with one thin device rather than a library of books and cds.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for a great price!", "Author": "Robert L.

The Kindle app is great and my entire libray of over 300 ebooks available at the touch of a finger. The overall operation is fast and responsive. Android 4.0 is quite impressive, though it does not support flash player as thoroughly as previous versions. I had to manually download and install Flash Player since Adobe no longer provides support starting with Ice Cream Sandwich.I don't use the docking station so I cannot speak to the problem many have mentioned concerning cracked screens. And the lack of compatibility with some Facebook games is not the fault of Asus or Google but rather Adobe, as mentioned above.

The Tab II was sluggish and glitch. The Galaxy Note was impressive and very responsive but $100.00 more than the TF300. I found the TF300's performance and features equal to the Note's for a lot less money.So in summary, the Asus TF300 is everything I could possibly hope for in a tablet and then some. Perhaps there are some drawbacks to the docking station but I have no plans to use it in that manner so it isn't an issue for me.UPDATE - 4/28/2013: I have had this tablet for several months now and am even more pleased with it than in the original review. I have since unlocked, and rooted it allowing me to flash a custom ROM and kernel and overclock it. BE AWARE! DOING THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY! But I purchased a no questions asked extended warranty from Wal-Mart when I bought it so it wasn't an issue for me. It is even covered if I drop it or spill something on it causing damage.I also do not recommend modifying it if you are squeamish about doing anything of a technical nature. But the upside is I have control over what apps are on the trablet and the custom ROM runs faster that the stock ROM even without overclocking. It is more stable as well.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tablet....  if you haven't already, get the keyboard", "Author": "T.

So the only devices I can compare are my HTC Incredible 2 and my Samsung laptop. That being said, this is a neat device. Overall I can say it is good at most tasks.The physical is very nice. It seems very sturdy but light weight. The back is attractive but the texture is a little strange. Seems like the ports and buttons are in very functional places.The software seems more than a little buggy. Many applications frequently take a long time to respond. I get the \"wait or cancel\" message regularly. I have found that a few apps in the Google Play store say they are not compatible with this device, although not many, and have not yet been able to get Amazon MP3 cloud player to work.The default browser has closed randomly, but third party browsers don't seem to be any better. Opera mini works the best but doesn't support Flash (no thanks). The keyboard has a \"swype like\" feature that is useful but doesn't work in certain programs. Maybe that's on purpose. Editing text after it has been typed is more than a little frustrating. It doesn't seem to let you touch where you need to edit. It registers my touch but then moves the cursor to another random spot.I cant say I have been super impressed with the processing speed. I read many reviews that just raved about it. I expected it to be more responsive with the hardware they used.It has also reset itself a few times although once was for a firmware upgrade.I have not tried the docking keyboard yet.The screen and display are marvelous. No complaints there. I'm sure there some difference in the higher resolution models, but this display has well surpassed my expectations. I watch Netflix on it all the time. No problems.I've had it for a little over a month now, and as I said earlier, not bad, but not great. Certainly cant argue with the price.UPDATE 8-21-12Did a \"cold reboot\" and that fixed a lot of the little buggy problems. Also Asus upgraded this model toJelly Bean last week. Seems like it just hums now. Really pleased with performance. As I said before this does a lot of things well. Great with just about every app I've tried on it. There is a great built in app for screen sharing with computers on my home network. Many of the other built in tools have been helpful too. Since the upgrade it just \"feels\" more like I thought it would. Battery life has surpased my expectations.Highly reccomended.

I'm pretty picky about my electronics and after checking the specs and reviews on the other offerings out there, chose the TF300T. The first unit I got had an issue with the casing by the headphone jack. It appeared as if the case wasn't properly seated, or that the headphone jack bulged just a bit too much preventing the back from properly seating. That one went back within two days and I got my current unit.I had none of the nit-picky complaints of some other tech users (eg. light bleed) because quite frankly I don't give a crap about that. Just need to be able to get my content and have a solid user experience. It's been two months and the tablet has been randomly rebooting. Not once or twice a day, with heavy use, a few times a session. My sessions are about 3 to 4 hours long. This is infuriating to say the least, and there is no pattern to the reboots. It happens sometimes when using google to search, launching different apps, checking email - just totally random. This is unacceptable for a unit that we all paid a premium price to obtain.Another issue I've observed is the touchscreen will launch apps and select items even before you actually touch the screen. In some cases your finger may be within a quarter inch of the screen but not touching, and it will fire off whatever it hovered above. Let's I'm in the google play store trying to decide what to get. It will launch you into items which you didn't mean to select. Ah.. ASUS, this is an issue!Let's talk battery life and performance. If you want any kind of decent battery life you have to sacrifice the performance. Don't let the specifications entice you. To get close to the ten hours ASUS advertises you have to set the unit on \"battery saver\" mode which brings your performance on par with the supposedly lesser OMAP 4430 processor in the Galaxy Tab 2 , Kindle Fire, Lenovo S2109. I'm certain these tablets don't crash and have the kind of stability issues I'm seeing. What's the point of having a screaming processor if you can't fully enjoy it with decent battery life? Very few apps are written for Tegra 3, most are written to support the majority of devices so should you shell out the extra bucks and deal with stability issues when they will run just as well on another device - sans issues? This unit may well end up being returned - I really wanted to like it but I'm having a hard time at this point.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A really nice tablet!", "Author": "Robert L.

Noonan \"jim94510\"", "ReviewID": "R146A2BD80KWIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly a beautiful, sexy, and powerful piece of Android sweetness.  The Tegra 3's 4+1 cores rules multi-tasking, handling streaming tunes from Google Music, showboating in Google Pluse's Hangouts, while downloading a video - all without a blip or hiccup.Look & Feel:At 10.35in by 7.12in , and at a tad over 3/4in thick, it fits nicely in one hand.  Even for an older, geeky couch-potato, it's no effort to balance the 2.60lbs tab and dock combo; tab only is 1.40lbs. Even though the body is molded plastic, it feel solid. The nice concentric-circle embossing adds to a secure feeling, and no fingerprints. Comes with a microfiber cloth for the glass screen.Screen:This is not an iPad.  The 10.1in. WXGA screen (1280x800) is an IPS panel; not the Super-IPS of the Transformer Prime, or Infinity, so using this badboy in direct sun will be a chore at best. However, if you intend to use this indoors, or on a shaded deck, this backlit LED is up for the job. The nearly 180-degree viewing angle is great with friends next to you. It's the perfect size for 35,000 feet! It collects fingerprints fast! The 10-finger touch support is great when using gestures, (ie: 1,2 & 3 finger swipes)Wireless Connections:WiFi is robust and steady. Excellent mobile hotspot recognition, when you need to tether to your 3G/4G data plan.It's easy to burn up your 3.5GB data with the larger screen.My home router limits me to \"G\" band, so 802.11(n) should knock your socks off!  I use an older WRT54GL and still pull 31mbps on the deck. The new dual-band router should be here next week.Bluetooth handled both file transfers and a mini-mouse flawlessly, with is nice for those with larger fingers. I get 100 feet with JayBird Freedom bluetooth headset.OS & Software:This is nearly pure Ice Cream Sandwich, with little in the way of propriatary launcher. Tegra 3 was made for ICS, and with four cores and 1GB of DDR3 ram, it zips around without a studder. Coupled with the 12-core GeForce GPU and 1080p video is outstanding.ASUS includes additional software including \"SuperNote\" note taking software. Pretty cool! Let's you add pictures, video, and finger doodles to your notes in notebooks. \"Kindle\" and Google's \"Play Books\" compete for e-books; \"Zinio\" & \"Press Reader\" for magazine and newspaper subscriptions. \"MyLibrary\" consolidates all your books and various subscriptions. \"Polaris Office 3.0\" to handle your pre-Office 2007 (doc, xls, ppt) documents.For your wireless home theater, ASUS has \"MyNet\" for streaming digital media to any DLNA device connected to your network. The mini-HDMI works great for any HDMI TV. Also included is \"MyCloud\", which not only provides 8GB of lifetime storage for music, videos, documents, and photos - anything; it also allows remote access and control of connected PC and Mac systems.Storage:On board is 32GB of storage, more than enough for some serious rocking games, especially those made specifically for the Tegra 3. The microSD slot can give you another 32GB. The dock has an additional full-size SD card for a third 32GB; and a full-size USB for flash drives, USB hard drives, card readers, etc. If you're a fan of cloud storage, ASUS, Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon, Carbonite, SkyDrive, Sugar Sync, the storage is nearly endless.Battery Management:One of the biggest issues for portables is battery. If you're diligent about switching power modes, you can squeeze 12-13 hours out of the tablet alone. Switching to power saver uses the chip's fifth core for low powered syncing chores and maintenance. Normal will handle multi-tasking email, streaming music, and browsing easily. and power mode will process the latest games and Netflix without breaking a sweat. Also shutting down radios when in sleep mode helps conservation as well. I get about 7.5 hours when video-conferencing, downloading, and streaming music ... can't beat that.Final Thoughts:For a legitimate iPad alternative, you can't beat this tablet. With the additional dock, you have one badass netbook when you need something a bit more, including an additional 4-5 hours of battery life. The additional $149 is absolutely worth it. Also ASUS sells a 40pin to USB adapter that will allow the tablet alone to use full-size USB, but the dock has that capability built-in.UPDATE:Announced today (July 17, 2012), ASUS advised their Transformer tablets will qualify for Android 4.0 (Jellybean) updates.

This is really a good tablet, it does all the jobs a tablet should do, but not confined to those. It is so good that i have to leave a comment here.This is my first tablet, but i have played with new ipad for a long time (one of my family members owns one). Of course new ipad has a more sleek outlook and better resolution.other than these two feature, i think tf300t totally out-wins the new ipad. The performance is much better, especially graphical operations,thanks to the nvidia tegra3. Also, the operating temperature is much lower than the new ipad.Equipped with the latest 4-core processor, tf300t runs almost all the apps i can find smoothly. I am a graduate student studying physics and most ofthe time i read papers on my laptop. I found reading papers (pdf format as well as djvu) on tf300t is more comfortable. The screen is large enough for a standard letter-sized document, and the brightness is very good in various environment. I recommend a free app called Orion viewer, which is very professional and reads documents ultra fast. It comes with built-in kindle viewer, whichis also very sweet.For web browsing, the built-in browseris a bit unstisfactory as mentioned in other reviews. The dolphin browser is the best replacement. It runs very smoothly, and once i got used to the gesture function, it is as fast and convenient as browsing webpages on my laptop. It also supports all the webpages that i usually read. In sort, it is just like my laptop, but with much less weight. Very easy to carry around, without even noticing its weight.It takes all my music and videos; plays fullHD movies flawlessly. I recommend VX movie player as well as dice movie player. Photo and camera quality is okay, not very impressive though.The battery life is about 8 to 10 hours of normal ussage. Good enough fora normal day use i think.I forgot to mention that the screen glass is not as hard as the best commercial grade, such as its brother Transformer tf201. I did not count this as a flaw though; you get what you pay for. Also, it can be easily resolved by applying a screen protector. I bought Poetic ProFilm Screen Protector Anti-Glare for Asus Transformer TF300 (3-pack) and Made By Poetic, it does its job without affecting the transparency---you wont even notice. I also bought Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for the Asus Transformer TF300 Black with Build In Stand (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)(Has Open Slot for Charger Port)(Business Card Holder is Plus), very classic outlook and it does it job.In conclusion, considering the price and performance, i think tf300t is the one of the optimal choices of tablet.

I had my laptop, and my smart phone, and couldn't see how a third device could fulfill me any more than what I already had. Enter the Kindle Fire. After many months of hinting/cajoling/begging/whining I made sure my wife got a Fire for Mothers day, which of course required some setup by me, and I said to myself, \"Self, this is almost a really good device. With a bigger screen, a little more storage space, and a little more customizability, this would be awesome.\"I almost made a misstep. I very nearly purchased a refurbed Motorola Xoom, but fortunately did my homework, and landed on the Asus Transformer Pad as the device for me. The hardware packaged inside the Transformer Pad appears to be unmatched in a dollar/performance comparison with any other tablet currently available, and the package itself is very attractive to my eyes. The features available both software and hardware wise have seen me using my laptop much less, and my tablet much more. So far I have purchased a very nice, and inexpensive case for protection, and the dock/USB adapter. The USB adapter has allowed me to connect storage devices from USB thumb drives, to a USB floppy drive - and they all just work. I connected an XBox 360 controller USB wireless adapter, synced a controller, and it worked. Every app I've thrown at it, works. The video editor \"Movie Studio\" works. Battery life is phenomenal whether the Pad is on, or off. Threw in a 32GB MicroSD card and loaded it up with music, and again, everything works. Overwhelmingly, I have had pleasant experiences with the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T, and am looking forward to a long time enjoying my purchase, especially if I can ever bring myself around to getting the keyboard/dock to go along with it.Of course, not everything is roses. For completeness sake; a list of the foibles that I don't care for.The dock connector: I would much prefer a standard micro USB connector - since that's what every other device I have uses for charging and communications.The speakers: Sound quality is great, but with the speakers right next to each other there's no stereo separation. Which begs the question, why have two speakers?The MicroSD card has popped out once. I don't think it will be a problem in general, but I did manage to hit it just right once to unintentionally pop it into the ejected position.Charging: Due to the large battery, it only charges correctly when connected to high voltage/USB3 connections.The internet Browser: As mentioned elsewhere, the browser does \"hang up\" for several seconds many times just before the page completes loading. Not every time, but it can get annoying.It's too big to use comfortably as a reader sometimes - like laying down to sleep - this is the one area where the Kindle Fire comes out ahead.None of these issues I have are anywhere near deal breakers, and most likely there will never be a device that is perfect, so my recommendation is definitely to buy if you're in the market. Again, I am very satisfied with my nearly four-hundred dollar purchase, and in comparison with the similar devices I've seen (the \"New\" iPad, Galaxy Tabs, Kindle Fire), I think my Transformer Pad takes the cake.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Convenient Multi-Purpose Tablet", "Author": "Randall Harp", "ReviewID": "R3KRDF275JZXR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet is everything that I love about my Android smartphone in a larger, more user-friendly format.

I love android and I believe Asus really took advantage of the ICS layout and really brought out the best with it. Two reasons I really love android are brought out in this tablet: 1.Asus built some simple yet useful widgets(I love widgets) 2. Multi-tasking/App-managing really shines with ICS and is great for a tablet. You can end or switch between apps very easily and even change music w/o having to leave your current position simply tap the bottom right-hand corner.  Power management with the TF300 is great as well, with this tablet being so powerful that it can be used for gaming it was necessary for Asus to put in an easy-to-use power management profiles that you can easily switch between. Battery life on this tablet is great lasting easily all day with off-n-on use. One thing I really believe is a con is the front-camera; it makes me sad that I'm yet to see a tablet that has a good front-camera so that I can easily skype with my friends and family. They complain that the image is pix-elated. Below are some of the reasons why I purchased this tab over the others.Storage:Plenty of storage on this device for music, videos, pictures and whatever else you want and great cause it has a micro sd port!Battery:It was a decent battery life I'm not a hard user with it but I use it frequently I took it off the charger this morning and after reading on the bus for over 30 minutes, playing music for an hour while surfing the web and receiving and sending a dozen emails, I'm halfway through the day and still 85% battery life. For the price its great, if you want something a little extra go with the Asus Transformer Prime, that has an over 3 hours more of extra battery life(according to the engadget.com battery test).Processor:This is the first series of tablets to sport the Tegra 3 processor, that's 4 cores!! To be honest as we all know though, it's not just about quantity but quality. This tablet maximizes the use of those 4 cores. In the 5 days of me using this tablet I have experienced slowing when I decided to test how many widgets and apps I could run before it started slowing(by the way that was on power saving mode as well, which reduces the processor speed)Display:The Display is great, makes reading fun. I have noticed a bit of glare issue but that happens with all displays, honestly have not noticed that much; I can still read just fine while on the bus and the sun shining on me. The automatic brightness only adjusts when you unlock it so if you have your tablet on and are moving in-n-out \"dark/light\" areas it will not adjust. But even on the lower brightness settings I can read just fine.Note-taking:The note app that it comes with works great, I bought a stylus as well and it makes it a lot easier for input. My brother got the keyboard dock and I did notice that the cursor(when the track-pad is in use) is sometimes registered as a \"touch\" on the screen, creating unwanted lines or spaces (this did not happen 100% of the time, hence sometimes).Keyboard Dock:I already lightly touched on this but at first I was not interested in buying this; yes it would be great to have a few more hours of battery life and yes it would be nice to have a keyboard to type with. But I was concerned that it would be too big for the battery or not big enough for the keyboard. My brother purchased this dock and I was able to test it out. I liked it! The keyboard was still big enough to type on, yes you have to get used to it but it's no Everest, it's more like hill. The size is great, just as or smaller than your average net-book.Price:When I bought this tab it was 385 and it was worth every dollar.Overall:I love this tablet and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy a tablet. This is one of the highest rated tablets out there right now and is still cheaper than the old iPad2 (except refurbished). You will not be disappointed!

I am a pretty big technology freak and love having the latest and greatest so when this came out, especially at the price it came out at, I had to have it. I also bought the keyboard dock that is compatable with it and it works perfectly well together with it. I am not new to tablets, I own a Acer W500, I briefly owned the Acer A500, the nook color and the iPad 2. I also bought 4 different phones in the last year because of this electronic addiction I have, but I really believe this tablet is a fine piece of electronic.I did notice the light bleed, at first I was worried especially since it does get worse if you flex it, but after using it for quite a while, i don't notice it at all.The back is not the worlds most sturdy thing but i think it will work out fine. As expected, the screen is a fingerprint magnet, the cloth they provide works surprisingly well though.With the keyboard I think this is as close to a laptop/netbook replacement as it gets.Pros:-Nice and light-Runs games flawlessly-With keyboard, writing is easy-Amazing Capabilities-Screen is bright (I know that the Prime does have Super IPS +)-Long battery life, especially with the keyboard battery.Cons:-There is that lightbleed + flex-Having the hardest time trying to find a stable browser as they all seem to crash, not frequently but enough to be annoying (Tried everything- Chrome, Dolphin, Boat, Firefox, Stock ,ended up with Maxthon for tablets)- It's pretty sharp around the sides and can start to hurt after a while when holding it.Hints- If you have a good stable internet connection, the best way to do any office editing would be to get Onlive desktop and use it with the keyboard and you instantly have an awesome computer that can edit Microsoft Office stuff perfectly-Plugging in a controller (such as a wired Xbox 360 controller) in the USB slot on the keyboard makes this thing a dream to play games on such as GTA 3 or Shadow gun not to mention N64.. going to test if PSX will work on this tablet-Like others have said, if using the keyboard, learn where the mousepad toggle is.Summary- This is an awesome tablet at an extremely reasonable price. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who like to tinker around with electronics. Even being 6'6 and 210 lbs, the keyboard works fine for my fat long fingers.

It lasts me through an entire day of on and off usage with pretty liberal power settings as long as I let it auto-sleep after a few minutes of non-use. I highly recommend that other users let it charge a full eight hours the first time, and then let it fully drain and fully recharge 2-3 times rather than partially recharging it afterwards)I've had this tablet for nearly a week now, and I'm exceptionally pleased with my investment. It handles 3D rendering without a hitch or hiccup, and has by and large been entirely stable, consistent and efficient. (You can bet I'll update this review if it later fails to be) It easily hooks up to a desktop PC via USB for file transfers without any unnecessary dancing around with sync applications, though those are still usable if one wants. The power cable is a little loose where it anchors to the tablet, however.It does, unsurprisingly, come with a fair amount of Asus and Google bloatware, but there is at least one gem hidden among that. There's a free copy of the Splashtop HD desktop streaming app, hidden away as part of the \"MyCloud\" app, tucked away in there, which is incredibly useful and works really well. This is something to be aware of, as some owners of this tablet have ended up buying Splashtop without knowing it's included free due to the way it's integrated in the MyCloud app. You also get 8 GB free on some cloud storage app, but as far as I can tell, you can't freely choose which folders to sync to it like you can with services like Dropbox, making it a bit unappealing even if the generous space allotment is nice. You just get a single sync folder that you have to move or copy your files to instead, meaning you have to either keep them in there or have two copies of everything. Blech.The screen is very glossy and can be a little dim (especially with automatic brightness enabled, which will err on that side to save battery power), and can be nearly impossible to make out in bright, direct sunlight. If you're getting a screen protector, one with a matte finish to offset the reflectivity might be a good choice if you're going to be out in direct light much. Indoors it's fine though, and looks fairly nice. Also, the battery power doesn't seem to be living up to the advertised lengths - but the instructions also advise going through several cycles of fully discharging and recharging the battery (after the initial eight hour charge-up), and I've only done this once. Apparently it hits its stride once it's gotten \"broken in\" this way.I am very new to tablet ownership and have little to no basis of comparison for my experiences. I know so far I've got no real complaints except those minor ones outlined above. Everything works very well otherwise, from the GPS to the Wi-Fi to the software. As well as a similarly priced tablet? I can't say. But I've richly enjoyed my ownership experience - and the ability to remote in to my home desktop and effectively carry it around portably via Splashtop has proven to be a massive unexpected bonus.

He can't do that. The pics and video I took also went on SD card that was past around and copied. He couldn't do that. King of the party. Oh yeah!The GPS capabilities are fantastic. REAL GPS. Hiking, travel, and nautical.  I checked the GPS on the second day and, I know this sounds made up because during my research I came across these same statements myself, but it did find a shortcut where I did not know one existed. Shaved off at least a mile and a half. With the right apps and maps this will save you $150 for the GPS alone. So the question, \"what can it do for me\"?... Well, there is an assistant app that you can download for free,( I named her Emma because I made her British). ask for a recipe, the location of local stores that sell the ingredients, navigate to said store and she'll even tell you a joke.

First thing this is my first tablet I own myself but I have many friends who own I pads and Samsung Galaxies but I was just waiting until my laptop finally retired to get one. This being said I have LOTS of time to weigh the pros and cons of all the tablets.Firstly, this tablet is amazing and any person who knows or wants value will buy it.Secondly, lets get to the specifics. Unless you work on a construction site and will be in the sun the entire day with your tablet, this screen will be amazing for you. Fortunately I am not a constuction manager so I use my tablet like normal people and this screen is outstanding. I watch countless videos on this thing. As I sit right now in my home office I am streaming How I Met Your Mother. This brings me to my third point.The wifi is better than the Ipads I have used. I live in a small town and where I live we don't get the best wifi reception, however my tablet gets a solid signal at a much further range than does my friends tablets or their laptops. Some complain about the plastic back. But fellow humans.... this was done to improve the wifi reception. On the note I say mission accomplish!The look and feel is amazing and let me get to the value aspect of it. The specs of the machine are the best around right now, the quad core is bullet fast. I have had one restart the first day I got it and that was cause it wasn't properly charged and I was downloading apps like a crazy person. Since then the apps run perfect and Google Play is littered with amazing apps which is why I love it as compared to the Apple Store. The widgets give you variety and allow you to have your personality of sorts on the tablet.Additionally, this is a 32 GIGABYTE tablet. The new Apple tablet cost almost $700 for the 32 gig. I just asked a 7 year old whats the difference and he correctly answered that there is a $300 price difference for a comparable tablet! Brighter screen worth $300 more dollars when you will rarely use it outside?Accessory wise there arent as many for this tablet yet but I found a few great ones  made by other companies.

The original tablet I received had a small defect on the bottom right corner of the screen where a bright white spot (not a dead pixel, much bigger than one pixel, more like a cluster of pixels, maybe one of the LEDs or nits behind the screen?) showed up every time the background color of the screen was white or a light color. It did not appear to impact the overall functioning of the tablet but was disturbing/distracting on a brand-new device. Called Amazon customer service on May 10th, explained the defect, received RMA soon afterward with pre-paid shipping label to return defective unit to Amazon via UPS, and was told that a replacement was being sent out (2-day UPS delivery). Much to my (pleasant) surprise, I received the replacement unit by early afternoon on May 11th, even before I had a chance to drop off the defective unit at a local UPS pick up station to return it to Amazon. After charging the replacement unit, powering it up and going through the initial set up process, I then examined it for any defects (in particular the screen to avoid getting a unit with the same problem as the first unit I received) and much to my relief found no apparent flaws or defects in the workmanship, build quality, or overall functioning of the replacement unit. So, long story short, if you are worried about getting a bad unit, don't worry. Amazon will make things right. I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this was my first time ever returning/exchanging an item, so I was naturally concerned about how painful (or not) the process would be when compared to returning items at a brick & mortar retail store. I'm glad it proved to be painless and pleasant, more so than I would have expected.Now onto the product itself.This is my first tablet and I was lured by the affordable price point, quad-core processor, well-designed keyboard dock (which I did get with the tablet in my initial order), large internal storage, and ICS operating system out of the box. I did look into the original Transformer Prime but shied away after reading all the reviews about the problems some owners have had with wireless reception. Realized that the Transformer 700 (Infinity?) is coming out soon/later this year but with its higher price point wasn't sure if it was worth spending so much money for a tablet when I wasn't 100 percent certain if I would be able to integrate it into my work needs and leisure pursuits. I figure if this Transformer 300 works out well, then I can always save up later to upgrade once I know for sure that a tablet can actually be useful for my needs. Because I rarely play games on my existing computers or watch much streaming video, whether I upgrade later to the Transformer 700 will depend wholly on how useful the Transformer 300 can be in my classroom instruction, lesson preparations, and one-on-one conferences with parents and students. Because I've only had this tablet for less than one week, maybe after I've used it for a while I'll come back to update this review to let others know how useful it can be for an educational setting.I did go to a box store to hold, play with, and examine a physical working model of this tablet (the 16GB one at BB) before deciding to purchase it here on Amazon (where the 32GB version was available for the same price as the 16GB version at BB). I was concerned about the screen resolution and quality, especially after hearing about the improved screen resolution for Apple's iPad 3 and the upcoming Transformer Prime 700. But after watching videos and browsing websites using the tablet at BB, decided that the resolution on this tablet, 1280x800, is perfectly fine for my needs. Despite initial misgivings about the plastic back instead of a metal/brushed aluminum back as found on the Prime, I find that it is sturdy enough for everyday use/handling. The volume on the speaker (even though it is mono and not stereo) is sufficiently loud enough and clear enough that it can be heard even in a somewhat noisy environment and is more than sufficient when one is using the tablet in a quiet home environment. Obviously audiophiles (which I am not) may still prefer the sound quality that can be heard when using earphones connected to the 3.5mm headphone jack. The touch screen has been responsive thus far. While the screen is not gorilla glass, it does not feel frail and fragile. Cannot comment on the software & apps yet because I haven't used it much. But I do think one of the niftier features of this tablet is that by signing in with an existing Google account that is also used on one's existing Android phone, by choosing to sync the tablet to the account the apps that one has already installed on one's Android smartphone will automatically be downloaded and installed onto the tablet along with preferences (i.e. bookmarks in the web browser).For the moment, I am pleased with my purchase and look forward to getting to know the various potential uses of this device in an educational setting. If after a while I notice any software or hardware issues that would result in me regretting this purchase or wanting to take points off the overall rating for this device, I will then post an update explaining the situation. For now, I think it's an amazing device and think anyone interested in getting a moderately priced tablet with pretty good standard features should definitely check it out for consideration before making a decision on what to ultimately get for themselves.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "I upgraded my ASUS t101 to the new t300...comparison", "Author": "AstroBob \"AstroBob\"", "ReviewID": "R1OZNE3AW9U275", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a ASUS t101 and loved it for the three weeks I had it.

Both my friend and I bought original at same time so we both traded in...thanks BB!They even gave us $30 back since the new one was on sale!The new one has some differences. Quad core vs. duo core is main one but also now has 8mp full 1080p HI DEF video capability (old was 5mp 740p video) both taking and sending to your monitor. I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative). Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah). It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101. The  micro is more available due to its being used by movie camcorders so a positive. Screen is still gorgeous and output to any big monitor through HDMI is outstanding...I use it for astronomy lectures. You can also get a HDMI to SVGA for those older commputer projectors/monitors. The screen format is wide screen so a better match to modern TVs and monitors than the Apple 4x5 format.  Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop. Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off. Beats my HP laptop which with a extra large battery gets about 5 hours.The wifi performance is fine...they use a plastic case so no issues with metal case killing the wifi or blue tooth . I tested in real world use alongside my two HP  laptops Pavilion DV6s Win7 64 bit....the ASUS t300 just slightly beat both on distance from  router which was in my basement and computers were on next floor up...through wooden floor and a couple of walls.. That was a worry as the previous fancier version called the Transformer Prime had a major issue with limited wifi distance due to a metal case.Quad core does make a difference in processor intensive apps like Sky Safari and SKEye but it isn't like night and day. I have used Ipads and frankly the addition of the keyboard, quad core and ease of memory expansion puts the ASUS ahead. I also love that I can take my 500GB USB hard disk and use it interchangeably on both my  Win7 64 bit machines and the ASUS. Using the included program you can read and right in Word and Excel to swap back and forth. I can also use a flash drive to exchange data.I also love having option of tablet standard operation or keyboard WITH mousepad. My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem. Tablet locks to keyboard so no danger of it falling out like another brand I tried.Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5....wish it had a user replaceable battery...same issue with Ipads. And like all laptops.. Wish it had red backlit key letters for low light/dark conditionsBy the way it does support AD HOC wifi which is necessary for me so I can use a SKY FI device to connect wirelessly to my telescopes and operate them remotely...works flawlessly. Rooting is not necessary.  The Android version of Sky Safari is identical to Apple version and works perfectly...my main reason for getting the ASUS. Beware that some Android brands do NOT allow use of the Sky Fi due to the AD HOC issue.There are probably a million apps for Android...I like idea of not being tied to Itunes and the open architecture has advantages.In short a most amazing product.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Right Decision", "Author": "Mark M", "ReviewID": "RB9CIZ7QT4Y7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my tablet - it does not replace my laptop, but its portability and features are what I was looking for in a tablet.

This seems like it may be a backlight problem or my display is slowly dying.  Fast forward to three nights ago and now the small blotches in my screen are now very prominent throughout the display.  It looks like a reverse inkblot test...  This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.

This was after they gave me two non-operative email addresses to them and I had to find the correct one after searching around.  They acknowledged the picture, gave me a case number and a number to call.  I did just that with the following result:1. they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.  I asked why I needed to do this when they asked for a picture.  What was the purpose of that if not to evaluate the case?  They didn't know, I had to send it in.2. I then asked them how much it would cost to repair if they decided--arbitrarily, of course--that it wouldn't be covered under the warranty (which, of course, it should be since only a defect in manufacturing either in the tablet or the docking station could cause a spontaneous crack).  They said $248.  I told them that was ridiculous because I could but a refurbished one getting the whole thing again for $202.  No response.2. I then said to tell me what the replacement part number was if I wanted to repair it myself.  They said they didn't have the information.  They don't have the replacement number for their own product?  Ridiculous.  They just want to obviously overcharge you for their ridiculous repair cost for their defective product they don't want to repair themselves under the warranty.3.  They could, of course, tell me how much the part they don't have a number for costs though.  That was $148.  Gee, how do you know what it costs if you don't have the number Asus?  This, of course, is also ridiculous as you can easily find an OEM replacement for it on the internet for around $60 or so, meaning they are overcharging you some $88 just for the part.4. That leaves $100 for them to do the labor to repair it for you.  Gee, a quick search of the internet shows a video on how to do it yourself which takes about 20 minutes to do if you do it slowly and carefully.  That means they are charging you at a rate of $300 an hour to do the repair for you (actually probably more like $4-500 and hour since an experienced tech could certainly do it much faster).5.

Lastly, the screen picks up fingerprints and smudges like none other!As for the software, it sometimes hangs up on programs (though I feel that is the developers' fault), and every so often when I turn it on, it appears to have fully shut down.  When paired to a Bluetooth keyboard, it sometimes does not stay in sync when the device is woken up, requiring the device and the keyboard to have their Bluetooth turned off then back on.

The Tegra 3 processor rocks in it handling anything I've tried on it even in the maximum power-savings mode. The screen is beautiful and bright. It might not be as impressive as the newest iPad screens, but it is still a beautiful screen. Headphones jack, micro SD card slot, and micro HDMI connections round up the most commonly needed connections/ports for a tablet. The sound is rather impressive as well for a compact device, and is by far better than any audio I've heard come out of a laptop let alone something smaller.Battery life is great. My niece and nephew played Angry Birds in Space and some other games draining 50-60% of the battery over the course of 4-5 hours over the weekend. The claims of 8hrs or more for playing videos or music seems very likely, as the games kept the screen on like a video but also required more processing power to run than a video. Playing music with the screen off should result in a much longer playtime.Love Android 4 (AKA Ice Cream Sandwich), which backups settings such as wireless connection passwords to your Google account.

Asus didn't mess much with the lovely Android 4.0 experience, so it's coupling up with my Galaxy Nexus quite well.  They added some items to the notification bar and put a few of their apps on it, but that's about it.  It's a bummer that they couldn't make due with a more standard connector, but I understand that micro USB probably wouldn't have worked so well for the dock.Since the first time I saw the original Transformer I was very curious at how well the keyboard dock would work and whether or not it would be more beneficial or detrimental to the product.  I feel like Asus has worked a lot of the kinks out and did a good job with the integration.  I've really considered the Transformer Prime since it started getting the ICS update, but at the same price as an iPad, couldn't quite justify it.  But, this more budget friendly TF300T is a good compromise to the Prime with it still having a Tegra 3 and 1GB of RAM.My perspective, in looking for a tablet, is mostly that it is a toy and that's why it's taken me 2 years to finally purchase one.  This tablet offers a few features (through the keyboard dock) that make it more versatile than others.  The keyboard dock essentially makes it an Anroid running netbook, complete with a full size USB port and SD slot.  I can upload pictures from my camera, use USB keyboards and mice, and access files off of flash drive (even office files with Polaris Office).  Now my tablet is a tool and not a toy!I'm an IT tech/sysadmin type and when I carry the on call phone I can connect to my office VPN and remote desktop to my workstation to reset passwords, update file permissions, or do any number of remote support services.  I've also tested the navigation and found the GPS to be rather accurate and usable while driving.I spent around $515 on the TF300T and the keyboard dock, so $16 more than the Prime or the low end \"New\" iPad (though Amazon is showing the 16GB iPad for $550 today).  This is basically the Prime with some budget parts (IPS and not IPS+ screen, etc.), I don't have little plug adapters to lose, I have a battery extending keyboard and it all comes in a stylish little package.  I'm very happy with my TF300T!Update (1 month of ownership) - as noted above, screen bleed started to appear after a week or two of use, I considered returning it, but it is only noticeable in the dark and the reason it is less expensive than the Prime is due to more inexpensive components, ie plastic case.

Some of the tablet-designed apps, especially things like gmail or email apps, are much nicer than using the phone versions on a tablet (i.e., 2x/3x based tablets).* Quad core CPU.  Things *are* much smoother.  The only time I tend to get small glitches/temporary \"freezes\" are when the drive is being accessed heavily, such as app installation.* Double cameras - front and rear.  Skype works great, by the way.* Audio quality - it's a lot better... better bass; the gTablet had a bit of a tinny sound.* Screen - resolution is better I think, or at least seems like it is.  Also, the viewing angle is much better than the gTablet.* Docking option - I don't have this yet, but I may upgrade and get the dock as an almost-laptop-replacement (e-mail, facebook...)* Size - it's much thinner.* Soft keys in ICS - the buttons on the gTablet are really hard to see in the dark (or impossible; I ended up doing it from memory of where they are).  The only physical buttons on the TF300 are the volume and power controls.* GPS and gyroscope.  The gyro makes screen orientation changes much nicer, don't have to shake it to get it to recognize it :)I really don't have many complaints about it.

The wifi has better reception than my Galaxy phone, so Asus have definitely fixed that issue.The screen is actually rather good. Its not as bright or crisp as the 201 (or the 700 when ever it comes out), but unless you have the two side by side, you seriously can't tell. There is no reason to bag this thing for its screen.

But it seems that apart from a few quality control issues, Asus have done a good job.

It holds up very well. The design and build are both very good. It feels light and thin for its size. Some reviewers have commented on the slight lack of color depth in the screen, but I was able to adjust it to my complete satisfaction. Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front. This could have been engineered better, though mechanically, it's fine. I have other Android tablets, most notably the Motorola Xoom, which was billed as a premium tablet when it came out, and it is. The Asus is not quite there in perception of quality, but it is easier to use than the Xoom by a good margin. Part of that is the fact that the Asus has the new Android ICS OS, and part of it is that I prefer the Asus UI over the Xoom's (also, the volume buttons on the Xoom might be the industry's worst). However, one of the main reasons I got this tablet was its upgrade to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and with the exception of the ability to make folders and thereby only needing one screen for all of my apps (I always have many more than I need), I'm NOT impressed with that new operating system. Really don't get what the big deal was. The same can be said for the difference between, say, the UI overlay and older versions of the Android OS on the Amazon Fire and the counterparts of those on the Xoom which had the previous \"big story\" for Android. I know this review is about the Asus, but I want to say that I own 4 android tablet devices using various Android operating systems and user interfaces, and of those the best, easiest to use, most enjoyable combination is the one on the Amazon Fire. If you want a 7\" tablet that is the tablet to buy. That, however, is not a knock on this tablet, and for the money, I think this Asus is the 10\" Android tablet to buy. My only other complaint with the Asus is that the two main installed widgets, while resizable to an extent, are still HUGE after making them as small as I could.Would I buy this tablet again?

It mostly worked, but not always, and not as fast as I'd have preferred, and it took a lot of tweaking. Last week I gave up on it and popped for the ASUS TF300 - I'm so glad I did.The Tegra3 chip in it is fast. Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent. It was a toss-up between this and the ASUS Prime, with the metal case, but the Prime seems to have problems with the GPS and WiFi signal. I guess that metal case blocks out the signal. The display isn't quite as nice as the Prime, but I'll sacrifice a little in the display department to get GPS without the dongle, and WiFi that doesn't fade out when I move more than 5 feet from the router. For the way I use it, it's perfect. It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great. ASUS can be a little hot-or-miss on full assemblies (they made some really stupid decisions on my GX-74 laptop, for example), but this one is a solid win. The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3) version of the OS: It found and applied version 4.3 of the operating system a few days ago. I waited a few days to update this review, to see if any problems cropped up. Nope! And I love it even more. Switching between the screens is faster, smoother, and more seamless. The whole operation is much faster. The only glitch in the upgrade is that my weather app went back to the default (metric) settings, so it was telling me the temperature was 19 degrees.

The really neat part about it to me is that it has a keyboard dock.  The dock  protects the screen a little while also recharging the tablet's battery.  The keyboard also expands the capacity with removable SD cards and USB mass storage.  I can connect my camera directly to my tablet or I can remove the memory card from the camera and insert it into the dock and backup or share them easily without the need to have a laptop.  And of course the best part of the keyboard dock is that you have the full screen devoted to your application without a touch keyboard taking up precious screen real estate.  Other devices can connect to keyboards via Bluetooth, but then you still need something to hold the tablet up.  The keyboard dock does this as well as to recharge the tablet battery!Recently I used the tablet while shopping for a washing machine.  The included SuperNote app allowed me to easily intermix photographs, handwriting, typing, and drawings while taking notes of what we liked and didn't like about each unit.

Maybe I have been one of the lucky ones, I dont know. The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen. It is a finger print magnet.

I have both now (running ICS on Slider) and though I like both a lot, I do have opinions on their differences:Build/Fit/Finish:  The SL101 wins.  Apart from the somewhat odd keyboard sliding mechanism, the SL101 has an awesome feel.  Rubberized surfaces, rounded/beveled edges, two-tone styling.  The TF300 is plastic.  The grip made with grooves in the plastic on the back give an odd feeling.  Almost tickles when you move your fingers across it.  I prefer the rubberized surface much more.Performance:  Of course, the specs tell you that the TF300 is the winner.  And it is.  However, it is just the barest perception of a difference when used side-by-side for normal use.  I'm going to reserve judgment though for gaming.  No noticeable difference in the games I do play, but then I haven't really gotten a game that is built for the Tegra 3 yet.  I notice that there are some games you can only get for the Tegra 3, so even then, I wouldn't be able to do a comparison.  That in and of itself is a comparison ...  Available games:  TF300 wins again.Cameras:  TF300 takes it.  Not just because of Megapixels, but the image is less grainy.  There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.  It is really grainy.  This includes the front-facing camera as well.  The other thing to consider is video conferencing.  The TF300 takes it there too.  The image is better and with the dock you can easily adjust the angle of the camera.  The SL101 has a fixed angle, and it is some what \"up your nose\".Typing:  TF300 wins.  The keyboard on the SL101 takes a little getting used to, but the TF300 is natural right off the bat.  The button to turn off the mouse pad is your best friend, because the mouse is very easy to touch with your thumb while you type and in turn moves focus on your screen to something else.  Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.  It does better with touch.  Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.  I use it all the time.  It's just not as nice.  Plus, the TF300 comes with an extra row of very useful keys, and of the keys that the SL101 does have, I think their location on the TF300 is better.Touch while propped up with Keyboard:  SL101 wins.  The angle I was complaining about before for video conferencing is actually why I prefer the SL101 in all other uses.  The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.  It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.  The TF300 reach and angle are very different.  It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.  Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.  Touching the screen tips the balance.  Of course, this may be the point where you decide that using the mouse pad is the best choice for the TF300.  Personally, the mouse to me is not a desirable feature for a device based on touching.Screen:  SL101 wins.  There is nothing wrong with the TF300 screen, but side-by-side, the SL101 seems more vibrant and has better darkness (contrast).  It is still pretty close though and I wouldn't make a choice based on that alone.Battery:  TF300 wins.  I haven't actually run a test to prove this side-by-side, but by all reports, and especially given the TF300 dock carries an extra battery, it should win.Weight:  No winner.  This one is apples to oranges.  The SL101 has a keyboard built into it and is marginally lighter than the TF300 with the keyboard attached.  The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.  The TF300 when detached from the keyboard is very light.  Overall, I prefer the feel of the SL101, with or without the keyboard extended.So, that wraps it up.  I personally think that it is unfortunate ASUS seems to be dropping the SL101 form-factor.  I guess it didn't sell that well, but all thing being equal between devices, I'd prefer it.  Here though, all things are not equal.  The TF300 has some other advantages that might tip into your favor.  If asked which one I would keep though, it would still be the SL101 slider.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer support from ASUS", "Author": "lpedreros", "ReviewID": "R2PC6UII5MSVW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet, along with the Transformer Prime have horrible GPS lock issues.

This time I read an article in consumer reports that compared it to the 500 dollar ipad. They said it did everything the ipad did at a fraction of the cost, and went on, and on about how great this thing was. So..............I bought it. When It came, I got a real nice surprise in that it was supposed to have a 32 gigabye hard drive. When it came, it had a 64 gig drive. I was smiling like a dead pig laying in the sun shine on a hot day. About a week after I bought it though. I noticed that a couple of minutes after I turned it off. It came back on, and rebooted itself. It stayed on for a minute, then shut down, and a minute later, rebooted again. While it is running, if you just run you finger over the start button, (your supposed to hold it down for 2 seconds to work it) it will immediately go black like it has shut down. If you barely touch it again it immediately lights back up, telling me that it wasn't shut down, but maybe had gone into the sleep mode.

People are moaning and groaning about everything that Asus makes, saying that they can get no satisfaction on anything.I'm as hacked off with Consumer Reports as I am with Asus over this.

Free stuff is always no good, so I guess free advise is the same way.I took it to my computer repairman to try to fix it...........nope, it is a throw away thing as all tablets are I found out. You can't even open it up without tearing it up. If it was just the off on switch that was bad, I could replace that with any kind of off on switch. I don't care what it would have looked like.I am to the point now, that every time I pass by it, I am tempted to very gently lay it on the floor, then jump right in the middle of the screen with both feet.

A family member had this still in the box and let me try it out with the keyboard, very generous of them.  I charged it and set it up with my accounts.  The screen resolution is great but is very glossy.  I remedied this with a matte finish screen protector I cut to fit and that made it awesome to use in meetings under bright florescent lighting.  The keyboard is outstanding and is every bit as capable as the major fruit brand tablets.  The battery life with the tablet by its own is sufficient to get me through a business day.  With the keyboard attached with the added battery it will last forever and I can go 3-4 days between charges with moderate use.  I have since sold my older fruit brand tablet and purchased this from my family member.  Having the ability to expand memory and a standard USB port on the keyboard really sets this apart.  I can easy snag and share files from colleagues thumb drives or SD cards.  I suggest a matte finish screen protector for this item to help with the glare.I have read some reviews of individuals tables rebooting at random.  I have been using this as my sole tablet and even replaced my laptop in most cases.  I have not had this issue.  I downloaded the usual apps, Netflix, Pandora, and a couple of games and still no problem.  With all the privacy you give up when you accept an app to download I am very selective on what I will download.  I wonder if problems occur when you download and delete lots of apps?

I had a Samsung tablet that I barely used because it just didn't do what I needed it to do.  I had looked into the Transformer tablets before I bought the Samsung but it was a little more than I wanted to spend at the time.  When I stumbled across this bundle for a really good price I went ahead and ordered it.  10 minutes later I tried to cancel but apparently Amazon was faster than me and I didn't beat it.  When it arrived I almost didn't open it and just sent it back.  Curiosity got the best of me and I did.And dang it, I love it.  This is what I want in a tablet.  The keyboard dock turns it into almost a netbook so that you can type well without lag or connection problems (Something I had with every keyboard I tried to pair with the Samsung).  The dock also gives it more battery life to run off of.The screen is nice and the sound is ok (I'll give Sumsung props on sound... it is a bit better than the ASUS here.)  Unlike the samsung which seemed to lag on most everything but the simplest of games, the ASUS is pretty quick.  Some web pages are a little slow to load, but quick enough that I'm not frustrated with them.  Let's face it, this is a tablet, not a powerhouse computer and it's not going to be as fast.  And that's ok.This thing isn't filled with a bunch of junk software like the Sumsung was either.  Sure, there are some things on there from Asus and such, but nothing like with the other.  A+ to Asus for keeping the bloatware to a minimum.This is the only tablet I've seen with the USB connection as well, so you can drop a thumb drive or connect it to an external drive if need be.  Nicely done Asus.The cord they sent with it to charge is stupidly short.  Seriously Asus.  This was a good idea how?  I ordered another one.The ASUS weather program has never worked.  Even after upgrading the OS.  I don't know why.  It always just says unavailable.Honestly, those are really the only negative things I have to say about it.  I wanted something that could take the place of my netbook when I traveled or went to work and this does the job nicely.  I've had it a few weeks now and have been very pleased with it.  I did do the OS upgrade as mentioned before, but I didn't care for the newer interface so I swapped back to the other one.  Happy they gave you the option between the two instead of just overriding the old one like others... *cough*samsung*cough*As long as it holds up I'm a happy camper.  Very pleased with it and just recommended it to a friend who wanted something like I did as a matter of fact.  This is a great option for those who wantnetbook/laptop functionality but still want a tablet.2-12-14We happened to have a slow shift at work the other day and I spent nearly 8 hours straight watching Veronica Mars.  The battery/dock was NOT fully charged and I still had charge when I was done.  Sometimes the picture or sound glitch, but it varies with the things I watch.I've had it reboot itself a few times, which is insanely irritating.  I tried to pint it down to a specific software or action that I'm doing but I can't so far.  It happened 3 times in the span of a few weeks but hasn't done it since then.Overall I'm still pleased with it.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth it, choose different manufacturer", "Author": "Student4455", "ReviewID": "R1AT2FUZ8OD36P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Arrived without warranty card or manual and with the WRONG size charger.

If you're interested in buying a tablet for its advantages of size, weight and portability, you now have several alternatives to the default purchase of the IPAD including this ASUS 32gb TF300T.In an attempt to overcome the annoyance of using an on-screen keyboard, the ASUS has a detachable keyboard dock - a brilliant idea which mostly works well, but the disproportion in weight between the tablet & keyboard means some users might find it less than stable on a table top. If you're using it in a less formal setting (like lying on a sofa) it's OK.Battery life is very good particularly on the power-saving settings. This is important because the whole idea of a tablet is to use it like a phone, on the move away from a power source, so few people will ever use one connected to the mains. One caution: when first charging out-of-the-box, we couldn't get any life from it at all - not even a charging light, and it took some fiddling around to get it to finally accept charge. Since this initial problem charging has been trouble-free.The screen doesn't quite have the clear resolution of the IPAD but is very good and more than adequate for a 10.1-inch portable. You can connect multiple-USB devices like a laptop and have the usual big menu of free Android aps to choose from.pfd is fine but it won't do adobe flash player and won't run MS outlook programs, so you only have webmail. The browser is surprisingly good with a fast connection, video & in-built speaker acceptable though it won't fill a room with music.Overall I think the ASUS is a good alternative to a laptop if you want a device predominantly for web surfing, media & webmail. The detachable keyboard is a great innovation & removes the objection many people have had to the fiddly & frustrating onscreen keyboard of the IPAD. However:* It won't replace a Windows or Mac notebook for speed, or run business software like Sage, or Autocad, or even MS Office; but if a browser and media player is predominantly what you want, it's great* It's not that much cheaper (if at all) than a much more capable budget notebook* It's not that much lighter or more portable than a lightweight notebook either* On the other hand it's not as pocketable as a smartphoneOf course, in a couple of years the market will look different again & the tablet as we now know it may be obsolete, replaced with some device infinitely more capable with half the size and weight.

Compare to Galaxy, ASUS pad was not pre-loaded with bunch of company stuff, but rather with some common for Android system programs, quite useful in everyday life. Where were no problems to remove unnecessary soft from the tablet, while Galaxy was pre-loaded with rard to uninstall Samsung junk.Both tablets were used by kids to heavily play state of the art android games and we have seen some glitches on Samsung, but not on ASUS pad.TF300 has 32Gb installed memory and a slot for 64gB card, making it as a perfect replacement for a budjet desktop with almost 100gb memory: checking emails, reading news, surfing internet, editing photos, playing games, watching stream shows are flawless. The only thing it is not quite good at is making photos - the camera does not have flashlight, so photos are often gloomy. However, it is not the major intended use of this pad.As soon as Android 4.2 was released, this pad showed a message about available system update.

This means that you cannot effectively charge this tablet via any method except the wall wart, and I imagine you shouldn't use the wall wart with any other device.

I first push/hold the power button as the manual mentions, but nothing happen. Then I plug it in to charge, and try to turn it on again, still no luck. Based on some other reviews here, I know that mine is DOA.The reason I still give it a 3 stars solely because the service the Amazon provides. The shipping is lightening fast and replacement is already in process. Even though it is a bit disappointed of not be able to play with my first tablet, things happen and Amazon makes it so that I don't feel worse.I have heard that many others have the same problem of DOA with this tablet. This only decrease my perception toward Asus brand image. Hope the replacement wont be a disappointment as well.Will update my input when I get the chance to play with the tablet.----Update 05/12--------Turn out, it was my terrible mistake to quickly jump into the conclusion that the tablet is DOA. After leaving it on charging for 30 minutes, the tablet boost up without any problem. So I think that if you think that your unit is DOA, try to keep it charge for 30mins then try power it on again. I think that with all the problems that I have read on the internet, it makes me become too fast to think that it is defected without even give it a shot.First impression, just as many other reviews, it is light, and a bit small from what I thought. Keep in mind, this is my first tablet, ever, so my thoughts were based on the pictures I have seen. The plastic feel on the back is good and I have no problem with it.The only negative comments I have so far is the fingerprint magnet of the screen and the charging port on the tablet give you a feeling that it would break easily. When the port is plugged in, it feels very loose and I hope it won't break accidentally too soon.----Update 05/22--------3 days later from when I discovered my mistake of DOA, I found out that the tablet produces some clicking sounds when I use my fingers to slightly press the bottom (where the connector is). So I contacted Amazon and replace it with another one.2 days later, my screen (left side) started to flick as many others in the Transformer's forum indicate. However, I researched and found out that it is due to firmware, not hardware. I soon received an update from Asus and the screen has not flick ever since.My only draw back, so far, is the lack of its accessory. I ordered a anti-screen protector from a seller on Amazon. Despite the description say that it's custom made for TF300, it's not. It's for TF201, the Prime. But the seller admitted it and give me refund.

Was really expecting a great experience with quad-core and ICS.  WiFi is good but many web pages \"hang\" on loading and you get the wait / close box.  Pushing the wait usually makes them available quickly.Color rendition is mediocre.  I have a color calibrated desktop system that I use for PhotoShop CS and the photos that I loaded to the tablet from my PC show washed out compared to my desktop, although I can tolerate it to some extent as I will just be using the tablet primarily for field storage.  A software fix could be done to let us custom change the color temperature and contrast if we choose rather than just one setting.  Using a Class 6 microSD card for external storage and the tablet takes a LOT of time to complete the image load from the card to the screen.  Expected a faster load time from a quad-core processor, but again, I can tolerate it as they are large .jpg files.Polaris Office, while nice, does not load properly on my tablet.  When it comes up, it shows a screen very similar to file manager, not the screen that I have seen in reviews where it comes up to a choice between word/xcel/power point programs.  I can get to them from the \"file manager\" with several \"clicks\" but I have tried other tablets where a different screen comes up.  Don't know if it is just the version that I have (3.0 where a galaxy tab that I tried out this afternoon had 4.0).  Won't really use it that much but would be nice to have it correct and can find no way of changing the boot up sequence of the program.Screen is a total FINGERPRINT MAGNET.  Possibly the worst I have seen in a tablet.  Have had the Thrive and Galaxy Tab for myself and my wife has an iPad2 (the cleanest for fingerprints I might add)While I am far and away NOT an Apple fanboy, I am impressed with the iPad2 in that it will load websites faster (tested with the wife on same sites), the build quality is much better and whatever the coating is on their glass, it is great.  All that being said, I hate not being able to move files the way I want to, not the way Apple demands that I have to and I also do not want to have to be tethered to iTunes.One other gripe, and it is common with Android, why can we not get a music player that will allow uploading of playlists.  I despise having to upload music and then have to manually create playlists and even then it is a 50-50 shot as to whether Android will properly recognize them correctly.  Easier on the tablet than the phone but still a pain.Was really shocked to see that all of the ASUS/Android operating system and preloaded software was taking up in excess of 3gb of space.In closing, I do like the Asus tf300 but it is not the \"great experience\" that I was expecting.

If ambient lighting is turned on it goes to the midpoint and then just sits there forever without any dynamic adjustments.  I'm sure this is a software issue and it doesn't really bother me but I thought others might want to comment about possible solutions, etc._______________________________ORIGINAL TEXT______________________This is my first tablet.  I prefer the flexibility of Android and I already have an Android phone so I decided to give this one a try.  I also do not want to install iTunes on any of my PCs.I decided to purchase a tablet because I do not like having to boot up or keep a PC running just to check my email, surf the web, watch a video, or read an ebook.  I decided to go with this unit because it's being sold at a reasonable price for its specs.  I really wanted a tablet with a USB port so I could transfer photos in the field but no models so equipped were/are available at the time with an IPS screen (another one of my requirements).  In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.  I do not believe in spending big bucks on something that I can't do real work on so I stayed away from the expensive iPads and premium Android models like the ASUS Transformer Prime.I have mixed feelings after using the TF300 for a couple of days.  It is speedy and comes with plenty of RAM.  RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.  Pretty much all the programs that I have tried on it fly and I haven't noticed any bothersome slow-downs that some have noted.  The USB adapter works but I would have much preferred a cable because it becomes a rather long moment arm hanging off of a delicate connector when it is in place.  Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.  For normal use this is fine because the screen flips automatically but some programs, mainly games, insist on displaying in only in native orientation.The screen is more than bright enough for indoor use but not enough for daylight outdoors.  It's also a HUGE finger magnet. At this point in time, the \"Next iPad\", with its much higher resolution screen (I refuse to use their incorrect marketing jargon for it) just wipes the floor with all the Android tablet displays out there.  Hopefully that will change sometime soon but I foresee the manufacturers charging a large premium for the increased resolution.  The screen does have some minor light bleed that is noticeable when the background is black but nothing that I consider overly objectionable.  What bothers me more is that when the background is completely white I can see a slight yellowish gradient near the top.  Not sure if most people would notice this but it bothers me; especially when I'm reading ebooks.  Both Wifi and GPS work great.  I wish there were speakers on both, or even three sides like some competitors have, but they sound clear and are loud enough for me.  If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.  The build quality (or maybe the internal design) is not what I would call \"bulletproof\".  When I push on the screen near the left bezel I can feel it flex.  If I look into the microSD port I can see the opening change shape when it's flexing.  I'm worried about the long term repercussions of this.  The screen feels solid around the rest of the bezel perimeter.  I checked on the display model at a local store and it has the same issue so unfortunately this does not appear to be an isolated case.Being a fan of Google Sky, I quickly found that ecompass to be terrible.  It's off by about 90 degrees and very inconsistent.  I've tried calibrating it and trying different applications with no luck.  If anyone knows how to put this tablet into diagnostic mode let me know so I can figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.I'll try to update this review as I log more time with the unit.  For now I give it 4 stars because of the bang for the buck.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Awesome what I Expected", "Author": "ahmad_93ah", "ReviewID": "R2JZEIZ9I50O8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is awesome love the feeling of the tablet in my hands, not much difference with the prime actually even though the back is plastic it still feels like great quality.

I got it after trying a friend's iPad. Since I've an android phone, normally I wanted an android tablet and I guess I was never a fan of apple's \"hermit kingdom\" policy. Bought it for $299 which I thought was excellent considering the hardware was comparable to the iPad, the OS I'm afraid wasn't. The android version tailored by Asus for this tablet is definitely not as fluid as the iPad or the android OS in my phone for that matter. First of out of the box, it could not play flash videos in sites like say... Yahoo! With a little research I was however able to make it play flash in such sites by following instructions from a site I got off Google and downloading and installing a piece of software. The whole process wasn't terribly difficult but I figured, I shouldn't have to do that in the first place since people normally buy devices like this for that purpose. Then there is the problem with streaming videos through the stock YouTube app and YouTube with the stock browser and even with Google chrome, some videos will just take forever to load and will stop to again buffer. Some videos though will be flawless, which is odd to me since I never have this problem with the android in my phone (android ver. 2.3) also its an older HTC phone with far inferior hardware than this tablet and streaming though Verizon FiOS, which leads me to believe that Asus' software is the real problem here. Browsing is also often painstaking since websites will delay loading and will freeze while doing so prompting it to show a little box asking you if you want to close the app or wait. This I'm afraid happens quite too often to ignore. And now the real problem which prompted me to write this review, the tablet recently will not turn on after going to sleep even with a fully charged battery. This happened 4 times already and I had to call Asus' tech support twice about the problem. We were able to work it out  and the solution was pretty simple but they could not offer me an explanation as to why this is happening but a simple research through Google reveals I'm not alone. Some people's tf300t and not a lot  i should note have had the same problem as mine. These are just some of the issues I thought I had to share here for others considering to buy this tablet. On the plus side, the screen is wonderful. I'm into dslr photography and the details of my pictures on the screen is just amazing. Listening to music is also quite pleasing with the stock speakers. And lastly the tablet is very sleek, thin and light. But honestly if I have known the issues with this tablet before I bought it, I would have spent a little more and got a Samsung tablet instead and no I will not recommend this one to my family or friends.

Buggy soft, nice hardware.", "Author": "Schizophriend", "ReviewID": "RZ3R5L2SL0QM4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update: The tablet has been serviced twice (motherboard replacement etc.) to no avail. The bottom line is it's hardware is fine but ADB does not work in the bootloader (i.e., no easy full backup of the system) and attempts to pair with my Lenovo smartphone lead to bootloops after the next restart and turning Bluetooth on.* * *This is my first tablet but I also use an inexpensive Android 4.0.3 phone that proved much more stable in my experience. Same is true for my ASUS netbook, and that was the reason for choosing TF300T. In my opinion, its hardware is decent for the price and is probably not flawed in my device. Yet while its failure to handle some videos might be attributed to software players, three bootloop crashes in a couple of months are most likely caused by ASUS firmware and imperfections in (its version of?) Android. Most disturbingly, none of the problems could be solved by any means other than a full wipe.Two of the crashes occured each within a day after updating ASUS firmware (with hardly any 3d party software installed or ASUS applications disabled). In the first case the tablet restarted endlessly, in the second it got stuck at ASUS logo while loading the system. The third bootloop occured a few minutes after a restart, when the tablet was not in use and the only application launched was the default Android Bluetooth connection.I am an experienced problem solver in other systems yet TF300T forced me to waste quite a few hours of forum reading and experimenting with recovery options - all to no avail (currently I do not intend to root or unlock the device).Asus email support was remarkably insulting both in its complete irrelevance and in further robotic persistence to remain utterly inadequate. This rating would have been 3 stars if the representative had demonstrated any inclination to actually read my message. Compiling a detailed and well-structured description of the problem + my initial troubleshooting was a complete waste of time. Since I reside outside US, sending the device for warranty repair or exchange is not a practical solution at this point.To sum up, my tablet charges fast and works reasonably well for a while but is not reliable in certain usage scenarios. I believe the hardware design of this model is OK but the Android firmware has been problematic so far.

While the Fire is the best at reading ebooks and with Amazon based services, I can now see where it is severely restrained compared to full fledged tablets, since it meant to be mainly an Amazon based device.The TF300 is quite a leap forward in abilities and options. And that's not including the keyboard.  The TF300 runs the few games and apps I have tried, so far, without a glitch.Pros:It is extremely fast.It has lots of memory( I got the 32gig), and options to add more( micro sd on the tablet and full sd card with the keyboard).The 10 inch display is stunningly beautiful.The tablet is not too heavy for its size.The wifi is very strong.The GPS works great.The body of the tablet feels solid.Keyboard option.I haven't found any of the problems others have so far.

Speakers widely separated at the top of the tablet would have been better.(Still, the sound quality is  very, very good and plenty loud.)The ports could have used covers.

With the exception of the Prime's aluminum body, longer-lasting battery, camera flash, and moderately brighter screen, the TF300 is practically identical while costing significantly less.The TF300 has the same Tegra 3 quad-core processor as the Prime, and it shows; it's fast, powerful, and fluid. It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together). Still, it's far louder than even my laptop. When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black. That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but the screen on my Galaxy S2 blows this thing out of the water. The Pad's colors aren't as vibrant and text/images aren't nearly as sharp. It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors. If you don't already have a mobile device with amazingly high resolution and vivid colors, then you probably won't have any problems with the Pad's screen at all. The native browser is unforgivably slow and buggy at times; hopefully, they rectify this in a future update.As for the battery, I'm impressed. I'm not a heavy user (I mainly use my tablet to play word games and do light web browsing and reading), so I find that I rarely have to charge my TF300, perhaps once every other day. Apps that are optimized for tablets really shine on this device thanks to ICS and the quad-core processor. With the exception of the browsers, I've never had problems with any of the apps that were actually optimized or specifically designed for tablets. I love the keyboard dock. It is, of course, significantly smaller than a regular desktop or laptop keyboard, but if you're at all comfortable with typing on netbooks then you shouldn't have any problems using the keyboard dock. I have fairly large hands for a man, but I still find the keyboard dock adequate, just make sure you turn off the hyper-sensitive track pad while you're typing. Oh, and the keyboard charges the Pad when you dock it, provided the keyboard dock has an adequate charge.The keyboard dock leads me to my biggest and final gripe with the TF300: it doesn't come with productivity software. This should have been a no-brainer, especially when one considers that Asus made such a functional keyboard dock in the first place. Yes, you can use Google Docs (now merged into Google Drive, if you weren't yet aware), but that presents you with Google Docs' main shortcoming: you need to be connected to the internet in order to use it. If I could open, edit, save, and create word documents without having to be connected to the internet I'd probably get rid of my laptop, or at least relegate it to the same dust-gathering status of my netbook.So, that was my rather long review of the Asus Transformer Pad TF300. I'm truly pleased with it, despite some shortcomings. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for an Android tablet. If you've always wanted the Asus Transformer Prime but were put off by its sticker price and/or GPS/wireless issues, then this is absolutely the tablet for you.UPDATE-6/17/2012It was brought to my attention that the included software, Polaris Office, is a productivity suite. I opened it up briefly when I first received my tablet and assumed it was nothing more than a file manager, but you can, in fact, create word documents and such with it.UPDATE-6/18/2012After doing some research for a problem I was having with Polaris Office (it would open my Word documents but it wouldn't let me edit them) I found out that there is a major bug with this software that causes random, irreparable corruption of files.

My smartphone boots up fast and quickly syncs all apps and downloads as needed. That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new. I\u2019ve seen other posts state that a tablet is not meant to be turned off preventing boot up issues. That\u2019s a false crutch and it still doesn\u2019t solve this unit\u2019s intermittent Wi-Fi failure. All the other features of this tablet can be compared favorably with all other apps on the market. The ASUS has a terrific screen and nice size/form matter. Too bad as I really wanted this tablet to come thru.

For exactly one year, it worked well.  Then one night I plugged it in to charge overnight and woke up the next morning to find that both the connector on the charger and the charger port had overheated and melted.  I contacted ASUS customer service.  I was assured that my tablet was still under warranty and that I could send it in for assessment and possible repair.  I received an e-mail in which I was assigned an RMA# and given mailing instructions for sending in my tablet.  In accordance with the ASUS mailing instructions, I sent in my tablet.  The service center received the tablet three weeks ago on April 30th.  As of right now, I have not received any updates or information from the repair center regarding the status of my tablet.  I have called customer service twice, once last week and the second time yesterday to see if I could get any information.  Both times I was told that I would receive an e-mail from the service/repair center in the future, but they could not say how soon that would be.  The service representative I spoke to last week said that he would elevate status of my case, which I guess means I might hear from ASUS after a month or two instead of three or four.  The service representative I spoke to yesterday also said that he would elevate the status of my case.  I told him that a representative had already done that last week.  After a moment, he confirmed that the status had been elevated last week.  At that point, he could do nothing more for me other than to once again assure me that I would receive an e-mail at some later date.

Unfortunately, Asus also likes to clog them up with a custom skin that slows everything down to a crawl. The TF300 has a great developer community. I ROMed this tablet with a Kitkat (android 4.4) ROM and it runs very very well now. If you are not going to ROM it you might be disappointed with the speed of the device using the stock ROM it comes with. Especially if you are going to use their feature to have multiple accounts.The display is good but does not do gradients well. Good visibility and good view angles. But in gradients you will see some banding. The resolution is good but not great (not in the post Retina-display era of Android anyway). Color reproduction is excellent though.Battery life has generally been very good for me though it will not hold up great under gaming. It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off. The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have. With the optional keyboard dock, expansion and battery life are increased dramatically even further. The keyboard is very well implemented (snaps on and off securely). Though it makes the tablet a lot heavier and bulkier.So if you are looking for a mid-range tablet and do not want to wait for the new Nexus 10, this is a good alternative.

I don't have any drops or cracks in it, but it just started becoming inconsistent in recognizing touches and now it pretty much recognizes nothing. Fortunately, I have the docking keyboard and the mouse worked so I retained some function.But a tablet isn't worth much without touchscreen capability -- docking keyboard or no. It's at a local shop for repair and will probably cost me about $150-$175. I'm not thrilled about it, but if it works again that's better than losing it's functionality completely and still cheaper than replacing it with another 10\" tablet.I googled and found a lot of people complaining about the touchscreen/digitizer issues. Just know that this is a problem going in.Otherwise, as far as functionality, screen quality (visually), and ease of use I really like the tablet.

The camera is the highlight of it in which it works great with no embedded Flash. I worked for two hours after  unboxing  with the original  Ice Cream Sandwich  OS in which the speed was amazing , but after updating to Jelly Bean 4.2 the same day, I saw a decline in response time specially while browsing with the stock browser.  I reset the  tablet, but the Jelly Bean would stay on it after the update even after the reset. Android will give you the opportunity in the settings to use the 4.1 Launcher which feels more like the friendly Ice Cream sandwich interface , but still no improvement in the Performance and the speed of the tablet  is noted.  The response time, and performance is still acceptable after the update, so no significant issue is noted except couple of ultimate freeze in which I had to restart the tablet,  But it's sad to see such a wonderful product has issues with Android 4.2 , so I hope the Next Android OS would be a fix for the Asus Transformer .I'm also not a fan for the location of the speaker, why is there a Mono speaker located on the back of the tablet ?  the Mono speaker's sound is fine , but why on the back specially when many people use the protective case which covers the speaker ?Another problem noted is with the Light Sensor. It's not sensitive enough, and always under the normal conditions set the light to the lowest possible setting, only in the actual dark , it will raise the brightness from the lowest settings. I don't know if that's the problem with my table or all the Asus TF300 , but I had to turn the feature off and use the manual brightness adjuster.So I'm taking one star off as the result of the stability and speed issues with Android 4.2 , Location of the Speaker, and light sensor  otherwise everything else is perfect so far.

The tablet itself doesn't have a USB port.

Or at least I dont know how to. I know there is an app to sync the playlist but is there anything for accessing the photos stored on the iTouch?- Polaris Office is ok but of course doesn't have that much features.

I was originally looking at a slightly older pair available at another retailer as refurbished.  However, after considering that an update to Jelly Bean is important to me I decided that Asus's statement regarding the update being planned \"in the coming months\" and the quad core processor were worth the bump in price.The aesthetics are pleasant.  I knew I was buying a 10\" tablet so the overall size and weight are inline with what I was expecting and have found it natural to use.  The screen does collect finger prints and debris easily so I'm experimenting with a stylus and have a screen protector on order to see if that will help.I am a fan of Ice Cream Sandwich (and looking forward to Jelly Bean), so while that's not a unique feature of this tablet, but they do pair well together.  The apps/widgets/etc included are OK, the Note app in particular seems to have potential.  However I like that there are not a ton of unnecessary apps/bloatware included that you can't remove; it provides a nice, clean, simple environment for you to go crazy downloading apps catered to your needs/wants.  Contrast this to my smartphone which came with a dozen apps I never asked for nor want but take up precious space and constantly want updates and I'm a happy camper.As for performance of the tablet itself, I have seen one or two hiccups including apps closing themselves and lag/slow performance.  I'm not certain yet if it's relating to the specs of the device itself, the performance settings being used (Asus includes an easy to access setting for low/mid/high performance to help manage the trade off on battery life/performance), or the apps I've installed.  Hoping to experiment more and zero in on a possible cause.Overall I'm happy though, with my few minor concerns so far either having work arounds or being \"livable\".", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding, Easy to use, even for a six year old.,", "Author": "W.

They have not been extremely frequent, and as long as I keep the cached and running processes under control, I haven't observed very many of these reboots.Additionally, I have noticed a very tiny mark of pixel damage on the screen, which is only visible on dark or black backgrounds - if this becomes worse, I will contact the manufacturer, but I haven't done anything to cause impact to the screen, so this may be an individual unit issue.In all, aside from the spontaneous reboots, I am very satisfied with this product.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should have bought this great device a long while ago!", "Author": "W.

With the connection of the laptop dock, it really feels as if it's a full-on netbook.  I have an Asus EE netbook and really feels almost no different, except that it has all the benefits of Android. And with Chrome now running on the laptop and the ability \"to request desktop site\" when you're going to web pages, it adds to the feeling of being a netbook.I bought the tablet and keyboard dock for the purpose of using it as a tablet to take notes on at work (replacing my aging HTC Flyer) and as something with a big enough screen that when I travel for work, I can easily view files, etc.  And of course, it allows me to use all of my personal Android goodies.From a hardware perspective, it has 2 SD card slots (one on the tablet & one on the laptop dock) as well as a USB slot for native USB support, and a mini HDMI out cable too.I did debate between the TF200/201 and this device, but at a $100 cheaper and a few items fixed in the 300, it was just the right choice (although it is a slight bit heavier than the 200).Can't say enough about this device, very, very pleased with my purchase!

They were built like tanks. My first two ASUS laptops from 10+ years ago STILL run today... and I never turned them off, they run 24/7.NOW this ASUS tab worked fairly well for the first 2 weeks. The unit itself looks great. The plastic backing doesn't look cheap at all. The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker. I did have some problems with the light sensor that was suppose to detect environmental light levels and adjust the display automatically... It just didn't work. Where ever I was, when set on auto, the tablet screen always adjusted to the most dim. Another problem is the battery display. My battery can be charging or fully charged and the unit would give me the most random battery status. \"52seconds on 100% battery charge..\" really? The Android OS isn't polished either. Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase. Adobe reader was laggy, and google chrome as well (without flash support???). The weather app was useless on auto detect mode as well... I had to manually set my location...I could deal with all this except 2 days ago the tablet started randomly and frequently rebooting itself. I would set it aside and when I come back to it, I'd notice the tablet had shut down. After a bit of trial and error I found the unit was defective. It was sensitive to me placing it on any surface, even on the couch or the carpet. I wasn't throwing it either and from day one I had a hard case placed on it. I'm sure this is a QA issue. I'll give the tablet another chance and it's been shipped back to Amazon for a replacement.UPDATE: First of all the Amazon replacement program is AMAZING. I never left the house! Makes me not worry about ordering from this company ever. Printed my labels and called, they dropped off a new unit the same day they picked up my defective one. This unit works perfectly, no more shut downs for no reason. The OS is running smoother now with the latest update. The ASUS weather is working finally, as well as the auto dim option. Adobe's update also makes my image heavy pdfs run alot smoother. I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.

A  couple of the android application seem to be missing a functions or two , but nothing serious, and  would rate my TF300T purchase a  5.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Tablet Review.", "Author": "J. Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R64WF57IPMYIF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this tablet up on Saturday and couldn't wait to get it home and have some fun. After waiting patiently for several months for this to be released.  This model is replacing the original Transformer the TF101 and not the TF201 Transformer Prime even though some say they took what was wrong with the TF201 Transformer prime and fixed it for this model.  I think of this tablet as a hybrid of the prior 2 tablets.  The repalcement for the Transformer Prime is coming out later this year and will be the TF700 Infinity Pad.  I will first go into the pro's of this unit in no certain order, and it is possible that a Pro can also be a con.PROS:Keeps the slim profile of the Transformer Prime and the 10 in screen and connection capabilities of both.Plastic body instead of all-metal chassis.  Some will see that as a con, but, I don't becaue it allows the wi-fi to have a better reach and stronger signal with no GPS issues.Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor which also comes with a bonus core to do low level tasks such as email to help with battery life.DDR3 Ram with 10 inch IPS LCD 1280x800 screen with bluetooth and WiFi.Weight.  The tablet only weighs 1.3 pounds.Sofware.  This comes with ICS right out of the box, and updated immediately with a minor update once activated.  Asus is the king of updates so you know you will get updates before everyone else. Cough...cough Samsung.  I belive this will be one of the first tablets to get Jelly Bean once it's made available.  Also Asus does not load this tablet down with too much bloatware, and no skins.  You get a very close vanilla android experience, which is what most people prefer.Benchmarks.  The benchmarks are off the charts on all test that I ran, and comes close to the Transformer Prime scores.Power Modes.  Asus provides 3 modes.  Power save mode, balance, and Performance mode.  This takes advantage of the 4 plus 1 design of the Tegra 3 processor, with a 5th core that engages druing periods of low processor activity.  So, you can change the tablet to power save mode while travelling or doing low level tasks that does not require all of the processor as say playing a game.Nvidias Tegra Zone.  On Tegra only devices you get acces to tegra optimized games that you will not normally find in the Google Play Store.Camera/Video.  It is by far not the best camera, but, is better than most other tablets I have used, and since most people do not use thier tablet for pictures, I do no think it will be a issue.Pricing, at $349 for the 16GB and $399 for the 32GB Asus came out swinging with top of the line features at a budget price.  The closest competitior right now with a Tegra 3 would be the new Acer Iconia Tab A510, but at $70 more for the base model and $50 more for the 32GB.Dock.  This is one of the real beauties of the Transformer is the capability to add a dock for $149 transforming your tablet into a netbook increasing the battery life also.  By making a dock the Transfomer does allow for longer emails and it is now possible to get some work done using your tablet, and it does act as a screen protector when it is closed.  You can also add a bluetooth mouse and you get a full-sized SD card slot along with the tablets MicroSD card slot.  The dock will also act as a second battery that charges the tablet while attached and you can charge both through a single cable when the tablet is inserted.As you can tell, there are a lot of pros about this tablet on paper, but do the specs on paper match real life use.  We will see with my review below.After only a few hours of setting it up just the way I wanted, and downloading all my apps, the tablet started randomly rebooting.  I though ok, just a minor hiccup and something to keep my eye on, but then the browser kept randomly closing and locking up. When it would lock up a little menu would appear and ask me if I would like to wait or close, I typically pressed wait and after a few seconds it would start back up again.  I tried several different browsers from the google play store thinking it might just be the stock launcher, and I found it to do the same thing.I also found the app market very slow to load also, which should not be happening on a tablet with these specs. My Epic 4g Touch never has this issue, and neither does my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 or 7.0 or Ipad 2.  I also found the screen to be washed out, especially in the app market. It was difficult to read text.  Also, when scrolling up and down the text and pictures would get reall blurry and then you would have to wait for the screen to catch up and the text and pictures get clear.  I also had issues trying to scroll up and down, once again, not very responsive.I often found myself having to touch the screen repeadly to register my selections, it felt like I was touching pure plastic and I often had to touch the screen 3 or 4 times to get it to register my touch. Which was also a knock on previous models.  Asus definitely cut corners on this model and the Prime TF201 is a much better tablet as long as you get the newer models that were made. You also have to keep it on full brightness or the screen gets to dark to use, and at full brightness it makes the screen even more washed out.If this was only $249 I could have lived with these issues, but at this price point you are better off with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 or their new model coming out in a few Weeks.  I also found the overall build quality to be very cheap and if you press on the back to hard you can see the screen bleed, so you might want to be very careful if you carry this in a backpack especially with no gorilla glass.It is possible the model I got was defective because Asus has always had very suspect quality control, and there are other reviews out there stating very similar issues.  So, maybe there are great tables out there, and some that are not, but, it would be hard to recommend this tablet and have to return it 2 or 3 times to find one that works great when there are other options out there such as the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 that will be available for pre-order on May 4th and unless they change the release date should be May 15.I had decided to return the tablet but instead decided to do several factory hard resets and try again.  I did notice now the tablet runs a little bit smoother, but, every now and then when you open a app or the browser it will lock up and give you the option to wait or close, especially when performing mulitple tasks like downloading 3 or 4 apps and surfing the web.  Once again, with the specs of this tablet, that should not be a issue, but, I will give it a few more days and see if it gets better or if Asus states there is a known issue with a fix on the way.  the bottom line is when the tablet works, it works great but the periods of sluggishness can be frustrating.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "WHOMSOEVER Complains about this Tablet Should Be Flogged.", "Author": "Crush KD", "ReviewID": "R2LU2RFGZNMXX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Hands Down the best deal on a Tablet EVER!!!!!TEGRA 3 - CheckAndroid Ice Cream Sandwich - CheckExpandable Drive space - CheckKeyboard Dock - CheckPrice Point vs New iPad - Check, Check, CHEEEEEEECCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKCompetition - Only it's Siblings.....Hahahahahahahahahahaha", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "This would get zero stars if it would let me", "Author": "Jillie422 \"Jill\"", "ReviewID": "R21K9VWPIKXLG2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This piece of trash has been in a drawer or at the shop more than we've used it in the months we've had it.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R1DUKJ246K4YZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these on sale last week.  I loved the specs, memory and price.  Considering the mediocre resolution (1280X800) the screen was actually bright and decent, although it took a little while for me to get used to it, considering it replaced my retina iPad.  I gave the iPad to my wife and switched to Android because I find the widgets and other customizable options to be very useful.  Although the specs of the ASUS look good on paper, the iPad was still much more responsive, especially with games.  Subway Surfers and Adrenaline 7 play flawlessly on the iPad.  The colors are rich and vibrant and the gameplay is smooth with no frame rate issues.  On the ASUS both games had dull colors and suffered from constant frame rate issues including artifacts and occasional stuttering.  I realize the iPad is better optimized for gaming, so I didn't hold this against the ASUS, especially since I spend less than 10% of my tablet time gaming.  That's one of the tradeoffs going from iOS to Android.  The good tradeoffs are the customizable interface and my fave, the widgets.  The TF300 was wonderful for the first week but on the ninth day, two bright spots appeared on the screen.  They were about the size of a pea and appeared in two different areas of the screen.  They were noticeably brighter than the rest of the screen. I exchanged it for another, came home, opened it and immediately scanned top to bottom for screen issues.  The screen was okay other than some backlight bleeding along the edges.  Figuring I was just unlucky with the first one, I settled down with the replacement and started reloading all of my apps and settings.  My joy lasted one day.  On day two a dead pixel just popped up out of nowhere.  I tried t ignore it but it was in a prominent spot of the viewing area.  No matter how hard I tried to ignore it, it attracted my eyes like a magnet.  Needless to say, I returned that one as well and gave up on the TF300.  Call me picky but if I'm paying over $300 for a tablet, I don't think a defect-free display is too much to ask.  I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.

Is responsive, does all kinds of things a tablet should and does it well; when it works right. Got it with keyboard. Glad I did. In August (after Amazon return window closed) Tablet touchscreen stopped responding. Would only work if attached keyboard, used it for a while, then disconnected from keyboard. Searched web and Asus site for support. Found very little info on web, some similar problems but no solutions. Found nothing on Asus support. Very awkward site to negotiate. Removed some apps, no improvement. Have rebooted device multiple times with no results. Lived with sporadic problem for a while then Asus pushed out OS update to Jelly Bean, problem went away. Then it started again a couple of days ago. I wanted to take some photos with it (excellent camera) but no touchscreen response. It sucks when trying to take photos with keyboard attached. I use this tablet for my references for a study I attend and cannot do it with keyboard attached, too many things to hold on my lap. Did not intend to use keyboard for routine work, only for occasional and when traveling. So tablet without touchscreen becomes $500+ paperweight which I don't need.

Struck gold on Amazon when Tien Phan found my complaint on the Amazon site and contacted me. We established email connection and he and I attempted a couple of fixes including a system restore to factory defaults. When those software attempts did not work he determined it had to go back for service and provided me with an RMA to ship it to Texas. Prepared it (I still had original packaging) and sent it off on 11/23. Was able to track progress via shipper's site and the repair with ASUS RMA. Service turnaround was quick and had it back on 12/5. Have used it heavily past two days, no repeat of the screen freezing up. I am pleased with the device, raised it to 4 stars. I'll give it some more time before we get to 5. I am very happy with Tien's work and so happy he found me on Amazon.UPDATE 02/11/2013Wanted to leave a final update to this.

Both tapping and/or pressing on text fields on a web page or on the tablet setup screens often failed -- the sceen would not accept my input.  Sometimes the tablet would mysteriosly bounce the cursor to a different position on the page so that it became impossible to correct wrong characters or choose another field.  The onscreen keyboard has limited keys, including no Tab key!  Another issue is that the icecream 4.0 o/s on this tablet only permits google email setup.  I tried to find online support to find a method to set up a different email program but apparently that capability only existed on earlier versions. Plus the only technical support for this product is a user forum -- Asus does not provide technical support either online or by phone.  Hated the experience!  In fact, I'm changing my initial rating from 3 stars to 2, because writing this review reminds me how unpleasant this whole out-of-the-box, plug-and-NOT-play experience has been.Additional note:  the color choices on Amazon are Blue or White and I ordered Blue; however, the tablet delivered to me is Black.  Not sure if the mistake is Amazon's or the shipper.Update:  I purchased an iPad 2 and am very happy with it:  The out-of-the-box set up experience with Apple is great, easy, up and going, just like you expect; the Android Asus Transformer doesn't come close in comparison.  And, the difference in performance of the touchscreen in the iPad compared to the  Asus Transformer is night and day:  The iPad touch is responsive, easy, and awesome -- just a great screen!", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST TABLET EVER AND I CONSIDER THIS TABLET THE BEST", "Author": "mau", "ReviewID": "R2UZYX21WYYE2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY FIRST TABLET EVER AND I CONSIDER THIS TABLET THE BEST..........(STRICTLY MY OPINION BUT I AM WAYYYY TO EXCITED TO THIS TABLET,This has google android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwhich,THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS SKYROCKET,REALLY REALLY NICE super fast,please read carefully the details of this table before you purchase.........it has build in 32 gb capacity and I bought a extra 32gb MICRO SD CARD to make double space(is cheap so look around here in amamzon),brings bluetooh,wifi,speakers,BUILD IN MICRO-PHONE.DUAL CAMERA FRONT IS 3 MEGAPIXEL AND BACK IS 8MEGAPIXEL,charge can hold for very very long time,built in sensor so it lights up under darker environments automatically,3.5mm headphone jack,HDMI port but YOU NEED TO BUY THE CABLE SEPARATELY IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT TO HDTV OR OTHER HDMI PORTS(same look around here  and you will actually find BUNDLES WITH SCREEN PROTECTORS,THE CABLE,CARRY CASE,ECT).......VERY NICE QUALITY BULIT TABLET...............I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION SOUND QUALITY-IS VERY NICE CRYSTAL CLEAR HD SOUND NO CHEAP OR BUGGY SOUND..............also NO RJ-45 port,only wireless internet only....Now I will write some comments based on OTHER people negative comments on this tablet.........1-There were some people that said that this tables feels cheap,THIS IS NOT SOME TO EXAGGERATED ABOUT COMPARE TO TABLETS THAT COST $100 or less, I WOULD SAY A BIG NOOOOOOOOO WAYYYYYYYYYY NOT EVEN NEAR THIS IS VERY VERY GOOD ENOUGH,IT HAS A SECURE GRIP SO IT WONT EASLY SLIDE OF YOUR FINGERS BY ACCIDENT DOES NOT FEEL CHEAP AS SOME PEOPLE SAY BEFORE I PURCHASE THIS TABLET,THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE........PEOPLE PLEASE DONT EXAGGERATE.2-THE WIFI IN THIS TABLET IS VERY VERY SECURE AND NOT FADE AWAY OR GOES AWAY COMPARE TO A TF200(I NEVER OWN OR TOUCH ONE BUT WAYYYY TO MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT,THAT TABLET HAS BAD WIFI OR THE ONES THEY RECEIVE,THIS TF300 HAS PERFECT WIFI,NO FADE AWAY AND VERY FAST RANGE/RESPONSE TIME..........THIS IS THE NEW TF300 TABLET SO ASUS DID A IMPRESSIVE WORK TO THIS TABLET.......3-my last comment so i dont make this too long is that FOR THE PREVIOUS PEOPLE THAT HAD/HAVE this tablet,when you DOWNLOAD A PROGRAM FROM ANDROID MARKETPLACE,if it CRASHES OR SHUTS DOWN,PLEASE GO TO THE MARKETPLACE AND (UPDATE) THE PROGRAM TO FIX THE CRASHING/SHUTING DOWN APP, AS WELL AS DOWNLOAD ANY UPDATE THAT ASUS puts in the tablet once you connect to wifi(UPDATE AS WELL)SO THE TABLET CAN RUN SMOTTHER AND EVEN NEW FEATURES GETS INCLUDED IN THE ASUS UPDATE LIKE FACE UNLOCK,ECT so please keep this in mind and I HAVE YET TO ENCOUNTER THIS PROBLEM...........I love this tablet and VERY GOOD WORK ASUS TO MAKE THIS TABLET..............thanks everyone for reading my review.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 weeks from purchase and already a problem", "Author": "Glenn \"Scuba Diver\"", "ReviewID": "R1HDGAE8XNLJ3L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased my new TF300 two weeks ago.

Box came and it was packaged well, but oddly enough the plastic covering looked like someone had already opened it and packaged it.. although it was \"factory sealed\"!So as I tried to start it up, it was dead.. not DOA but battery wasnt charged! So I let it sit for 3 hours and finally it turned on.. everything was honkadory until the wifi kept dropping.. this happened all day long! I even did a factory reset to see if it would fix the problem.. the factory reset actually opened up more problems...1. The speakers started making weird white noises2. The screen kept flikering on and off3. There was random reboots4. There was screen lag, especially when going from home to either camera or gallery (and yes I updated the software already)5. The power button sometimes wouldn't work6. Wifi just wouldn't budge, I tested the speed test against my Galaxy Nexus7. When I restarted the tablet.. all my created playlists were resetted.. which sucks because I teach at the gym and I create playlists all the timeI ended up returning it today and buying the Toshiba Excite AT305.. sure the camera isn't that good on the Asus TF300, and sure its $42 more expensive, and the memory is only 16 vs 32, but I can deal.. Id rather have gorilla glass screen, a working WIFI, some what plastic metal casing and a lower version of ICS... I don't know Asus.. for some reason you went chincy on the material and hardware... It would be nice if they had the Infinity available but I can't wait.. and personally, if the TF300 had all these problems, I am pretty sure the Infinity might have it as well..(This was my second TF300 this week, first one I bought from BestBuy on Saturday.. returned it because Amazon offered a better price with a larger memory.. didn't really get to play with that one too much, but all I can say, is that I should have gone with my instincts when it gave me wifi problems on Sunday..)", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed....web browser kept crashing and disappearing", "Author": "Eric Wyz", "ReviewID": "R1AIM8YDCFBQVB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After spending many hours researching between the Transformer Prime and the New Ipad, I ended up purchasing the Asus Transformer TF300 due to the lack of WIFI connection on the Prime.  Further this product also kept me on the Droid platform which I use for my phone.Out of the box, the tablet looked great and the plastic covering on the back was fine with me.  One of the primary reasons I chose the asus over the Ipad was because of adobe flash.  Little did I know that when I went to websites that utilized adobe flash the web browser would just close out of nowhere.  Not every time but I would say at least 75%, if I got lucky it wouldn't happen.  I would then have to go back to the home screen and initiate the browser again.  Sometimes the page I was on would still be there while other times I would completely lose the page and any information I had on it.  I ignored the problem for a few days but after a while it was just frustrating always having to restart the browser.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything else about the tablet and I wanted to stay on the android platform but I may be soon joining my wife in the apple world.

It cannot hold a charge for more than a day. If I fully charge it and then set it aside, the next day it will be dead. Android is terrible. It is laggy, it will turn itself off randomly, there is a constant delay between pressing the on button and actually seeing the lock screen, and every program crashes consistently. I wish i had gotten an iPad!!!!!! Avoid like the plague!UPDATE 5/20/12: I received a replacement unit and have had a completely different experience with it. I have had it for about 1 week and have only experienced 1 random restart. Hopefully this will continue to be the trend with it and it becomes even more stable after the firmware update. The build quality is noticeably better than the 1st unit I received, which leads me to believe I had received a unit that was rushed out of the factory. In anycase, I am now happy with my purchase and hope Asus makes sure to keep the quality consistent with what a consumer expects when making this type of purchase.-------I preordered the TF300 as soon as I saw it available on amazon. I had considered the prime but had ofcourse heard of all the connectivity issues and anticipated that the TF300 would have those issues solved. And I was right, no connectivity issues. Now its just a whole lot of other things. The list:1. Touch screen stops working. I am browsing a website and suddenly I can no longer scroll. I know its only the touch screen because I can plug it into the dock and use the cursor. The first time it happened it fixed itself after about 5 restarts. The second time I just let it sit. And currently it is sitting next to me useless because the touch screen is once again unresponsive. Unacceptable.2. \"_____ has stopped working\" is a common message you will see from every app you try to run. It is almost a surprise when I dont see this at least once per use of the tablet. Unacceptable.3. Camera pictures are sometimes distorted or just show green. It is annoying to hit the camera button and have to pray that the camera will initialize. When it works the pictures and video are great. But often the camera app is too slow to be useful. Unacceptable.4. Finally worst of all: Random Restarts. This will happen at anytime without warning. It occurred mostly after less than 10 minutes of streaming Pandora but i have experienced it while using the browser, playing a game, checking email, and trying to get flash to play. This tablet is without a doubt the most unreliable piece of junk I have ever used. And I wanted to like it! UNACCEPTABLEFinally, the construction does feel cheap. The plastic is textured nice but in terms of flex it cannot compare to any aluminum tablets.To any Asus Rep: Are these all software issues? Is there a fix coming? I performed the factory reset and the tablet performed great for about 3 hours and now its back to its old tricks. Why would you release such a shoddy product?!?To any potential customer: STOP! I know it looks cool and the price is amazing. But believe me, this is not worth the trouble. I dont know what your alternative is but this is not the great deal it appears to be.

I didn't get the keyboard attachment for this tablet so I can not speak to that. I've actually had this for about 9 months now, so I've been using it pretty extensively.The biggest complaint I have about this tablet: It's sluggish. After waking it up it may take 5-10 seconds before it starts responding to touching the screen. Or it may respond almost immediately. If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app. I have to reboot the tablet periodically to regain performance.This sluggishness doesn't make it unusable. Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine. It just seems that background processing and context-switching is very poor in this tablet. I do not know how much of that is the specific flavor of Android and how much of it is hardware.A second problem I have which may be linked to the sluggishness is the touch-screen doesn't seem to respond properly sometimes. Even when an app is clearly running (screen is updating, sound is playing, etc) I sometimes have to tap a button or icon a dozen times before the tablet realizes I'm actually interacting with it. I've verified this isn't due to calibration settings or the screen being dirty.By contrast the Acer Iconia 500 was very responsive both to touch input and general app performance. It has a lower-power CPU and less storage capacity, yet this supposedly more powerful tablet ultimately feels like a downgrade. :(My advice is you are considering this tablet is to try and use one for a while, such as borrowing a friends or trying it in a store. Or pick-up a used one and sell it if it doesn't meet your needs.

Amazon's only attempt to inform their customers with booked orders were to delete the letters 'GPS' from their 'click for further technical specifications' section (no mention until much later of the significant wifi range problems).After several discussions with their order desk it was clear they didn't have any TF300 and it might be 3 to 4 weeks before they got any.  All this when several local big box stores had them in stock - so I bought the 32GB.After using an iPad2 for a year, the TF300 has been both a challenge and a delight. Asus apparently didn't learn enough from their TF201 design problems so wifi range is still a problem (they did make a significant design change in the TF700).

I was na\u00efve and didn't check their rating before buying the tablet but every forum you will go, you'll find nothing but complains.

They'll try to do all they can to pin whatever issue you have on you. My frustration at the sudden crack was pretty apparent yet they kept saying I was \"misusing\" it. Really?

I plugged the tablet into the removable keyboard, and the cursor worked fine for a few minutes, then became overly sensitive, selecting apps when I'd only moved the cursor either over them or in close proximity to them. I reset the tablet about three times before the touchscreen function worked, but only for a few seconds.After the Jelly Bean update, the touchscreen function became more reliable, but I still found that every few minutes, it would stop working. This could be fixed by either rotating the tablet a few times, or tapping the power button off and on, or by plugging in the removable keyboard.My attempt at using the Note Scribble app was incredibly frustrating because of this, and additionally, the tablet started scribbling random dots and dashes when I wasn't touching the screen.I went to the Asus website to speak to a customer service representative about this; there is no phone number for customer support so I had to use their live-chat option. The representative was nice enough, but denied that this is a common problem when I asked him if he'd heard of any other complaints. While I was online with him, my tablet suddenly started selecting multiple apps and opening and shutting them, without my finger anywhere near the screen. I told the rep about this and he said that I could have my tablet sent in to be looked at by Asus, but that they would not refund me for the postage.I looked up the TF300 reviews on multiple forums, and found that while a few customers had great success with the tablet, many had similar experiences to mine. Some had even claimed to have sent in their TF300 three-plus times to Asus repair centers and were still finding problems with their tablet.A final issue: I tried downloading some PDF files from my class' lecture and found that even though I'd downloaded the adobe reader app, I couldn't successfully download my PDF files because of an \"internal error\".As of now, I am considering the Galaxy NOTE (or tab) since those seem to have great reviews and are about the same price as the Asus transformer.TL;DR-- The touchscreen is buggy and unreliable, the removable keyboard is far too sensitive, Asus has a frustrating customer support service, it seems that a poltergeist is included in the product package, and a search on google will show I'm not the only person who has had these problems.

The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.  Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.

Another long story short, got the package dropped on my doorstep @9:30 am after badgering ONTRAC when they called me back.I followed the directions and charged the tablet until the battery was 100%.  The tablet did a firmware update the first time I turned it on.  I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.  I did some browsing, installed Nook app and a few other common, free apps.  After having the tablet about 12 hours, it began to operate erratically, sometimes the screen would not respond to any action (swipe, tap, hold, double tab, etc.), essentially frozen.  When not frozen, tapping an app would sometimes work, but more often would execute an entirely different app (note they were not at all near each other on the screen).  Examples - tap browser, runs gmail - tap any app displays wallpaper dialog - tap settings, first screen appear but could not press anything that worked and could not scroll.  Attempted a cold boot (Vol down plus power), after reading posts about the issue; this appeared to work, but did nothing to remedy the problem.I called ASUS tech support @ 1:30 am PST and amazingly enough got through to a live person after about 30 minutes (20 minutes then disconnect, 2nd call only took 10 min). The Technical Support Representative took 5 minutes to be able to repeat the spelling of my name back to me correctly after 10 very careful, slow spellings (also using letter names), kept adding an e to the end of my last name.  After reviewing the issue with him, and attempting another re-boot, the tablet went into what appeared to be an endless power up and down cycle.  I was finally able to get it to stop, but upon starting normally screen totally frozen.  Rep said it was defective and I should send it to them \"unless I could think of something else to do\".  He indicated it could take anywhere from 4 to 6 or 8 weeks and I would have to pay shipping.  I asked him what the \"something else for me to do meant\" and he said perhaps return to Amazon (duh).I arranged to exchange this defective item with Amazon, trouble free and quite simple to accomplish KUDOS to Amazon.  Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.  I printed the label and return authorization and re-packaged everything in the original box and Amazon shipping box and took it to UPS store.  UPS store charged me $1.00 to tape the box (about 2 seconds and perhaps 10\" tape {wow at that rate $1800 per hour :-(I've already gotten the shipping confirmation and tracking number for the replacement and it's the same delivery company so I've got my fingers crossed and will call them as soon as it's on the truck  in hopes of ensuring a trouble-free delivery.During the about 6 or so hours that this tablet worked, it worked fine.  I'm a little nervous about the charger connection as it's pretty obviously a bit flimsy and feels somewhat as if it will fall out of the tablet.  I'm planning on getting the docking station with keyboard when I have the money so perhaps that will be less of an issue.I'll update about the replacement item.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Iffy browser", "Author": "M.

Specifically, I've owned 3 different phones (HTC G1, Google Nexus One, and Samsung Nexus Galaxy) as well as a Google TV.  I'm a happy owner of all 4 of these, and all but the G1 I still use.  In general, I'm a big believer in the Google ecosystem and I like the idea that Android makes it so I can seamlessly switch hardware manufacturers (in theory).This is my first Android tablet.  My wife has a recently purchased iPad 2, which allows me to make pretty direct comparisons to the obvious competition.  Overall, this tablet doesn't hold a candle to my wife's iPad 2 and it's a major let down.On to the review:Versatility: HDMI out, microSD slot, 32GB.  This is frankly my favorite part of the tablet.  And this is the kind of flexibilty that Apple bends over backwards to stop users from mixing/matching hardware as they please. While the tablet also supports an external keyboard, I prefer to use my desktop, laptop, or Chromebook for actual work or heavy communication.Performance:This tablet has fast specs on paper.  I've ran numerous benchmarking suites on the tablet, and it appears that my tablet scores very well.  When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.  The actual browsing experience (responsiveness, page load time) is way worse than my iPad 2.  This is true regardless of browser -- default Android web browser, Chrome beta, Dolphin, etc.  And in several games, the tablet frequently stutters or pauses for several seconds in the middle of it all.Tablet touch sensitivity:The tablet has a very hard time registering clicks.  Sometimes, it works flawlessly.  Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.  Sometimes clicks are dropped.  Other times, I just need to \"patiently\" weight 8 seconds.  I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.  Some games that require you to use 2 thumbs (one for navigation, the other for actions like shooting) are completely confused by any movements I make with my left thumb.  I have to awkwardly use my left index finger, and even then a lot of the motion gets dropped or garbled.  I can't tell if all of these issues are completely software or issues with the tablet input itself, but the end result is a very frustrating navigation experience.Stability:My tablet crashes at least once daily.  This is the least stable consumer device I've owned since the original HTC G1 I've used.  Android should not feel this \"beta\" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.  I've also seen odd glitches in several browsers -- for example, videos will sometimes play \"underneath\" a page.  Half of the video is visible, half of it appears to be playing underneath the embedded video widget on a web page.Google services:I'm used to flawless integration with Google services on Android devices.  Gmail and Google Voice continue to work well.  But what I really care about is media.Unfortunately, this is another area where this tablet falls short.  Picasa Web Albums does not sync correctly.  I can't easily get all of my photos on my device. I have tens of thousands of photos and probably at least 100 albums -- this may be causing it sync less reliably than if I had less.  The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.  However, the TF300T's headphone jack plays very good sound.Display:Display suffers from some fairly visible light bleed in 2 of the 4 corners.  My wife's iPad 2 has light bleed issues as well, but not as obvious.  I think part of this has to do with the color palette of iOS being more white/gray, while Android is more black/dark gray.  The iPad 2 has much more rich and vibrant colors than the TF300, which appear washed out in comparison. I notice the difference in color when browsing, when watching videos, and sometimes when playing games.In my mind, the crashing/lagging/glitching alone makes this product defective.  I'm considering returning it.  Based on the positivity of others' reviews, I can't tell if I have a bad tablet or if other people just aren't bothered by the stuttering and crashing.  But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?

I've read nearly every review posted since I bought the device, and I'm amazed how many reviews here offer a non-critical love affair with the TF300.  Please people, if the review looks like it was written by a professional reviewer, it's probably nothing more than a carefully placed advertisement.  I also suspect that there's an army of people working for Asus voting up these fake reviews, and voting down reviews coming from real people who have actually spent some time with this device.Let's get to the point.  There are some things to like about this tablet, but in the end there are some dealbreakers.Pros:  (with keyboard dock)- Incredible battery life.  With the dock I'm easily getting 15 hrs, which is unbelievable.- The keyboard really is quite good.  If you're comfortable typing on a 10\" netbook, you will be fine with the transformer.  One important caveat: find the key on the dock that disables the trackpad and use it regularly.  If you don't, your pointer will inevitably jump all over the screen as you type and sooner or later you will throw this thing against a wall.- A tablet + keyboard combo that doesn't rely on bluetooth, so you can use it on an airplane.  That's actually unique in the marketplace right now, so well done Asus.Pros:  (whether you have the dock or not)- Ships with the latest android OS, ICS 4.03.  I find this latest OS from google a pleasure to use.  If you live in the google ecosystem as I do, it is very nice to have native apps for gmail, calendar, maps, docs, google drive, etc.  As long as we're comparing this to the new ipad (which is inescapable considering it's dominance in the tablet market), don't forget that Android has an open file system, which is very useful when you're trying to use this as a netbook / laptop replacement.- Device runs very cool.  No heat like you typically get from a laptop, so you can take it into bed with you.  Even the new iPad can run pretty hot, but I've never felt any heat coming off this device.  Major win.- Encryption - you can set a numeric PIN or password to decrypt, without it the device won't unencrypt save for a factory data reset.  Cool feature if lost or stolen.Now, here's why I do not recommend this tablet:1) \"Browser is not responding.  Would you like to close it?  [Wait / OK]\"  Be prepared to see this regularly while you use ANY browser.  (Browser, Dolphin, Maxthon, Opera, Firefox - I tried them all - Chrome being the worst.)  This gets very tiresome.  All the browsers were slow save for the Maxthon browser, which became unstable after a day of use.  I'm sorry people, but the browser is the \"killer app\" on a tablet or netbook, and I need it to work.  This is what a quad-core \"tegra 3\" tablet gets you?  Yikes.2) As mentioned in other reviews, let there be no doubt:  The screen SUCKS.  If you have any experience with the new ipad, you'll probably find this screen to be laughably bad.  1280x800 display with colours that wash everywhere vs. 2048x1536 on the latest ipad.  Videos look terrible.  Do I have to use iOS just to get a decent screen?  Come on Asus.  Just listen to the critical reviews here:  people are reporting dead pixels, yellowish tinges and light bleed.  My device actually shipped with no noticeable defects but I have zero confidence in its long-term durability.  And there's no other way to put it, I don't like looking at the screen.  It's vastly inferior to my smartphone, my laptop and my first generation ipad.  Will I spend a lot of time using this?  No.3) Cheap plastic-y construction: the pad and the dock flex all over the place.  If you want something tough, this isn't it.  Another reviewer mentioned that you can see the colours on the screen distort when you apply moderate pressure to the back of the pad, and yup, sure enough, they do.  What if you accidentally put pressure on this thing in your backpack?  Great, let's buy an expensive aluminum case and add another 5 pounds to my backpack, no thanks.  I need something that's portable and durable that I can take everywhere, not another decoration for my apartment.4) Not a dealbreaker for most people but it is for me: this is no audiophile device.  Lossless music files + player pro + dsp pack + Shure SRH440's = very average listening experience.  Allegedly the Tegra 3 uses a lower quality DAC than the Tegra 2.  No Wolfson chip so no Voodoo Sound app to save it.  Oh, and the volume doesn't have smooth scrolling, so the volume goes up and down in chunks, which I detest.Conclusion:  Back to Worst Buy...  The main dealbreakers being the poor browsing experience and the flimsy construction.  Unfortunately, as much as I love android I just don't feel this is a good purchase long-term.  I see this device lasting 6-12 months maximum.UPDATE:I lasted 3 weeks with this device.  I've decided to return it, and wait for the Transformer Infinity, which is expected to have a better screen and more solid construction, and - hopefully - an improved browser experience.  To give credit where it is due:  the transformer is amazing as an instant-on note-taking device.  It is my preferred device for email, calendar and google drive.  It just doesn't cut it for web browsing however.  Despite two firmware updates in 3 weeks, the browser is still unacceptably slow.  If you expect to do web-browsing, this is not the tablet for you.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY.

The issues are waaay too deep to get into here. However, below I've tried to summarize my frustrations about this company and this product:1. There was some over the air firmware update and update to the new version of Android that wasn't communicated to customers ahead of time.  The result of the update is a system whose data ports are now buggy (odd) and a touchscreen that has completely stopped working making the tablet useless. Troubleshooting gets nothing accomplished.2. It took many, many, many times of trying and extremely LONG, LONG, LONG waits (had to hang up a few times to try later) to get an actual person on the phone to assist me.  He was rude to say the least but also very apathetic to my needs. He gave me directions to do the same troubleshooting I'd already done on my own that didn't work (I told him this and he didn't care).  I went through his erroneous directions until I realized that he didn't know what he was doing.  When I finally figured out he was trying to get me to do what I'd already done, I tossed his directions out of my mind and just executed the function on my own (this took like ten minutes of frustrating conversation to get through).  Of course the reboot didn't work so then he asked me to just wipe the data.  I didn't want to because I would lose all data of course and the connectivity ports and touchscreen made any attempt to back up my data impossible.  I went ahead and wiped the data (sniff, sniff) which basically cost me both past and future time and money.  My touchscreen began working for about ten minutes then froze again (what it's been doing since the firmware/software update).  This whole process so far has taken about 32 days from the time I noticed a touchscreen problem (I waited a couple of weeks since the blogs indicated Asus would likely fix this issue quickly over the air and since I had heard the customer support was bad) to the time I was able to talk to a representative and wipe the data.  Now I guess I have to go through the pain of calling back and sending the product for repair.  I'll update on how that goes.3. Researching the blogs and gadget websites indicates that software and firmware problems are a recurring theme for Asus.  Apparently in January 2012 owners of this same tablet also went through frustrating technical issues.  I have read that everything from system crashes to hdmi and usb port malfunctioning occurred then too.  That was the icecream sandwich update I guess, and I'm guessing this one is what they call \"JellyBean\" or something like that.  Looks like Asus technology is just sub-par and/or that Asus and Android rarely if ever communicate.  It has been hard to find good info on Asus tech problems which means that they probebly try hard to keep problems like mine quiet.  Thank God for bloggers.4. Sort of unrelated, but perhaps not, my docking station also went kaput during this same firmware update time.  It cracked and popped open slightly on one side like something inside disengaged and came aloose.  Of course I dared not try to depress it back into place.  I left a review on that too...I find it amazing how these products cost so much but break like they're made in China...I guess I should research if they were...the lady I spoke to on this issue from Asus was also rude and unenthused about her job.  When she put me on hold (for a long time) the recording about the warrenty information conflicted what she told me, and she was unable to provide data on pricing.  Why did I ask about pricing?  Because she said that it was strange that that happened to my docking station and that if THEY determine the break was MY fault then they will contact me to notify me that they must charge me for the repair.  It felt like she was saying that I'm a liar or something.  I mean, this item isn't expensive enough for me to tell this dumb of a lie...Since the docking station is only about $130 I questioned whether sending it off to possibly pay for my own repair was not worth the time and money since apparently I have to pay for my own shipping to get the item repaired as well (that was the warrenty contradiction I was talking about so she or the company itself is the liar).  Sending a $130 electronic item and insuring it to make sure the shipping itself doesn't cause damage is itself expensive these days.  I ended up paying for that and crossing my fingers that they don't try to charge me.  I'll update this with the total cost of repairs including shipping when I find out, but back to my point--Why can't they at least estimate pricing when they tell people they may have to pay for the repair?  I guess because they have to do diagnostics first, but I guess what I'm really trying to say here underneath it all is that the lady from Asus gave me the feel like she saw me as her adversary and took an adversarial approach to the docking station issue.  I like being treated like a paying customer when I call tech support and not like I'm going to have to fight.Bottom line:  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you don't mind frustration (and wasting time/money) everytime there is an update, but I'd still caution that for so much money my gut feeling is that these products are made cheaply.  Of course this is my layperson opinion based on my own experiences, and perhaps I happened to get a lemon tablet AND docking station, but logic and the laws of probability makes that unlikely.  I'm going to see if Asus fixes everyting completely then try to sell the tablet and docking station both during the Christmas season.  I just want rid of the headache and wish I could tell Asus to keep the tablet and refund me.  I have a few friends with other products that seem to work much better, but unfortunately they don't have all the features that Asus does which is why I took  a chance and went with Asus in the first place.  I have decided to wait another year before attempting another tablet purchase...it seems the technology isn't quite there yet no matter the company.OK, so I'm obviously frustrated and a little mad, but to their defense the tablet is pretty cool when it's not malfunctioning and when you have connectivity.  It's just that those are two HUGE hurdles that overshadow the coolness of the product.  I actually like the tablet and hope they get their crap together in the not too distant future.  Honestly though, I'm secrectly hoping Google/Android will come out with a good competitor before then.UPDATE- Was out of town for a week and when I returned (as of Oct. 1) my screen seems to be working again without pause...(so,so glad).  We will see how Android 4.1 works on this from now on.

I will monitor the performance over the next few days and hope for some improvements.On a positive note the wifi reception is wonderful. I changed the channel on my router and now I have 4 or 5 bars when I'm over 40ft from the router.  I downloaded the app Wifi Analyzer and it helped me to improve the performance of my home network.____________________________________________________________________________________When I first received the tablet it would not power up and I thought I had a lemon. I charged it about 7 hours and it was good to go. I was forced to upgrade to ICS after playing with it for an hour, and I have to say I haven't noticed any changes or improvements.  The plastic back does have a cheap feel in comparison to the TF201, however performance appears to be the same. The TF201 has a better screen and very weak wifi (The iPad 3 has the best screen).

I knew I didnt want an Apple product as it was too restrictive for a tablet. For iPhone its fine. But tablet is more like a computer and so need flexibility and openness.So Android was the obvious choice. I liked the 4.x release when I checked out other tablets. I wanted one with quad core processor. That left me with Asus transformer tf300 and Acer a510 iconia (at least for now in my price range). Comparing them both I think Asus had an edge based on the review comments. I also checked them out in local stores to have a look at it. I found Acer to heat up after 5-10 min of usage. The pluses were battery and dolby. But I decided for Asus.I ordered it and was eagerly waiting to get my hands on it. When it came, I immediately opened up to start using it. Upon pressing the power button nothing happened. Tried few times - no luck. Thought the battery may not be fully charged. Plugged into the wall and let it charge few hours. The power button LED came on in amber color which gave me hope.After allowing it to be charged several hours, I tried again. No display. I can see the black color all over the screen. Nothing else. You can tell the difference between the screen switched off and the black color in the screen. I held the power button for several seconds in hope of doing a hard reset. That didnt help. I thought of hitting the reset button using a pin. But then thought, why should I do it. I paid in full for this and I shouldnt have to reset it the first time I am switching on. It didnt feel right. I packed it up and shipped it right back and got the refund.Now I am back in the tablet market - debating whether to give Asus another chance or not. Or go for Acer although it gets warm. Or wait for some more time until Amazon or Google to come up with a 10.1 tablet. Not sure what to do so I am waiting....I wanted to give zero stars. But Amazon doesnt let me do it.

Price target was encouraging, and so was good availability throughout retailers and e-retailers.  I placed an order, did not receive any delay response, and it arrived right on time.  Then the horror struck yet again.+Good:Speedy, mostly jitter free performance.Good size of built-in storage, complemented by microSD slot.Wifi works, range is good, and so is GPS.Blue (only color at the launch) plastic back with good amount of texture.  I know some people took a hack at this as \"cheap\", but I am not sure about that.  Prime's metal back was bit too slippery for my liking.Quite thin, similar dimension to Prime.-Bad:First hour is painful due to seemingly endless amount of updates all huddling at once.Dock connector.  It has bit of cheap feeling to it.Speaker.  Single slot, on one end.  It is ok on portrait mode, but weird on landscape mode.Contrast, or lack thereof.  Display looks washed out in high brightness, and simply too dim at low brightness.--UGLY!:Quality Control, Quality Control, Quality Control.  My God... does anyone at ASUS know a thing about Quality Control?  Do they have a factory full of lint floating everywhere?  Yet again have I been struck by stupid display issue.  With Prime, it was stuck/dead pixel.  With TF300, my first one had lint stuck in between outer glass layer and LCD display.  Needless to say, I was seething.  Yet another round of return-and-exchange debacle.  amazon made this painless process, but I was not a happy camper.Light bleeding.  This is bit of toss up as it is mostly noticeable when screen goes dark, but it is present and does not require keen eye to identify it.  I suspect that ASUS might have gone even cheaper route than original Transformer on display assembly as I haven't seen original having this many complaints on light bleeding issue.  It does not ruin your movie experience nor is it enough to make it unusable, but what bummer.Rumor mill is busy chirping about ASUS/Google superpad in few months, and I thought about staying put in order to wait for one, but after seeing new batches of tablet and playing briefly with Samsung Galaxy Pad 2 7.0 (only downside being 1024x600 resolution), I was more than ready to give tablet another try.

The tablet's appearance, responsiveness, functionality, sound, and display are all reasonably good.  For me as a first time tablet owner who also never uses a smartphone, it requires some getting used to.  But, overall, I am pretty  satisfied with the purchase.There is one problem, however, with the GPS.  If I set destination and driving direction at home before my trip, the GPS does its job flawlessly.  Once I am outside, say at my destination and would like to return home or go to a new destination, the device has not worked a single time after quite a few attempts over different days and hours.  The device would still identify my location through the satellite.  But it hangs with the message of \"getting driving direction\" after I enter needed address.  Once I return home, it acts as expected again, which made me wonder maybe this GPS requires WiFi connection to set driving direction.  If so, that would be a major disappointment.Some other reviewers mentioned GPS function and no one seems to have similar issue.  I thought perhaps it is a user error and I sent an inquiry to the ASUS technician who responds to reviews at this site.  The person helped me with a few other questions (thanks for the prompt response!) and suggested I could try power off.  It did not solve the problem, unfortunately.  If anyone has suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them as I hate to return this machine which otherwise works quite well.Update 13May2012 -Apparently, typical tablet users do not expect this device to function out of box like a standalone GPS.
