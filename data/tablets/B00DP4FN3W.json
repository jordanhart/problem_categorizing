I probably just got a defective one.  I liked the speed of the WiFi and the speed of how quickly it charged when it was working.  There was no delay in reading books, playing games or being on the web.  For the price, it was a good little tablet.  I could have exchanged it, but just didn't want to go through the hassle should the next stop charging as well AFTER the 30 days from purchase was up.

I bought this for my teen son and he just loves it. Skype is easy to use, Google Play is simple use. I love the fact I can come to Amazon android order apps, and when he goes on line they download the apps to it. Download is fast easy to use. battery time is about 2-3 hrs. Recharge is fast. Suggest you order screen protectors for it, my kids like to touch it with dirty hands alot. They say to use a External SD card, but it is not that easy to make Google Android pick it up, there is 2 apps you will need to hook the external SD card to link with the one inside.I suggest you use Amazon Andoid Apps if you can, after you get tired of a game you want to unistall it, Amazon holds you apps in it folder and it is very easy to just re-load if you want to play it again, take out your old apps to make room.Put a cleaner app in it, after each day it will remove the junk you may of got while on the net and it boost the speed greatly of the hard drive.Now I did have one issue with them, because they fixed the issue, I will not say what it was. had nothing to do with the Tablet as for how good it works. The Customer Service is OUTSTANDING, They will try their best to help you with any problem. For that I would give them a extra star if I could.I have 4 teens in the family, so I am going to order more for Christams from them. The price is great, you get a lot of features for the price you pay. If you got kids or even for adults this is a very smart item to buy. It is worth every penny you pay. Also I got this very fast after my order was made.Music sound okay, better when ear phones, have little kids, then they will be able to use it easy and play their games.Watch out for one thing, it is habit forming, just cant seem to put it down.One Hint, please contact Customer Service first, they do go out of the way to help you.
