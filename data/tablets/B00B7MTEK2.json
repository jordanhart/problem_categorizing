{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2EBIZ57N5JG0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.  It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day!  It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have.  I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system).  I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version.  I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version.  I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010).  However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once.  I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day.  I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.).  The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will.  If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device.  In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc.  I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting.  Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVING THE NEW IPAD 4!!  HERE'S A BREAK DOWN", "Author": "Bigz \"BIGz\"", "ReviewID": "RM1Y65IQTWOX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.Externally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.

Well, this is essentially an iPad3 with a few improvements that I really like.I already own an iPad2, but decided to upgrade to this because I needed to bump up to 32GB.  That, and a deal on this iPad which was incredible convinced me to upgrade now. I still use my MacAir and my Dell laptops, but the iPad is my daily go to device and where I go an iPad is going. Great battery life and minimal problems make this a much loved convenience.The improvements are not overwhelming, but the truth is I already love the iPad and this makes it better. I've always thought the screen image was very good, but this is an obvious step up. It is clear, bright and vivid with the improved retina display.The iSight camera at five megapixels is very good, but I wasn't complaining about the pictures I took with my old iPad. Still, it is a nice improvement and it takes a much clearer picture than my old iPhone.The new processor is really fast. I didn't think it was slow before but when I have a lot of apps running I've noticed that it is faster. You'll have to trust me on this one. I tend to run a lot of stuff at the same time and the old iPad was slower, but not to the extent that I found it irritating or irksome.I like the new lightening connector which is an 8 wire adapter. Just me, but it seems less clunky. However, if you have a lot of Apple products that use the old 30 wire adapter, this may be a pain. I'm going to have to get another car charger/wall charger and I'll have to take two chargers to cover both adapter types when I hit the road.Another thing I like is my personal secretary Siri. Depress the screen button and Siri is ready to roll. It is voice interpretive intuitive software that retrieves information. While this will probably seem like rudimentary artificial intelligence in a few years, I get a total kick out of it. It's nice to get directions or find out where the Sox are playing or get the earliest showing of a movie. Love it, though I am still playing around with it and probably haven't scratched the surface yet. I don't know if there is any truth to this, but I've heard that the Suri software may be available for the earlier versions of iPad at a later date.As for the size and weight, minimally larger but I'd be hard pressed to say this except I compared the specs.Here is the thing. If you don't care about a better camera or a better display or a faster processing speed or having your own cyber slave to talk to, go with the less expensive iPad2.I like Apple products. I have been using the iPad for two years now and it is fairly trouble free. The few problems I've had were the result of software upgrades. I am absolutely no techie type, but the problems have all been fixed with minimal grief.This product is getting 4* because the differences between this iPad and its predecessor are slight when you look at the overall big picture. This takes a great product and kicks it up a notch or two, but it hasn't reinvented or reimagined the iPad.Update: I am liking this better each day. The updated processor is nice but this also seems a bit more intuitive if it can possibly be so.The imaging is incredible and the pictures this takes are amazing in their clarity and level of detail.I found that my pricey Joby stand case, which was supposedly made to fit with my iPad 2 works with the new iPad despite very slightly different dimensions. I'm delighted that it doesn't have to be tossed.The only problem I've encountered thus far was an upgrade to the software. This is Apple's problem since it screwed up our other iPads with the same problems, most notably with mail. There is a fix that I found on an Apple forum.Love this, but it is still a 4* considering everything.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "You need one too!", "Author": "Lionsfan \"LionsFanForLife\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0NIXN13N3MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a MacBook and our household owns 3 Ipod Touch devices, and I made the mistake last year in buying the Nook Tablet.  It was ok, but I really didn't use it much because it was a pain to even access web pages, just clumsy overall.  So I plunked down the cash this year and took to leap.  I bought this IPad on Black Friday from the Apple store and it is getting heavy use every day at my house.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros-Awesome Retina display- this is pretty nice.  I wouldn't say it was a selling point, but is nice to have.Nice chip- this has the newest chip in it, and you can't get that with the mini.Apps- I love the apps.  My Nook was a joke compared to the immense amount of choices I have now.Great for kids- My 4 year old loves it...and I mean LOVES it.  There are so many good free apps for her to learn with.Voice dictation- This is it folks.  This was where I dropped the extra $130 or whatever.  You can build documents just speaking.Lightweight- it feels really good as all Apple products do.Charge time- I run this thing all day long and just plug it in at night.Capabilities- I feel like I am just scratching the surface, seriously.Cons-Handling- You need a case, absolutely.  I bought an Otterbox Defender.  This thing almost hit the floor 2 times when I got it.  It is just slippery and is pretty solid so one wrong shift of weight and it might fly out of your hands.I have no other complaints.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad 4", "Author": "E.

Below are some of the improvements with this latest model and some of my impressions.Pros- Dual-core A6X with quad-core graphics means games and apps runs twice as fast compared to the 3rd Gen iPad. No slowdowns on apps that i previously had problems with.- Wifi speeds are also twice as fast. The improvements are noticeable, downloading on the Appstore, watching Youtube and just browsing are quick.- It runs cooler. Using this device for several hours won't burn you, Battery life is also the same to the previous model.- Front facing camera is 720p, back is 5 megapixelCons- Lightning connection port means some accessories won't work without an adapter.- The camera quality wasn't that impressive.Overall the upgraded version has many improvements, if your undecided about making the purchase all you have to do is ask yourself, are you happy with the performance of your current device? if your not a gamer and your not using apps that require a lot of processing power then you don't really need it but if your experiencing slow downs, this is the device you need.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warning Defective iPad!", "Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R17MWPL4MIUCNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love apple products, just like most of the world does!I sold my ipad3 to get the new ipad4 due to the HD front facing camera and the blazing fast A6 chip compared to the A5 I had in my ipad3.Long story short, Biggest mistake ever! The ipad4th generation has an issue with Wi-Fi, if you don't believe me or if you are skeptical just Google it and it will appear right away. It is not my intention at all to harm apple, in fact I plan to return my ipad4 and buy an ipad3 because it was perfect.Also, Just to let you know, after I received my ipad4 I sold it and bought another one just to discover it had the same problem with Wi-Fi.Apple made a huge mistake with their new generation ipad4, and they should either fix the problem or stop selling the unit. The new ipad will disconnect every 5-15 mins constantly! It's terrible, it will make you angry, frustrated ,and this is far from what you would call quality.It's your money and your call, just don't say I didn't warn you.

For this it deserves 5 stars. As an owner of the \"New iPad, aka iPad 3rd generation,\" however, I feel that Apple did an injustice to those who purchased it.The previous version was released to much fan fair in March 2012. This version was released a mere 7 months later, in October 2012. When I called Apple to find out why they would release a newer version so soon after the previous one, the representative who I spoke with informed me that there were problems with the 3rd generation, and as a result, Apple removed it from the market and introduced the generation 4.I have no problem with the fact that technology constantly changes, and that computers are outdated in short order. What I have a problem with, is the fact that Apple prematurely introduced the 3rd generation of the iPad knowing full well that it wasn't ready to be sold. While Tim Cook was onstage last March promoting the 3rd generation of the iPad as the most revolutionary product ever offered by Apple, he knew that it was just a stop-gap measure until the components were ready for the model that you see here.I love Apple products and have always thought that the company treated their customers in the highest regard. As a result of the above, I now feel differently about the company, not the products. As of this writing, Apple sells the iPad 2 and the iPad with Retina Display, aka the 4th generation. They do not sell the 3rd generation at all, as the one listed here is what the 3rd generation was supposed to be. I feel that this is very deceptive on the part of Apple and believe that owners of the now obsolete 3rd generation model should be given the option, for a fee to upgrade to the model presented here. I spoke with customer relations at Apple regarding the above and was told that this would not be an option. They readily agreed that there were \"issues,\" with the 3rd generation model, but refused to tell me what they are. In this regard, they are certainly not being very transparent to their loyal customers.So, the bottom line is that the iPad with Retina Display is a marvelous device, however owners of the previous generation got screwed. I'm giving the model presented here 5 stars, because that's what it deserves. On the other hand, if I had the option to grant stars to the way Apple treated owners of the previous version, I would give them just 1 star.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lemon, not Apple: wi-fi connectivity issues", "Author": "Bea Haven", "ReviewID": "R2FOXOVPREEH8N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I would love the iPad, but I don't even like it at this point.  I love my sister's iPad, my son's and others', but mine won't stay connected to wifi.  I tried to troubleshoot using Apple's website, called AppleCare several times, and ultimately sent the iPad to AppleCare for repair.  But my iPad still doesn't work.  In the same locations that my iPad is nonfunctional, I can use my sister's iPad (she has the iPad w/retina display, too, and I set hers up the same as mine) with no wifi connectivity issues.  But every time I try to access the internet, I get the message that my iPad is not connected to the internet. I go to settings, select the wifi connection, and if it connects at all, it's only briefly.  This happens not just with my home router, but at my place of employment and other wifi access public places (where other iPad users report no difficulty and I have no problems with my laptop, etc.). The AppleCare folks sent my iPad back in 2 days (fast service but the porblem is not solved) with a form letter that states my iPad meets Apple's specifications for acceptable performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my standards. I have a $700+ lemon. I know the Apple iPad is amazing when it works (and it usually works, according to the vast majority of reviews). If Apple replaces this lemon with an iPad that actually works, I will update my review accordingly.Update-1/13/13: I spoke with AppleCare again and was instructed to send the iPad back for maintenance--this will be the second time. Why should I expect it to work this time? What a a waste of time! Another week+ without a functional iPad. If the problem persists after this encounter with AppleCare, I was told the iPad would be replaced. I am becoming more disillusioned with Apple. I have had experience with other iPads and know they can be wonderful when they work, so I would not advise against buying this iPad. But purchase with the knowledge that there is a significant problem with wifi connectivity attested to by many consumers on Apple's own discussion forum. I'm thoroughly frustrated with this lemon and my experience with AppleCare!Update-1/28/13:  After a few returns for maintenance without improvement in performance, Apple replaced my new iPad with a refurbished one. It connects to the internet, but is slow.  I've updated my router, called my wifi provider, and it's still the same.  If I could, I would return this one. One of the big selling points of the iPad is the ease of use and mine has been anything but easy to use with this wifi connectivity issue. Another big selling point is the fast connection speed--not so for me.

I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking.

The iPad is extremely useful and portable for studying anywhere, anytime.  It offers several different apps that allow you to store PDF documents, highlight, and annotate.A helpful tip for people interested in using this for school.  I subscribed for a free membership at Acrobat.com -- an Adobe product. This was a 100% free program.  You download the Acrobat app to your iPad, and it will allow you to view, highlight, and annotate.  The beauty of Acrobat is that they give you 5GB of free online storage.  (5GB is almost unheard of to get for free... Drop Box only offers 2GB for free.)  Once you have your Acrobat.com account set up, log on to the website from your desktop/laptop (wherever you have your PDF documents stored).  From there, you upload your PDFs to Acrobat.com, and you can access them anywhere and anytime by logging on to the website.  Your website login info will be saved in the Acrobat app on your iPad, and you can study and annotate your PDFs from there.  Once you are done studying, Acrobat automatically saves your modifications to those PDFs, so you can view your latest modified document ANYWHERE.  If you forget your iPad one day, you can log in on any computer and view/modify your documents from Acrobat.com.  **By using Acrobat.com you will not use up any of your iPads hard drive space, so the 16GB was more than enough for me.^^ Sorry about that tangent, but I found this extremely helpful, and I wanted to share it with everyone!

Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.I had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily. As I was buying from a distributor through Amazon (Xr Distributors was the one mine came from), it could be that they bought the iPads and resold them without any customer having used them in the meantime. The downside is that the 1-year warranty that iPads come with would expire in Oct 2014, taking away from the amount of time I expected to have a warranty.I contacted the seller to let them know what Apple said, and they replied to my query within two hours. John T., who was listed as Operations Manager, apologized in the email for the inconvenience and said that all their iPads were brand new factory sealed. If I wanted to return it and buy one directly from Apple I could, or he would give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience.I really appreciated the gesture and opened the iPad to find that it was brand new, never used, and it's such a wonderful product. I'm glad I chose the 32GB as well because I shouldn't have to think twice about space issues.

Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.Here are the Tech Specs for those who don't know----Hardware:Height 9.5 inchesWidth 7.31 inchesThickness 0.37 inchesWeight 1.44 poundsColor Silver / Black, Silver / WhiteSpeakers MonoDisplay:Screen size (diagonal) 9.7 inchesTechnology IPS LCDResolution (X) 2048 pxResolution (Y) 1536 pxPPI 264Touchscreen type CapacitiveMultitouch YesSoftware:Operating system iOSLaunch OS version 6Media streaming AirPlayProcessor:CPU brand AppleCPU model A6XClock speed 1.4 GHzCores 2Memory:RAM size 1 GBStorage:Internal size 64 GB, 32 GB, 16 GBConnectivity:Wi-Fi YesWi-Fi support 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11b, 802.11a802.11n frequencies 5GHz, 2.4GHzBluetooth YesBluetooth version 4.0Front Camera:Effective pixels 1.2 megapixelsVideo resolution 720pVideo framerate 30Rear Camera:Effective pixels 5 megapixelsFocus type AutofocusVideo resolution 1080pVideo framerate 30Ports:Video out YesHeadphone 3.5mmData connections LightningSensors:Sensors Ambient Light, Gyroscope, AccelerometerBattery:Capacity 42.5 WhRemovable NoQuoted use time 10 hrThis is the best tablet out there so far!!

The problem I encountered was with Apple. I wanted to purchase their Apple Plus warranty, but they only allow you to do that within 30 days from the date of purchase. When I applied, Apple asked for the serial number of the device and after entering it they informed me that it had been purchased by the reseller several months before and, as a result, they would not extend me their product warranty. I explained that the device was new and in the original packaging, but the representative I subsequently spoke with said that because it had been on their shelf for months they couldn't verify it's condition. I asked if it would make any difference if it had sat on the shelf in an Apple store for the same period of time and the rep said he had to speak with his supervisor. When he returned he said that Apple would not offer me their warranty and advised me to return the device to the seller and buy a new one from an Apple store.

I was able to return my ipad 3 to the apple store within 3 weeks of purchasing from them. At first I was angry that apple released a newer version after 6 months. I then purchased the refurbished ipad 3. After a while I found it to be slow and read many good reviews about the ipad 4. Black Friday came along and I was able to purchase the ipad 4 for cheaper than the price of the brand new ipad 3 version.On to my review. The ipad 4 is considerably faster than the ipad 3. I noticed this right away once I started using it. Opening, closing and switching apps is faster. Boot up is now half the time of the ipad 3. The ipad 3 took almost 50 seconds, ipad 4 takes 25 seconds. Wifi is also much faster. I have a newer router that supports dual channel bonding. Many web pages load almost instantly. Speed tests show much faster speeds. My ipad 3 would get 30-40 Megs down. My ipad 4 gets 60-70 megs down. The ipad 4 also comes with the lightning connector cable and a faster powered charger. This allows the ipad 4 to be charged in quicker amount of time (5hours and 15 minutes). The ipad 3 charged with its charger takes 6 hours to fully charge. The ipad 4 also has a newer hd front camera for FaceTime or Skype. The ipad 3 did seem slow at times mainly due to an under powered processor having to operate the demanding retina display. The ipad 4 no longer has this problem. My ipad 4 finally feels like my ipad2 used to feel. Fast and responsive. My ipad 4 is also getting 1-2 more hours battery life than my ipad 3. This is due to the a6x more efficient processor. I can get about 18 hours of web browsing and youtube watching with brightness on 25% and notifications, email, GPS and Bluetooth turned off. The ipad 4's screen is made by LG. At first I didn't like it compared to my ipad 3's screen made by Samsung. The screen appears with a yellowish tint when compared to ipad 3's which has a blueish tint. After using the ipad for a few days the ipad 4's screen grew on me. The LG screen is said to be more accurate and easier on the eyes. I also found it brighter, which means I can keep the brightness lower to save battery life.When the ipad 4 was first announced I was hoping it had some of the ehancements I had on my wish list. I wanted it to be lighter, thinner, stereo speakers and 2gb ram. None of these features were added to the ipad 4. The ipad 4 is still heavy and thicker than the ipad2. The ipad 2 was the perfect weight and thickness. The ipad 4 is still heavier and thicker due to its retina display and much larger battery. I don't know if the ipad 5 will be able to be made thinner and lighter. There is a good chance the next ipad will have stereo speakers like the ipad mini design. I'm still not sure how their will be room to fit the stereo speakers. Hopefully the next ipad will also have 2gb of ram. This is a much needed feature so that the ipad can better multitask and run many tabs without reloading pages.If you don't really need or care about a lighter, thinner ipad with stereo speakers and 2 gb of ram then you should buy the ipad 4 right now. The ipad 4 is a great device, which is the fastest when compared to any other tablet on the market right now. No other tablet will give you 10+ hours battery life. Apple continues to have the best tablet apps with 275,000 and growing. Apple also has great build quality and support. The ipad 4 is must have for previous owners of the ipad 1 or 2. If you have the ipad 3 and you bought it when it first came out I would still suggest waiting for the next ipad. Unless you can sell your ipad 3 for a reasonable price or you were able to return it. The next ipad will have more improvements then this version and will be released by October 2013 or even earlier.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "ipad vs MS Surface", "Author": "Aman", "ReviewID": "R3SMMYSRY22ZAE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have 2 iPads previously and so when time came to buy another, iPad was the top contender, but given the rising popularity of Microsoft Surface and Samsung Galaxy tab, I decided to try those out. MS Surface won hands down in my experience.First off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.Secondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.Thirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.Fourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.I like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.Not to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed.

Granted the iPad doesn't offer a lot of things that other tablet manufactures offer (i.e. card reader, expandable storage) but when you think about it, do you really need it? Apple allows you to purchase a app & you can install & uninstall as many times as you wish on 5 different devices in your home. I originally purchased the iPad 4 when it was first released. My two 4 year old daughters picked it up one day & was interacting with it like they went to college for computer science!! I couldn't believe my eyes. The iPad is that easy to use. Well as it turns out I ended up having to buy another one because they were having a hard time sharing the one iPad. :-) I would have purchased the new iPad Air but that would have started another argument.

I'm very happy with the upgrades.  Like with my old iPad I'm basically using it to surf the net, watch streaming videos/podcasts, and read books.  I don't take pictures with it or store music.  I'm also not a gamer - so I can't comment that much on the retina display - but I will say the colors are brighter and I find it easier to read books.  The big difference that I notice is in the processor.  Even with my crappy internet connection I notice a huge improvement in the speed with opening apps and streaming videos.  Battery life is longer than the iPad 2. However, because the battery is bigger on this device it takes a lot longer to charge.  I like to kill the batteries on all my electronic devices before I charge them and from a dead battery to 100% charge on this iPad it took over 8 hours to fully charge.  I wasn't using it when it was charging.  In fact, I read on a couple of review sites that this iPad will continue to charge up to 2 hours after it says it's fully charged.  My advice is to allow yourself extra time and charge it overnight if you can.All in all I'm very happy with it.  Since I carry it with me everywhere I bought the OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Pink Alpenglow for extra protection.

When charging, the touch screen was behaving in a very strange way. I cannot click on the icon and screen just acted very strange. It works fine when NOT charging. I brought to Apple Store since it has 90 days warranty and the staff confirmed that my iPad 4 came with a fake and faulty charger. The text on the charger also indicated 10watts and not the original 12watts. The iPad came in an original packing with USB cable but the wall charger was totally fake. I can feel the different in the material too.2. This was another disappointment for iPad4, it is thicker with bigger battery but it take like 4-5 hours for full charge from 50%. Also, when you use it for very long, the ipad get warm. I tried with different wall chargers (original 12W) and it is the same. The charging seem to take longer than the iPad2.I would stay away from iPad 4 is you are thinking of buying it for retina display.UPDATES: Contacted Amazon and the Seller. They suggested that I return the iPad4. I confirmed with Apple that iPad4 is ok and the charger need replacement. After several email exchanges, Amazon refunded me $19 so I can purchase original wall charger with 12 Watts for my iPad4. Kudos Amazon so I am giving the additional star for great customer service but not the product.

All was lost. The best they could do is to exchange it for a different one. The lost data was worth so much more than the iPad.I think is unacceptable that this tablet may destroy the user's data and according to the Apple store employees, there's nothing wrong with it. If the operating system has a problem, user's data should not be deleted, even if it has to start cold.This is the second iPad we have and the second to fail. The first one, a first generation, just stopped charging and we had to pay Apple to exchange it for a different one.The lesson we learned is that this devices may be good for music, photos or any other unimportant tasks, but to me, they are toys.I wouldn't rely on this tablet on anything important.Update: It did it again.

I contacted Apple support; they explainedme how to remove these applications with the help of iTunes on PC. That was OK, but certainly I didn't expect that removingan application should be so complicated. Although the Ipad was declared as being new, I had the impression that somebody used it before and messed the iOS. Being rather disappointed, I start playing with the device for a few days. Not knowing what else to do, I decided to reset the iOS (iOS6 to iOS7). Surprisingly, that was a step that resolved all the problems! The Ipad started working normally, and I don't expect to have similar problems in the future.

The Samsung I felt was a good tablet.  I won't say I was anti Apple but I was trying to justify my reasons for buying the Samsung.  I got tired of hearing how good Apple is....how clear the picture is compared to Samsung etc.  so, I purchased an Apple I-pad.  I figured I still have my Samsung.  If I don't like the Apple I will return it and get my money back.After using my Apple for a few weeks now, I am totally sold on this product!  If fact I am considering a total change to Apple for all of my computer needs!  Next it will be a switch from my Dell desktop to the Apple 27 inch desktop.  I have been a Dell customer for approximately 20 years!Apple is a more expensive way to go, but I feel it is the best way for me.  I think Apple products are very much worth the price difference..in my opinion!Why have I strayed somewhat away from the review of the Apple I-pad!

However, since I have started using the new iPad, I use it more than my computer, and for many, many more projects. I've started listing items on eBay right from the device (which works even easier than on the computer, since it has the built-in camera). I also have been using it for many projects that require a lot of typing, as the smart case I purchased makes typing comfortable and easy. I've even started playing more games on it because of the incredible processor inside! Previously, I could only run Angry Birds and Diner Dash, as I knew they wouldn't crash (and heavier games like Infinity Blade crashed the old iPad way too often). Now I can run GTA Vice City while multitasking with eBay and email, and no lag at all!Apple has really outdone itself with this new iPad -- of course, I understand that it isn't worth the plunge if you own an iPad 3.

I should have passed on this and gotten one of the thin little laptops instead.Also if you get one, get some kind of warranty and get a cover for it before it even arrives. It's more fragile than the iphone. I did not have a cover on my iphone when I first got it and dropped it a few times and it was fine. I was in the process of looking for a cover for this ipad and dropped it and the screen cracked. It's going to cost me at least $160 to get a new screen. The more protected it is the more places you will take it and the more use you will get out of it. I was at disney world's magic kingdom a few weeks ago and they have this amazing electric show at night. It looked like an ipad commercial. Everyone was holding up their ipads and recording it. But again I would be hesitant to haul it around without sufficient protection.So the graphics are amazing and it's a fun little gadget to watch movies or play games with.Oh I'm also in a few bible studies and the bible app is WAY better than on the iphone and you can also download books on kindle app. I do this with my bible study workbooks and you can fill it the blanks and answer questions and everything. The youtube app looks good.I'm not sure what else to say other than everything works and it's not defective. I just don't have a lot of money for \"toys\" so I wish I had gone with the laptop.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "ipad with retina display", "Author": "Fathi Jishi", "ReviewID": "R2Q4M7HI6WZAGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a present for my son, so I did not use it my self.

They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.This is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, \"That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.\"  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.In fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).Will you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.  If you wait for the price to drop, then you're going to want the model after that.  And the cycle of suffering on this matter is endless.When you're ready to buy, then buy.  Buy the one you want.  This one versus the Air, personally I think the only significant difference is price, that you're not missing something.

It is the first apple product to hit our home since the iphone 3 failure we had a few years back. So we got the ipad last night and proceeded to set it up. Everything was fine until we tried to use it. The first app we used caused the ipad to restart. So we tried again. Again 1 min into use and it restarted again. We thought, oh, maybe this thing cant download apps and use them at the same time. If that were the case I would return it for sure and not buy another because that is just ridiculous. Luckily that was not the case. The third time we tried an app we had nothing downloading, updating or anything, and it restarted again. I went to apples site to try to talk to someone about it and when I entered the serial number the site said it was out of warranty and no tech support could be used. That told me that there was an error or I was just sold a used ipad. Since amazon doesn't print the serial numbers on the receipt there is no was for me to prove I bought the ipad that same day. I then spoke to amazon about this and they said since I bought it thru a marketplace person we couldn't exchange it but had to return and buy it over. I thought fine...I will go and do that. Well, while I was on the phone the ipad timed out and went to sleep, but it wouldn't wake back up. So I called apple this morning and spoke to them about it. They told me it is possible the item was used before but there is no way for them to find out. They had me do a hard restart which made it possible for the ipad to turn on again but about 5 min after I hung up with the guy it turned off again and wouldn't turn back on. So I made my mind up. I hard restarted the thing, wiped it clean, and will mail it back Monday. Meanwhile, later today I will go to the apple store and buy one from them, brand new, with warranty. I figure this is apples 2nd strike against me. The only 2 apple items I have own were both defective, so either I have the worst possible luck or apple has fairly low quality standards. If I get a third defective product from them its over.Lesson here....check the serial number on apples site as soon as you get your item.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, but not a huge leap from iPad2", "Author": "PositiveLogic", "ReviewID": "R1TWEXARNCGHED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own an iPad because it has business apps I use that are best used with a touch screen. One pros side, there's not much I can add to what's already been said. It is great and I'm glad I upgraded from an iPad 2 to iPad 4.But I'm deducting one star for the following reasons:Apple wants to upsell you from the iPad 2 to the iPad 4 mostly on this criteria:1) Siri. There's nothing revolutionary about it. For most it's answers it just spits out Google search results and then you do the rest. People are fascinated by it because it throws a few human-like colloquialisms.2) Retina display. I upgraded from an iPad 2. To quite frank, things do no all of a sudden jump out at you in iPad 4. Yes, I do like it. And it's very nice to be sure. But the Retina Display is just a name someone dreamed up that makes it sound more innovative than it actually us. High resolution is everywhere. It's just that Apple give it a snazzy name and suddenly, it's like the a new invention.3) \"A6 is 2x faster than A5\" Huh? Reality check. This one is probably where I feel people are misled the most. To me the A5 is noticeably faster and that's nice. But in real life \"twice as fast\" means 50 mpg vs 25 mph. Or flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 8 hours instead of 16. To me the speed difference is more like flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 14 hours instead of 16.All in all, there a lot of hype that used to make the iPad 4 sound like a quantum leap rather than the incremental improvement that it is. Thus we pay more for it.That said, I like it a lot, but mainly for the reasons that people have liked the iPad ever Steve Job unveiled on that big screen behind him...not because of these minor improvements.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "maybe refurbished", "Author": "andrewaa", "ReviewID": "R2IQPAI7UES2H4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it as a new one.

If it wasnt for cydia I would have sell  the ipad for sure and go to a samsung tablet.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "\ub0b4 \ud56d\ubb38 \uc815\ub9d0\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc88b\uc544", "Author": "Pizza Cat", "ReviewID": "R1R8U79HZIF6RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\ub0b4\uac00 \uc774\uac78 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud574\uc57c\ud560\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc885\ub958\ucc98\ub7fc \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc874\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\ud589\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \ub290\ub08c\uc774, \uc816\uc740 \ub1cc \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ub610 \ub2e4\ub978 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \uc9c4\uacf5\uc5d0 \ube68\ub824 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac14\ub2e4 \ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5 \ucf54\ub4dc. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub108\ubb34 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc5c9\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc774\ud574 \uc774\uc788 . \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubb38\uc790 three hundred \uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc778\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac81\uc774 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc778\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uaebc\ub824 \uc57c \uac19\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub294 \ub3d9\ubb3c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub97c\ub610\ud55c \ubc84\ub77d \uc624\ubc14\ub9c8 \uc81c \ub0a8\ud3b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy if you can't get wi-fi", "Author": "Diane Garner", "ReviewID": "R2Z3WAYC6MT21T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This iPad doesn't come with the ability to get internet UNLESS you can get to wi fi.

I even set up 1 of laptops for dual os usage--- Linux and windows. I really loved Linux the bests but apps are hard to find. So,after nearly 35 yrs of computer usage,I feel I can objectively rate the apple iOS on my new ipad. I heard,read,and researched info. About apple and thought I should change over after conferring with my husband (senior software engineer) who said apple now has business apps for the professional population. That said: here I am after only one week of owning an iPad and I AM CONSIDERING getting rid of it, the main complaints about windows are: 1) windows 8 2) privacy, 3) the wga genuine harassment (paid a lot of money for msn windows 7 and EVEN with re-doing I'd numbers back and forth --- I constantly got a \"not genuine\" tag that constantly pops up no matter what I did--- I had been using the same os and upgraded to professional, and after a year, for some reason,it started popping up the WGA harassment!  4) during os scans,Microsoft data,,virus,identifying, LSO ,was the #1 culprit that were \"infecting\" my computer!  With these 4 windows os  ( there are FAR more) issues , I decided to leave that os. NOW The iPad issues : 1) apple support (for HOW to use this iPad--- not repairs or apps , all of which are general) I am being forced to give the serial number which I know to be a \"record\" of my personal computer. And NO I am NOT interested in a relationship with apple EVER. Don't I have the right to know how to use this expensive piece of ----- I hadn't even turned it on because I didn't want ios7 automatically downloading on my ipad! And the rep lied and said it wouldn't  and I have full control. Over it not happening. Well, it DID auto download without my permission! Even though it isn't installed, IT Is the manipulative,greedy, way that Apple is controlling over what I want to download . Now,I can't get rid of it,and this nagging update flag is in plain sight on my computer every time I turn it on, this control reeks of dictatorship without any regards to MYRight to use my computer! 2) I didn't buy this iPad for facebook or twitter or ANY social Media at all! Instead of going to the media website and installing it BY MY choice, it is everywhere ---- my settings, shows up in website address bar as I am typing which website I wANT to go to. And if my finger slips on it or I accidentally tap those sites, I get connected or it begins to install itself! This alone disgusts me no END! 3) all software downloads have to come through the apple store---how proprietorial is that! That , too, I didn't know. What I was told was that apple apps are virtually virus free without \"bug\". So why can't I download the free open office word processor directly from the Internet? Another  dictatorial control of apple. (4) the web browser is awful! No way of setting privacy features such as third party cookies (instead there is an \"always\" , \"never\" or when I visit,to always accept all cookies. A site by site \"allowable cookie\" option is not available. And I can't even get redirects stopped when I do a first party website connection,  No add ons, and I have to remember every time I leave the site or shut down, to have all browser history deleted and cookie deletion. Safari is the ONLY web browser because all other browsers have to go through apple's  exclusive browser and it slows down Internet service. (5) email is not user friendly. It is difficult to have all email sites linked to this feature. In fact, using emails other than gmail,yahoo is almost impossible. I don,t use them at all. (6) having to constantly use a password each and every time I access they apple stop is time consuming and the iPad doesn't allow me to have it automatically saved.Well there's the review.like I said ,i am considering getting rid of my ipad. In fact, I am trying to find a reason (s) to keep it.
