{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better Than Expected", "Author": "Anfro", "ReviewID": "R3T4NP8MHRA7T6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this Tablet for over a week now and have to say that I am blown out of the water by its performance and what you can do with it! To be fair, there were a few laggy areas when I first got it (day after launch) but those have since been cleaned up by 2 samsung updates. This thing is smokin fast now. I don't really use the \"My Magazine\" app that people are complaining about so I don't have an opinion on that one. But everything else that I use it for is amazing. I really enjoy the web browser that came with it too. I never use chrome or dolphin now.So far what has really blown me away is the split screen where you can have two apps open at the same time side by side. I really love this and do it often. Normally when I split, I have the tablet in portrait mode and have youtube in the top windowpane and the internet browser in the bottom windowpane. But on top of that in each windowpane can have multiple apps that you can switch with independently. I also love the fact you can have a windowed app (select few) that you can move around on the screen while you do others things. For example, I have my bank app up and want to figure out my finances for the next 2 weeks so I use the Spen to open a windowed version of the calculator and just start crankin away. It's awesome!Honestly I don't use the Spen that much for drawing and didn't really buy it for that. I bought it for the beefy specs, build quality, and high resolution screen and have not been disappointed one bit. It is nice to take a screen capture and be able to write notes directly on it though.One thing I think a lot of people are not taking advantage of is an app that comes pre-installed called \"WatchON\". It is a samsung app that uses the IR blaster as a universal remote control for all your devices that use a remote. In the tutorial you set up your tv model the cable you use, the make of the cable box, and voila you have a powerhouse remote experience. Let me tell you I use this every day now. So I open the app to the \"guide\" section and it shows everything that is on tv like your cable box guide. You then select what you want and it changes it on your tv! It's just nice to have a channel on and just peruse though the guide and select what you want without dealing with the cable box guide. You can star your favorite channels and switch between them with ease.  Volume up,down, source, and many other options at your fingertips. I also have my AV receiver that I use for sound set up and it knows to use that for the volume, the channel for the cable box, and the power for the tv. Brilliant! On top of all of that, if you have a newer tv with WIFI direct you can click a button to connect the tablet with the tv and choose to watch whatever is on the tv on the tablet! I was blown away when I stumbled upon that feature! Alert: this app is awesome on football days when you want to switch through the many games that are on at the same time!I'm rambling on here but also you can mirror your tablet to your tv (with wifi direct) and it shows what you see on your tablet on your tv. I played the new Madden game on it and it was flawless.All in all this is a great tablet and I am very happy with my decision even though it was about $100 more than I wanted to spend. It is worth it though. The software you get with this compared to a clean android experience makes it worth it.  I really think if i went to a nexus device from this I would miss all the features and Spen abilities. That is how I know the extras are worth it.I will update this review as things change for the better or worse but right now I am thrilled :)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1: Well, I have had this tablet for just over 3 weeks now and it has successfully integrated itself in my daily life :) I thought it would be odd for a while considering I came from the HP Touchpad with android installed. The HP touch pad has a more square aspect ratio (like the ipads) whereas the Note 2014 is more \"Wide Screen\". I am happy to say that I am totally comfortable with the Note 2014 after just 3 weeks. :) I even use it in portrait mode mostly and it feels natural and great. Over all I still love this tablet and it is performing very well.I've been through 3 over-the-air updates from Samsung and it gets faster and faster with each one. The only problem I had with the tablet was that it took a second or two to wake from sleep via the power button. The 3rd update seems to have fixed this mostly but there still are times where it will take a second...one Mississippi...there we go :) But honestly its not that bad. I use the MoKo case for it that I got on Amazon. It has the smart cover that wakes it upon opening so I don't notice a delay that much if there is one. Other than that I am still very happy with this tablet. I'm glad i did my research and waited for this one.Something I didn't really touch on in the original review are the speakers. They are very nice and I love that there are two of them for stereo. They sound very good as well. The HP Touchpad had some pretty good speakers (shockingly) and I feel this tablet is on par which is good and above average in my opinion.In conclusion, I am still very happy with my purchase even taking in account its price. I knew I needed at least 32GB internal storage so it was $600 or nothing :) Keep the questions coming and I will try to answer them as quickly as possible. Later!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This tablet is not for everyone, but those it is for will be blown away", "Author": "J. Bush", "ReviewID": "R3G0A2Q146EVPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has entirely streamlined my educational, professional, and personal productivity.  I will preface this by saying I chose this tablet (as my very first tablet of any kind) after 5 WEEKS of research and hours and hours of reading the manual, watching video of reviews, unboxing, customization, how-to's, tips and tricks, and specific software guides. I had the nexus 10 in my amazon shopping cart when I first came across this tablet.  I will nowhere in this review compare this to an apple device- I have never and will never own one- personal preference, I wholeheartedly believe iOS is sufficient or ideal for a lot of people's use, just not ever going to be for mine.  As background, I am in an international DVM program whose laptop just crashed and all 600+gigs of my life were backed up but now only floating in cyberspace so my requirements were a little heady for a tablet-a) deal with extensive editing and review of PDFs, PPTs, DOCs,  XLXS, etc  14-17hrs a day (terms range from 21-24 credits, 4-5hrs of lecture straight, 3-4 hrs of lab with no access to outlet in many labs).  Also when I say edit I don't just mean take notes on I also mean incorporate text, figures, etc from textbooks, websites, and other documents.b) Be a textbook reader and rarely a e-book reader (novels for fun!)  Need to access my extensive kindle library, plus some google books and a few Elsevier/pageburst textbooks. Also this needs to be something I am comfortable and accepting of to literally study off of, enough to give up my previous preferring to only study off of paper/actual printed out notesc) Allow for flawless email, web chat, skype video and text, some web browsing, and file transfer... all on an absolutely horrible school wireless and LAN setup, unpredictable power availability, etc.d) Streaming and downloading of podcasts, video, MRI, CT, radiographs, and ECG'se) Be portable to the clinic and the farms for patient-side transcription, recording, etcf) Get me through the 5-6hr flight and all the airport time!g) Occasionally watch videos/listen to things for funh) Most importantly, due to a dominant hand injury, multiple surgeries, and continued required hand therapy/rehab, I am currently able to write again but not to type with that hand.  I therefore wanted a tablet that was stylus intensive- not just for notes, but for navigation, etc.  THIS is what made me give up that wonderful squeaky clean android OS of the nexus 10! (I still thing that is probably the best thing for people that want an android tablet but don't NEED a stylus) So my tablet arrived flawless and flawlessly.  The display is beautiful, if anything the screen is too bright- I'm aware my eyes are light sensitive so this won't match with the majority of people but if I do turn my brightness on at all I don't believe I've ever gone above 15%, though I'm sure there will be some case videos poorly and darkly shot that I may need to in the future.i) at least temporarily, replace my laptop and download and have as much of my backed up laptop files as possibleThe tablet was quickly populated with the apps from my HTC phone and google account.  The account set up for everything was quick and easy.  The initial 2 updates were completed with no adverse signs. Navigation was great, no lag, and I quickly cleared out the stock widgets, set up my panes, and then went into settings.... I activated Developer options and did some customization and disabling there, but most of the disabling I did in app manager, device, and controls.  There are very helpful guides out there if you're not sure which apps are safe to disable as well as a \"Guide: Longer Battery Life- How You're Being Robbed on XDA that takes you step by step in maximizing your tablet.  It was not created at the time when I cleaned up mine but it would've helped greatly!Here is the gist.  The tablet comes crammed full of software and capabilities that I don't need or want.  The My Magazine app, a lot of the touchwiz stuff, the eye movement sensors(smart screen), the hand gesture stuff, reading mode, voice control, motions/palm motions, all of that is just a constant battery drain and I will never use them.  They were disabled and the vibration feedback for everything was also turned off.Battery Report:  This tablet was shipped within the US twice, and was brought internationally on a plan 4 days later.  It was accidently left on the ENTIRE time for about 8 days with six apps up on standby.  It arrived with 18% battery left.  I use it for 15-17hours a day and end up having to charge it 2-3hrs per about ever 24hr period to get it back to 100.  I can use it while it is charging and it will still positively charge during use.USE FOR A STUDENT:  It has replaced textbooks, laptop, printer, scanner, and painstakenly editing and customizing notes and making documents for me.  Disclaimer: as someone who used to be able to type 130+ words per minute, I'll make perfectly clear, if you prefer to type and plan on typing a LOT tablet touchscreen keyboards SUCK.  This is a fact of life.  You can get used to them, you can get proficient at them, but you'll still probably hate it and you're going to need a physical keyboard case/add on if you do a lot of typing of documents or emails.  Now, this tablet is made for a stylus.  This is not just a peculiarly edged simple piece of plastic that you can buy for just about any touchscreen device and kind of use as a writing device.  This is the s-pen, a WACOM and this device and stylus is designed to maximize the experience so you are writing or drawing digitally with an experience just like on paper.  Examples- the harder you press the more solid and thicker your pencil/pen/brush/highlighter/calligraphy/etc line.  The button on the stylus brings up air command which can be super helpful and it also allows quick screen shots. The stylus allows for fine website navigation that allows you to open drop down windows etc as mouse would.  It also offers things a real pen/pencil cant- selective erasing, and selection for drag/drop/copy/paste of ANYTHING to ANYWHERE.  You're typing notes and see a great figure and text on a website, you can freehand or rectangular circle what you want and put it into your document. Then you can resize/edit.  It's great.  I've been using the Snote app for everything thus far, I have made short futile attempts with Lecture Notes and Evernote but I couldn't really get anywhere.  I'm not going to give up on then, I just need to research them more to see if I can eventually get them to do what I want and then I can compare them to Snote.USE FOR A PROFESSIONAL: So far, this has been wonderful.  I can seamlessly take notes, look up references, voice record my exam findings, and awkwardly as only a tablet is, take video and pictures of patient's during an exam for later review. (Extremely helpful during lameness and neuro exams for the file).  Collaborative documents through Polaris office and google drive is exceptional- as fast as a laptop and more portable, and better screen size than a smartphone. It runs better than the school computers for running presentations off of onto projectors.  I can also have students I tutor digitally sign- literally our weekly sheets and submit them via email with one step- completely negating the awesome printer and scanner I brought down here.USE FOR A CONSUMER:  I find this tablet beautiful for watching movies and videos and the sound is great.  In a classroom of 50 people chatting between classes I have no problem hearing the speakers among the hub but there are completely valid reports that even cranked the sound might get lost a little if you're in a very loud close crowd.  Sound improves with earbuds but the initial audio set up app (basically a hearing test and then a customized audio scheme for you) was startling when it compared the stock/base line settings to what it came up with for ME.USE FOR AN ARTIST: I'm still learning and adapting, I'll never turn to this instead of actual physical art supplies and paper but it is fun and I can really see myself doing more digital than before.  It has been especially nice for graphic design, photoshopping, etc.USE AS A LEFTY: no issues except see below for one thing that affects both right and left handers...ISSUES:  1) One day after about a week of ownership, my battery was in the upper 80's, I was taking some notes and about 2hrs later I looked at the status bar and it was 29%.  I went into Battery in Settings, and the s-pen interface was responsible for 80% of the battery use.  I shut down and then restarted and it's never happened again.  Similarly the Android OS did the same thing at a later instance but again it was a one time thing and in both cases the battery recharged speedily after and stayed charged.2) Snote- I have had weird episodes where an import fails, or it force closes itself repeatedly when I try to rename or change the cover of one particular document.  After this erratic behavior occurred twice in three days and completely clearing and restarting Snote from scratch (everything backed up and replaced on my Samsung account) to no avail, I did a factory reset.  The last \u00be of my ownership have seen no such problems any more.  I will warn you that if you wipe out S note and you start from scratch in it and re-transfer all your SNote files back in, if you have a lot of really big files, it can take a really long time to re-populate.3) The menu/return and physical home button- occasionally based on the desk I'm at, if my arm isn't supported and my wrist is resting fully on the edge of the tablet, these buttons will get pressed while I'm writing.  Its purely an annoyance and doesn't affect the writing or do anything but I definitely have to reposition if I find I'm getting lazy on holding my wrist up at these desks.Wrap up: I only use in landscape, it's just like writing on a portrait piece of paper except you can also zoom.  I got used to writing on the tablet and the tiny stylus very quickly but there are compatible Samsung styli of various widths and sizes out there as well. I thought about waiting for the new 12.2 whose screen is literally a full piece of paper landscape, but I realized this is perfect for me and more portable than the 12.2 will be (this thing can just squeeze into one of the pockets on one of my lab coats.  I was planning on having to use the Nova launcher to avoid any lag but truly, this tablet was a speed demon already and I eventually got Nova solely for the customization ability and cleaner interface.  It allows me to avoid more things I don't use and I didn't lose ANY of the software I do.Bottom line, RESEARCH! PREPARE! And there will STILL BE A LEARNING CURVE! But it will be based on discovering unexpected cool features instead of on frustration).  If you won't heavily use the stylus, don't spend the money on this tablet.  If you're just curious if you could \"get into a stylus\" try one out first but prepare first so you can use it to the full advantage while you're there.  Also, I came from NO tablet and no Samsung/Note experience and there are changes between the previous model and this.  You don't actually lose much but things are moved around and different.  Don't be scared to optimize it, I'm not talking rooting, though adventurous forays into that terrain have finally arrived as well. In conclusion I love it, it has made things so much more efficient for me, I get a lot DONE with it and it's basically all I have to carry around.  I purchased the 32gig tablet plus a 64gig Sandisk XC which installed and worked like a charm. There are annoyances that come up but any issue I have had I have been able to fix. I have everything safely backed up on Carbonite and there's a million ways to sync all of your accounts if you chose (note some of this may be unnecessary or frequency can be dialed back too)It performs and looks beautiful and I am still learning.EDIT: FLASH PLAYER: This tablet absolutely supports flash. Youtube and embedded flash worked right out of the box, however, to watch my amazon video's etc, I just downloaded the following file- I cannot post the actual link but it's a drop box file. Install this and make sure flash is enabled in your browser settings/plugins and it will work in the stock browser, Dolphin, and Mozilla. Some people also recommend having your browser set to View Desktop site.Edit 12/15/2014: Please see my comment under product question- \"Can you use amazon prime video on the galaxy 10.1 2014 ed? asked by Judith C.

I just wanna say that this now support multiple users!! This is awesome and I'm so glad Samsung came through with this feature.Pros--Screen- Wonderful color representation and clarity, Eye candy.-S-pen- such a nice stylus, works like a pen, a tablet and stylus really belong together like this!-Speakers- Beautiful sound, surprisingly clear and crisp, just a pleasure to listen to. (watched the avengers a couple clicks below highest volume and it was definitely adequate)-Speed- One of the quickest tablets I've used, it has recently gotten an update that increases the speed of touch-wiz getting rid of any previous stuttering. The gpu in this is a beast capable of a lot of things that some of the next gen chips can't do like directx 11 and full Gpu computation.-Sturdiness- Feels very well built, haven't had any problem, although plastic it is very sturdy and doesn't \"feel\" plastic. The faux leather back is quite nice, and a welcome change of pace however it is just molded plastic I'll say so you don't get mislead.-Battery Life- This will have enough juice to power a heavy user through the whole day. I have done a test on 25% brightness with WiFi on continuously. In this condition it lasts 10hrs and 43minutes approximately. This was under heavy network usage, and the usage was about 4hrs of video, 1hr of gaming, 2hrs of drawing, 2hrs of web surfing and about the last 2 hours buying and installing stuff. This was with power-saving mode on I believe.S-pen air command functions:-Action memo- take a quick note and link the information your wrote to something.-Pen Window- Basically, an overlaying window that is surprisingly reminiscent of windows on, well..., windows. (Works with only seven apps currently though)-Screen write- Take a screen shot and write on it, not sure what it's good for. Maybe to annotate a website or an E book.-S Finder- Search your content, and the web for whatever your looking for. (draw a symbol and search it, or an equation, although it might not always know what kind of equation you want it to be.)-Scrapbooker- Basically collect content from the web, or anywhere and throw it all in one place for you to have easy access to.Cons--Touch-wiz is definitely not as easy to use as stock Android, once you get used to it though it isn't at all bad.(edit: I have really begun to like this version of touch-wiz, it has some things reminiscent of stock android but gives it a new spin, but it might not be for everyone)-Expensive, but worth it if you are going to use the features.-Cannot record 4k video, honestly 4k isn't going to be mainstream for awhile and it's not something that is missed as this can record 1080P which is very high quality.-The packaging was weird hah, was very secure though.-Not sure what else to put as i can't honestly think of anything else that is troublesome.(i will update though as i have further use of the tablet)If you have any questions please comment.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it!  Here's a few tips... (Follow-up)", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"richlife\"", "ReviewID": "R3E3LTQOYH9KQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 1/11/2014:  I just want to add a tip that someone gave me in a comment to another Note 10.1 2014 review. In the review that follows, I complain that Android is not really conducive to developing and editing spreadsheets, That's true ( .for me at least), but the tip was to work spreadsheets with the tablet in portrait position rather than landscape. That really does help.Update 12/3/2013:  First of all, I've downgraded my rating to 4 stars -- for the same reasons many have commented on.  I just don't find the problems to be as large or as tedious of some do and I get a lot more benefits from my Note 10.1 than I have issues, so I would really say a 4+.The biggest issue is that the Note hand writing translation is not anywhere near perfect and does actually have a few naughty problems that will at times slow you down.  I find you need to learn how to \"write\" on the note.  For example, it has difficulty between my \"i\", \"l\", \"/\", and even \"'\" or \",\".  As I get more meticulous the better the result.  My \"tt\" is done with three strokes, not four.  The Note seems to have learned how to handle that.  (Good!)  Stray spaces or overwrites tend to happen and mostly surprise me and require correction.  But at times the Note just correctly interprets the same input.  (Strange!)So for me who uses the Note to communicate with others (not just to take notes for myself) and who tends to perfectionism on spelling and punctuation, there IS a certain amount of frustration and correction that I shouldn't have to do.  (I should point out that 45 years ago in college, I learned to print FAST because I couldn't read my own writing when it came time to review/study.  I haven't tested Note with my writing, but frankly, I shudder.)So why a 4-star review?  I love it.  With some minimal correcting, I generally get what I want properly entered with the s-pen and I feel no need for a real keyboard despite being an excellent typist.  I MUCH prefer the s-pen over poking the screen keyboard.  Those who complain about lag, even with TouchWiz, clearly are not getting all the Samsung updates or may have other issues.  (Incidently, as a new Samsung user, I LIKE TouchWiz and have not felt a need to replace it.  I also just got a new Samsung Galaxy S4 and naturally there is almost no learning curve.)  Despite TouchWiz, Android 4.3 is simple Android 4.3.  Don't bother me with complaints otherwise.The screen is great, the size is perfect for me (where the Nexus 7 was just too small), the feel is good and after 3 weeks I still don't understand why people complain so vehemently about accidentally pressing fixed button or soft keys.  Some adaptability in life is a good thing.  I won't say that accidental key presses have not happened, but no more than using my 6 year old laptop (still getting occasional use).The speakers puke, but that's why I bought a Logitech Bluetooth Speaker for my Nexus 7.  I use my devices for music access, not for quality sound.  You need to find your own sound quality.  A photographer or a smartphone owner may not want to use the onboard camera, but it is definitely useful at times with reasonable results.My other use for a Note is for woodworking design.  The is no replacement for Sketchup -- that's the only software for which I need to find an Adroid option.  However, some limited use of the S-note and Sketchpad have been very promising and hand drawings are basically how I start everything and sometimes the only thing I use.I'm a retired programmer/project manager and now have only an irregular need for a full computer system though I have been dependent on a PC and then a laptop for more than 30 years until 3 weeks ago.  My laptop still suffices when needed, but I've hardly used it at all since getting the Note.  My biggest issue is with the extensive spreadsheets that I would like to be able to use, edit and update on the Note.  Spreadsheets in general are not well supported by the Note software (or any other Android software that I have found). Spreadsheets are not pure text input and Samsung or someone else should provide a \"Cell Based\" input means that doesn't cover half the visible spreadsheet with an input area.  So there is some spreadsheet utility, but at this point, I still must go to the laptop for major updates.I don't see that as particularly a Samsung problem although they could (and should) certainly provide the solution.  The Android spreadsheet software is just lacking for advanced work.  Most of the FUNCTION is there, but as I said, the interface is weak.  This typically would only affect me about 3 - 4 times a year.  My spreadsheets have 10 years of development and use in them for budget management.  I can still see my results (including the graphical analysis) and do limited inputs with what is available on Android.So this spreadsheet limitation is the ONE item that prevents ME from COMPLETELY replacing a Windows based computer with the Note 10.1.  It may not work for others, others may feel more limited, it may be necessary to adapt to new software and techniques (cloud usage) but I am very satisfied with the Note.  Improved S-pen software and a good spreadsheet interface, would complete my requirements.I've never been an Apple user though in my technical days did involve early Macs.  I'm in the camp that the the iPad bigots should \"get over it\".  If you like your device, fine.  It's not better than mine for my purposes -- I like to be able to manage my own device.(It suddenly strikes me to say that MY usage has almost NOTHING to do with media entertainment.  Interesting!)(Begin original thoughts:)It's hard to add any to the good reviews that have already been made, so mostly I'll first recommend that you read the first 5 - 8 reviews under the default \"Most Helpful First\" sort.  At the end of this preliminary review, I'll add the many suggestions I collected from reading ALL the reviews and comments -- that should help some of you who are new or still trying to learn.  And I strongly recommend that anyone watch the 48 minute YouTube review that I have posted as a comment.  There is more good information and orientation in that video than you'll find in maybe any other.Despite some dissenters on this idea, I'm using the Note 10.1 as a replacement for my venerable Win7 on Sony VAIO laptop.  The laptop is beginning to show it's age and wear after 6 years.  Still runs better than my wife's new Lenovo Twist with Win8.  I've been using a Nexus 7 for the past year and this Note is much nicer.So related to this laptop replacement, one question I have up front is whether any of those who rate this tablet at 5 or 4 either have or plan to get a bluetooth keyboard to use with it.  At this point, I'm not in a rush, but as a typist, a keyboard CAN be nice.  For me, the keyboard would stay in my living room like my laptop does -- I definitely will use the Note and stylus for portability and convenience. (Edit:  You can get a keyboard, but I now don't think it is necessary.)The most difficult concern with this tablet is it's complexity (I've commented about this in a number of other reviews).  After that concern, there is a nice \"feature\" that got in the way -- once you follow the introductory setup, if you already have had a tablet, the Note will go out to Google and/or Samsung and start downloading your configuration and apps.  Nice (it took several hours to get all mine from my Nexus 7) but interferes with getting the new updates from Samsung.As others said, there are currently three updates which eliminate the lag and add multi-tasking.  If your new Note is clean, you will have no issues with doing a factory reset after getting those updates as some recommend.  But if you spent hours getting your apps in place, you probably won't want to start again from scratch after a factory reset.  Despite that (wanting to be sure I had the best possible performance) I decided to do the factory reset -- after all it was just a matter or waiting for all those downloads again as I hadn't really done any special customization.In the end, I found that doing the factory reset didn't seem to provide any better performance for me -- it was great before and after with no lag.  I suspect that those who did get an improvement had not downloaded all 3 updates before they did a reset.  Can anyone confirm or deny that?  (Edit:  Max posted agreement with this.  Thanks, Max.)So now I'm into seriously configuring this thing.  Since the Nexus 7 doesn't have a memory card slot, all my apps were downloaded into the Note main storage.  Any suggestions on what and how to best transfer stuff to the 64 Gig microchip?  I assume some apps will run better from main storage?  I plan to put all my data, music and pics on the microchip.I'm not having problems or lag with Touchwiz, but I'll try another launcher and post about that later.  (Edit:  Not sure now that I will actually bother -- TouchWiz is fine for me.)So that's my preliminary rating based on the fact that everything I've done and tried out has gone well and the device itself appears to be in perfect condition.  I'll edit this in a couple of weeks to update my experience, but up front, I TOTALLY disagree with the review that complained extensively about the poor build quality.  Sure it's plastic, but the fit and finish is great.  NOTHING appears to be loose or vibrates.I also want to comment about the experience I had with Amazon on the shipping.  UPS completely screwed it up and reported the tablet as delivered on time even though I never saw it.  The first Amazon CSR seemed to get things all taken care up, but I didn't get any followup.  After I called back AGAIN, the support team worked together to first of all ensure I got to someone who would take care of the problem and each person involved took responsibility to see that the handoffs were completed properly.  Not ideal, but I got my Note 10.1 with only a small delay.___________Ok, these are the suggestions I gleaned from the reviews and comments of others.  Feel free to use or not as you choose -- these items are copied as found from different people so they are a bit disjointed and redundant:NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues. Go to Settings/General/About Device/Software Update to get it. Mine did not automatically update.If you continue to have issues, you should do a factory reset after installing the newest update for the device. To check for updates manually, go to about device in options.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher.NOVA is good, but I've always liked Apex better.  With Apex, I turned on \"Tablet UI\" mode, which makes it look like stock Android (no bottom bar, no dock, app drawer icon in upper right, square-outline tablet animation for panning desktop, etc). I love stock Android so for me, Apex in tablet-UI mode is great.After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great.Cons: Samsung overlays android with their system touchwiz. It has its good but it has its bad like major Memory hog. I'd recommend using one of the launchers such as nova launcher for a more customization of an experienceUSB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome.Google Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities. To allow the Dolphin Browser to have its Flash option work, you must download an Android 4.0's version of flash on the tablet, anyone version will do. Google Android flash player archives and proceed to the Adobe site. Flash has no longer made anymore updates for android devices, therefore you must do it this way. Go to dolphin browser, hit menu, hit settings, turn on flash. And now you have flash capabilities on your Dolphin browser, no other browser has flash capability as of now. I must tell you it is a pleasure to watch Amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser, and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use S Note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:  -------------Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to \"not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button\". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master.  -------------Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location.-The Touchwiz gallery app is TERRIBLE, it draws thumbnails every time you open the app, so if you have lots of photos, it hangs/lags sot bad that it can render the device unusable.[I use QuickPic and it handles everything fine](For people that dont have 4K+ photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging, dropbox photo displaying, Google+ photo syncing/displaying, Facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery)??? If you have the Galaxy Note phone, transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same. And once you link your Google account, it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you. You'll still need to download Amazon apps individually- but you'll need to allow downloads from \"unknown sources\" to get them.I will say there are some things you won't discover right away; settings that are buried in other menus and menus that you discover in apps after days of using them.Many application features are difficult to discover. Always press the menu button, just in case!Turn off the news/home button association by pressing the menu button while the news is on screen. You'll see the option to turn it off there.The S-Note can go into what I'd call \"Note-Only\" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).I've only had it a few days and the first thing I did was download Nova Launcher, program it to \"remote\" my TV and to prevent possible lag went into \"Settings\", \"General\", \"About Device\", tapped \"Build Number\" 7 x's. This opens the \"Developer Options\" tab, then under \"Drawing\" turned OFF \"Transition Animation Scale\". You can go to YouTube and watch this tutorial presented by TheDigitalDigest. Great series of helpful tutorials for tablet neophytesTo learn more about the Note 10.1 2014 Edition, here is a link to a YouTube video on Samsung Mobile's page:[...] .  [Even better to me, this is the long, thorough review that shows almost everything there is to know:  [...] .]", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why I returned my Ipad air and purchased the Note 2013 Edition", "Author": "Mark H. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R1UR3PZTN5YPWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was a very difficult decision to return my iPad Air and order the Note 2014 Edition.  There are plenty of reviews that address the functions of the and features of the Note 2014 Edition, what I will address the key areas that  made me move off the Apple platform.For background I have been an iPad user since the beginning, I have loved the design, function and application portfolio of the platform.  What I have not liked was the closed environment of of IOS, I find it frustrating to run all my content thru iTunes and the difficulty and sometimes inability to move content from the iPad to other platforms.(Yes I know about Dropbox and cloud services but that still requires additional steps and still doesn't enable certain content to be easily moved))  It is incredibly easy to sideload content to and from the Android platform enabling me to share my content across all of my android devices.Aspect Ratio - I read a lot of printed materials (newspapers/magazines) on my tablet,  initially I favored the 4:3 aspect ration of the  thinking that it enabled me to read the text of a full page without expanding.  Even though (in landscape) the 16:9 ratio on the Samsung is not is wide it turns out to be wide enough and better fits the length of display required for both newspapers and magazines.Expanded Storage -  In the current release of Android you have the capability of running applications off of the MicroSD card effectively expanding main memory.  Note in early release of android you could only store content on the microsd.  I was always very frustrated at the cost that Apple charged you for storage-  For an additional $45 I have been able to expand my 32gb congfig to 96gb - note- you'll want to use a micro SD card the read/writes ar 30mgps like the Ultra series from SanDisk.Printing - This is a definite strength of the iPAd/IOS platform.  The print function is built into the operating system enabling you to print natively.  Printing on the Note is a bit kluge and requires third party apps like cloud print, HPePrint and others. than on Android Applications -  It is no surprise that more iPad applications are optimized for the larger screen.  Android still seems to be a phone based operating system that works on larger devices.  From the aesthetic perspective this in not a problem for me, video content from Netflix, HBOGO, Xfinity and Youtube look just as good on the Samsung Note and the did the iPad Air.  I get less wowed that my weather widget doesn't jump off the screen.  However one of my favorite magazine applications Newsstand does not run in Android.  This is that app that consolidates electronic versions of the print magazine you subscribe to.  Currently note of the publishers of the magazines I subscribe to have a native android app.  All of the aggregation apps like Plus or Zino would require a second subscription which I am not willing to do.  Big negative for me.S-Pen -  This is a key reason to purchase the Note.  I love to take down phone numbers and have them immediately published to my contacts file or to-do to my to-do list.  Using the S-Pen with the multi-taking capability is incredible, it enables you to asclosely as possible emulate what you can do on a powerful laptop.  Major feature/capabilities advantage for the note.Swift-Key/Swipe - This is the best way to input onto a virtual keyboard.  I hated typing on my iPad after sywping on my Samsung Phone. Swiftkey is an even better implementation along with it allowing you to resize and relocate the keyboard.  Major advantage for the Note.So to net it out, they are both great tablets but the ability to expand storage (cheaply), easily move content to and from the platform, multi tasking, swyping and the S-Pen made the decision easier for me.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "SUBSTANCE and INGENUITY- Not Just \"AIR\"  ---now has MULTI-USER !", "Author": "anzicco", "ReviewID": "RI1ECL1ST763L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Galaxy Note10.1- 2014 now for about three weeks ever since I traded in my aging iOS device, an iPad 3.I am blown away by the beautiful Ultra HD display which far exceeds any clarity and color of any tablet I have seen!  Blows retina away!The S Pen let's me be \"naturally\" creative as I would with a pencil on paper, as it responds well and handles almost flawless to transcribe what I write as text into typed text from taking notes, to searching in the URL box, to the new ingenious Twitter application that let's me write or draw tweets! The ability to open multi windows is a great new experience from the decaying stagnant features on my old tablet. Not only can you open two apps and work between them at the same time, but you can also open two windows with the same app such as 2 websites or 2 emails... and you can even draw another window, or 2, or 3 on top of those windows to watch youtube or bring up a calculator and more!The one gripe I have is because of its advanced specs, some of the software, especially touchwiz related items, does not seem to be optimized for these higher specs and tend not to run as smoothly as they do on the S4 or Tab3. There are also some game apps that falter or slow down for some reason (like Simpson's Tapped Out) when they work fine on my other Galaxy products. I don't know if they just haven't been updated for android 4.3 which is standard on this device or if they just can't keep up with the tablet's specs. I hope Samsung releases an update to speed up these issues, and that Kit Kat 4.4 is planned for this monster of a tablet soon!I highly recommend this tablet. Samsung makes it easier to switch from other formats such as Apple's iOS to android than some of the other manufacturers that just give you vanilla android.I made the switch earlier this year when the S4 was released and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be...I did not lose functionality or choices of productive apps, but actually gained a lot more and also can customize my device to reflect my taste, not some hot shot designer in an IvEry tower telling me the way my device should look and function.  You can also expand this device's storage by an additional 64GB with a micro SD card!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tablet for anyone who likes to be creative or productive and enjoys the freedom to have the additional input that the S Pen provides!********************NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues.

That being said, having an Android device, especially a Note 10.1 2014 has its benefits:-Customization of home screens with android widgets (see google).-Air View, Smart Scroll (leave off when not using to save battery), Smart Stay (leave off when not using to save battery).-Micro SD card for external storage up to 64 gigabytes.-Downloadable music, video, document files right off the internet that gets saved to your device(external or internal) and easily accessible through the general video, gallery and document apps on the device.-Ability to download third party apps not found on the google play store, such as paid apps. (Does not require your device to be \"jailbroken\" like the iPhone/iPad.-much more benefits,Note: If you buy the Note 10.1 2014 you get over $600 in perks. This means $25 google play store money, $50 for Samsung hub to download entertainment, 2 years of 50gb of Dropbox storage free, 3 months of Hulu Plus free, Audible for 3 months free and several more other offers.Before you start using the device, I highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.Comparing this tablet to the newly released iPad Air, this tablet is much for capable in terms of multitasking and performance. iPad Air has 1gb of RAM, whereas the Note 10.1 2014 has 3gb of RAM. There is a noticeable difference in better performance speed in running apps and graphic \"smoothness\" compared to other tablets out there like like iPad 4 (not sure about ipad Air). More importantly, this extra RAM allows the Note 10.1 2014 to multi-task very well and I am referring to the \"multi-window option\" which allows split screen between two apps (Apple does not have this on the iPad) so you can operate different apps side by side at the same time. In terms of screen real estate, they are about the same however the note does have much more pixels (see specifications). The note is longer but shorter, while the iPad is taller, but not as long. The reason one may buy this tablet is for the S pen feature and its highly customized interface.No other tablet in the market has an S-pen that is advanced than the normal pens you use for touch screens. The S Pen has a button and when clicked on, it initiates air command which lets to choose options to take notes,save portions of the screen, write on a screen shot taken, etc (read all about air command). The accuracy of the Samsung screens is much more accurate in terms of pointing at words with your finger and especially your S-pen on the Note 10.1 2014 which is shown by research, if you google Samsung screen accuracy.For flash capabilities, I use a web browser called Dolphin Browser, there are others out there for flash capabilities, but i prefer Dolphin for its speed and stability. After installing Dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled, I've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities.

Great case, with auto sleep/wake when opening or closing flaps and a great feel/look.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Downfall for this tablet (currently), hopefully an update to fix will be out soon.Known issue of slight lag in the interface/home button while browsing around:Touchwiz is known to cause this issue(the interface program for Samsung Galaxy Series).LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:Turn on developer options by tapping \"build number\" found in the \"about\" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off.

Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master. Also I highly suggest you install an anti-virus software like AVG on your Note 10.1 2014.Tips to extend battery life, go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep. In addition, turn off GPS located by networks in the network location options, turn on GPS only for location. I suggest if you do get a defective Note 10.1 2014, return it for another one.But hey, for the innovative features you get on this tablet and especially the high customization you get it is worth it in my opinion. iPad's and iPhones have been nearly the same every year after each years new release.A good tablet contender would be the Surface 2 in terms of pricing, which is actually cheaper right now, but does not include a type cover.The pro's to the Surface 2 would be an almost identical Office Suite, the RT version of a windows 8 desktop and tiles, close feel to a laptop and built in flash player.The Con's would be a very limited HD screen, that is about 208 PPI, low market share and only 100,000 Apps on the windows store.In my opinion using the type cover with the Surface 2 would be almost like using a small laptop, which I personally think takes away from the term of what a tablet actually is. I might as well use my small laptop with windows 7 installed to do my office work. I dont plan to replace my laptop with a tablet. However if you rather have a tablet-like experience with something you are very familiar like windows, then the Surface 2 may be the way to go.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, a tablet that thinks with you and not for you.", "Author": "Beantown Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1F623L69UAQEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding off on jumping into the tablet game as every tablet out there was just another vehicle for access to entertainment and \"intuitive\" decimation of information (which I think mostly means without human thought or involvement).  While entertainment is great, my tvs, phones and laptops had that covered.  I'd been holding out for a device that could do something those others didn't already have covered.  A device that combined time - tested methods (handwriting commits things to memory like typing or finger tapping can't) with modern information and productivity.  This tablet is that and so much more.As a researcher, I need something that can handle hours of reading and annotations, mind breaks into magazines and Web searches and space to customize as my needs change.  No other tablet offers that level of flexibility.  This tablet does it beautifully (literally the screen is awesome and the function is unparalleled).  It's worth every penny.  The battery life is great, in the few days I've had it, I've had no problem going 2 days without a charge.  It's very comfortable to use in both viewing orientations.  And,  if you download the manual, you'll realize how unlimited the capabilities are.  The S pen is awesome as well and there has been no learning curve to convert it to text.  I use it all the time and haven't found areas of incompatibility.Basically if you've been looking for a device to think with you and not for you, that truly adds to your tech abilities instead of replicating what you already have, buy this tablet.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best right now", "Author": "Neteru1920", "ReviewID": "R20K38MRU6LHDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I'm sort of a technology junkie so I have iPad and iPad mini, nexus 7 and a galaxy note 8, surface pro(which is a pc not a tablet) and I have to say the Galaxy Note10.1 (2014)is my go to tablet right now. I really needed a solution where I can take notes grab articles from the web and multitask.

I was looking for something that I could bring around that would have access to all of my documents and data (google drive) and also something to take notes with in class. This thing is perfect. I have all my books in PDF form so Im bringing around this little guy in my backpack instead of 200 pounds worth of paper. Reading with this thing is a delight, the screen is nice and sharp. Whenever I want to make notes I can do so right in the PDF viewing app, and can review my notes later when studying for tests.Also the stylus is perfect. I'm 8 weeks into classes and already gone through 3 notebooks worth of scrap paper from solving physics problems and such for my classes. (No homework is actually collected, but if you don't do it you'll fail - so its all \"scrap\" paper essentially) With this tablet I can solve problems on the screen and save them for later if I want to study the material. Everything is nice and organized as opposed to my notebooks.In addition to that you have all the normal tablet functions and such yada yada, but hey this isn't a tablet that you'd buy because it can do tablet things.

Save your money and time.  I purchased this tablet with the hopes of using it as a desktop replacement - and using with a keyboard and/or mouse. Any/all Bluetooth devices drop on this tablet.  I have upgraded it to version 4.3 .  Doing a search on the internet reveals this is a systemic issue for the 2014 model. When calling Samsung tech support, they claim not to know it is an issue - however, they will tell you it is a software issue and to 'wait for the update.'  They cannot provide any time for the update...and aren't the ones publishing it.  Too bad - this thing is a nice product otherwise.  I will comment that my Bluetooth devices work well with my Galaxy S4 and other Android Devices.**UPDATE **After speaking with Samsung customer service, they continue to deny there is a problem with the 2014 units.  However, per the customer service rep, Samsung pulled their planned Bluetooth keyboard (he saw it in Beta) - and commented it was quite unusual for Samsung not to have released a keyboard by now.  I published a negative review on the Samsung website about this issue - only to have it pulled from the site.  Shame Shame Samsung for releasing a product with a defect like NO reliable Bluetooth for key'd & mouse. I also am not sure I can attribute this is an Android issue - I have other 4.3 devices *namely a 7\" Nexus tablet* running 4.3.  And that unit works GREAT with various Bluetooth keyboards + mice.

But the fact is the Note 10.1 2014 is the best tablet yet from Samsung, with advanced specs and a state-of-the-art stylus that make this device a worthy competitor to Apple's iPad Air.The biggest selling point of the Note 10.1 2014 is its advanced stylus, called \"S Pen\", which should benefit those who handwrite and draw a lot.  The 10.1-inch touch-screen doubles as a Wacom digitizer board that senses pen pressure and displays pen stroke thickness accordingly.  The S Pen also \"talks\" to the Note tablet: if you hold the tip of the S Pen close to the screen, the Note will sense its presence and automatically disables the touch-screen, so your hands won't accidentally touch it while you are writing or drawing.The S Pen has a fine-point tip that allows precise interaction with the screen.  The tip is  replaceable if it gets dull over time (search Amazon for \"S Pen nib\").  The tip is short and thin, but the end of the tip is round, not sharp.  The Note tablet has a pen holder at the corner for docking your S Pen, so you won't lose it so easily.Samsung doesn't offer a comparable, pen-less version of the Note 10.1 2014.  The other  10\" tablets from Samsung, Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Nexus 10, both have less advanced specs compared to the Note 10.1 2014.  Wait for the rumored upcoming release of Nexus 10 2013 edition, which may have better specs such as the latest Android OS 4.4, if you want just a vanilla 10\" tablet.  Or, if you prefer iOS, get an iPad Air.S Pen is obviously for those who draw and/or write notes a lot.  But if your notes consist mainly of text and you mainly type your notes, then probably any tablet or device will do.  If you need handwriting recognition for text, there are already apps with such ability made for regular tablets, so you don't necessarily need the S Pen.  Rather, the Note and its S Pen are best for people who HAVE to handwrite and draw.  They are for those whose note-taking involves a mixture of words, symbols, and drawings, or any type of activity that necessitates handwriting or drawing.For instance, the S Pen would be useful for students who take notes in class, professionals who make quick visual notes, or anyone who needs to jot down any info that isn't only text.  Useful scenarios for the S Pen include designers who need make some quick drawings, mathematicians writing down equations, writers of East Asian languages who may find it more convenient to handwrite than using complex input methods, or anyone who needs to make a lot of handwritten annotations on pictures, documents, etc.The S Pen's handwriting recognition for text is supported system-wide.  Wherever the regular keyboard pops up, once you take out the S Pen from its holder, the Note immediately changes the keyboard to a writing pad that recognizes your writing.  This only works if you specify the default Samsung keyboard in system settings.  If you install and use third-party keyboard apps, this will not work.The S Pen's handwriting recognition for SHAPES, however, is supported only in a few apps.  By \"shape recognition\", I mean the Note will turn your rough drawing of a square, circle, or any recognizable shape into a perfectly drawn shape.  This results in neater and more presentable notes.Three bundled apps are able to recognize hand-drawn shapes.  \"Polaris Office 5\" is able to recognize simple 2-dimensional shapes only: squares, triangles, stars, etc.  \"S Finder\" is able to search for symbols you have written in your notes, but sadly this only works for 5 symbols: star, circle, heart, question mark, and smiley face.  \"S Note\" is a powerful app that links to your Evernote or Samsung account.  It recognizes 2-dimensional and cubic shapes more accurately, and also lets you edit them more easily.S Note is a richly featured app that recognizes handwritten text of all languages, shapes, and mathematical formulas.  It lets you tranform (and undo transforming) handwritten words to real text that can be copied and pasted elsewhere.  It lets you transform (and undo transforming) handwritten mathematical formulas into PNG image of properly-typefaced formulas.  It lets you resize any part of your note when you run out of room on a page.  You can change colors of any object.  You can even adjust the thickness of the pen strokes already written.  You can use the eraser to erase any portion of your note, down to individual pen strokes.  You can also choose different pen styles: ball-point pen, pencil, caligraphy brush, hi-lighter.  You can customize pen color, thickness, and even set pen presets.  And of course, there is S Pen's ability to sense pen pressure and draw thickness accordingly.  Every action is undoable or redoable.  Most importantly, the plethora of features work really WELL.Needless to say, Samsung did a great job with S Note, which really shows off the S Pen's capability beautifully.  This will probably be the most used app for many who buy the Note 10.1 2014.  As I said, all notes are linked to your Evernote account.  If you use the Evernote app to view or edit your S Note creations, you will be taken automatically to the S Note app.But the excellent S Note lacks one good feature that only \"Action Memo\" has.  Action Memo is another bundled app for note-taking, but it is a much more primitive compared to S Note.  While it recognizes handwriting, it does not transform.  Handwriting stays as is.  It lacks many advanced editing features found in S Note as well.  But Action Memo has the unique ability to perform actions on your handwriting, such as adding your handwritten name and phone number to your contacts, sending an email address directly to a new email composition, sending an address to the map app, or sending a search word to a browser's search field.  Of course, you could just open up the individual contacts, email, map, and browser app and make your entry there.  Hence, this feature's usefulness is somewhat suspect.  Other than this lone capability of Action Memo, I think most of you would use S Note most often instead.The S Pen costs thirty dollars should you need to replace it.  Make sure you get the one specifically for the Note 10.1 2014 tablet, so it will fit into the pen holder.  Do not buy the one for the Note smartphones, nor the one for last year's Note 10.1.  Samsung's website shows that only the black S Pen is available (part# ET-PP600SBEGUJ).  Hence, owners of the white edition of Note 10.1 2014 need to make sure they don't lose their white S Pen.The S Pen itself has a button that launches the \"Air Command\" menu, which lets you launch any of 5 apps: Action Memo, Scrapbooker, Screen Write, S Finder, and Pen Window.  Sadly, S Note is not among them, and the Air Command menu is not customizable.Scrapbooker lets you free-hand \"lasso\" any image on the screen and save it to the \"Scrapbook\" app.  This is essentially just a screen-capturing function that also lets you cut out only the part you want.\"Screen Write\" lets you capture a screen and write on the image afterwards.  The bonus in doing so is that words written in this manner are SEARCHABLE by S Finder, provided that your writing is legible enough for recognition, and that the words are written on solid backgrounds with color that contrasts nicely with font colors, so that recognition is more likely.You can screen-capture the traditional way by pressing the Home and Power button simultaneously.  Captures are saved in the \"Gallery\" app, where you can add writings to the pictures.  But writings made in this manner are NOT SEARCHABLE by S Finder.  Apparently, words are not \"indexed\" here, thus making them not searchable.S Finder is the \"global search\" function of the Note 10.1.  It searches contacts, visited webpages, note content, help content, handwriting created in S Note, Action Memo, and Screen Write, and online content via Google as well.  As I mentioned, it also searches for five symbols: star, circle, heart, question mark, and smiley face.  You are supposed to use these symbols to tag your items, allowing them to be searched more easily.  But as I said, 5 symbols are just too limited to be useful for such a purpose.\"Pen Window\" is a multi-tasking, multi-window feature.  It opens up a small window, lets you choose another app (which must be one of the built-in apps such as Calculator, browser, etc.) which will then open up in a smaller window on top of your current app.More useful is the ACTUAL multi-window feature, which works like this: you open up a tab on the left of the screen, choose an app (which must also be one of the built-in apps), and it will run SIDE BY SIDE with your current app.  You can share info between the two apps by dragging and dropping, if both apps allow it.  This is useful when, for instance, you are composing a document in Polaris Office and you need to drag a picture from the Gallery app to the document.The Note 10.1 2014 has voice recognition as well.  Whenever the Samsung keyboard or writing pad appear, there is a button for voice command, which functions for any language you select.  It works pretty well also.  Technology has advanced to the point where voice recognition works pretty well for everyday vocabulary.  Of course, you may not want to do this in a crowded environment where other people can hear everything word you enter.  You may want to turn off the keyboard tapping sound as well, which also helps to conserve power.Regarding battery power, the Note 10.1 2014 has a few features that drain power and may even overheat the CPU.  I installed the third-party app Android Tuner to monitor the CPU's temperature.  One day, I was shocked to see that it went up to 70-80\u00b0C, which is too hot even for desktop CPUs.  I turned off the Note's \"palm gestures\" and \"smart screen\" features and the temperature went right back to a normal 30-40\u00b0C.  \"Palm gestures\" let you take screen captures or pause video playback by moving your palm in specific ways, and they don't always work.  \"Smart screen\" is supposed to let you motion your eyes to perform certain basic tasks, but again it doesn't work reliably.  Better to turn these features off to save battery AND the CPU.---COMPARISON WITH IPAD AIRChoosing between a Samsung tablet and an iPad may come down to whether you are a bigger fan of Android or iOS.  In terms of apps, both operating systems offer many of the same apps in their respective ecosystem.  There are some notable differences in OS features, however.Android lets you enhance the home screen with \"widgets\", such as stock market ticker, weather tracker, news headlines listing, etc.  Both Android and iOS let you install third-party apps to enhance your home screen appearance.Both Android and iOS let you install third-party keyboard apps.  iOS comes with East Asian keyboards with handwriting recognition.  Android doesn't, so you need to get third-party apps for that.Many Android devices come with a microSD card slot so you can add extra storage.  With iOS devices, the only way you can get extra storage is to pay a hundred dollar more to get the model with more storage.The micro-USB port on many Android devices can connect to external USB hard drive with the necessary cable.  The micro-USB port on iOS devices cannot connect to anything other than iOS accessories.Former iOS users who are new to Android may be disappointed that Android doesn't have the ability to let you tap on the top of the screen to return you to the top of the page.  You have finger-scroll all the way up.Also, Android does not have audio notification for sent email, the way the iOS email app does (the \"swoosh\" sound).Here are some comparisons specific to the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 and iPad Air:In terms of looks, the Note 10.1 2014 has a shiny, silvery outer edge that makes the device look quite cheap, and a faux leather back cover that looks even cheaper.  iPad Air has a sleek, clean look, and an aluminum body that is beautiful to the eyes and great to the touch as well.  Both devices are the lightest 10\" tablets available, weighing slightly over a pound each.A blessing for some but an annoyance for others, the screen of the Note 10.1 2014 is wider and shorter than iPad Air's due to its 16:10 aspect ratio as is the case for many Android tablets, while all iPads are in 4:3 aspect ratio.  A wider 16:10 screen benefits those who watch movies and TV shows, since most of today's shows are shot in wide-screen.  A 4:3 screen is better for photographs and reading, since 4:3 is the common aspect ratio for photography, and a printed page (typically letter size 8.5\" by 11\") is also close to 4:3.Both the Note 10.1 2014 and iPad Air display in very high resolutions that exceed 1080p HD resolution: 2560x1600 for the Note, and 2048x1536 for iPad Air.  They enable the shooting and viewing of high-quality and detailed videos and photos.The Note 10.1 2014 supports the latest Wi-fi 802.11 \"ac\" protocol in addition to a/b/g/n protocols, while the iPad Air only supports a/b/g/n.  \"ac\" supports greater frequency, range, and data rates.  But routers that support \"ac\" are currently more expensive.The Note comes with 8MP rear and 2MP front cameras.  Both allow you to shoot videos at 1080p or lower, at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio.  You can shoot stills in 16:9 or 4:3 ratio as well.  The rear camera also has LED flash.  The camera app also lets you set a timer.  In comparison, iPad Air has 5MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras.  The rear camera only shoot videos at a fixed 1080p 16:9 format, and the front front camera at a fixed 720p 16:9 format.  Both cameras only shoot stills in 4:3 format.  There is also no LED flash nor timer.Some iOS devices do have LED flash, like iPhone and iPod Touch.  In iOS 7, the LED flash doubles as a flashlight as well.  Note's LED flash is just a flash.The speakers on the Note is noticeably louder than the iPad Air's, but you need to adjust the audio with an equalizer app to get better sound quality.  With headphones on, both devices have similar audio quality.The Note has two speakers on the left and eight sides, both pointing away from you instead of towards you.  You may need to cup your hands around the speakers to redirect the sound towards you, sort of like cupping your hands around your ears to listen better.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Interesting Twist of Events", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R1LI7MI8O59X8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a self-proclaimed \"Apple\" guy, I was very skeptical of getting a Samsung product. I am so used to operating Apple's products such as my Macbook and iPhone, but all things considered, the iPad is basically a larger iPhone, and I wanted to mix things up a bit. Therefore, I took a huge chance on the Galaxy Note. At first, operating the tablet was difficult because the operating system was so foreign to me. That being said, it did not take long at all for me to get used to this device and its absolutely outstanding features.The speech recognition works incredibly well when searching the tablet or verbally inputing text. Also, one of the main features of this tablet, the S pen, makes this tablet easier to understand thanks to the Air view features which, when hovering over certain icons with the S pen, gives a useful and brief description of the icon on the screen. The S pen also allows artistic users to write/draw personal notes and artworks, as well as write to input text.  The battery life lasts for a while and does not take as long to charge as other tablets that I have had experiences with (i.e. the Nexus 7 and Apple iPad). The multi-window feature makes multitasking simple, and the accessibility options make the tablet's operations more personal and convenient to each user's standards. And of course, Samsung's \"Smart Screen\" features only further increase the convenience of this tablet. Why take the time to pause a video when you can just look away? If you are, for instance, reading with a tablet, the screen timeout may beat you before you can flip to the next page, but with Smart Screen, all a user has to do is continue to look at the screen for it to stay active. Various motions and voice commands also make this tablet wonderful to navigate. Don't feel like hitting the snooze button on your tablet's alarm? Just say \"snooze\" or \"stop.\" Samsung has integrated so many useful features into this tablet.While the Note 2014 edition packs a punch with its features, fear not- It also has wonderful aesthetics.  The packs are made of a sturdy plastic material with a leather-bound look.  The screen images are typically extremely clear and almost lifelike.I personally worry about storage often due to my love of music, pictures, and applications. I purchased the 32GB Note 2014 edition, but should I run out of storage space, it is comforting to know that I can easily remedy this issue by inserting a micro-sd card into my Note.With all of these wonderful aspects in mind, I have found a few minor flaws with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition.  On a few occasions, my tablet has briefly frozen or randomly returned me to the home screen. Also, integrating my music, photos, and contacts from my computer was a bit of a hassle at times, and it took me some time to finally get everything settled. Those flaws being said, I could almost always Google any questions or issues that I had to find a solution. If I could go back, I would undoubtedly purchase the Note over an iPad. It just has too many amazing features and characteristics that put other tablets to shame.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet out there", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "RKLI0QZKRLE8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is currently the best tablet on the market.

If you want a tablet to surf the web and play Angry Birds, this tablet is NOT for you.The multitasking abilities is just unmatched, no tablet comes close, it will be interesting to see what the Surface 2 looks like but the Windows tablets are pretty far behind in terms of app development etc.The digitizer (SPen) experience is again unmatched, sure you can buy a stylus for the iPad, but it doesn't have the same experience.NOW, for all those people complaining about lag. The unit doesn't lag much for me other than the magazine app which has a lot of visuals it needs to load and when your in this app you should be just browsing slowly anyway.If you are still complaining about lag, I would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like Nova Launcher. This tablet SCREAMS with the Nova Launcher, the best thing is you DO NOT lose any functionality with the Nova Launcher even though your not using Touchwhiz. For example the multiwindow side bar is still there when you use NOVA along with the Air Command features. All still work, only thing that doesn't show up is the swipe up feature to get into my magazine.Overall, no tablet comes close, the Ipad is easier to learn out of the box, where as this tablet may require a few tweaks but overall the features available on this machine, coupled with the impressive hardware and beautiful screen makes this tablet well worth it.Update 10/18/13I just discovered another feature, the tablet has an IR blaster at the top of it so you can use it as a remote control for your TV or digital box. It comes with a great WatchOn Samsung app which is great, you can actively look to see what is on right now in a guide and then click the show on your tablet and the tablet automatically changes the channel on your TV, even works with older non HD style TVs, this is a really nice feature.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Productivity bar none", "Author": "Radim S", "ReviewID": "R11T8CAU4JCF4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am laughing when I hear people say iPad is helping their productivity.

The resolution is just amazing.  At a  2560x1600 the resolution is the single biggest improvement over previous generation which was just 1280x800.  I was blown away with the resolution.Compared to previous model, size has reduced a bit, weight decreased a bit, and memory of 3GB is so good. Battery has bumped up to 8220 mAh. There is no other tablet on the market with such an integrated S Pen system, and for this alone this is a terrific buy. If you are someone who has to take notes on a frequent basis, the 10.1\" 2014 edition is a great buy. If you browse TV shows, you tube videos on a regular basis this is again awesome. If you are not into lot of note taking, you should not consider this. This model's cousin the Tab 3 series is apt for regular use. Again I did not use the last generation for its low resolution. This model trumps it all. My only wish is the weight and price could have been even lower. At 1.26 lbs it is not the lowest in the market. With iPAD air at only 1 lbs, it is sure to have competition. But I am a fan of Android and the use of back button, and I like the Samsung series for that reason.64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.I tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space.

I was skeptical when the tablet market took off, thinking I'd never have a legitimate use for something like this, but when I held the first iPad on launch day, it felt like a special device.

I felt my iPad particularly had lost its luster and its legitimacy as a helpful device -- it never evolved past being a toy, something to read a magazine on or casually play games.

So i use S note a lot.  This is the main reason why I bought this tablet. So far it has served my needs pretty well.  Below is my honest opinion about this tablet.  This tablet is an upgrade from my 1st generation IPAD. Haha!The good:1) The screen resolution really blows your mind away.  It is the clearest and sharpest screen I have ever seen yet.  I have no problems staring at the for hours and still admiring its beauty.2)  When running without any problems, this tablet is a beast. It is a powerhouse.  It can handle any applications you throw at it with ease.  it can play any HD games with no problem at all so far.  Surfing the web is a joy and the multi window feature really helps especially when I'm taking down notes.3) Using the S pen is a joy and i believe it is the best thing to a pen and paper experience out there.  It writes smoothly and accurately as opposed to the display units in Best buy that i have tried.  I tried writing on my friend's IPAd and there was no comparison.  This tablet is miles ahead of the competition in terms of the handwriting recognition and note taking capabilities.The Bad:1) One of the things that stops me from giving this tablet a 5 Star rating is because of the occasional crashes and glitches I experienced. SO far, i experienced glitches from the games and also S note in the midst of taking down notes in class which can get pretty annoying.  I might be quite harsh in my comments but given that this product is one of the most expensive tablets out there and a direct competitor to the IPAd, I believe this tablet should be more than good.  If not close to perfection.2)  The home button at the center of the tablet really gets in the way during note taking. When writing on the 2nd half of the screen, I have to be cautious and careful not to touch the home button. This really made the whole tablet experience a tedious one.3)  The screen scratches very easily for some reason.  I tried using my friend's stylus pen on my tablet and my screen got scratched.  I didn't want to get a screen protector because I'm afraid it will affect the superb handwriting recognition of the tablet.4) The stylus that came with this tablet is pretty small and thin. My hand get tired writing with it after a 1 hour lecture.Overall, I like this tablet.  It has grown into my schedule ever since I bought it and I can't leave for class without having my tablet with me! I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a good note taking device and can also double up as a good multimedia device.

It does help with eye strain, but makes it look muted elsewhere.Sound - 4.4Good volume and stereo is where its at. The speakers are crisp, clear, and loud enough. Their fault is 2-fold. They lack any real low end, so leave music to headphones. Also, on peak volume certain higher frequency ranges rattle a bit. The speakers being on the side vs front really doesn't seem to make a difference.Construction - 4.2Lets face facts, its plastic. We can compare it all day to an iPad, and obviously it wont come close. As far as Android tablets go, its got one of the most solid feels. I don't get any creaking. The seems where the chrome plastic is could be better, the tolerances seem perfect on the bottom and sides, but the top and a super small difference. THe weight is good, and balance is even. All the buttons response with a soft feel and definite \"click\".Performance - 4.8After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great. Even the \"My magazine\" app, which many pre-release reviews showed to be very laggy, lost most of its lag with Nova. High def games run great, and this is the first Android tablet to run Visible Body 3D Human Anatomy Atlas (and very high res, detailed anatomy app) with no hesitation. 1080P movies look fantastic.Battery Life - 4So far I get a day. Thats a day of games, reading, web browsing, ect. So not a day just doodling. My previous Note got around 3 days. I have a feeling this will be one of the biggest improvements once I get it rooting and completely tweaked. Charge time is....I don't know. I go to sleep and plug it in, its full once I wake up. Honestly that all I care about. It lasts a day of good use, and is charged when I wake up. I also keep in mind given the hardware and screen res, a full day is pretty acceptable. If I can get it to 1.5 days after tuning, fine by me.Productivity - 4.8Best tablet on the market for it. The added bonus and multi window within multi window? Thats cool. Office program on one side, pdf editor on another, and a small floating youtube window. The reason its not a perfect \"5\" is because the \"pen window\" feature in air command only allow for a few apps to do this. Its NOT every app compatible with multi window. If that changes, Ill be changing this to a 5.Stability - 5I've only had it for a few days. No crashed/freezes yet. If that changes so will my score. I have a feeling a mix of me using Nova Launcher, and only using some pretty well established apps, means I wont have to worry.Overall - 4.6For what this tablet is for, and what it can be once the user puts some tweaking into it, its the best Android tablet on the market.Here is the video of Orrery. Ill probably add one of Atlas 3d in action too. It gives you a good show case of the speakers sound quality, as well as how it handles graphics.[...]", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "REAL REVIEW", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R2L9DJT4B05LHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a few days ago in black a best buy on the 10th, initially impression are, I love the black, nice quality. My wife has a ipad 4 so I compared them both substantial. The GN 10.1 is lighter, smaller bezels, much louder and better speakers, The screen is better quality overall for sure. I did internet test by going to the same website on both tablets at the same time, I tried about 10 different sites and GN beat the ipad 4 every time with ease sometime double the speed. The battery is about the same as the ipad 4. The S pen is awesome, and I could totally use it for school and just browsing the tablet. Their is slight lag here and there in some things but not even close as laggy as some of the reviews make it out to be, overall I think its extremely fast. I have a Galaxy s 4, and its faster. Mine does not lag on the main screen, or gallery like others. Overall I think its an amazing tablet and totally worth it. Sure the Ipad has better and more apps but its not a productive tablet like this one. The GN has great multi tasking, S pen, many features that make it better.

Quite honestly this seemed quite idiotic to me and the support person kept insisting I charge the device even after I called to state the problem persisted.

Really Samsung when did the product become Amazon's!!Thankfully because I opened the device I would be able to return it for a refund within the returns window period. Must give kudos to Amazon for their response in returning the defective device. I think a better arrangement has to be made between Samsung and Amazon with regards to the warranty, if I had purchased the device in a store I would have just walked in and got a replacement. With Amazon I have to ensure that it is returned within the 30 day period, taking into consideration I have to drop it off at UPS (ground) and wait till my device arrives at the warehouse and then another device is shipped. Again Amazon customer support was actually great but I after this experience think I will purchase future electronic devices at stores.Well three days before Christmas and off to look for another gift for my girlfriend.

This year I decided to save my Christmas and birthday money to buy one. So I came to this.The tablet came 90% charged, which was really surprising to me. I never had any device come more than 50% charged. Upon using the device I noticed the screen turning on was slow. I believe Samsung made this as design, and I'm sure there is a way around it if you dig deeper into the system after you root it, but I rather not go that deep.Clicking the home button had a delay when exiting apps. This is because of the S-voice and the magazine feature. Disabling them made it a whole lot faster. But I ended up freezing those applications after I rooted the device, which made the tablet even faster in return.After rooting the device and freezing all the bloatware that it comes with the tablet became a lot smoother and faster. There was no more of that unsmooth pattern unlock which made you mess up, no more battery draining, no more random speed drops, etc... It just became the tablet it should be. I considered returning it before I rooted it because of the performance issue. But now it's not a problem. (Did you know Amazon bans for too many returns? I prefer to keep my returns low.)But of course when you root your device you will void your warranty, which is pretty stupid. They should allow rooting since their the ones that slow down the tablets by putting junk software on it that no one uses. Totally worth it though!One problem is if you have a Anker portable charger. The tablet will not charge on the 2A port, only the 1A port. Unsure why. My Android phone works fine on both ports. If you use the tablet on the 2A port then it will start randomly clicking on the screen somehow. Luckily it's not a phone as it tried to make an emergency call on an application!The screen itself is a fingerprint magnet. Prepare to clean it often. Very often. My Galaxy S4 get's less prints than this tablet. However, the screen is very nice and very sharp. For me anyway. My dad has problems seeing it without glasses.Sound is good, you won't have any problems hearing it. I keep it at max most the time and is pretty loud.

It's my own opinion of course, but I strongly believe there is currently no better tablet on the market at this size than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 2014. I am well aware of the previous model's drawbacks and I can safely reassure anyone reading this that those shortcomings have all been addressed and resolved. Samsung was listening closely and hard to all its customer's feedback and complaints; and there were a lot because Samsung got it wrong; that being their first generation tablet and all.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect But Close", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RUUPBBX9GQ2M6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would actually give this 4.5 stars. I can't give it 5 because it is not perfect.  I spent 4 months doing research, reading, and watching tons of reviews. I had tried to find reviews that were not biased one way or the other towards Apple or Samsung.  The other tablet I was considering was an IPad Air. If you read a review from a magazine that gets big advertising dollars from either of these guys who are they going to choose? I am familiar with Apple as I own a MacBook Pro, an Ipod touch 5th generation, Apple Tv too, and used to use an IPhone.  I have several Android tablets and a Window 8 tablet too.Which tablet you buy really depends on what you want to use it for.  The IPad Air is a nice tablet.  It has a great display, it is fast, and thin.  Apple apps run very fluid.  Apple has an advantage here since they are the only company who makes their tablet they can more easily optimize the software to hardware. Also developers often design apps with ios in mind first but that is changing. I have noticed that a lot of my ios apps run smoother than the same ones on Android but that gap has really closed.  An IPad is easier to learn than Android.  If you are looking for something to watch videos, browse the Internet,  and check emails it is great. It comes preloaded with Iworks now so you can get a little work done too.Now for the note which is the one I ultimately bought.  I wanted something that I could take notes with and do simple photo edits with. There is more of a learning curve with using the note but it is worth it.  The pen is a great feature.  It is great for note taking, drawing, and comes in handy for photo edits too. I have the 32 gb version with a 64 gb micro sd card installed.  This is not an option with an IPad.  Samsung let's you store apps on the card too.  I loaded photos onto the tablet with a card reader,  did some minor edits, transferred the pics to the external sd card and then copied them to a usb flash drive. You can not do that with an iPad.  Wacom does make a Bluetooth pen for the iPad that works fairly well but not nearly as well as the one on the note. Plus it cost around $100.  A big complaint of the note is there is lag when going from one app to another. It has not been a big deal for me most of the lag is due to the Touchwiz interface that Samsung uses.  However you can make some adjustments like disabling animations or you use a different app launcher like Nova, Apex, or Action which are very straightforward and fast and most of your lag issues will go away. I didn't see that much lag on Touchwiz to be honest but Samsung is trying to do a lot of things with it and a lot of programs run in the background that take up ram. When I loaded another launcher the speed did improve.  I really love the things I am able to do with this thing. You have a lot more freedom using the note vs. an Ipad. Apple IOS is going to be more consistent because Apple is the only company that uses it.  Many companies use Android and they all add there own touches to it that is going make Android less consistent from device to device.It came down to features for the money.  I don't like the Apple gouge factor.  $100 for each increment of storage with no option to add any on your own. A 64 gb card is $37 on Amazon and when they fill up you can just get another one.  I pads will not recognize flash drives and will not let you transfer data to a flash drive or sd card. You can view photos with a card reader but that is all. $100 more for the Bluetooth Wacom pen when a better one is included on the note.  Apple charges a premium price for their tablet and doesn't even offer a camera with a flash.  Then there is the planned obsolescence. I experienced this with my Iphone after 2 years there were a lot of apps that would not run on it. On my MacBook I loaded programs on it and then upgraded to the next os and they no longer worked. I would get messages that power dvd programs were not longer supported. I had to look for updates or redownload programs through the app store. People using the first iPad can't use many of the current apps from the app store. My wife has an Asus transformer several years old that has no problems running most apps. It has been my experience that Apple designs products according to what they think is best for me. For example Apple thinks that I don't need flash so they pretty much ended support for it on many products. They decided I didn't need an optical drive anymore (my MacBook was the last one with a dvd drive included). Of course I can purchase additional storage in ICloud or buy an external drive. Samsung tries to listen to their customers and design products that give them every feature that they want. Maybe even too much so.  If there was a tablet made in the U.S. I would buy it.  At least Samsung does 90% of there work in South Korea rather than shipping 90% of their manufacturing to China and calling themselves an American company. I have a Dell Venue 11 Pro I didn't include it in this review because it is in a different price category and runs a full desktop operating system so I didn't want to compare it with the other two. The Dell can run full desktop apps including Itunes, runs flash,intergrates with office well, and offers many different storage options. The pen is far better on the note and both IOS and Android apps are better than Metro apps.

As I said, spent about two months with this galaxy note 2014 and haven't been disappointed,  but I do have some nit picking for folks looking to purchase should be aware off. First off, my chief annoyance is with the internal gyroscope.  If you have a flip detachable keyboarded case that have magnetic backplate and strips, there no way to use the drop down menu android users are accustom using as the gyroscope is extremely sensitive to anything magnetic and will lock the drop down menu until the tablet is removed from the case. There's no way to turn this off or disable it, plus I read overtime it can permanently damage the gyroscope so please take this into consideration when purchasing a flip case for this tablet. Next is this Samsung My Magazine app that built into the menu button, when navigating the home screen using the menu button WHICH SHOULD bring up the menu screen only to be redirected the My Magazine app, which I mind you cannot be turned off or disabled. My last annoyance is with a great number of app that can't or won't allow for landscape mode or run on the tablet seeing as they were built for smartphones and the tablet option was an add on. Its the same OS platform built android,  how in the heck an app works for one and not the other mind you this is a developer issue. Google controls the platform,  they need to encourage developers to cross build for the android both smartphone and tablet equally.  Now that this is out of the way,  let's get back to the reason I bought the galaxy note 2014. My computer motherboard was faulty and was in need of repair and if your like me everything is done on your computer. So I toiled through online reviews to find a tablet to replace my computer if only temporary with maybe similar accessible features to get through day to day use and top specs hence the galaxy note 2014 tab. It uses Firefox, Pulse news feed, Skype, YouTube, and a host of other apps I use on my tiny 4.2 inch Samsung nexus and places onto a 10.1 inch screen eliminating the constant eye strain and occasional tapping on in app ad's that have no barring to me whatsoever.  I use all these apps on my PC as well, so this was a win-win-win for me. The interface runs smooth with no hitches or hiccups, all apps open within one second upon tapping on them, and the setup is what you'd expect from an Android device. All the 10.1 screen real state does make a difference when using smartphone apps vs tablet apps. This tablet has handled everything I through at it with relative easy and after a day of moderate use I still have just over a half battery charge left to work with. If you're waiting on the new galaxy note or tab pro 12.1 or 8.7, the galaxy note 2014 has the exact same hardware specs pound for pound,  the only difference is the new tab pro run android 4.4 allowing 4 on screen open apps at once, while the galaxy note 2014 runs android 4.3 allow 2 open apps on screen at once if that a big deal too you. Kitkat 4.4 for the 2014 will be out sometime in April after the Samsung galaxy 5 phone is released,  so unless you really need kitkat 4.4 immediately, I'd say get the 2014 as all these 2014 Samsung tablets are the same. If you don't believe me,  checkout the other written and video reviews on the new Samsung tab pro 12.1. With that said, you can also root the 2014 to run a custom 4.4 unofficial kitkat rom with all the kitkat goodness.

The Samsung Note gives a pretty decent experience overall and excels on many features, and from then on it's a matter of preference.I still prefer my iPad for magazine/text book/newspaper reading due to it's shape that makes it easy. I also find it the best for surfing the internet although Galaxy Note is not far behind. Kindle's silk browser is slooow, and I would never use it. Chrome works fine on all and you can change the settings to use Chrome. iPad is also my tablet of choice for sketching apps. The Galaxy Tab comes with a pen but I don't find it as responsive as iPad for my sketching, although it might just be because I am more used to the iPad with a stylus. I can't even think about the same on Kindle as the interface seems slow and unresponsive, it's improved quite a bit with Kindle HDX but there is still ways to go.For watching movies I prefer Kindle HDX 8.9 as it's the lightest of the three and has the best resolution and streaming is pretty seamless. The sound is perhaps the best of all devices but if you're using headphones it doesn't matter. Galaxy Note and iPad make the Chromecast streaming pretty seamless unlike the Kindle HDX, so if you're using your tablet to watch a movie on another screen keep that in mind.When you're holding the tablet the weight really makes a difference and for this reason I like to read books on my Kindle HDX 8.9. Although, nothing beats the Kindle Paperwhite for reading novels.Another thing about Galaxy Tab is that it's convenient to have a pen right on the tablet. The pen offers many point and click functions, but I just wish they were a little more user friendly and unobstrusive, so far I prefer to use my finger unless I am using a specific app that requires the pen. I was excited about the feature that turns handwriting to typed text but in reality it has a learning curve and is still not very intuitive. Right now I don't see an advantage over iPad if you're using a good stylus.If you're considering how to decide between iPad and Galaxy, the first thing you have to consider is the eco-system. If you've been using an Android phone the transition to Galaxy Note is seamless. But if you're an iPhone owner you may find the Android interface not as user friendly as it's not as simple and intuitive but offers more flexibility. If you have many apps that you love and use on iOS for example the Garage Band or iMovie then you may want to buy the iPad - these apps are now free with iPad Air.The other thing to consider is storage and importing files. The Galaxy Note allows you to put in a mini SD card to expand storage. That makes also it very convenient to access files on the Galaxy. However, with Dropbox and direct streaming from many sites the need for expanded storage is diminished. There are also now many products out there that function that don't need WiFi to create a network expand storage on the iPad.The Kindle HDX has a closed eco-system that does not allow any outside apps like Nook, iBooks in books or music from iTunes. I am especially frustrated by not being able to read my magazines in one place as there are separate apps required for each magazine. iPad's newstand integrates all magazine apps for one seamless experience. Kindle HDX is most useful if you have more content from Amazon. But it's cheaper and has a pretty decent email interface and a free Office app so it can be used as a multi-purpose device. It also has a send to Kindle feature that allows you to \"print\" any doc to your Kindle. I love that feature.Overall, the Galaxy Note is a very useful device with the most features of all three and is the most flexible. However, I use it the least. My main tablet usage is surfing the internet, reading magazines/newspapers, watching movies/TV, editing photos and the iPad is still my go-to device due to it's shape, speed, and app eco-system. Kindle HDX is next for it's video-viewing and all the content I have from Amazon. Samsung Galaxy Note though versatile is not my go-to device for any one thing - so it loses out. However, it comes the closest to a PC replacement if I did more office work on my tablet so I still like having it around especially when I travel.The Galaxy Note came with a ton of freebies like Google Play and Samsung Store credit, expanded Dropbox for 2 years, Boingo membership for one year, Businessweek subscription for a year, Hulu Plus membership for 3 months which was very nice. No other device offered all these freebies so if they're still being offered when you buy the tablet, factor that into the cost.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "another winner", "Author": "Mary F. Hazlett \"mhazlett\"", "ReviewID": "RNWTISJADT3FG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every Samsung Note tablet/phone except the first Note phone.  So you can say i love the Note serries.  I have also owned nearly every Samsung tablet, many  Kindles, Nooks, and have the Ipad 2 and had the ipad mini (first mini).  So, i'm well rounded.  To think i went into technology kicking and screaming in the early 2000's!This tablet is awesome.  I've definitely note explored all of the features yet on it because at the present time i also own the Note 8 and my phone is the Note 3.  I've also for the first time learned how to sync my SNotes with Evernote; that may sound basic, but i didn't know how to do it and now someone at Best Buy spent time with me helping me learn.I own the Note series because I like Android -- for those who say that there are many more choices in the apple app stores i say how many apps does one really need?  Everything i look for is available in the Play store.The multi window function is great, although i don't make use of it as  often as those who work might.  I retired a few years ago. I buy the series because of the S pen.  I keep a journal, and enjoy handwriting it.  I love keeping one on papeer, but when i am traveling without my large backpack/messenger bag, i can handwrite on this.  I also use the SNote function to keep a grocery list on my phone.  I save all kinds of things in Scrapbook, such as tips from a great source called Dripler (in the Google Play store).  I also like the fact that when i do my banking, i can, using the Spen, bring up a calculator on the check page to do my checkbook balancing.This baby comes with a lot of perks.  Off the bat i received a credit for $25 in the Play store, $50 in the Samsung Hub store, free magazines from Zinio (i don't get the crredit because i already have the app -- by the way, many public libraries have Zinio -- magazines -- available for checkout and unlike books, when a magazine is checked out, you keep the magazine), a 3-month Audible trial for audio books in Amazon (again, because i already have an account, i am not eligible), and 50G of free dropbox storage.  And, a free 3month trial of the NYTimes. Samsung says these freebies are worth $600.I'm not wild about the price, but if i held off for a while, the price would come down.  I thought and thought about whether to get this new 10.1 2014 Note since i currently have and use the Note 8, as well as my phone.  I also use my ipad, but because it is in a leather keyboard folio, it is heavy to cart around if i just want to lighten my load.  Yes, i can remove it from the folio.  But an advantage of android is the Swype feature -- being able to slide my fingers from letter to letter on the keyboard.  It is easier than the hunt and peck typing method on the on-screen keyboard of the ipad.  I do have several portable keyboards, but the one i'm currently using when i want a keyboard is an excellent one by Brookstone.  I have the one with the little shelf which can hold a device on it.  But because the keyboard can be removed, i can simply slide this slim full-size keyboard in my bag if i want to.  The whole thing is lighter than my keyboard folio for the ipad.  Many small bluetooth keyboards are weird -- when i type on them foreign symbols pop up and i have to select what i want, slowing down the typing.  I'm a good typist, and the brrokstone is simply a regular but lighthweighth keyboard.I highly recommend this tablet. It is fun, good for professionals, comes with great features and lots of 3-month expensive freebies, and it has -- oh yeah -- an expandable memory, unlike the fruit tablets. That is also a big selling point.  I have all of my music on a micro card and can simply put the card into the Note series.You can't go wrong.

If 1/2 stars were possible, then I'd give it 4.5 because of the high price tag. I work in academia and run my own research lab. I have to attend various meetings and many other functions that require a lot of thoughts to be thrown around, saved, and eventually have to follow-up on them. I've owned a Galaxy Tab 10.1 (first generation), Google Nexus 10, and Apple iPad 3, trying to be patient with the Note series until it matured and wasn't yet sold on the idea of the S-Pen let alone a generic stylus. Well, it has matured and has the muscle behind it. The S-Pen feature is what separates this tablet apart from the aforementioned tablets, as they all were simply media consumption devices and had no further usefulness beyond checking email and watching videos. I'm not a game player, so I really don't care for this aspect. The built-in Samsung apps are very basic and don't offer a great experience. Thus, I felt compelled to look beyond the Sammie ecosystem. Thus, I downloaded a free Android app called, \"Papyrus,\" paid for a few premium features costing around $3 each, and I have never looked back. Note-taking with this app complements the capabilities of the S-Pen very well. The pen is sensitive and responsive enough to feel like natural hand writing -- granted, it is not absolutely perfect, but for what it's worth, it is great. The Papyrus app does what it's supposed to without being too gimmicky and cute like other writing apps.Pros:1. Quickly, easily, and accurately write down important notes and save or convey/share those thoughts to others.2. Mirror my tablet on an HD television screen in a meeting room and write everything so people can collaborate / review in real time.3. Export or share notes in various formats (PDF, PNG, JPG) via email, SMS, and the usual set of sharing mediums.4. With #3 above, I find it very useful to MMS my notes, as it reduces the need for typing a full-blown message. Anyone with a tablet knows that typing stinks, no matter what brand you have. Steve Jobs was completely wrong about the utility of the stylus!5. S-Pen is very accurate and responsive. You can also lay your palm on the screen while writing and there's no \"background\" pickup. It can be accessed easily and stored discretely.6. Tablet has the hardware specs capable of handling what I need to do -- use productivity apps, watch videos/movies on the plane, and a whole lot more!7. Did I mention that the screen resolution is awesome? Well, it's awesome!Cons:PriceBuilt-in Samsung S-Pen apps still weak -- find yourself some other Android appsIf you are serious about being productive at work while also being able to enjoy \"intense\" multimedia, then this device will not let you down.

The different functions I can find to use it for astonish me.  I've used it to take,  transcribe,  and post meeting minutes (the pen works great in drawing mode,  but text recognition isn't quite fast enough to use while in the meeting,  I go over them at leisure later).  I have about a zillion books on it, reference and otherwise (does just fine as a reader).  Plays movies and Internet videos with beautiful quality - if the source video is not so great,  you notice it, but HD source is rendered perfectly.  The extras that Samsung threw in to sweeten the deal are nice to have.  I have bigger hands than most, and find it easy to use and manipulate- smaller hands might find it a little unwieldy to hold while using the on-screen keyboard. Also,  carrying it one handed must be done with care, as I've almost slung it discus style a couple of times- I really recommend getting a holder for it. It's nice and light, the battery goes on (figuratively) forever- I use it all day,  and charge it at night.  Can't do that with my phone.  It does LOVE to be hooked to the Internet, tho it functions fine when out of range.  A lot of the built in apps and email functionality will just cease, but books, movies, and music loaded onto the thing work fine. They just pick back up where they left or when you're back in range.  In closing, I'll leave you with this:  I've gotten a digital only subscription to my local news paper with this thing, I read it every day, and it lets me do the cross word puzzle (that took some thought,  but I figured out how! ).

But the poor screen resolution and the lag issues reported made me reconsider. I decided to wait for the next generation. So, I was excited to see an upgrade appear late last year. It appeared to me that many of the issues I was concerned about had been addressed. So, when my birthday rolled around, I hit my wife up for the 2014 edition.It is EVERYTHING I had hoped and more.I wanted a device with a crisp and vibrant display. Check. I wanted a device that would let me take handwritten notes in my meetings and let me draw/design with decent drawing tools. Check. I wanted a device that was reasonably fast with no serious lag issues. Check. I wanted a device that would let me multitask. Check (with caveats). I wanted cool apps and utility and convenience. Check, check, check.This thing is AWESOME! I have loved it from the moment I opened, and that feeling only grows with time.When I powered it up and logged on with my google account, it automatically uploaded all most of my apps from my Galaxy S III phone. Everything was there, my contacts, my music, my cloud. It has changed how I do many of my daily activities (I have probably cut my PC and smartphone time by more than half), and, with some modest changes, I can easily see how a tablet could eliminate my need for a PC or phone at all (think tablet partnered with and voice controlled communication device the size of a dollar coin - similar to the communicators from ST Next Gen - the technology is nearly there).I'm still learning how to use all the apps and features (it takes me a while to get comfortable with new systems and apps), but I am very pleased with everything. Well, almost everything...Here are the few things I don't care for:1. I hate that the power connection is on the bottom edge of the device. This makes it awkward to use with a case in a vertical or semi-vertical position with the power connected. You basically have to flip it, which puts the power and volume controls on the bottom where they are more difficult to reach. I would have preferred a left/right side power access. I'm also concerned about the durability of that miniUSB port.2. Speaking of power, this device is a hog. A PC UPC connection will not provide enough power to keep you working continuously.  In fact, trying to recharge the Note from a PC with the display and all apps turned off is not really practical (for me, <10% an hour). If you are doing anything active (gaming, video, etc) long term (more than an hour or two), you will have to hook directly to an AC outlet. If you want to recharge in a reasonable amount of time (>%10/hr), you will need direct AC as well.3. Some Samsung app interfaces are not intuitive to me. The SNote app is a prime example. Creating, editing, and organising notes is cumbersome and different than what I'm used to with other systems. It's even different than the note app on my Samsung phone. To me, it is more difficult than it needs to be.My wife purchased this on sale at $470 (I got the 16GB version, as I don't do a lot of video and I knew I was going to add a 64GB miniSD for less than the $50 cost for the extra 16GB internal).

So if you are expecting to go shopping for your favorite apps or sitting down to a good book or tv show don't hold your breath.........UPDATE:4/2/2014  A note to let the people that so kindly responded to my review know where I stand on the above Samsung Perks issue.I have contacted Samsung's customer service a total of 4 times now, still no email containing the perks code.  After the third call I was contacted by the survey department. Following a brief explanation of why I was giving Samsung such low ratings, he told me never talk to a level 1 customer service person. He said the tier goes to a level 4, ask for at least a 3. He stated the 1st level people I spoke with previously probably never escalated the issue like they said they would. Needless to say the survey did not bode well for Samsung. :(  Today I called for the 4th time. Right off I asked for a level 3 rep. She acted as if she did not hear me so I waited for her to finish the sentence she interrupted me with and asked again. She assured me she could definitely help me so after going thru all the same questions of the first 3 calls, and being put on hold 4 times, she again wanted to escalate the ticket. It was then I demanded to speak with a level 3 rep. I told her I had gone thru this 3 times before and am not doing so again. I asked why this issue was so hard to resolve? No answer. Finally she said she would transfer me if a higher level \"was available\". I was transfered to another person who refused tell me what CS level he was. He asked me all the same questions again!! He even asked me if I knew how to check my email, lol!!... I asked \"him\" why the issue has not been addressed,.... I was asked to hold again. When he returned he answered, \"they did not have the model number so they could not continue resolving the issue\". I responded that they certainly did have that info, I had provided all the info the last 3 times I had called. I then asked why they did not contact me if they needed more info to resolve it. He was dumbfounded, studdered a few times, then silence.  When he could talk, he apologized that they had not contacted me.

I am sure future updates will fix that. with my iPad 2 and my Asus transformer, I often wished I old have apps opened side by side, now with this I can and do. The battery seems to run down a bit faster but with the power saver and a little experience I have learned what to turn off and on to save battery life. Most devices use battery power like mad. It is a little pricey and that made the decision to purchase this a little harder, same with iPad 2, but I have no regrets at all. One more thing for now is that you can't watch Amazon Prime Videos on it, the amazon prime movie app is not compatible. That was disappointing because all my movie and tv entertainment is online, cable has became obsolete for me... I will update as I feel it should be.

I only used it for a few days before deciding to return it. There's a lot of stupid problems here, not all of which are Samsung's fault. But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game \"Tapped Out\" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA. But it's important to consider, as the game it's very popular and widely used.2) The offers are  good deals, but they are limited to the device itself. For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a \"Chat Now\" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight. You'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it, and it can't be used on a laptop or other device. Similar limitations exist for many, but not all of the offers. The 3 free audio books? Only 1 per month. All of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions. I *strongly* recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying: [...]3) This Note uses Android 4.4 aka \"KitKat\". There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model.

It stopped working right 3 days after receipt.  I purchased the 3 year warranty, but my experience with these warranties was negative because Best Buy refused to even look at my last tablet the ASUS Transformer 700 when I took it to the store under the same type of warranty.  Best Buy Geek Squad Manager said it was an unidentified software problem,  thus not covered under the warranty.  They even wanted over $60 to set the tablet back to factory original. This requires 2 keystrokes.  One year later and at least 6 hard resets later they finally replaced the ASUS under warranty.  Skip ahead to March 2014. We bought the new Samsung and it stopped working after 3 days.  We spent 2 hours on the phone with Samsung.  Technical support top level tech stated it was a hardware error.  Finally after 2 hours and at some level of management,  we were told by Samsung that we could send the 3 day old device in for repairs,  it would take a month and we would end up with a device that wasn't new and had been cracked open. This was unacceptable. The manager finally transferred us to a very nice woman at Amazon.  It took less than 10 minutes and she had sent a new Samsung device along with return instructions sent to my email. I had the new device in hand on Monday and it's working and the broken one was picked up all by a very pleasant woman from Amazon.

It  caught my interest because of the capabilities of the spen. I had read online that the previous incarnation of the Note had clunky software, and didn't always work as advertised. The 2014 model, however, seems to have solved any issues that the older model may have had.As an artist the real-time stylus capabilities really caught my eye. I was also impressed that the stylus was built by the wacom company - I may be wrong, but I think this is the only tablet outside of the wacom family of products to use this technology. I have been wanting a tablet wih the capability to draw in real-time, and this tablet does not disappoint. It may not have the capabilities of a high-end Wacom drawing tablet, but for the price point it is great for sketching on the go. The stylus, while fairly basic, has the precision and usefulness you expect out of a wacom product.The multitasking feature is very nice as well. I use my tablet for work and find it really handy to be able to work between multiple apps, pull out the spen for a quick sketch of an idea, and then jot down a phone number - all with ease.If you just want a tablet as a \"media consumption device\", then I would suggest you take a look at a more value- priced tablet.

While this is my first tablet i'm not sure tablets get any better than this, right now. I am completely satisfied with its capabilities.  I wanted something smaller and lighter than a netbook. but it had to be able to produce for work. seems like the majority of tablets on the market are marketed toward the entertainment end - videos, games, net surfing. i needed something i can produce and modify products on. this is it. This machine can handle .docx/.pptx/.xlsx files with ease and even creates them.A couple comments - if bloatware drives you insane, you might want to research which products are out there that don't stack their offerings with bloatware. this thing came with lots of stuff i can't get rid of. with only 16gb of on board memory, 6gb is taken up by the operating system and some of this bloaware. only 10gb are left for internal storage. not all apps can be placed on the SD card. if i had the 32gb i'd still make that complaint. i resolved this with the next comment.This edition (2014) of the Note accepts 64gb SD cards. There is some question out there as to whether or not it does. Mine accepts with no issue a 64gb PNY SDXC micro. No reformatting, no special app, no nothing. not sure if they accept higher than 64gb. if they do, that's even better capability. i'm not a big fan of loading up on apps that get used once a month so keeping 10gb of space available inside with the remainder on the card is more than plenty for the average user. if this isnt enough you might want to rethink what you are storing. do you really listen to 25gb of music. probably not. there are also other wireless storage options out there now that might make for a nice pairing with a tablet if you really need more storage.If you are on the fence about \"useful\" tablets like i have been, this is the tablet to take you off the fence.

Orth", "ReviewID": "R32AELAF5YNULQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet that a lot of the reviewers (as in professional reviews like cnet) don't cover very well. Most tablets are made mostly for consumption, but this tablet has a lot of productivity tools built right into it with most being based around the use of the S-pen, which is incredibly powerful. For my uses, this tablet can do enough to replace having to carry a laptop.S- PenFirst, the tablet can recognize script or print writing, and does a great job even with my terrible handwriting.  Samsung really did a good job with the recognition software. The pen also has rubber tip which provides a little drag on the screen in an attempt to simulate writing on paper. It's better than just a plastic tip, but doesn't reproduce the feel of a real pen on paper.I was actually somewhat concerned because prior to my purchase I tested one of these tablets in the store and the S-Pen was pretty worn down and dragged a lot. I was glad to see in the box that Samsung gives you 6 new tips for your pen. I do not know how long each tip will last since I have not needed to replace one yet. Also, if the tablet is sleeping when you remove the pen, then it will awaken and unlock for you.Air command, which is launched with the button on the S-Pen, is very useful and makes certain task more efficient. The Action Memo accessed through air command has become my favorite tool. I now start almost all Google Internet and Map searches from it. Of course, Action Memo also does other things such as allow you to jot down a quick note, add a task, start an email, or add to your contacts. One benefit of the Action Memo is that it opens in a small window over whatever you are looking at. Why is this good? Because if you are looking up or writing something from the document you are currently working on, such as a phone number, email, or address, then you can see the information as you write it in the Action Memo. Then it is just a quick click to map it or save to your contacts.The tablet also has an Active Digitizer, which is the system that tracks the S-Pen. With this system, when you are writing with the S-Pen, the tablet will reject any touches from your hand so you can rest your hand on the tablet while writing. It also allows the S-Pen to be pressure sensitive.Writing on the device is also good for meetings. I previously used my phone combine with MS OneNote in meetings to take notes, but people gave me looks like I was ignoring them and texting. Writing on a tablet looks more like what people are use to seeing in a meeting; people writing notes with a pen.Handwriting is faster than the on-screen keyboard in certain situations, and it is especially nice when you need to write out equations. S-Note can transform drawn equations into text and symbols. Handwriting also helps me remember and learn quicker, but I also like having a typed document for future reference. With this tablet I can hand write and produced text documents at the same timeNow, I have encountered a few issues with the hand witting recognition. It will sometimes incorrectly capitalize words and seems to do so really randomly. It will also put commas instead of periods if they are anything more than a dot. Capital I's are also sometimes interpreted as a 1 or a slash (/). Characters like 1 and I require you to add the additional lines so it is recognized correctly. Sometimes G will come up as an 6.On-Screen KeyboardThe tablet also comes with Swiftkey software installed, which works like Swype but also has predictive text (tries to guess what you will type next in a bar above the keyboard where you can just hit the next word). For typing, it is accurate and I have found it can be really fast. The predictive text is somewhat creepy how it can guess the next word you want. I have been able to type entire sentences just by hitting the words out of the predicted list.The tablet will try to correct words though, even in handwriting mode. I can be kind of annoying when you type out an obscure word and it keeps correcting it to what it thinks you meant.SoftwareTouchWiz, Samsung's front end for android, is good on this tablet, especially with the S-Pen integration. If you like your Samsung S3 or S4, then this tablet will feel right at home. I have not encountered lag to complain about and all the Apps I run operate smoothly. If you compare a pure Android tablet with TouchWiz, then you can see the \"lag\" when swiping between screens, but we are talking milliseconds here in difference.I also like the ability to turn on and off certain settings from the top pull down such as Wifi, GPS, and screen rotate. In addition, with the case I put on my tablet, when I open the cover it will unlock the tablet and open up a screen with your calendar and a drawing area that functions like the Action Memo. It's a really convenient feature to have that Action Memo immediately available.S-Note is pretty good, especially for handwriting and writing equations, but the tablet also comes with Polaris office which allows you to edit or create Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Since discovering Polaris, I have mainly been using it over S-Note. I haven't found a way to save files straight from Polaris to Sky drive so I use the Sky drive App, which works pretty well. I am looking into other options as well such as Google Drive and Evernote. Samsung also has Dropbox and gives you 50 Gb's of storage for 2 years when you purchase the tablet. I have not signed up for it so I cannot tell you about that process or how well it works.If you like to draw, then the tablet also comes with Sketchbook. I played with it some and the pressure sensitivity on the pen works really well. I am not much of an artist so I cannot comment on this program too much, but there is a wide selection of brushes and large amount of settings to fine-tune everything.Battery and ScreenI am getting good battery life out of the tablet. With Wifi connected and working on word documents, email, and internet, I can get an entire day out of the tablet. Currently, I have about ~5 hours of use on the tablet with screen brightness on Auto and Power Save off. The tablet is sitting at 52% battery.The big screen is also a reason I purchased this tablet. The larger screen gives you more area to work and makes the multi window functions actually worth using, especially the S-PEN air commands. I also have a phone (not a Samsung) with a large screen, so a smaller tablet did not feel like much of an upgrade over just using my phone.Other NegativesPrice - If you do not want the S-Pen or Productivity tools, then you can consider a cheaper tablet. Depending on what you need to do on a computer, it is not a full replacement for a full laptop, but that has more to do with the current Apps that are available, as well as how much more efficient a keyboard and mouse is (though you can use a keyboard and mouse on this tablet).Location of Home, Menu, and back button - The location can be annoying, but I will rotate the tablet so they are at the top of the screen.Speakers - While better than rear facing speakers, they do stick out the side. I feel I have to have the sound up much louder than required since they are on the sides instead of facing directly toward you on the front.Camera - You phone probably has a camera and taking pictures with a tablet is awkward, but it is there if you need it. I think of it more as a utility feature than anything else.Overall, I think it is one of the best tablets on the market right now for productivity. Since having a tablet that could function as a useful tool for me is important, I put most of my effort into finding a tablet that gave me those options.

I use it frequently. However, my two biggest problems with it are 1) bluetooth doesn't work well at all on this tablet and 2) it comes pre-loaded with a lot of things I don't use, and that is built into the price. These are the reasons why I have taken two stars off the five. I have played with the bluetooth to try to make it work, and I have made sure that things that use bluetooth (i.e. keyboards) work with other devices... it is only this tablet which cannot use them. The problem seems to be that the bluetooth will be okay for all of thirty seconds when I turn it on, but then it stops working. To have to reset it every thirty seconds (if it works, because it often doesn't even do that) is aggravating to say the least. I am most disappointed in this feature because I had planned on using the 10.1 2014 with an external keyboard, and I can't.Otherwise, I find this tablet is lovely. It is my first tablet. I love the multitask function and use it relatively frequently. My primary use for the tablet has been for video chatting, as my fiancee and I live in two different states. I can use google video chat with other windows thanks to the multitask feature. Thanks to the new skype floating window feature on android tablets, I can also use Skype while doing other things on my tablet. The screen is beautiful; I use it any time I am looking throuh a large amount of photos because the picture quality is so high. I read some reviews complaining about battery life but I have to say I haven't had a problem. If the screen brightness is turned down, the tablet lasts for days (with moderate use) or for 3-6 hours while video chatting (if fully charged to begin with). The only time I've had a problem with the battery was when the brightness was turned all the way up while I was video chatting: this caused it to discharge while it was plugged in. However, when the brightness is turned down, it charges just fine while video chatting, albeit slower than normal.As a tablet, it's great, but I am quite irritated with the bluetooth problem, and I would have happily bought a cheaper, non pre loaded tablet over one with all the extras. I have a laptop that I use for word processing, photo-editing, and times when I want to have a lot of internet tabs open (happens a lot when planning a wedding!), but overall, this tablet has been and continues to be a great tablet. When I am without my laptop, this tablet is perfectly able to surf the web (and I can use stuff like the Pinterest app to keep track of things). It's definitely a powerhouse.

Love the stylus.", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R3119DS3TXOUPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much waffling, I bought this tablet with a handful of specific purposes in mind. First and foremost, I am a musician and wanted a tablet to read music on. While I'd really prefer a larger screen in a perfect world, what sold me on this one instead of one of the (relatively few) significantly larger ones was the stylus. I need to be able to make annotations in my music the way I would with a pencil. Zooming in and then writing with my finger doesn't cut it when I want to be able to write in small markings like accidentals, breath marks, cues, etc, in the middle of a rehearsal. Unfortunately there aren't nearly as many music score apps for Android as there are for iOS, and they don't necessarily all take as much advantage of the stylus as I wish they did, but there there are some and I found what I needed. And there are more Android apps all the time.But regardless, the stylus makes a big difference and I think it makes this device a very competitive alternative to an iPad, even though more musicians seem to use iPads.Incidentally, the actual surface area of the screen is about the same on the Note 10.1 as on the full-sized iPad. I actually prefer the iPad's aspect ratio, but that's not such a big deal.In terms of reading music off of it, I still wish the screen was a bit bigger since I have to stand far enough away to not bang my instrument into the stand. But at the same time, I think it's easier to read smaller-sized notes off this screen than it is off of paper at the same size, and at least lighting isn't an issue.Second, I wanted something that could be a lighter, more compact alternative to carrying around my laptop, but something big enough to be reasonably comfortable for general internet use and getting actual work done without being frustrated about not being able to see enough of it at once. For that, it's perfect. The stylus makes even just web browsing easier because it's easier to click on small links than by poking with my finger. And being able to write in the text instead of typing on the \"imaginary\" keyboard on the screen is really great. I only wish you could do it any time there is a text box, instead of only in some cases, in some apps, or on some websites.Samsung did go to a certain amount of trouble to add stuff that the stylus is good for, some of which is useful, but even aside from that, to me the stylus just generally enhances the ease of use by more than I expected.Other odds and ends: the display looks really nice. The camera is good enough that I can take a photo of my music and comfortably read it off of that if I don't have time to scan it. People talk about the molded-fake-leather-texture back feeling cheap, but it feels fine to me. I don't really care about that; I put it in a case and don't really see the back much anyway. It's sort of annoying that the port for the charger is right at the bottom, which makes it awkward to use while it's plugged in.But on the other hand, that hasn't been an issue much because the battery life is quite good.So all in all, I've been very happy with it. So far, I'm satisfied with my choice of a device with a stylus over a device with a bigger screen.But hey Samsung! A Galaxy Note with a screen the size AND aspect ratio of a regular piece of letter-sized paper (or even just reasonably close) would be AWESOME!", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet!", "Author": "Albert", "ReviewID": "R3AXPINWIDKMF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very awesome tablet but if you dent think you will utilize the S pen than you Can probably get another Samsung tablet", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Cody Moorhead", "ReviewID": "RY9G2I3F6BOT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is nothing short of great.

I mostly use mine for games, drawing, streaming Netflix, and surfing the internet. The S-pen is very comfortable and has a natural flow for me... I find it easier to use for drawing than my bamboo tablet for instance. As far as battery life goes, I have no complaints. The first day I had it, I literally played around with it from about 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening and only went down to 22% battery without being plugged in at all. I played games, drew stuff, downloaded a ton apps, and even watched a few of episodes of my fave shows. The screen is beautifully crisp and clear but audio is a little hollow. I usually use headphones though so it's a non-issue for me. I haven't had any connectivity issues with my wifi (802.11ac) and it's just as fast as my hard wired desktop. The weight is evenly balanced and not cumbersome at all. I also really like the leather look back... it's easier to grip than the super smooth plastics on most tablets/phones.If you're on the fence about it, I really think the big difference between this and other similar tablets available right now is the S-pen which is great for casual artists, writing, and more precise navigation. If you buy one, I would recommend watching some tutorials and reviews online just to see all the little features and tricks to get the most out of your 10.1. Overall, I highly recommend it and feel it's worth the cost.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Tablet and a worthy successor to previous model", "Author": "G. Bluitt", "ReviewID": "R300BFUCT65FI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Up until recently I owned the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012 Edition) and coming from that tablet to the 2014 Edition I have to say that Samsung has made a lot of improvements over last year's model.The device is very snappy, even snappier out of the box than my original Note 10.1 was (tested it after wiping it just before selling it). The display is a lot better than before as well. Battery life has me not needing to charge it as much, even after streaming videos all day (the previous model would last several hours but the battery would be in the red. Not the case on the 2014 model).The S-Pen functions better than before, especially with the Air Commands and multiple windows.I did not give it 5 stars because of a few quirks ..Settings menu - It is in a tabbed view, similar to the Galaxy S4 and it cannot be changed (the Note 3 has the same menu but it can be changed to a traditional list view).Button Placement - While I am used to the Home Button and capacitive menu and back buttons on my phone, I was not used to them on this tablet. I had to get used to them being in the same spot and not changing when switching the tablet from landscape to portrait. The tablet design is the same as the Galaxy Tab 3 line (this is good to remember when ordering accessories, as the cases for the Tab 3 10.1 will fit the Note 10.1 2014), so if you have one of those tablets, then you should be OK with the button placement.Overall, the speed, display, S-Pen functionality and battery life are a marked improvement over the 2012 model, the software and button placement you will have to get used to. Beyond those quirks, it is a quality tablet.Finally, as for the price, it is higher than the previous model, but I was paying $600 for the Motorola Xoom nearly 3 years ago so the price doesn't bother me really.

The only sensor it is missing is barometric pressure, but the GPS (using GLONASS and QZSS) has no problems.It has one major flaw.  My last and sometimes current tablet is a Toshiba Thrive.  While watching an HD stream it will charge in an hour, but it has a laptop style charger - it also has swappable batteries.The Samsung can only charge at 2.1a, which means over 4 hours to get the 8Ah back to full WHEN IT IS OFF.  When it is running, e.g. using Google Maps to navigate with other things in the background, it will at best breakeven or slowly go down.  This is without \"powersave\", but even with it on, charging is glacial.There were some very pleasant surprises.  First is a hard app/home button, and offscreen menu and back buttons (which I accidentally press when holding it at times, aargh, but I think I can get used to it).  On my Thrive and other devices where this is \"soft\", when things bog down, whatever system that reads the screen/touch needs to do its thing to detect it.  The home hard button always works.The digitizer pen is nice.  Even things like typing just work better.  At least for me, touch will never be precise, so it is nice to have this when I need it.  The place where it is absolutely vital is selecting text for cut-paste.  I have never been able to move the cursors - they always disappear or select the wrong thing.  With the pen, no problem at all.I'm annoyed that to use a bluetooth keyboard, I have to switch back to the Samsung keyboard (I prefer Hacker's keyboard).The Browser works and manages to get a zoom-to-select right.  I wish it had more junk filters though (maybe a local privoxy type app?).I haven't tried all the facial recognition scrolling, pausing, etc. but may explore that, and some of the more advanced apps later.The brightness can be made both bright - and as importantly dark enough for any time of day or night.There's more but I will need to continue exploring.  Again, my only real complaint is the charge rate, especially when I'm using the tablet.Update: Pleasant surprise - it uses bluetooth headsets (my EtyBlu2 or BlueParrot noise cancelling)!  So I can Skype or GrooveIP (Google Voice) or use SIP phones.  Unpleasant surprise: it won't use a bluetooth keyboard unless the original samsung onscreen keyboard is selected (so I have to keep resetting to Hacker's keyboard).

Youtube viewing is best experience!2) Front camera is good and Skype chatting which I use a lot. Not experimented much with back camera, I use it rarely.3) Many people tell this tablet is laggy but I never experienced any lag or delay opening pages or even flipboard is fine. In real life, no one flips 10 pages in 2 seconds. So be practical while deciding if tablet is lagging or fast. I have no issues with its speed.4) Very good in multitasking and S pen, u will find many videos on explanation of these features. 3GB RAM is enough as of next 2 years.5) I am enjoying free 50GB dropbox and $25 google play store credit with this. They have also given $50 Samsung app store credit but nothing really good to purchase from there.6) Front speakers are so loud, no complaints at all.7) I play lot of games like Prince of Persia, Riptide GP2, subway surfers, temple run 2 and all doing good, no hang or frame drops.Battery life is more than expected.

They make tablet storage heavy and android becomes dirty.

Let me tell you about the Cons. Of course I gave a 5/5 why would I talk about cons? Well, I'm going to explain how most of these issues aren't really issues if you're a power user, and lets face it this is definitely a power user device. First off, Don't use touch-wiz. I installed Nova and removed all Samsung software that I didn't need. This can be done by installing another ROM (look at xda-developers.com) or just by rooting and removing those apps. BTW root is a MUST with this tablet. I suggest installing Xposed and Gravity Box. This will allow you to setup up your Note so that it has virtual buttons in portrait but physical buttons in landscape.But what if you use your tab in landscape all the time?? follow the instructions here [URL was removed do a search for \"[MOD][GUIDE]Disable Galaxy Note 8 Capacitive Keys\" on XDA] and you'll be able to make the competitive buttons only react to the S-pen. this is very handy to make it so you can have your hand on the side without rising accidental taps. This takes care of two of the biggest cons. The third...batterylife varies depending on who you talk to.

Greer", "ReviewID": "R180MRHC1979U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this when I'd had enough of the low RAM in my iPad3.  I was running into issues with iOS7 where the iPad would lag with too many apps open and only 3 web browser tabs could be active at any given time without them having to reload when you clicked back over to the tab.The first Galaxy Note was DOA.  Got audio but the screen did not work.  I tried everything and finally had Amazon replace it, which they did quickly.  The second one worked fine.Packaging:The device was packaged well.  Included were the Galaxy Note Tablet, the Pen, AC adapter and USB charging cable and a small users guide package I never opened.Setup:Once I got a working device, setup was easy.  Pretty much the standard Android fair.  Configure it for your wireless, put in your Google account info and you are pretty much good to go.Pros:*  The screen is great.  High resolution, rich colors and good contrast.*  The Samsung skinned version of Android 4.3 has some great features like split window with multiple apps running on the screen simultaneously.*  The Pen and built-in Wacom digitizer are a great combination if you are an artist.*  Games shine with the high end hardware on this device.*  Charges with standard Mini-USB connector.*  Pen could be good for taking notes if you get a good notes app (the Samsung included version is not good)Cons:*  Not a fan of the fake plastic leather backing.*  Samsung heavily skinned Android for this device.  While there are some positives, as mentioned above, there are far more negatives.  The interface can be very laggy when swiping or loading apps.  Double-tapping the home button brings up a Samsung app instead of the list of running apps.  Swiping up brings up a Samsung Magazine app and it is sensitive enough that I accidentally opened it constantly.*  Samsung chose to go with hard buttons, which are fine in landscape.  In portrait, however, the buttons are on the side.  This position is not only inconvenient and unfamiliar, but it also is where you put your fingers to hold it so you often accidentally hit the home button.*  Standby battery life is terrible.  For constant use, the battery compares to the iPad but in standby, you lose 15-20% of battery life over the course of a day.  If you have gotten use to leaving your tablet lying around unplugged, don't plan on it with this device.*  No LED battery charging indicator on the device or adapter.In the end, the cons won out and I sent the device back to Amazon for a refund.  Before sending it back, I purchased the Sony Xperia Tablet Z (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xperia-SGP311U1-10-1-Inch-Tablet/dp/B00CE590Z0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1396645920&sr;=8-1&keywords;=sony+tablet+z).  While the specs of this device suggest it will be slower, that is not the case.  Since it is very lightly skinned, the performance is great.  It is also much lighter and thinner than the Galaxy Note and has much better standby battery life (comparable to the iPad).  To top it off, it is cheaper.

I've always been an Android guy, but I decided to give a Retina iPad Mini a try. I found that interesting and not as bad as I expected, but didn't care for the app ecosystem (overall usability was great though). So I exchanged it for this Note 2014 expecting the experience I would be happy with. After all, this is nearly the fastest Android tablet out right now. Before I was able to walk out of the store, a Samsung rep who worked at my Best Buy told me to stop by and have the firmware updated. A bit disappointing to have to let someone else open your new tablet, peel the sticker off, and then sit around and wait for it to update since it's not up to date out of the box.I was underwhelmed by the Note however. Comparing from the retina Mini, power on on the Note has a delay of 2-3 seconds for no reason - the Mini came on instantly, every time. Much like my Galaxy SII, the Note sometimes didn't register my PIN when I tried to unlock it. The screen is good, though the larger screen size used here doesn't make it as impressive as a smaller screened tablet such as the retina Mini (But different form factors I know, not really complaining here). I found myself disappointed with the quality of apps for Android tablets. Many were clearly scaled up from their phone versions and took no advantage of the increase in resolution. The YouTube app is particularly disappointing considering it's Google's own service and yet it is greatly lacking in user experience compared to the free YouTube player I downloaded when trying out the retina Mini MXtube (Which allows the exact resolution to be selected, downloading of videos to be watched later, and a very nice user interface). In fact, the most downloaded apps seemed to just be for emulators to play old video games on these which honestly seems like a waste of power for this tablet.Comparing cameras, somehow the retina Mini had better cameras than the Note 2014. Both the front and rear facing cameras on the note have a high level of noise and the colors go from being too blue to far too red. I find Samsung's photo \"helper\" modes to be largely more trouble than they're worth. Battery life is good, I never got it too low in the time I had it but I left it off the charger for an entire day idling with wifi on and it only lost 5% of its battery charge after 6-7 hours. During active use it seems to lose about 10% every 45 minutes to an hour, so pretty good for a 10\" tablet. The retina Mini did best the battery of this though, only losing maybe 5% in an hour of regular use. Both would last you through an entire day. Something annoying about the Note 2014 - it can't charge from a USB via a computer. You must plug it into an AC outlet with the adapter to charge it, which is very annoying to me as I use my Galaxy SII with my computer's USB port for charging and the retina Mini also did so without fuss.The big attraction for me was the ability to use multiple apps at once and to have a stylus. Disappointingly however, you can't just put whatever app you want in a window, only some apps are allowed to be put in a window. I use Dolphin browser for internet on Android and I am not able to use that in the window. In fact, the majority of my apps cannot be used with this feature which is a huge letdown. Unless you like running all the vanilla stock apps, the pen window feature won't be of much use to you. While I'm thinking of it, I wanted to use this also for remote desktop use occasionally - since I have a 2560x1600 monitor I figured it would be a perfect match. Unfortunately it scales the resolution down somehow, which seems disingenuous. I have many icons on my desktop, and the retina Mini only seemed to shift the location of two icons - remote desktoping from the Note 2014 shifted three rows worth of icons all over my screen (forcing me to redo my haphazard organization scheme). Very disappointed the remote desktop didn't do better (I used Microsoft RDP with a Win 7 machine).As far as taking notes, it's quite nice. You can choose multiple tip types and widths, and you can zoom in, select your text, resize and relocate it, and even convert math to formulas (Very hit or miss though, you have to print very neatly for it to work - my notes were never nice enough to use this feature when taking notes as I normally would. S note does a decent job ignoring your palm on the screen, however it sometimes does register while writing and will: zoom out, try to go to another page or treat it as a three finger tap (hides the toolbox - what a hassle figuring out how to get it back after I kept inadvertently hiding it). S note is not a very user friendly app, as it's difficult to figure out how to create a new memo in portrait/landscape mode (You can't change it after you've created it, you have to open S note and then create a new one from the template - and it doesn't reorient if you go from landscape to portrait or vice versa).I also discovered S note is very laggy at times, and I can't understand this on a tablet as powerful as the Note 2014. I had only two background apps on at the same time (Draw Something and my Lookout device protection) and I'd sometimes write and then see nothing. Thinking I missed the screen, I'd try again and nothing. Then it would finally write, so I'd try to keep going and then it was still lagging. It did this several times, which is very frustrating when you need to take down notes quickly. At one point I tried to create a new memo book so as to change the format, but didn't like it so I hit back and then hit delete - but it had selected the memo I just took all my notes in. It deleted it so fast I had no time to react, and there was no copy to be found on the device. Thankfully Evernote captured it in its trash section, I've seen horror stories of the Samsung backup not having the notes due to problems with their service syncing properly. Later I was taking notes and noticed it was lagging badly again, so this time I thought to clear my memory. I had just saved my notes and synced, but when I came back all I had was an empty memo. I checked and it apparently did not sync with Evernote, and didn't save the notes. When I cleared the memory it was actually using 1.89 GB of the 3 GB available, which I found shocking considering how little I had running on it - I've nearly run out of memory many times on my Galaxy SII with only 1 GB and I'm sparse on background apps because of this. I honestly can't believe Android can manage to use up that much memory, and I had no live wallpapers and only the weather and S note widgets running on my home screens. A quick note, I tried a few games and found some did ok but there were more than a few which had noticeable framerate drops. I know this isn't supposed to be a gaming tablet, but it's surprising that it has trouble with some of these titles considering the generally powerful hardware it has.That was the final straw that made me decide to return it. There was a lot of potential for this to be great, but it ends up being hampered by TouchWiz which is a clunky interface that bogs the device down and lots of unnecessary Samsung software which is honestly not very good. Some of my qualms are honestly with Android on tablets. The experience is not as smooth or full featured as it should be. So much of what you'll find is just a phone app running on your big tablet, which makes the screen feel like a waste. I also found wifi performance disappointing. Sitting at my campus with 3 out of 4 wifi \"bars\" I was having trouble connecting to the internet. I pulled my Galaxy SII out and got online with the same 3 out of 4 \"bars\" immediately. I toggled wifi off and back on and it seemed to straighten up, but hardly confidence inspiring performance from a device which should easily destroy the performance of my much older Galaxy SII.For the price you pay, this is not a good deal at all. If it were cheaper, perhaps it would be worth dealing with the quirks but this is being sold as a premium product yet suffers from limited software and disappointing performance. I still do not care for the iOS app ecosystem so I won't be getting an iPad again. After this, I am moving on to a Windows tablet - far less limitations with the OS available on the device (Even with RT). If Windows tablets don't pan out for me, I think I'll just go back to using a laptop - something like a Lenovo X230t which has the ability to be a laptop or a tablet (albeit a big one) offers far more capability and functionality without issues than iOS or Android. Both of those platforms seem excellent on phones, but I personally question their value on tablets. Personally, this is the last Samsung product I will be buying as my Galaxy SII has experienced regular lag, hang ups, and random issues for no reason and it is only a few months old (My original was replaced due to the microphone dying on it for no particular reason). I am disappointed in Samsung's failure to improve their quality, while many competitors are stepping up it seems Samsung is just beefing up the internals and reusing the cheap enclosures with the old TouchWiz interface which needs to be ditched.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's an awesome tablet", "Author": "Chromie", "ReviewID": "RX15I1ORPDW9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is better than I expected.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R3MIBE7BKVK20K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I held off on doing a review on this tablet because at first glance I was severely disappointed/underwhelmed. I love the hardware on this device, if it weren't for 3GB Ram, the beautiful screen, and the S-Pen this would have gone back immediately. I stuck with it because I wanted to love this product.When you get this product it is SLOW and CHUGGY. I couldn't believe how poor the experience was! Maybe I am the only one who has experienced this as a search online turned up very few results. The other thing I noticed was the device is filled with bloatware- I don't need the New York Times or Travel Helper or whatever it's called. Words can convey how much stuff is packed on this tablet! I wouldn't care if the experience using the device wasn't so poor (because of being slow).Last night I had enough and installed a new launcher; I didn't even know this was an option! I installed Nova Launcher and wow- what a difference! It's snappy and extremely responsive now. If you get this tablet you absolutely have to change the Launcher because if you don't the experience suffers. When installing a third party launcher you can still use the S-Pen and S-Note apps. I don't know why you wouldn't want to switch at this point.Pro's:+ The hardware, I love how this feels in my hands. Just comfortable.+ The stylus and associated apps are very well integrated.+ Rooting is simple if that is your thing (I wouldn't know).+ Love the IR feature. No more pesky remote.+ Even Apple snobs take notice of this device.Con's:- Be prepared to do some work to get this thing working well (see notes above).- No NFC, so no touch to share with my Note 2.- Front camera isn't as good as it should be. Tablet designers should know that one of the basic use-cases for this device is video communication, what's the point in having an 8 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera? Seems like this should be reversed (who is taking pictures with this thing?).In conclusion, glad I kept this device. Despite all of my badmouthing I love it- just want Samsung to pick up the pace on the software side.EDIT: Sluggishness and choppiness seem to keep occurring. At times when tilting from horizontal to vertical the device will hang. Google Maps causes the screen to go black. The WatchOn app text is sometimes garbled. I want to also point out that Samsung is now pushing KNOX onto its products, which is a bad thing. Research KNOX before buying this device to hear what users have to say about it. I wish I could disable this program!With everything stripped down as much as I can (no animations, no frills, etc.) the device is \"just usable\". I have to work very hard to use this tablet. I have to restart the device periodically in order to get it to speed up. So the final verdict on this is \"stay away, far far away\".

I previously was an ipad person, having owned an ipad 2 and 4. felt limited by the ecosystem and bought my first android tablet (Note 10.1 2014). I was impressed with the out of box performance of this device. Even with all of the preliminary bloat running on this device, it was very smooth and ready to go. Rooting was not necessary to unlock acceptable performance (as i have done with my samsung phones). after a few days of disabling certain services and installing all of my apps, i was surprised at its build quality (for being made of polycarbonate) and robustness. No issues whatsoever. Screen is just amazing. the LCD display is incredible and the resolution is very complimentary of the LCD display. A few weeks of usage and i found myself using this more than i used my iPad 4. S pen is very convenient for making dimensions while building things, drawing symbols and taking notes. I knew i made the right choice by buying this over the iPad Air.Pros:-Speed-Screen-S pen (probably one of the best features)-expandable sd-buildCons:-speakers a bit dull?-lockscreen wake up lag (maybe by 1-2 seconds)-couldve had a micro hdmi slot (for a $550 tablet these days, should be standard)-shouldve made hardware buttons since portrait orientation of home button and capacitive buttons is kinda awkwardI would definately recommend this to anyone looking to buy a tablet.

So all this was more convincing than the apple brand.  Now that I've had this for over a month, I'm so happy I got it.  I've customized it to my liking.  I can use the stylus pen for better precision when I need it. There may be a little lag here and there but it hasn't bothered me at all.

I've either returned them all or traded them in on another. iPads, Androids, Samsung Galaxy's, Lenovos, even HP Touchpads. Not to mention Microsoft Slate RT, and more. So far, I tend to have loved the latest Nexus 7 and iPad Mini.This tablet is stylus focused, and with Samsung add ons in software, makes it less desirable to me as compared to vanilla Android (Google edition with no added bloatware). That being said, if you haven't had a Nexus device, this is a powerful device with a lot of productivity apps and productivity apps built in. If you're really looking to replace a laptop or do more things than tablets are typically considered for, this is a power tablet that may fit some needs for you. I wouldn't recommend it for the average consumer.HardwareThe look, feel, design and finish of this tablet are superb. The back has a leather \"feel\" and texture to help you keep grip. It's thin and fairly light. The screen is bright enough and quite high quality-- I wouldn't put it up there with the Fire HDX's, or maybe not even Retina, but it's very nice.It is Samsung, so it tends to be \"buttony\" around the edges. Spots for memory cards, a stylus, volume and screen brightness, a \"home\" type button, a right click button and so on. This is part of the \"nerdy\". Things that do mar the style and svelte simplicity, but at the gain of some functionality not used by all, but by some. If you are in that \"some\" you will care about these features.SoftwareUpon turning the device on, I was forced into more than one update sequentially. This was disruptive as I first started my journey with the tablet, but after reading some other reviews, it fixed some pretty significant issues so all for the better. The OS is quick and snappy. Very little lag.Next is my biggest pain point: The threshold between Android and Samsung software. I feel like Samsung has overdone that and went a bit too much customized. I am almost always a strong proponent for vanilla Android, and given that this one is intended to be \"note\" it has some additional functionality and applications that take advantage of a stylus. All of that software is usable, but I feel like the over-presence of apps that go beyond the \"note\" focus and outside/beyond that added value on top of Android is where I get annoyed: A side bar that gets in the way, and some other functions that I don't find useful and more often than not feel like are in the way.I spent some time on the tablet, and took it to a friend who has had Kindles and iPads and does prefer a stylus to a finger. She spent a lot of time on it, gleefully enjoying some features, and in the end said: Is it half the price of an iPad? If so, I might be interested.\" The conversation ended there.So, I give it 4 stars because I like it and I don't think Samsung has done a bad job with this kit. I don't like how much they've intruded with their own software, unnecessarily to present a tablet as a note, some additional features beyond stock android. It feels distracting.In conclusion, if you are strongly demanding a stylus and software that can accommodate it, this is probably the right tablet for you. If you are just generally in the tablet market, and aren't sure what you want/need, this tablet is probably not for you. If you are the nerdy type and want memory card slots, the ability to install non-OEM software around an app store and prefer not iOS or stock andriod, this tablet might be for you.As for me, I am going to continue banging on this thing. If I discover more that I like or don't, I will update the review again later.In a nutshell, unless you have a specific need or reason for a specific brand or model because of an off-the-beaten path feature or function, the best experience for me has been to stay on the road most traveled and go with an iPad, a Kindle Fire, or a vanilla Android (Google edition) tablet. You get the simplest least cluttered experience, have the best track record of constant frequent software updates and the best app availability.My conclusion on this tablet is the same.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like how it works.", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "RNVBR02NLZGOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The tablets works good, it is light and thin.

I experienced constant reboots and the tablet was frankly, unusable.  Though the two earlier updates improved it, I still could not stomach the performance issues so I exchanged it for another one.  I was still noticing occasional hiccups and reboots in the new model so I decided to take the following steps:1. Turn off all the animations in developer settings2. Reduced my homescreens from 5 to 3 with fewer widgets2. Deleted all sideloaded apps not gotten from the playstore (Like Flash player)3. And taking \"Lago's\" advice, I reset the tablet after updating it.I was really determined to confirm once and for all, if this tablet's performance issues were my fault or not as I was on the verge of returning it again and going for the iPad air.  Coincidentally, I did all that yesterday (Nov 1) and it appears a THIRD update was received shortly afterwards.Oh Boy! I cannot begin to describe how fast this device is right now.  I multitasked at a ridiculous level all night and did not sleep till 5am this morning!  The last time I experienced such smoothness and speed was when I had just bought my iPad 2, 3 years ago.  I will have to give all due props to Samsung for continuously rolling out updates to improve the device.  I am still a bit miffed that they had to do so AFTER I bought it, but the joy of using such a smart device compensates for that.  This is the BEST tablet on the market by far, right now.  I have reinstated my 5 home screens and widgets with no noticeable issue with performance.  I am still on the fence about sideloading apps though.  Any suggestions?  I really need flash for amazon prime on Dolphin browser but I'm afraid I might experience a drop in performance that will necessitate resetting all over again.In summary, I am not going to bother repeating what everyone already knows:  Best screen on the market, great battery life, Amazing S-pen, great specs (and now performance), Sd card slot, dolby sound etc.  These have all been said already.  I will rather continuously update my review to notify you guys of my experience with this device as time goes on.  This appears to be THE ONE; a tablet I am going to keep for a loooong time (3years?) and I am just hoping it turns out that way.  It is a 4 star because of the very slight, barely noticeable, hiccups in performance which do not in anyway hinder usability.  Also, there is an sd card issue mentioned by one reviewer.  I actually had to swap sd cards with my Note 3 and the one from the phone finally worked on this device while the one I purchased for the tablet is apparently working on my Note 3!  Go figure.P.s.  The notorious \"samsung fanatics\" (as they have been called) on this blog really need to get a life. You know yourselves ;) There are better ways of rendering constructive criticisms without being a D.bag about it.  Live and let live I say.  Anyone purchasing a $600 tablet has every right to expect it to perform as well as its competitors at the barest minimum.

So what I do is I use the multi-window feature, putting PDF on the top, and S-Note on the bottom.I usually use the pencil style on S-Pen, with Dark-Granite textual background and white pencil color.It really feels like you can see all your textbooks and papers with you; and at the same time a blackboard to jot down something right underneath.2) The S-Note can go into what I'd call \"Note-Only\" mode, meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows, only the 100% pure note, so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(After going into the edit mode) With 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release, and it will go into that note-only mode, and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button, and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode (back to the regular edit mode).So far, this way of using my new Note 10.1 has been awesome for me.May the Lord God's blessings and grace be upon those of you using this note-tablet!", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "DEFECTIVE UNITS - DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Alfred", "ReviewID": "R1TKHRD4FV7MTD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will NEVER buy samsung products again.Same bluetooth issues as everyone else.

So, I was waiting for the new version so that I had something that was faster, lighter and had the latest OS changes - especially those supporting the S-Pen, which is why someone gets a tablet like this in the first place.I ordered the 10.1 (2014) the other week - it arrived, and I set it up. Was it faster? Yes. Was the screen gorgeous beyond words? Yes. Were the improvements to the pen support worth it? Yes. Am I returning it? Yes. Wait, what?Here's the reason for the return: for reasons that I can only imagine are related to Samsung trying to force the user into landscape mode, this is a tablet with physical buttons. The buttons are at the \"bottom\" of the tablet in landscape mode - which is a nuisance, but not a hindrance. It's when you put the tablet into portrait mode that things get funky...First, it's awkward. If you want to hit the home, back or menu keys, they are no longer at the bottom of the page, where android \"muscle memory\" tells you that they should be. You now have to reach your hand to the side, and punch a \"home\" button  - which is actually a very stiff button. Sounds trivial, until you do it a few hundred times. (If you have the tablet perched on a stand, forget it. Punching that button knocks it over every time.The worst offense, however, is when you use the tablet as it was originally intended: for taking notes or sketching. Using it for these purposes means (in my case) that I have the tablet in portrait mode and I am either in a meeting taking notes, or walking around sketching... in that position my hand naturally rests with my left thumb on the bezel...which is, you guessed it, exactly where the physical button was placed. I turn the application off and return to the home screen by accident 90% of the time.It's frustrating to the point of making me want to kick a puppy, so back it goes.I have no early idea (other than the one I stated at the beginning) why Samsung would return to the physical button that was abandoned when the world moved on the Android 3+ and higher.

Impressed by the service.However I am returning my second one again.I don't know if I am too picky, but the screen has some issue.Minor light bleeding. Yes it is minor, so I don't care much. Unless I watch something black (screen) in dark room. Or updating OS ( black screen with green And-robot screen).My issue is that it has slight grey gradation At the top line under logo and left and right corner at bottom.First I thought it might be Samsung theme or effect, but even though I rotate screen. It always slight gradation.Since I noticed it, it catches my eyes more and bothered me. I was debating whether to return or keep it. But decided to say goodbye to my baby.When I asked my wife if she can notice anything on screen, she noticed that side so I can justify myself being not too picky.For the performance of the tab, don't expect super fast.Double price does not mean double speed. It is obvious as you don't get super fast computer as you spend more.Now I am getting off from my bus, so I will update again.Eventhough I gave it 4stars, I will talk about downside first. I assume you all reading these reviews are already haunted.No HDMI out.I have HDMI converter(??) That I used for note 2. It still works with some glitch.When I plugged it, Tab shows HDMI cable connected message but no pictures on TV.I checked Tab box, and found no signs of HDMI.---------------update-------------------My wife picked up a Tab 3 during Thanksgiving, and it works well with HDMI adaptor, so I assume, note (the one I had) had some problem, nor not support HDMI. it might be a OS version issue.----------------------------------------All share cast does not work or hard to set up.I have two Note 2.( me and wife) and software on laptop. I was able to show things on my screen on other device, but Tab was not able to find other devices.Buttons are too small. Hard to press. Volume control is awkward. I am more used to ( power - volume up - volume down)S note app is slow for large pdf document. For small size files with several pages, no problem, but when it comes to pages like 900s.... laggy and hard to find what you need unless you already know where it is. S note app is critical for Note family. Need more work, I guess.Printing.From gallery, it shows an option for printing. It scans networking printer or usb printer if it is connected via usb cable. However there is no option for documents(or I couldn't find). Also I tried my photo printer via usb, but not supported.( actually other apps on market did not support my Selphy 800 photo printer. Not a deal breaker)Things I liked about NoteS-pen. My kids loved to draw with s-pen. no need to buy note if you don't use s-pen.Vibration mode. Most ( or some) tablets does not support vibration mode, but note has silent/vibration/sound mode. This includes vibration feedback when you type something on keyboard. ( Tab 3, Nexus 7 (1gen) does not have vibration)Screen (including resolution). it is simply beautiful. My eyes are already spoiled by playing with Note.

I was not expecting it be so thick and heavy so that was disappointing.3. Using the 'pen' was awkward, it is thin and shorter than a regular pen so it's uncomfortable to me. Using it made my wrist and hand really hurt after awhile, and the next day. So just be aware if you already have wrist and shoulder issues, it may cause you discomfort as well. Nice thing, you don't have to use the pen ;)4. Full of apps you do not need or want.5. Unable to use a lot of my Kindle Amazon apps, books, and prime account.

I am not one of those people. I am a business professional who attends several client meetings and conference call per day. In my quest to be as paperless as possible, I was excited to read the specs of this tablet and envision using it for all my business notes.  In no particular order, here are my complaints about the Note 10.1 2014 edition:S Pen detection: The tablet is designed to recognize when the pen is removed from the silo and automatically take any of several actions from playing a sound to popping up a note app, etc. The table also vibrates when the pen is removed/replaced. After only a day of use, I found me tablet constantly vibrating as I handled it. I came to deduce it was the pen recognition going crazy at the slightest movement of the tablet. Bad build quality. OK, I thought, I'll just disable pen detection. However you cannot disable the vibration piece (only the popup app and sounds). So now, I have to walk around with the pen in my pocket ... not cool when you're spending close to $600 (after tax and ship).Charging: I have an iHome clock radio with a dock for my iPhone and an extra USB port on the back to charge my tablet. I just picked up my Note after charging it over night and it is at 7%. So the usb port by my bed is not adequate to charge this thing. Yes, I understand all about power current, etc ... but every other tablet I've charged there worked fine.Placement of soft keys: when holding the tablet in portrait mode, I am constantly hitting either the back or menu buttons. Also, because they are on the bezel and not on the screen, they are stationary and don't \"move\" with screen rotation.S-Note: The handwriting experience is SUPERB on this thing. However, the software design is just a bit off. Notebook management is difficult. However the deal killer for me is that you have to manually sync with Evernote. If you forget, then it won't auto sync. Why not just have an option to keep notes synced all the time?  And every other handwriting/note taking app on the android market looks like it was designed by student in an App Development 101 class at the community college.Android in general:  I am not an Apple fanboy. When it comes to my work, I just use the best tools I can find. Taking handwritten notes on an iPad is not feasible.  However, EVERYTHING else is just better on an iPad. The Android OS, although it has come leaps and bounds since its inception, still is not as polished as IOS. Sorry, but it's true. The biggest problem though is the apps. I don't need 80 millions apps for my lifestyle. I need a solid 20 maybe. News, Facebook, email, a couple games, check my stocks, etc.  With the exception of very fews apps, Android software is just not, well, beautiful, like IOS apps.  Facebook for android is a joke.  Zite, while visually appealing on IOS is plain UGLY on Android ... etc, etc etc.  Also, once you get used to multi-touch gestures on the iPad (four finger swipe, five finger pinch to home) - you'll never want to give it up.So, as for me, iPad is still a better choice for my money.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Worth The Money", "Author": "amr88", "ReviewID": "RS8090J7Z6ZED", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have an S4 which I enjoy for the most part.

I like it better than my previous nexus 7 because of its capability and potential in productivity. If you want productivity (with a stylus too) this is a great option to consider... I love to draw and I like the feel of a pen or a pencil. That's something I wish the nexus had. Taking notes on Evernote is fantastic. Drawing on Sketchbook can also be equally satisfying. The stylus gave me that freedom I wanted as a creative type. The accuracy of the pen is what I was looking for! For me, all that the stylus had to offer and could do had me sold. The tablet is great in that manner.I was also drawn to the Play Store. I'm already invested in the Google play store so my purchased apps could easily sync. I don't want to buy the same apps twice and I don't have to. But one thing grieves me.The Bad:At times it tries to do too much. Samsung seems to want to take the helm with your experience and data. It has apps for everything with the intention of completing the experience. You just need to agree to it. But, I already have Google watching. I don't want another. The consequence? I don't think it responded well to foreign apps (like nova) or apps that I think challenge Samsung's intricate OS... So, at times it feels a bit pushy to my app preference. But, I have a Nexus 5 & had a Nexus 7 before this guy. That might explain my craving for a more relaxed experience.The thing is, I didn't expect to be pulled into so many things Samsung. That's what it is. It is a step into the Samsung experience, or a dive. Samsung has it's own app ecosystem waiting for you. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on you. I already have my Google app ecosystem and I didn't want to jump into another. So my denying Samsung's didn't make it the cleanest experience. Samsung is expecting you to use its apps and its store. They just want you to agree with what they believe is best. If you're up for that then more power to you! Go for it. It's effort to make things simple is there but it's persistence can be messy. There are quite a few agreements to make for app permissions (which bugged me) for apps I could care less about. The good thing is that there's always an explanation to what's going on along with a choice...And My Magazine... I don't know what Samsung was thinking with that.

Seufferheld", "ReviewID": "R2TT7JAB20G1FL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this device for almost 2 months now and wanted to wait until it became a part of my daily life before writing about it.My review is based on my daily experiences and in comparison to iPad, as a former owner/user of generations 1 through 3 of that Apple device.  It was the update to iOS7 that caused me to look for an alternative that matched and, hopefully, improved on the iPad experience and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition seemed to fit the bill at the time. I will not expound on the details of my disenchantment with Apple in this review.I give it 3 stars because it mostly meets my initial requirement of matching or exceeding the iPad hardware and feature wise as explained in the PROS section below, and I do not rate it higher due to the items that I point out in the CONS section.PROS:- Has a gorgeous display that comes very close to the retina display resolution of the iPad, and with a larger aspect ratio.- Has a powerful enough processor, GPU and Wi-Fi radio to render streaming video flawlessly and to run most apps smoothly, including multiple open browser tabs.- Has a good set of cameras and imaging apps, and the rear camera particularly takes excellent digital photos in good lighting conditions, albeit no so much so in low light or with the built-in flash.- Through Google Play it provides most of the app equivalents that one would find in the iTunes store, excepting of course those that are exclusive to Apple.  It also comes bundled with a fair set of MS Office compatible productivity apps.- The sPen feature has many possibilities, especially if you like to draw or illustrate, and the sNote and Daynote apps are useful and nice features - all lacking on iPad.  It is a true pressure-sensitive pen like you would find on a Wacom, and not just a capacitive stylus as you would use on an iPad, allowing you to rest your hand on the screen while drawing without affecting the app.- Considering how difficult it is to include good speakers in such a restricted environment as a thin tablet, this device has a couple of fairly decent sounding stereo speakers with good separation by virtue of them being placed on opposite sides of the device, as opposed to next to each other at the bottom or a single mono speaker, as in most competing tablets.- Has a micro-SD card slot that allows you to increase the device's memory by as much as 64GB, whereas iPad's memory is fixed in 16, 32, and 64 GB increments, each one costing $100 more (you can buy a 64GB micro-SD chip for about $50).CONS:My biggest gripe about this device is that Samsung seems to have rushed to produce an iPad-killer without taking sufficient time to conduct actual usability studies, and thus have produced a device that meets that sole criterion (evidenced by the fact that Apple is suing them for infringement) while ignoring how the actual user will ultimately interact with the device, to explain:- While the screen aspect and resolution are fantastic, in order to fit the 10.1 package dimensions Samsung has restricted the bezel on either side of the screen to less than 1/2 inch (7/16) which makes the device impossibly difficult to hold with one hand.  You find your thumb constantly touching the screen which causes all kinds of havoc with open apps.- The device has been designed to be used predominantly in landscape mode, with the camera and the home buttons arranged on the top and bottom of the long sides. This causes several problems, as explained next:- If you buy a protective case for the device, the fold of the cover will by necessity be located along the bottom of the screen (by the home buttons - the main home button being raised above the bezel, and the 2 adjacent buttons being touch-sensitive).  The first problem with this is that even though the cover will put the device to sleep through the magnetic latch, it will be awakened again if any slight pressure is applied to the cover (like when carrying the device with the cover closed) because the cover will press against the raised home button. Why Samsung chose to make this button raised above the bezel is beyond comprehension.  The second problem with a cover that is hinged at the bottom is that it makes the device even harder to hold with one hand while your thumb tries to support the added weight by the very thin real estate provided by the screen bezel and the rest of your hand is trying to keep the cover tight against the back of the device.  The final problem with a cover that fits this design is that if you fold it back to provide the angled support for typing or reading it puts the entire device upside down, with the cameras at the bottom and the home buttons at the top - very annoying!- Many of the Android apps are designed predominantly for the smaller (portrait orientation) screens of smart phones and thus do not rotate into landscape mode, which is how this device was designed to operate even though it does have a position sensor. This causes a devastating consequence when trying to use such an app on this device as you are now compelled to hold it by the side that has built-in touch-sensitive buttons and so you have to be constantly aware of your thumb placement so as not to active menus and other apps by mistake while trying to hold the device while using such an app - also very annoying!- Last, but not least by any means, are the many apps that Samsung bundles into their modified version of Jelly Bean 4.3 - apps that cannot be uninstalled and occupy a significant amount of RAM besides annoyingly launching when you don't want them.  The most annoying of these is a Samsung-modified version of Flipboard called My Magazine that is tied to the home button and launches constantly when you press it, even though you have never set it up or have any intention of ever using it.Would I recommend this device to a friend?  Yes, but only provided that I had explained all of the above and they understood exactly what they were getting, especially considering that this device costs $100 more than a comparable iPad.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet, But expensive", "Author": "Armin Sadeghian", "ReviewID": "RU8UQNQFTD68", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I would say it was a good gadget for its design purpose and the issues were not really significant to affect the user experience.

I found this to be the same even with this newer version. The bottom was very clicky especially near the s pen area. I loved how sharp and crisp the screen was when watching videos, viewing pictures, reading text and playing games. The speakers also sounded great and were placed nicely so that they could be enjoyed in landscape mode like they should be. When using the tablet in portrait mode i found it very easy to press the menu and back capacitive buttons. Also the placement of the home button was very awkward in this position. I prefer my ipad air in portrait mode since it is 4:3 ratio and is ideal for reading. On the other hand I really prefer the 16:9 ratio on the samsung for watching videos. The android platform is lacks the number of tablet apps the apple eco system has to offer. Im sure in another year or so google would have improved on this part. The iPad air is also much lighter and I got much better battery life. I love that the note tablet offers expandable storage, widgets, third party keyboards and being able to run 2 or more apps at once. Overall I found the samsung note 10.1 2014 to be buggy and not as fast as I expected it to be with its specs. I even installed nova launcher and disabled many apps like I have done on my samsung galaxy s4. Other things I didnt like include: the tablet seemed to get very warm at times even with light usage and no way to disable the magazine feature. Priced at $600 this tablet is bit steep in my opinion. Something closer to $500-$550 would have been ideal. Lastly I was hoping to use the remote app with the ir blaster for my entertainment system like I do with my samsung s4 but the app was really buggy and was not working right. Maybe this will be solved with an update in the future. Overall some really great ideas and hardware. I still prefer my iPad air for now. I hope one day I can switch to an android tablet when more apps become available and the quality improves.

I just wish Samsung would realize their full potential with the Note, especially with regards to software.Pros:+ The performance is excellent, the pen digitizer works well, and the display is outrageously good.+ It's pleasant to hold and use.  The buttons, ports, cameras, pen holder, speakers, etc are well laid out.Neutral:+ Handwriting recognition is OK.  It messes up a fair amount but I probably just need more practice.+ Battery life, GPS, and cameras are good but not outstanding.+ The fake leather, fake stitching, fake chrome edging, and prominent branding are tacky, especially for a device in this price range.  It doesn't look bad, but it could look a lot better.Cons:- The first tablet I received was DOA.  It ran for a while but refused to charge, either from the Samsung charger or my PC.  Amazon was awesome about replacing it promptly, but I was still a bit miffed.- Most of the Samsung software is disappointing.  My main complaints are: The Samsung Keyboard is bad (prediction and replacement is clunky, it's too large, symbol page is badly laid out, etc etc) and switching to the Google Keyboard makes handwriting input mode less accessible; Multi Window doesn't support any of the apps I want to use with it; Air Command cannot be customized to launch the apps I want to use (and the default ones are largely uninteresting); the button on the Pen cannot be customized to do something useful like show recent apps; Pen Window supports even less apps than Multi Window; TouchWiz and the usual Samsung bloatware.  Samsung has some really great ideas for software, but the implementation is still lacking.- The screen auto brightness dims the screen too much, and I feel like I lose a lot of battery life leaving it on manual.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the Best; But a Very Good Tablet That Needs Some Seasoning", "Author": "Standards Are Key", "ReviewID": "RX597BHQQT0LG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On paper, this tablet is a significant improvement over the prior version.  But aside from the improved screen, it does not feel that way in actual use.In actual use, there are a number of areas in which the machine is somewhat laggy (never horribly so).  Page swipes are one example (whether moving from page to page in a magazine viewed in the Zinio app or page to page on NY Times web pages.)  The lag seems to manifest itself in unresponsiveness (e.g. I swiped on the screen but the machine did not respond.)  However, once on a page, scrolling up or down is fast.I used the pen feature on the \"old\" version of the Note 10.1 to take handwritten notices and really liked the way that machine worked.  Accurate, quick ( keeping up with my writing was not a problem on the old machine) and it ignored my palm resting on the screen as I wrote.Despite the improved specs on the 2014 edition, the S Note app just does not operate as smoothly.  My palm resting on the screen was not ignored as well as on the old version.I did compare the machine against my iPad2.  Overall, the Samsung is a faster tablet at doing some things but is nowhere near as smooth or polished as the Apple system (including the apps.)  The iPad rarely ignores swipes in apps such as Zinio but the Samsung does.  (I cannot tell whether this is a defect in the Samsung interface (TouchWiz) or Android or the Zinio app.)My hope is that through software upgrades the potential of all of this hardware will turn be realized and the functionality of the old Note 10.1 means it is realistic to expect Samsung to do the same thing here.My intended uses for the machine (aside from note taking) are basically content consumption (magazine, books and movies).UPDATED (11.1.13)I decided to return the item and will buy a refurbished version of the old model (the 2012 version of the Note 10.1).  The stylus remains a significant and worthwhile differentiator over the iPads so there are some uses of tablets that work better for me on the Samsung as opposed to the iPad.  However, the iPad universe of quality apps (particularly ones that have desktop equivalents on the Mac) is richer than the offerings on the Android platform so that platform remains my first choice for consumption focused tablets.I will reiterate that throughout the period of ownership of the 2014 tablet, the iPad2 did work better on a number of apps that I use frequently (such as Zinio).", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Be forewarned Samsung states that there is no compatible keyboard", "Author": "Grateful Dave", "ReviewID": "R3FZAJAEY7PMLB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be honest, I haven't gotten my tablet yet and will update this review later, but after reviewing all the reviews on keyboards here and at Best Buy, Newegg, and several android forums, the Bluetooth problem is pretty extensive.

I was not expecting that. The virtual keyboard is also not as smooth and a accurate with lots of mistakes but not too far behind iPad.The user interface is generally not as polished and user friendndly as the iPad either, another disappointment. For example, the cut and paste functions are a lot more functional and intuitive on the iPad, the Note falls short. Cut and paste should be the simplest and most intuitive of functions, shame Samsung dropped the ball on that, as I had high hopes for Samsung after all the over hyped reviews for it.On the plus side, it is lighter and screen is a bit brighter than the iPad, but thats about it so far. I still need to explore the Samsung further, but after a week of use, I'm NOT I m pressed for the price they charge.So if you want the smoothest experience, iPad is still my recommended choice.If you want a little extra functionality that Note offers a little more.UPDATE: 1/26/2014After a week with the Samsung Note, I'm disliking it more and more due to the bad GUI interface. The touchscreen is horrible, general usage is clunky, just a bad experience. If you have a lot of music already in iTunes, there is no iTunes App for Android, so I can't easily get to all the iTunes music I have already paid for which sucks big time.

While I mildly welcome the newly redesigned look of the tablet, with the faux leather back, there are many flaws with the casing. The metal speaker grills on the sides of the tablet are loose, if you tap on them, they will rattle and move. I don't think they'll fall off, but it probably would've been a better idea to have the grills cut out from the casing itself. If you apply pressure to the left hand bezel when holding the tablet in horizontal mode, the plastic creaks and depresses slightly, which is cause for concern. In some models, there are scratches and mis-molded plastic on the faux leather back of the tablet. You're probably thinking I just got an unlucky product, but I've actually bought and carefully inspected five Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition tablets. Yes, FIVE, that's how much I wanted to like this tablet. I would dismiss these issues if the tablet were low end, but this tablet is one of the most expensive android tablets on the market currently, and there is absolutely no excuse for such an atrocious level of quality control. It is standard protocol to check a few samples out of every manufacture batch, five minutes with this tablet and it is obvious the manufacturing process should be better tuned. This tablet actually costs $50 more than the iPad Air, which is often considered \"overpriced\", yet the iPad Air has impeccable build quality and Apple nearly always does a perfect job at quality control. If Samsung wants to charge the same prices as Apple, they need to step up the quality control. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is better than the iPad Air in almost every aspect, and it pains me to see such manufacturer defects.-Cheap materials. This is a $550 tablet folks, it should not be made out of plastic. I would much appreciate if Samsung had replaced the faux-chrome accents and replaced it with brushed aluminum, it would complement the faux leather back so much better. To be honest, I'd be happier if they ditched plastic altogether and had an all aluminum build, give it a nice sleek look.-There is a noticeable graphics lag present when flipping through the homescreens, especially if you have a lot of widgets. Not that bad of an issue, this is easily remedied with Nova Launcher.-The S Note app is very laggy and buggy, I attribute that to the software aspect of the app, and not the hardware in the tablet. The S Note app is the main app I use and it's kind of disappointing to see such low-quality coding and software optimization. Sometimes when starting up the S Note app, it doesn't recognize the pen, or it would just crash, which is very embarrassing when in the middle of an important meeting. I'd also like to mention that the Exynos processor in the tablet isn't actually an octacore processor, but two quad core processors. One running at 1.9GHz and the other running at 1.3GHz for power conservation purposes. I suspect the tablet often hiccups when the two processors hand off processes to each other.-Another bone I have to pick with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is that there is no microusb 3.0, which the galaxy note 3 has. They came out at around the same time, and to be honest, the tablet needs microusb 3.0 much more than the phone does. This tablet has a huge battery and it would be nice to charge faster.|||PROS|||-The sound quality on the built in speakers are phenomenal, they are very loud and the sound is clear. Perfect for watching movies or YouTube videos, or listening to music.-I'd also like to note that having an active digitizer is great, in fact, I don't buy tablets that don't have an active digitizer because I tend to take a lot of notes. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of the few android tablets that have an active digitizer and I love it.-The battery life is decent, I can get a full days use and maybe more if I don't put it through heavy use.-The screen is great, the resolution is nice and the quality of the screen is probably better than a retina iPad.-Having dedicated navigation buttons means that there's more screen real estate to be used for media and writing notes.-The reading mode of the tablet adjusts the contrast when reading books or articles so it's easier on your eyes.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Device is Good, but Warranty Service is Horrible", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32A1HJT9OEFID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The device was working great for a while; really loved the weight, the feel, and the S Pen.However, after 5 months of using it for about 2-3 hrs each day, with maybe an hour or so worth of writing with the S-Pen, the tip broke off.

There are nice things about it and not so nice, too. The screen is very bright and sharp. The color saturation is right on. The sound is loud enough to enjoy a movie, but will get lost in a busy environment.As for the negatives, I would have to start with the web browsing, because that's what these tablets are used for mostly. Pages tend to render in packets. The text will come up first, then the pictures. But, don't be too fast to click on anything just yet. The pages have to then arrange the contents, which takes longer than I experienced on an iPad or Windows tablet. Pictures and text slide around on the screen until everything is situated. Maybe the browsers cannot handle the floating content well. Who knows?As for the power, I have notice that it drops pretty fast from 100% to 30%. It's quicker than an iPad. Let's put it this way, after an evening of using it starting fully charged, I make sure to plug the tablet in before going to sleep. If I don't, it will not have much power left to use the next day. I suppose I am a bit spoiled after using an iPad, which had enough power to see me through two days of heavy usage. Still, I should be getting longer use out of this tablet per charge.The writing functions work nice. The pen produces very sharp lines as it glides smoothly across the display. However, the handwriting recognition is not working. I read that it is a problem Samsung will address shortly.Overall, I am still disappointed with many of the apps that are supposedly made for tablets. Although Google has pushed developers to produce apps specifically for larger screens, many of the apps look as though they are nothing more than stretched-out versions of the smartphone variety. I know there are diehard Android fans out there, but most of them are phone users, therefore they cannot see what I am talking about. In my eyes, even the Windows 8 tablet apps are better formatted for larger screens. Of course, I need not mention the iPad apps. Those are the best.So, I am deliberating whether to keep the Note 10.1 or not. There are too many quarks for me to use the tablet and be satisfied while doing so. I gave it a try because it is supposedly the best Android tablet being sold right now. So much for that. I tried.10/16/2013: Here is another annoyance I found. Samsung placed a couple of capacitive touch buttons in an awkward area on the bezel. One of those buttons is the back button, which is very sensitive. And, since the bezel is smaller with this model, it is more likely that you will touch that button and be taken away from the screen you are currently viewing.

It hangs from time to time and it's relatively slow lots of the time.  The stylus is buggy and every time I have used it I end up putting it away in frustration and just using the onscreen keypad.  The bloatware is massive and there is very limited support.  It's very hard just to figure out what most of this stuff is, much less how it is suppose to work.The worst issues are the battery and the sound quality.  I wonder if Samsung has production problems because I have seen several reviews saying that the sound quality was excellent, and others talking about loose speakers and poor quality.  On mine the sound quality was really bad.  Like an old AM radio in a '68 Chevy pickup bad.  It put out a tinny, thin sound that was irritating.  My Samsung Galaxy S3 phone on speakerphone was similar enough that I could not tell them apart.  With headphones, the sound is great, so the problem is the speakers.You can literally watch the battery drain as you use the unit.  There is a power save setting, but even with that on it drops 5% every 20 min or so.  Mine also lost 5% of the charge overnight with the unit completely turned off.  The Settings app does not give you access to whatever apps are running in the background, so you can't shut them down to save battery life, or even tell if that is the problem.  There also does not seem to be any way to delete apps that you don't want.  Several screens are taken up by Windows 8 - like tiles that you can't get rid of or replace with apps that you actually use.Also, the stylus will not work with a screen protector.  The stylus will snag and just not read on the screen through the protector.Tablets are basically toys and entertainment devices.  But this one was promoted as something that would help you be productive with actual work.  It doesn't.  I have found myself using my phone for most of the things I had thought I'd use the tablet for.Last, the support from Samsung is pretty much nonexistent.  With a lot of persistence you can find a users manual (250 pages in a pdf file).  Why this is not included on the tablet when you buy it is a mystery, except that the layout of the manual is so bad that you may find solutions faster through trial and error than by digging through the manual.UPDATE:  My son bought the same unit as above.  He downloaded a Task Manager so he can turn off apps and that seems to  help the battery life problem.  The handwriting recognition software was not on the unit, and had to be downloaded and installed, but it works very well.  He has used it for about 3 months and he would not buy another one.  Although the handwriting recognition is good, it is slow and can't really be used for class notes.  He and I both found the Air Command, Samsung hub, and TV remote features to be useless.  So, he basically uses it like any tablet, for email, web, Netflix, and occasionally reading a book.  It is sluggish when paging through a document, but it works.

I returned my Surface 2 since the app selection with Microsoft was less than sufficient, and got this 2014 edition. I was greeted by the abhorrent TouchWiz launcher, that was immediately replaced, and this system lag that ruled over almost every application including exiting apps and returning to the home screen. The \"cool\" features like multitasking and the S Pen are vastly overrated and/or are not actually usefull due to limitations. Overall the whole UE this tablet provides feels incomplete and sluggish and will not give you with the smooth operation of a new iPad Air or even my old Surface 2. Inside, 3gb of ram which is above industry standard  is still somehow not enough, coupled with the quad core Exynos i was expecting more bang....but this beast has been tamed by software.Then there is the subject of the materials, I won't go into great detail since there are many reviewers hating on the plastic that samsung uses instead of alum, and then there's the 'faux leather' texture on the back *insert eyeroll*.

There are audible creaks and cracks when handling the device, the added weight of using alum would have been welcomed.However, I am able to surf the web, read emails, and watch Netflix on its beautiful display.

Slow in unlocking, opening programs, closing programs, switching, just so slow compared to 2014 model!!! Screen not smooth in response (possibly the LTE model will be faster, but this is dammed slow)3- S Pen is not consistent, unpredictable behavior with each use, actually almost unusable (very few programs if any support it)4- most killing problem, is the absence of Android Apps with Tablet support. The play store has only less than 10 prime programs for tablets (yes ten). All other programs are just stretched from 5\" mobile screen to 10\" of this tablet. Very ugly and unusable. E.g. no Facebook native app for android tablet, or linkedin, usa today, dropbox, booking.com, ... just nothing except flipboard and BBC News ... compare this to 450,000 tablet optimized apps on Apple store.Update: ---start----5- streaming videos just suk on androids (whether using Crome or Samsung browser). They r not stable, keep hanging, and many many many times just don't open at all. Example motogp.com, I just can't watch live races on this lousy android based tablet. I always find myself forced to use my old ipad 3 to watch live streaming races.Update ---end---the list goes on and on ...I really regret buying android tablet at this stage, may be after two more years things become better (but not yet)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Misleading 32 GB to only had 25 GB!

So far N.O.V.A 3 and another game Dungeon Hunter by game loft crashes after opening splash screen. The internetintermittently loses signal. The web pages at times look like they are getting painted in slowly compared to a Nexus 7 or iPad. I tried zoomingon Gizmodo's page and there was horrible overlap. When using the pen and scrapbook, sometimes when you draw around a part of page, it trysto save it before you've even completed the circle. Also note, the WIFI version is using two  quad core processors, which I've read have trouble communicatingwith each other.  I was told by someone at best buy that it used the new Snapdragon 800, which on the WIFI it doesn't. As a matter of fact its using the SamsungExynos chip, which is only 1.9 quad core.  The LTE version will come with a snapdragon 800 chip and run at 2.3 gigs quad core. Im sure the Snapdragon will hopefullybe fixed by the time it comes out. Rumor has it Samsung will release an update for the system to use all 8 cores, but at this point who knows when. As far as the crashingwhether its the Touchwiz bloatware or whatever, Samsung should be ashamed of themselves for  releasing this unit before it had all the kinks worked out.

I can see the pixels. I was lying in bed with the tablet with my face quite close to the screen and I noticed how the icons at the bottom and the charging level indicator were not smooth. So I got out the iPad 4 and compared side by side. I cannot see the pixels on the retina iPad screen but I CAN with this. It is still a lot better compared to previous tablets or phones but cannot match the iPad's screen. Because the PPI is similar, I am assuming this has to do with the type of screen but maybe someone can elaborate?2. No touch gestures. It is frustrating to go from the iPad's intuitive gestures to absolutely no gestures. Having to take my fingers off the screen to touch a button to go back to the home screen or switch between apps is annoying. I believe iPad has copyrights on its gestures but surely they can come up with some unique gestures. I know some launchers have gestures but perhaps someone can tell me if they are as good of experience as the iPad.These two things are annoying. But there are some things I do like about the Note:1. I like the plastic backing. I prefer the plastic build vs the metal one of the iPad. The iPad metal enclosure feels cold and I don't like that. It also feels lighter.2. It is good for going paperless. It has a SD card reader and I like the fact there is a file system that you can access so you can organize your files in folders easily.3. I prefer the Android OS for a number of reasons.Overall, it is a good tablet. If this tablet were $100 cheaper, I'd give it 4 stars.Edit: Also, this is my first experience with the S-Pen but I feel it is a bit laggy. I write pretty quickly and this couldn't keep up.

This was my first Android (or any other operating system) tablet. I have had it now for about three days, and will be returning it to Amazon after the weekend, minus many hours of grief.1) Device arrived.  Opened box, looked at the instruction booklet. Yes, I read instruction booklets. This one though has difficult to read black type on a stack of brown paper, each page about the size of a playing card. What a silly way to have an instruction booklet. They should have left it out, I got something useable with a web download.2) The tablet felt heavier in my hand than I expected. My error, it is typical of high end tablets, I was just surprised at the feel.3) The screen gets oily from fingers really fast.  Kind of disgusting in fact.4) The instructions said \"Before first time use, fully charge the battery.\"  There were pictures showing how to hook up the charger to the tablet and a wall outlet. It was not clear whether turning the tablet on was first time use or whether one could turn it on but just not play with it.  In any case I plugged it in and nothing happened. Seemed strange, one would think there should be some indication that the thing was charging. I contacted Samsung and through a chat with a technician we worked through a variety of things, switching cables, plugging into a computer. Finally an icon appeared, and that was supposed to be the signal that it was charging! But the icon just as suddenly disappeared. The chat person disappeared too, claiming that I had exhausted my time.5) I still needed to know when the battery was fully charged. The technician said \"six hours\". Seemed like a long time, but that is what I waited. Not sure why the instructions would hide this fact. The technician did not seem to know whether \"Before using\" meant before turning the tablet on the first time or before using the tablet, i.e. going through the setups.6) Once the six hours were over I turned the tablet on and it worked.  I think the problem with the \"charging icon\" was that the screen was automatically shutting down after a few seconds. I don't know, I set the screen so that it would say on for much longer. I am sure this will cut battery life, but otherwise constant shutting the screen while one was trying to do something was irritating.7) The number of applications and capabilities of the tablet was overwhelming. I had to set up cloud things I had only heard of and did not plan to use. Ordinarily with a new Windows desktop or laptop I know how to get rid of all the bloat and just start adding software one by one.  I used to curse Windows for not giving the flexibility I wanted, without a lot of effort. But that was before I was exposed to Android.8) Take the simple task of adding wallpaper.  Fairly straightforward, either from reading the instructions or just playing around. Except that the choices are very limited, none appealing to me. What I wanted was a very dark gray background. That is what I like, what ordinarily might be classified as \"none\" on a menu. Could not find it, went on the web searching for what to do, was directed to \"free\" wall paper sites that had even worse wallpaper and I never was able to navigate through the sales pitches to download any. There was no information I could find about where \"wallpaper\" was stored in the device, or the dimensions of the graphics required. I ended up doing something in a graphics program on my desktop computer and then emailing it to me on the tablet, as an attached file. Now I have to get the attached file into something called the Gallery folder, and then should be able to choose it as wallpaper. But really, that much effort, just to select wallpaper that is essentially no wallpaper?9) The microSD slot has a cover. Good luck opening it with a standard male fingernail. Once you do get it open all you can think of is that if you have to do it more than a few times you will certainly break it. The instructions call for sliding the card gently into the slot, until it seats with a click. Typical. Only it did not seat. Again, my fingernails were not long enough. I did finally get the card to stay deep in the slot, and closed the door.10) The MicroSD was not recognized by the tablet. Instructions told me what to do to \"mount\" the card, but they did not work, that is, I followed the instructions until I came to a screen that did not have the menu option the instructions said would be there.11) I removed the MicroSD card. That was a job, again unless you have very long and thin fingernails it is extremely difficult. But I managed to remove it, and the screen did show a message that the SD had been removed. I reinserted it and removed it several times, but still was not able to mount it.12) I like the stylus feature. I like the fact that whenever you get someplace and you can't figure out how to get out of it you can press a \"home\" button that takes you home. I like the fact that it picked up my home wireless network and I was immediately and simply able to log on.  The screen is great. Writing with the stylus is great. Even typing on the virtual keyboard with my thick fingers worked well.  Maybe if I were in my teens and had lots of hours to play with the tablet to learn how to do things I would be happier with it, but already I have wasted many hours trying to straighten out the battery charging, and still haven't fixed the microcard problem, after many hours. Maybe some day in the distant future I will try again, but for now I am finished with it.13) One, two, maybe up to 10 icons are useful. But so many icons for so many applications, I feel like I am in an Egyptian tomb trying to decipher things.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F3SOJ7O"}}
