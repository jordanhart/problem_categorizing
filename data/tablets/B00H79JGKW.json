Ordered white, got pink. Decided to keep it and order another because it is a great tablet. Many more features and better specs than any other in it's price range. Wifi works very well. Dual cameras a huge plus. Higher res screen makes a big difference. Overall very happy. Won't give a 5 rating because of wrong color. Second one came, wrong color again.  Within 24 hours of posting a review, I was contacted by the product provider.  They gave me a discount to make up for the color mistake.  Excellent customer satisfaction move.  I am very happy, and I would not hesitate to purchase again.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slow, poorly configured", "Author": "popmidi \"popmidi\"", "ReviewID": "R3U9AHJ87XP67S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I deliberately purchased an ultra-cheap tablet in order to find out if it would be a valuable tool for my music and other endeavors.

color. ProntoTec 9 inch PT9 series is a Cortex A9 at 1.2 GHz dual core processor and is a very good value in price per performance. It has 1 GB RAM and also has a GPU. This runs Android 4.2.2 Android. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience. The dimensions are 9.25 x 0.43 x 5.91 in and weighs just over a pound. The screen resolution is 1024 x 600. The screen is excellent for reading documents/ePub books via Aldiko Reader Premium, playing games etc. I have bunch of screenshots at the end of my video review. I played Temple Run Oz and it was nice! Puzzle games like the addictive 2048 also performed flawlessly.Most of tablets have ARM based processors. This makes sure all of the Apps in Google Play ecosystem available. If you look at my video review, I have screenshots showing the CPU speed and other kernel details. Android Status is an app which gives lot of stats based of Linux /proc files in the system. This is always up to date. This supports wireless with Wi-Fi (802.11 BGN). Tablet has 2 cameras - front and back. This has 8 GB storage and you can use an extensible SD card slot upto 32 GB as well as cloud storage. Though not built in, the tablet supports external 3G/WCDMA dongle. Battery came for a good 8 hours with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. This tablet has a 4000 mAh battery. I have enclosed battery details from the battery widget pro app at the end of video review. Overnight it drained very less. Mobile Networking was on by default. I switched off as I was using only Wi-Fi mode now. I am tempted to buy a 3G dongle. I suggest you go to Settings and tweak things which are not required. Developer Mode was enabled by default. I turned it off. The capacitive touch screen was really good, some occasions I had to press little harder and at right locations, but pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.It is great the tablet has micro USB Port, 3.5-mm stereo Headphone Jack, built-in speaker, microphone, HDMI (yes, HDMI), micro SD card slot and a DC Input Jack. Note that for powering through wall adapter you need to use the provided DC input jack. Speaker was loud enough. In a room, once I keep the tablet in a stand it was good. Speaker is on the backside, so you don't want to lie this down on back as it will hamper the audio coming out. This is a design I hope changes in Android manufacturers in future. Android tablets are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where ProntoTec shines. Using a native Android 4.2.2, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. In many countries, where affordability is key, having a tablet like this with Wi-Fi is a big boon. Imagine having entire Wikipedia at your fingertips for a child. I tried few educational applications on this. I consider this as a big hit with educators than gamers.I tried Google Voice Search and asked \"what is capital of United States\". The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. I also tried Wolfram Alpha and asked bunch of questions. E.g., what is world population, what is population of China etc? The microphone picked up correctly and answered through Wolfram Alpha. Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly. I watched multiple video through few applications. Obvious first choice was YouTube. Was able to search and watch videos. I used TwIT.TV app and watched some segments of a podcast (video streaming through Wi-Fi). Again smooth playback. Hand-holding is really easy given the weight of it. No heat observed handholding the tablet. It is plastic, and buttons are made of plastic. For a kid, this is perfect also though the feature set is equally appealing to an adult. I was so enamored with low cost computers in late 90s and it seems I am reliving them with tablet. If you want to listen to podcasts/watch video then this is perfect. Just keep it in a stand and watch video. See my video review to get an idea of what I am referring to.For a computer geek, it is a challenge to design something with minimal resources - screen resolution, RAM, storage, chipset. ProntoTec has designed a tablet with budget conscious customer in mind. Out of the box, it worked to my satisfaction given the specification and price. Once powered on, it directly came to a working condition. No need to setup account prior to using. I signed with Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi router was in one bedroom. I configured in another room separated by two rooms. There was no issue with Wi-Fi signal. Once connected, I created a Google account as well. I generated a Application Specific password as I had 2 factor authentication. Once signed on, I updated applications like YouTube, Google Keyboard etc. I also downloaded few applications like TwiT.TV, Tetris from EA, etc. I downloaded Chrome and browsed few websites. Listened to Audio / Watched Video. Out of the box battery needed a full charge. Initially without charge, I did a video stream and wanted to see how device shutdown. Sure enough it shut down as battery drained. Powered on after charging and everything was fine.I am impressed enough at the engineering for the price/value/budget it delivers. The ARM Cortex(tm)-A9 processor is the power-efficient and popular high performance choice in low power or thermally constrained cost-sensitive devices. Cortex-A9 is available as a single processor solution offering an overall performance enhancement of well above 50% compared to ARM Cortex-A8 solutions. Cortex-A9 MPCore offers up to 4 processors delivering when needed, on lightweight workload as well as peak performance. Its configurability and flexibility allows Cortex-A9 to scale across a wide variety of markets and applications. This is from ARM specification. ProntoTec has pulled in many off the shelf components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. That is the golden test and it performed beautifully!", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I gave it 4 stars because the instruction booklet is just about useless, a joke really", "Author": "Laverne Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2CXGKGM17FFQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am really enjoying this tablet.
