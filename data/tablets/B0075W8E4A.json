I was looking for a ten inch tab, but didn't have a lot of cash.  I already have the Acer Iconia A-100, which is a great tablet. But i wanted a 10 incher.  When i first got it, it ran fine but there was no Google App Store, bummer, So I got the Amazon App Store.  everything was working fine but when I loaded Netflix it didn't work, the app loaded fine but the screen would just go blank.  I called Coby Customer Service and they said it was a problems with Adobe flash not running right?  Anyways, with Coby you actually get a live person however, you may not get one that knows anything.  So i looked around on the internet and found that this is a problem with the tablet.  I also found a solution. A tech advised to reboot the system and erase factory files. Here is the message ---- \"Power the unit off (holding power buttom) and selecting Power off, then hold simultaneusly back button and on buttom 8 seconds,when the android icon appears press the back button, in the menu select wipe data/factory reset pressing home buttom and then press back buttom, in the next screen select \"yes delete all user data\" pressing back buttom, and in the next screen select \"reboot system now\" with the back buttom and wait. IT WORK FOR MY TABLET.\" ------After doing this download the Good e-Reader app store through Getjar. The Good e-Read app store has everything. Netflix now works great on my tablet. I was also able to down load pretty much every app the Google Play Store has. They even have the Google Play Store app.  Anyways, after doing this my tablet runs smoother, seems to be faster and everything works. Took this tablet from a 3 to a 5 star. I now love this tablet.  Oh, when doing this it will erase things (music, pics, videos) on the tablet but not on the SD Card.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great for certain things", "Author": "Darrell Meece", "ReviewID": "RYDML0WV7D5LQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is for the 10\" coby. I got it to replace the functions of an e-ink kindle. I wanted to be able to read books, surf some simple web pages, maybe check my e-mail and calendar, play some simple games. I liked the idea of a bigger screen that I could see page-size pdf (and maybe a comic book) on. It turns out that this tablet is fine for those needs.It actually seems made pretty well. The touch screen seems to work well - by way of comparison, I've had a couple of older tablet pc's, and older windows ce pda's, my wife has an older resistive touch 7\" android, I have an android phone. So on the one hand I've used a lot of touch screens, on the other, I can remember when you had to have a proprietary batter-powered stylus to use one. So to me, the touch screen seems pretty good, but I don't know how that will translate to others. It is a finger print magnet and picks up smudges like mad. It is perfectly adequate for e-book reading and playing simple android games.I am an average sized male and the size is fine for me for a big book reader. The trade off of the bigger screen is that you have a bigger device to hold. I can just \"palm\" it with one hand - it is 16 X 9 so it seems longer than it does wide. I don't think it is too large to be a comfortable reader.The wi-fi connected in a snap, couldn't be easier. One thing that is sort of annoying is that everytime I resume from a suspend I have to disconnect and reconnect the wi-fi for it to connect. I haven't figured a way around that yet, but I think it may be an ice cream sandwich \"feature.\" It connects easily to our linux computers with the cable.I found that I was more bugged by the lack of google play marketplace than I thought I'd be. As best I can tell, everyone who has tried rooting the 10\" has bricked it. So I didn't root it. You can get the apk for google play easy enough and side load it, but the device isn't on google's list of approved devices so the apk won't run and connect to the market. Because you can't root it, you can't edit the boot file to spoof it as a device on google's list. So unless you root it or google adds it you won't be connecting to google play.Which isn't really that big of a deal. It has a get jar market on it, but I had already put on amazon market before I bothered looking at it, and there's really not much use in it. The amazon market is easy enough for anyone to add - just point the web browser to amazon and follow the directions. Of all things, the only thing I wanted to put on it so far but wasn't able to yet is tux math for the kids - it is on google play but not amazon market and I can't find the apk on the web. It was easy enough to side load other apks. It runs the angry birds apps fine, and the cut the ropes, fruit ninjas, temple runs. I had a devil of a time getting where's my water/Perry to install. It just wouldn't install. I tried different versions and nothing, then one time I tried it for a lark and both just installed and now they play fine. I must have installed something with a needed library or something along the way. Who knows. I downloaded free solitaire and freecell from amazon and they work fine. That's enough games for me, so I haven't bothered putting any emulators on it, without hardware buttons I don't care to.It has both a regular size usb and a micro usb, which is nice because you can use something like a usb key board. The power plug is an additional little port. The batteries last longer than I thought they would - good enough for me to read and play some games. I put some videos on there just to see them and they worked fine. The kids watched some youtube on it and that was fine. I couldn't get netflix to install on it though.It has an micro sd card slot, that is important to me. The file structure is a little wonkey, but you'll find the sd card if you look around. After the first time it didn't really matter to me because it remembered the location in the history and I can just click the short cut there.It comes with a book reader built in. I side loaded an epub file and it seemed to present it just fine. I went ahead and put the cool reader app on it because I like the flexibility of that app. I used it to read A Dance with Dragons an it was a good book reading experience - I turned off the background and just use white text on black or yellow on blue. Honestly I didn't miss e-ink and I was a fan of it.It isn't an ipad and it isn't a tegra 3. It is $150 bucks. So if you want the ipad or a tegra 3 don't get this. If you have some basic android experience then this will seem familiar and easy, and if you want a basic tablet then this is a fine one. I got lucky here, it fits my needs very well - so if you are looking for something like that, book reader, web, simple games, with a bigger screen I'd recommend this to you.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A couple of Aha Moments . . .", "Author": "nizzly", "ReviewID": "RG1ACDALT2AOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Arrived quickly, and I was very happy with how it looked!Things to note:- This takes a very small, 5V DC power supply, which is unusual to me.- It is an unsupported Google device = no Play app store, and still can't figure out how to get HBO GO to work on it, and can't get Facebook created app (unless someone tells me where else you can download it from!)- Has a very sensitive power button - last 3 times I've put it in my backpack for use at work, the power button has been hit in transit and I arrive with it drained and unusable.  Could probably be remedied by buying a better case than by using the slipcover it comes with.- Back button often exits you out of something, rather than taking you to your last page/position.- Browser, while effective, does not have near the same functionality as the browser on my PC.- Browser feels slow to me, and it's annoying.Other things to note:- Sound quality was surprisingly good for what it is.- Keyboard is awesome and works really well, which surprised me.- Absolutely zero lag in streaming of either music or video - win!!!- You can still do lots of great stuff, like use other social media apps that allow you to view Facebook, or use the browser for it (can't get browser version of HBO GO however, *sad clown face*).- Use Amazon app store for lots of good stuff even if you can't use Google Play app store - the Get Jar app store was surprisingly limited.  Might just be the brand new O/S.- Picks up home wi-fi & mobile hotspot (wi-fi from my phone) just great, never had a problem with that!- Renders books really well and is fun to use for reading.Overall, because it is less than half price of any other 10\" tablet out there, I will give it a \"like\" rating and deal with what it doesn't do.  But the HBO GO thing was a major blow and the big reason behind losing a whole star.  I've heard that they are supposed to be coming out with a new version of the app that I can get to and will work on this O/S, but my fingers are still crossed on that . . .Also, in case anyone from Google is reading this - you majorly effed up by allowing others to license your O/S by NOT also allowing anyone with said O/S's devices to be able to access YOUR CONTENT.

I mainly wanted a better experience playing games, viewing apps like Google Earth and streaming Collage Football games via the Watchespn app. As good as the i-pod is, it was just too small for some situations. I wanted to upgrade to an I-pad, but theI-Pad was just out of my price range.So after much research, I decided on the 10\" Coby despite the fact there was no access to the Google Play Store. I verified that I could download Google Earth and Watchespn from The Amazon App store so that wasn't an issue. I ordered my Tablet with the keyboard/case and the 16GB micro memory card. Both I would highly recommended getting. All 3 came in a very timely manner.This is my first Android device but I quickly found my way around and downloaded a few apps from Getjar. The best advice for apps is going to Getjar and download the \"Good E reader Android App Store\" they have a better choice of apps and from there you can also download other Appstores such as Amazon,1 Mobile and Appbrain.Pros:Great price. At present time $149.00Great picture quality for both photos and videos.Lots of storage available for apps (8GB internal)+ up to 32GB on a Micro memory card.HDMI inputStreams and plays UTube videos wellGood choice of accessories available from Amazon.com such as  cases,keyboards,screen protectors, Mini HDMI to HDMI cords and mini sd cards. All reasonably priced and wont break the bank.Good battery life. Lasts about 6 hours.No problems with the WiFi.Good for gameplayIdeal for E-BooksTouchscreen has good response.Cons:Poor camera quality. UselessPreloaded Browser crashes constantly. I use Google Chrome, it works much better.The 1042 Wont win any races while surfing the net.A bit slow loading pages. Some patience required!!No Google Play.Its a deal breaker for some but it shouldn't be.Speaker sound is fair at best. You can use headphones or amplified speakers to improve sound.I am very happy with my purchase so far. I think people who gave this Coby Tablet a bad review just didn't give it a fair chance. Granted you get what you pay for and this Tablet can't compete with the high end Tablets for performance but for the price it holds its own.

At first it would just randomly disconnect, which was annoying, but I just reconnected and moved on. By the next day, however, it wouldn't connect at all. It kept telling me the wi-fi was out of range, even when I was sitting right next to it. I took it to a few other places - on the off-chance it was my wi-fi - still didn't work.Bum deal. But that's what warranties are for, right? Aside from the wi-fi issue, it's still a nice little tablet.EXCEPT...I called Coby and after being on hold forever and bounced between 3 different reps, the not-so-nice lady told me I had to pay to send the tablet to them (insured) AND pay a $15 processing fee AND wait 6-8 weeks for them to fix it or send me a REFURBISHED tablet.Seriously?

The 7 and 9 inch screen Kyros are easily rooted by now, and I'm sure the 10.1 inch version will eventually be rooted, but even without rooting the little device is FANTASTIC.Don't get me wrong, the tablet has flaws and if I cared about using the internet browser, I'd most likely not be as satisfied as I am.I knew what I wanted when I bought the tablet. I wasn't 100% sure that the Kyros would accomplish everything I wanted, but I took a gamble and came out very satisfied.The first thing you're going to want to do if you're not rooting the tablet is get Amazon Market app from amazon.com on the device's browser. After that...1. I wanted something to read comics while at work without bringing my physical copies with me.  I downloaded ComicCat from the Amazon Market app. The app let me import and read every CBR file I'd all ready had in my PC's library. It works great on this device.2. I wanted to be able to draw and sketch with the tablet. Once again, I hit up the Amazon Market app and downloaded SketchBook Pro. The app works great, with only a very small delay between my strokes on the screen and the brush's stroke through the app. If you want to use SketchBook, you'll definitely want to get a stylus for your device. Works great though.3.I wanted to read Ebooks, and the Kindle for Android app works great on this as well.4.I wanted to play some simple games. The Kyros has handled everything I've downloaded for it.The SD card expansion is great. You can even use an external USB HDD for removable storage but it's not as convenient as the SD Card. If you're wanting to watch videos you could buy multiple cards and fill them with video and just pop them in and out of the device for unlimited storage.So the stuff that would have disappointed me if I'd been into other activities.The screen position sensor is a little wonky and sluggish at the same time. If you want to turn the tablet and change the view mode from portrait to landscape, the device will take a little over a second to make the transition... but on occasion the sensor will tell it that the little wiggles and body shifts natural to holding the device without resting against a desk or something means that you want to shift it to another view mode. This means you have to wait for it to shift, then wait for it to shift back. In apps where this becomes annoying, I just turn off the app's use of that function.The keyboard is sluggish at times. If you're wanting to write a book or something, I'd definitely recommend getting something else.You'll want to periodically fully power down the device and make sure that you aren't running extraneous apps in the background to prevent over taxing the processor. As long as you're somewhat attentive and patient, the tablet is fantastic. If you can't take a few seconds to set up your apps to counteract the tablet's flaws... then maybe you'd be better served spending several extra hundred dollars on a Xoom, Touchpad, or Ipad.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coby mid1042 10.1 Inch Tablet", "Author": "Ollie", "ReviewID": "R2K57VB0QPEV85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this is my first Tablet.

The one thing I don't know is why Amazon sells this and will not put Amazon apps on it ???. Amazon this would be and even better buy with your apps.

The Android Ice Cream platform will not allow you to access Google apps play store and does not recognize the device. It's almost deceiving that it's [resented as Android when you can't run Android apps because of the different platform. It's not an isolated case as I also purchased the 7\" version and I can not download the face book apps that run through google play store which are touted as Android Apps. As far as speed and surfing, it's efficient however again, since the tablet platform is unrecognized you will be limited on what mobile apps you can download for instance Iheart radio app, Zynga etc., even websites that stream audio. I accessed a local radio station that broadcasts live. It didn't work with these tablets and pops up as device not recognized or supported.If you want a basic surfing and email device with games that will function on this platform buy it. If you want more choices in apps through Google Playstore don't but you'll spend a little bit more more the convenience. As far as features, the camera is limiting as you cant see what you are shooting as it it faces towards the user and there is no viewer. I use the gallery photos for virtual tours of properties and it is grainy. A better camera that was designed for pictures would be advisable otherwise it's a Skye type camera. The Getjar app does have a nice selection of apps however Skype on both tablets is not very good and sends a signal processed to the receiving user as pink and not clear. The person sending Skype was clear as a bell so I would assume it's the Kyros that is sending a bad picture due to the platform or the processor.It was disappointing.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Coby Kyros MID 1042 Tablet", "Author": "Ginamarie Martino", "ReviewID": "R1LPWHEK1SBAUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the Coby MID1042 Tablet from Amazon w/ free shipping. Cost $146.00.  I have to admit that after the reviews that I like the price but was leary about installing the apps.  This item arrived way before it was expected to. Packaging was good.  Plugged it in, charged it and it was ready to go.I was able to get ALL the apps I wanted onto this tablet.  Not all from the same sight though.  Getjar is ok and has plenty of free apps. Not the ones I needed tho.  But if you log onto the browser you can bookmark your favorite pages right on your home screen.  Amazon, Netflix, Yahoo mail, Pinterest, facebook booked marked really easy and open up to the last page you had.  Again these are right on your main home screen.Then I downloaded an app from Getjar called \"Good E-reader android app store\".  this app is actually a store, so I was able to download a few apps off of this app for free.  This also had Netflix Aodbe and lots of popular games.Then my struggle was trying to kindle onto my tablet.  It took me a while and a lot of research but I was able to download the \"Amazon AppStore\". right from amazon.com  Not easy, not hard.Here were the steps I had to follow.On my tablet I went to settings - then to applications - make sure the \"unknrown sources\" is checked.Then I went to Amazon Appstore and in the upper right corner it asks for you email.Then it sends you a email with a link to download.Once its downloaded, you can see on the home page the downloaded icon, the one with the down arrow.I clicked on that and it installed the app.  Pretty easy actually.After that I was able to download Kindle and Audible.I am very happy with this tablet, yes it did take me hours to figure out how to get some of the apps but I didnt have to download anything to my computer or put anything on an SD card.The screen doen not act like an Ipad.  It is not a tap screen, but more of a touch and hold for 1 second screen.  One you realize this it just becomes natural to hold the icon. Not bad, just different.I would recommend this to my family and friends.  All I can say is be patient when trying to set up your favorite apps.

This is absolutely a luxury item, I bought it because I wanted a 10 inch tablet pretty much solely to read comics on and since no one has really touched on that I wanted to say it does that very well. It is faster and more responsive than my phone (an lg optimus elite, and the only android device I have to compare to) The touch screen works well and quickly. The text is clear (I've read about 40 different comics so far and only had to zoom in on text once)I suppose anyone else who has read e-comics on a smaller device hates double page spreads as much as I do, but no more! Loading and scrolling around them is super fast and easy. On the downside, there's no market. I haven't found that terribly inconvenient, aside from having some trouble finding a way to put comicrack on it. I also only see 4 GB, not 8, of storage but I didn't look that hard. Not a real big deal, just order a memory card to go with it. That's that really, if you want a more technical review scroll down, I just wanted to let fellow comic readers know that there is a decent alternative to spending a boatload of money on a fancy tablet just to read comics.PS...I forgot the camera. I don't even know why they bothered. The only real use I've gotten from it is showing people what the predator sees when he looks at them.

I was considering an Ipad, but I just can't justify 500 bucks for something my wife will surf the web with.  Sure the Ipad has great points, but I think all their products are a bit over-priced.  So my main need for a tablet is Kindle/Ebooks, surfing, Facebook, and Youtube.  Got this tablet; right out of the box it looks pretty good.  The resolution is average, not terrible.  The device booted right up and not being familiar with Android I was able to make my way around.  It did take me a while to figure out how to load Kindle.  First you have to load Amazon app store; then Kindle.  I found a defect after the first time using Amazon app store; it does not return any app searches and just appears as a black screen.  Tried re-installing a few times; same problem.  Not overly concerned because I can buy my books using my laptop or Iphone and store on Amazon cloud.The good: Kindle performs well.  The web browser is good.  Youtube app is good too.  The response time loading pages is actually really fast.  Took a great deal of research(will cover in bad)but I found a Facebook app that works well.  So the basic points that I bought this tablet for are accomplished.  Capacitive touch is really cool too.The bad:Heard a LOT of other folks mention; you CANNOT use Google play.  Not being an Android person I did not know this is the Droid equivalent to Apple Store.  Major letdown, I looked and this tablet is not on the supported device list.  WHAT does this mean?  Did Coby not pay a license fee to participate in Google play??  The device runs the most current Droid O/S.  Really poor.  Sent email to tech support - still waiting for response.  I'm hoping they come up with a solution.  Battery life has only been 3 hours; acceptable but not great.  They leave you with an app store called Get Jar which is an open source app store that has the same feel as using something like Ubuntu Linux.  If you want an app and can't find it; you're best bet is to find what is called an apk file for the app you want.  That is how I finally got Facebook installed.  I could not find it on Get Jar.  I cannot say enough bad things about Get Jar so I will stop; oh one good point I did find Angry Birds on Get Jar.  The camera as mentioned is pretty useless.  Device does seems to heat up; but nothing extreme.So all in all I'm happy so far.  The hardware is pretty darn good for 90 bucks.  The major drawback is the app support, as I mentioned.  I would have given this 4 stars had it come with Google play support.

I was impressed by the specs for $199 which definitely outweighs that of the Amazon Kindle. First of all, Amazon's description of the product is incorrect. The tablet does not have a 1MP camera; it only has a 0.3MP camera without a flash. The camera is located in a rather inconvenient location (top right corner) which makes it difficult to video chat unless you flip the tablet completely upside down. Even then, the images produced are very blurry. While using Skype, the video was so jittery that it was better to just make voice calls as opposed to video calls. Strangely enough, this tablet does not have a rear facing camera while the older MID9742-8 model does. Why Coby would take the extra camera feature away is beyond me. The specs also claim that the processor in the tablet is an A110 1 GHz; however, it is actually an A8 1 GHz processor. The big silver button on the tablet is a back button as opposed to a home button. Therefore, this button is redundant because there are \"touch\" buttons built into Android's Ice Cream Sandwich OS. The tablet does not have Google Play but after installing the 1mobile market by searching for it on Google, you will find all of the same apps available from Google Play. While browsing the web, I noticed that the WIFI would lose connection from time to time, especially if the tablet was being used after it was put on standby. The 16:9 screen ratio is not as nice as a 16:10 or even a 4:3 because you do not see the screen in its natural resolution. The tablet also began to freeze if you had more than two tabs / web pages open at a time. The battery life seemed to give about an average of 3-4 hours at best which is very low compared to other android tablets. For the money, I think this tablet is suitable for web browsing, reading e-books, watching YouTube, and playing simple games. For anything else, spend more money and get yourself something of better quality like the Asus Transformer or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this tablet:", "Author": "Linda S.

I received this tablet as a gift when it first came out in June. The android environment is very familiar and friendly. This is actually my third Coby Kyros sent to me.I played with the tablet and installed various apps testing how various stuff effects it. It had a nice long battery life, I was able to play with it for 5 to 7 hours on a single charge. During the first two weeks was great playing, but during a charge the adapter plug on the tablet broke and I had to call Coby Kyros for a replacement. Coby was very friendly and helpful, however you do still have to send $15 for s/h for the next one, plus you have to pay for s/h to ship the broken one back (which is about $7 -$15 depending how you ship it. It took about 4 weeks and they sent . . . well they just sent me a brand new tablet, which is still really nice of them. BUT..... when I received the replacement the wifi had a short in it, and would not stay connected or would not connect at all. I called Coby back and they actually did waive the shipping cost to ship it back. It took about three weeks and they did ship another tablet. I am happy to report so far so good, everything appears to work.It does not integrate with Google Apps that well. I have tried side-loading Google Apps such as Play, Drive, Books, Music, and even the YouTube app with little success. Out of all those only the YouTube app runs, but does not log into Google. I have found that Amazon's App Store does run and a nice alternative to Google Play. One thing Coby need to realize is that since it is an Android is has to be Google App friendly since no one uses GetJar. I did not have hardly any current and popular app (such as Facebook) on GetJar; actually no Facebook app on Amazon's App Store either. That I was able to side-load from my phone. I was able to side-load The Sims Freeplay which was great, because it makes the play much easier. Game-play is nice and doesn't lag to much. Most of the Google Play Apps were able to side-load just fine onto the tablet just fine.However since this is now September and Google/Galaxy Nexus 7 is here I would probably go with that one.

For the price, I really don't think it can be beat. One nice thing about it is that Coby, while a cheaper brand, is at least a BRAND. They have a website with contact information, help topics, and support available. They have products available everywhere etc.The reason I point this out is because in this price range, you will mostly get no name tablets from who knows who. If you have trouble, I would not know who to contact or even who to be mad at, since so many of the cheap tablets are not branded at all. Coby is a value brand, but seem to be putting everything they have into building better and better products.The main thing I would stress to anyone interested is that in addition to Getjar app store, you can also access the Amazon Android app store (as well as several others you can find online). You can easily find the information online on how to download it. It's also on Amazons app site, just do a search for it. You can even get the free app each day that they charge for every other day. I check every day and there are some good ones that it's fun to get for free. Even Getjar is pretty good. Unless you have a very specific predetermined list of apps you must have, the sources available on this tablet will suit you well. And for many things, you can simply bookmark the mobile website if there is no app for something that is primarily a link to the website anyway.Now, I use my tablet as a book reader, to play some games, check email etc. Just normal stuff. No business apps. No need for the games that only a few powerful computers can run. I'm just a casual user. I have looked at some of those lists like \"the 100 best android tablet apps\" etc and have not found any that I wanted that I couldn't get from Getjar or Amazon. But that' just me.The screen is better than I expected. I have used the Kindle Fire and it's screen is definiately better. However, this screen is crisp, clear, bright, and accurate. The touch mechanism is perfect. Just an easy tap and things work. Side by side, they may look differently, but I don't anyone would look at the Coby by itself and think anything is bad about it. I have read ebooks on it for hours at a time and have no complaints. Page turns are very smooth. All of the normal adjustments are there. Font, font size, black on white/white on black lettering etc.The speaker is fairly strong. The sound is loud and doesn't distort much when turned up. Wifi reception could be a little better. Doesn't drop the signal, but has less bars than my laptop sitting right next to it. Seems like it's a little slower on the downloads when it's getting minimal bars. When I'm close to the router, it's faster. Haven't used Skype yet, and may not ever use it. But the camera on this tablet is pretty low quality. But I did want one with a camera, just in case I want to video chat once in a while.. Some of the really cheap ones have no camera at all.Battery life is not as long as the Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire, but I have been getting about 6 hours if I am downloading apps or watching video the entire time. I get longer if I am reading books. I do adjust the screen brightness down a bit for reading. It is better for my eyes and does keep the battery fuller longer. I am satisfied with the battery, just don't expect 12 hours like some of the tablets are advertising now. I don't think they actually get quite that long for most people, but it is how they are advertised.Note for anyone looking at this tablet--Coby is coming out with a newer, updated 7 inch model called the MID7065 in spring of 2013. I didn't want to wait and pay $50 more for it, but it dual core and has Google Play installed. Otherwise, it appears to be exactly the same, appearance wise. But I look at it this way--if I really wanted a dual core tablet with Google Play for more money, those were already available when I chose this one. I am quite happy with the tablet and would recommend it to everyone except \"power\" users who know they need more. For the rest of us, for under $100, it's really hard to beat. I don't think I could have gotten anything better for this price and I didn't really want to spend much more. Nothing about the tablet has been a disappointment.It also comes with a regular wall charger in addition the usb cable. Amazon charges for it with the kindle fire. This also has no ads like the kindle fire. This Coby case also included a sleeve style case to protect it when carrying it around. Cases are extra on most tablets. This tablet also comes with a nice manual to help you get started. Some others don't really include a guide at all.Edit: Now that I have had this tablet for a while, I still love it. The Amazon app store is great, content wise, although I do have to reload it on the tablet sometimes to get it to work. I don't think it's the tablets fault, just a compatibility issue between the hardware and software. I really don't think the Google Play store would give me anything significant I can't get from the Amazon Store. The only downer of this tablet is that it doesn't charge from the mini USB port. The only way to charge is by the included charger.Battery life is good though. I turn off wifi when I am not actively using it and it makes a huge difference in battery life. I would not recommend leaving wifi on when the tablet is just sitting around but turned on or while reading books etc. I also do not keep the screen at maximum brightness all of the time. It helps preserve battery as well. I have downloaded an app to make turning wifi on/off quick and easy and adjusting the screen brightness easy too--without having to go into menus and find the settings.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "COBY 8048-4 doe work with angry birds etc....", "Author": "RT \"RT\"", "ReviewID": "RVWXT11YTVH3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my son for Christmas, at first I was upset that it did not have google play,I do not like GETjar, and Amazon marketplace did not have what I was looking for.

For the first week it kept turning on and off intermittently (and at the worst times), then it would freeze and need to be restarted. I hated the thing and was ready to return it. However, after the initial 30 or so reboots i think that it finally had the libraries where it wanted them to be.  I really feel like i got a good deal for the money.  I dont use face book so i cant say how that works, but I do stream netflix, I do play a ton of apps ( forget using the amazon appstore its not worth it and i used it religously before the change over), and i listen to tons of music. It does all of these things great. I have found new appstores GOOD E Reader appstore is a good one to start with. It does all of these things just fine. It has a really good sound from the one external speaker it has.

She goes to the educational sites and guess what?  They won't work.  Have to download Adobe Flash.  But wouldn't you know Adobe flash won't download for this tablet.  So I got involved.  And I searched the internet, did everything suggested and flash would not install.  No browser supporting flash would install.  I could find no solution at all for this.  There is simply no way to view any website that uses Adobe Flash.  We are subscribed to Netflix and Xfinity.  So nether worked.Now I know that some of the reviews gave solutions for this issue.  And I tried them all. It doesn't work.  So if you can live without anything that uses Adobe Flash, then you shouldn't have a problem with this tablet.The other big, big issue is that it kept disconnecting from the wireless internet and we had to keep restarting.  We have had a this wireless setup for a long time with a number of devices hooked up to it over that time and nothing else ever had this issue.And for all of you thinking that rooting the table is the answer; that evidently only works sometimes and it voids the warranty.

It cost me $30 to send it back. Over $15 to ship it to them and a $15 money order so they could send it back.  They tell it takes 6-8 weeks to get the replacement.  It is now June 13 and I have not been able to get through on the phone for over a month to check the status of it.  The only day of the week I have been able to get through is a Monday and had to sit on hold forever.Honestly I loved my tablet and miss it greatly but I would never by another Coby Kyros because of the lack of customer service.  The product is great while it works, but you might as well kiss it goodbye if you have to send it in for a replacement.If you don't believe me try calling these numbers to see if you get through: 1-800-681-2629  or 1-800-727-3592.Best of luck to those who still wish to buy, but to someone who doesn't have money and time to lose keep shopping.If you do decide to get it; the best free app stores to use with this were Amazon and Mobile1 app store.Get Jar was a joke. Hulu Plus did not work on it but Netflix did.  You do not get 4 GB of space for Apps, App space is very minimal and even with a 16 GB SD card still was pretty limited.

Could probably be remedied by buying a better case than by using the slipcover it comes with.- Back button often exits you out of something, rather than taking you to your last page/position.- Browser, while effective, does not have near the same functionality as the browser on my PC.- Browser feels slow to me, and it's annoying.Other things to note:- Sound quality was surprisingly good for what it is.- Keyboard is awesome and works really well, which surprised me.- Absolutely zero lag in streaming of either music or video - win!!!- You can still do lots of great stuff, like use other social media apps that allow you to view Facebook, or use the browser for it (can't get browser version of HBO GO however, *sad clown face*).- Use Amazon app store for lots of good stuff even if you can't use Google Play app store - the Get Jar app store was surprisingly limited.

The picture is not the clearist but you see them very good and most of all they see you too but its best you have a good connection for it to work.

It's perfect for getting on the internet, facebook, playing games, reading, and probably more things that I haven't figured out yet. I got this tablet to get on the internet at school between classes. It isn't as good as a laptop, but for about $115 I wouldn't expect it to be. The only problems I've had so far are (ironically) with the amazon appstore and the tablet has frozen up twice. The amazon appstore gets stuck, and you have to clear the data out and log back into your amazon account. The tablet has only frozen up when I was charging the device while using it. Lesson learned; don't do that. It charges nicely while off or in sleep mode; in fact, it seems to charge faster while in sleep mode. The battery does run down quickly with constant use but I can use it for about 3 hours a day and only have to charge it up at night. Don't freak because GetJar sucks and it doesn't have GooglePlay; get the amazon appstore and 1mobilemarket and you're set. You might want to download Avast for mobile devices; it scans downloading apps to make sure they're not malware and it's free! The 8 inch size is perfect for students; the tablet fits neatly into a backpack and is small enough to use even on those tiny desks some classrooms have.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "coby kyros", "Author": "mistydavis29", "ReviewID": "R1Z57AB705SHZL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its ok for a starter tablet....but not worth the money!

Tiny reset button easily missed.", "Author": "Justaconsumer", "ReviewID": "RWW0DN3UN40R6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I give it 3 stars because it seems to work great for the price. I replaced my Kindle Fire for this just to get Flash and other Android Apps. It loses a star because it doesn't access the Google Play store, but I found most of the free apps I was looking for on the Good E-Reader App store and some good paid apps on the Amazon Apps store.It loses another star because the tech support is lousy. After a week of using the tablet, it shut itself down (despite having a full charge) and wouldn't power up or reset when I followed the manual trouble shooting instructions. I replaced it with Amazon's return policy, and had the same symptoms a week after getting a replacement. Ready to give up, I called the customer support from the manufacturer, and they didn't have a clue. What neither the phone customer support rep nor the manual mentioned is that there's a tiny paperclip reset button on the side next to the HDMI port. It fixed my power problem. It was mentioned on their website, but it should have been in the manual and the phone support rep should have known about it. I shouldn't have had to keep digging for that answer.The Amazon App store is buggy on it. The Apps purchased from the store seem to periodically uninstall themselves randomly, causing you to have to re-download them. Every time I exited it or shut down the tablet, the App interphase disappears. I had to clear the data and re-register just to get it working again.  And then I had to manually delete the old registrations from my Amazon account online. One good thing about the bug, the purchased apps work despite the disappearing app store interphase problem, which was fine with me because there is no way to sign out of the app store or restrict my kids from purchasing apps once I've registered. I found that an older version of the Amazon app store worked on the tablet, but still didn't have a feature allowing users to sign out, so I re-installed the version with the disappearing app store interphase bug, just to keep my kids from purchasing apps. Amazon needs to fix both the disappearing interphase problem and include a feature to either sign out or restrict the purchasing of apps. The way the store works now, it only restricts existing in-app purchasing, but not the purchasing of new apps.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased the COBY 7048", "Author": "Robert M.

I must have read every review on Amazon about it.  Some reviews were good and some were just bad.  I was all set to purchase the Google Nexus 10, but the production problems, and even with the Nexus 7, kept me from buying one of those now.  I will buy one or the other in the next version.  I bought the COBY 7048 for about $92.  As cheap as they were listed on Amazon or Ebay.  It is what it is, an inexpensive tablet.  I have found that I can use the basic apps for email, documents to go, facebook, browse the internet without probles.  The WIFI isn't an issue for me in my house.  The size is what you would one handed.  It isn't heavy as I read in bed or watch a video on HBO.go or Netflix.  My only complaint is the battery life.  I get about 2.5 hours on a long overnight charge with heavy web browsing usage.  I would honestly rate this an OK tablet. If what you want is a basic tablet with a more than just a reader, then get this one for the right price.  I also bought the COBY tablet case.

The 1125 had been my workhorse tablet and this looks to be a good replacement. I appreciate the full-sized usb slot added, and having the latest version of the Android OS is great.The frame of the 1125 seemed a bit more durable as the 1042 has a more plastic-like finish in its construction, but that appears to makes it lighter and that is useful for a 10-inch tablet.  The loss of the 1125's various fixed button controls on the face-frame is no big deal as I often pressed them by accident when changing grips while reading.Resolution is not the greatest, but it works very well as a comic reader.  Perfect Viewer was quite fast in both display and taking in a large collection of comics, so the machine does not feel underpowered at all.Aldiko and other useful apps come pre-installed.  No significant bloat.As warning to prospective buyers, while Coby tablets lack the official Google apps and marketplace, the 1125 Kyros could easily have these added by just installing a few files, without need for rooting or any tinkering with the OS.  The 1042 however cannot install Google Play, the Gmail app, etc with similar ease.  I tested instead the GetJar app marketplace offered and found it quite lacking.  Several favorite apps that I had read GetJar carried could however not be found.  Sure, you can get Angry Birds, but no Perfect Viewer, no Cool Reader.  But the Amazon marketplace installed without problem, and so did the SlideMe and GoodeReader markets, so I could get all the free apps I sought.Navigation of the file system is a bit clumsy.  Unlike in my Coby Kyros 7 incher, the file manager did not show me in easy to access fashion the contents of my slotted 16GB SD card.  I had to go and look for it in the \"mnt\" folder.  Once the apps had the path saved it proved no problem anymore, but I wonder if my having just moved over the card from my older 1125 without cleaning its contents cause that.  Anyway, you have to go up the folders path but you can access the card, just know that it will shown as \"extsd\" in \"mnt\".More comments to follow as I work more with it.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coby Kyros tablets", "Author": "charlesbanks", "ReviewID": "R2DKZ3W8EH0W3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Coby Kyros 10inch tablets were purchased for gifts to grandchildren. they found them easy to set up and was playing within an hour.good so far.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "no bluetooth for link to keyboard but neat little device", "Author": "bloodhoundgrl", "ReviewID": "RHBZIMCA0Q2CB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "linked up to wifi fast, fun little thing to play with for the $$ but don't expect to hook it to a keyboard, your phone, ipod or anything because there's no bluetooth.

There's an entire thread on it at AndroidTablets.net and the step by step instructions have been posted: [...]You can play Minecraft PE and it works perfectly. No problems with video playback and I can give the kids more storage space by popping in an SD card. I haven't tried Netflix yet, but that should work.

For me, it was to slow. Trying to use apps like facebook or the internet browser was frustrating. Typing was even worse. I wouldn't recommend this tablet for a adult or teenager at all. Unless they don't want to browse the net or play around on facebook.I used this as an eReader for many months. It's perfect for such a simple task. Until the charge port broke off as I tried to charge it. It can be charged via USB but that takes three times as long.Eventually I upgraded to a faster tablet and gave this one to my three year old. I loaded toddler apps on it, as well as movies and cartoons for him. It's able to keep up with the toddler apps very well. Movie graphics are unbelievable. How can a tablet that plays movies this well, have a laggy keyboard?!This tablet survived many falls, being stepped on, wet and sticky hands and being thrown. However, it finally broke when dropped from a shopping cart.I would recommend this as a child's tablet. Yes ours broke, but it lasted over a year through two toddlers. No case protection. I originally bought the Nabi 2 and the ematic funtab for my children, the screens broke on those \" child safe \" tablets in under a week - in cases with supervision. The nabi was smacked to hard playing the drum app, and the Ematic was dropped, one foot from the ground onto plush carpet. They were the same price (at the time) and half the size, and didn't have the freedom this tablet does.Bottom line, its cheap, you can download a ton of free & cheap apps on this tablet and it will most defiantly  take abuse.

WTH??? another NOT. do not get it. it will have no port to plug it into. i ordered a male to male usb adaptor, does not work with it either. i then got a mini usb version of the same keyboard/case, does not work, as the actual port on the side of the tablet is MICRO USB. NOT mentioned in the description, it only lists USB. i had to spend countless hours online and read bunch of reviews suggesting the class of this port to figure out what it was - because the manufacturer does not say it. i even called them, and their agent would not classify the type of connection this has - she just said, it is one of their \"proprietary\" ports? WHAT????so, by far, tablet works surprisingly good for $100. deceptive USB connectivity in the description though. one of my tablets was already sent to the family member before i figured out the above, so the keyboard was a waste of money there... i still  have #2 here and am determined to  make sure the accessories i bought for it work - few more days before i get the replacement MICRO usb keyboard/case. i will post an update if keyboard works or not.UPDATE - 1/15/12Finally, i was able to find a keyboard that works with this thing. it is the \"DIAOTEC (TM) Synthetic Leather Keyboard Case with micro-USB plug for 7 inch Tablet Computers\" which i purchased from here for $13.

For me it does what I needed it to do. Read e-books. I get advanced e-books from writers in exchange for reviews and I was in need of a tablet so I wouldn't be forced to sit on my hard (now 10 yr old) computer chair and read. It reads all media files pertaining to e-books and I'm happy with that, but when I first got it I made the mistake of trying to turn it on without charging it as I was spoiled by my Samsung Galaxy player that was fully charged out the box. Needless to say I got the white screen of warning, not death, but it wasn't a pleasant thing to see. Upon charging it, it worked fine.But now the downsides. The WiFi sucks. Plain and simple. I was sitting no less than a foot from my router and it refused to connect. I had to go into my router settings and rescan channels for it to work. And let me say it only works on wireless channel 11. Anything else and it refuses to pick up the connection. GetJar also sucks. No apps what-so-ever. Again I'm use to having Google Play at my finger tips and the Amazon shop app does not like this tablet. Yes it works, but it's slow and clunky feeling as it chugs along. The main reason I got this tablet was because it was larger and had android 4.0, so let me also state that flash does not work on this tablet as Adobe is no longer offering it for anything above 4.0. You can't side load it either. Yes it will install, but it won't work.Now lately the screen flickers half of the background image from left to right before it settles itself. Despite the wifi problem I've ways of by-passing that and the screen flickering recently I'm going to keep it as I don't have the time to stand in line at walmart and return it and then wait 3 days to see my money back in my account only to have to go hunting again.

But after I connected after doing it successfully several times ,Coby screen would flash between homescreen and turn on usb screen rapidly till settled on home screen .Lower task bar on home screen showed usb icon and it indicated it was in usb mode .  My computer would not detect it as removable drive . No detection no matter what computer or usb cord I used.

I've not had much problem with previous models of Coby I've purchased . But I'm not sure what the issue could be with these 2 tablets,I'm no expert so I don't know the problem didn't occur because I did something incorrectly or there may have been issues with the USB port of my computers or even the cord.

Second, although there is no Google Play, my previous experience with the 1mobilemarket and the Amazon market was positive, so I figured I would install them and have access to most of the desired apps. However, both markets had issues installing, downloading and updating apps, you name it. The next flaw is that even without the apps, the tablet would crash on occasion from casual web browsing and had to be reset several times. The battery life would last around 3 hours of moderate use at best, depending on the level of brightness that was selected.
