Baker", "ReviewID": "R6NB867W8GQOF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I was pretty excited to receive this in the mail today. I did some research on the chipset and it seemed ok for a lower end model. The things that I liked were the fact it said it was supposed to have 1gig ram, 8g storage, and 1.5mhz dual core. All of these are untrue. I knew that the chipset wouldn't be because they are spec'd at 1ghz dual core, but the ram is half of what it says and the storage is only around 2gb. Luckily I had a 16gb micro sd card to install. Benchmarking in An Tu Tu got me a 6087 score which graphs it in between a kindle fire and a Samsung galaxy nexus. In comparison my Samsung galaxy S scored a 4000 and my galaxy S2 around 10000. Performance wise is not bad. My straight talk (att) sim card went right in and worked perfect. Im not in a 3g area to test that yet but phone calls and texting work fine. I would say app speed wise your looking just above kindle fire speeds. Wifi range is better than my other Chinese tablet (2-3 bars @ 35 ft with a wall in the way) I would say if this was spec'd with the 1gig of ram and 8gig storage it would be a 5 star for cost value performance. But storage is low and ram is average of every lower end tablet. Will update as I continue to use.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic for a phone........but..", "Author": "Amor C.", "ReviewID": "RT34JIM980BRC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "VERY fast delivery. Just plug sim n microsd card good to go. The coworkers were amazed  with the features and the price. People were saying its very similar to a Galaxy note. One noticeably item..sometimes tap any icon previous pages randomly show up. At times it froze. Imagine rebooting often. On the 3rd day it froze n when I turned it off  it never turned on again.

I have rated 5 stars, because this is a perfect solution for those,who doesnt want and/or has  much money for the smartphone. Really good device, highly recommended!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inadequate infrmation", "Author": "Joe H.", "ReviewID": "RUO6J2FNAOSOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Needs a GOOD user manual.

Great features, but to get most out it , root it (4share/YouTube) can show you how), and then petition it.  I got a 64G sd card and petitioned it.  This way it simulates more ram than the actual 4G and you get the max of 32G for your external sd card memory. I have over 80 apps on it and it is still quite snappy. Fanastic wifi response. One of features I looked consciously for was the fm radio.  In emergency situations, even if the cell tower is down or overwhelmingly busy...as they always are in emegencies...you still get news, music and red cross info...folks always seem to dismiss this feature, but if you can get it....DO.  :-) with otg...I have used external flash drives, mini mouse and usb hub.The not so Good:Crappy speakers, get a good pair of headsets or mini stereo speakers. Also, getting it to work with data on Consumer Celluar has been a problem, BUT, this is not just an  Epassion problem, Samsung, Motorola x and other android phones/tablets have similar problems.  I've set over 10 different APNs and have yet to find one that works for me, wierd thing is that over ten different apns has worked with the various android phones... it seems you just have to hit on the right combination.  IMEI  numbers are sometimes described as invalid when trying to get a sim card on line...but they do work, and I was able to get the At&t; online form to accept the IMEI number.Otherwise...wonderful tablet, I love the reboot feature...and inside settings, there is a quick bootup setting.  It is LTE ready, with upgraded viewing features in gmail.  Both sim slots work with tmobile and at&t.;  Command menu is easily accessible to check various modes. You can set data limits....once you get it to work:-)  You can schedule on and off times. The Kingsoft Office is one of its best feature....I like this better than Polaris, Doc to Go, and some of the other miscrosoft compatibles.... plus it's free.  Hopes this help.
