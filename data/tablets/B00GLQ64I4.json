It crashes at random while using the Android home screen or a web browser. I tried 3 different browsers and they all keep crashing to a screen that shows an \"Android\" logo, and then it reboots, which takes 15 seconds to 2 minutes. Sometimes I had to do a hard reset by a long press of the power button to get it to reboot.But some apps like Netflix seem to be immune - I was able to stream a Netflix movie at a high resolution for about 5 minutes without problems.There is at least one other customer with the same exact problem in the iDeaUSA support forums. No solution was offered by the company in the thread. The forum is not indexed or searchable by Google, so I don't know how many people have this problem.Pros:- The screen is bright and sharp.- Comes with a separate bluetooth gamepad, which was paired and recognized as a 'bluetooth keyboard\" by the tablet- Bluetooth headphones should work too - I didn't test this yet though- Netflix works- Wifi works, although the connection drops when the tablet crashes- Google Play is available and works. Available in the app folder. Has to be installed though. I had to try about 3 times until the installation worked- Amazon app store finally works, after about 5 unsuccessful attempts to installCons:- Random crashes- Not plain Android OS but has a custom user interface- All of the games that are compatible with the gamepad seem to be pay apps", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GLQ64I4"}}
