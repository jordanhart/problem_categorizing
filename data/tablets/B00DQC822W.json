I am also broke and needed a budget tablet.Pros:----------(EDIT)After tweaking everything a few times, I have found the best performance with these settings.- No frills CPU set to 48mhz lowest, 1.1ghz - 1.2ghz (any higher freezes often with no noticable speed increase)- Use Interactive governor (fast cpu scaling, quick to rev up and kills it when screen off to save battery)use- Use DEADLINE  I/O  (best for multi tasking, least crashes)With these settings and FAST REBOOT and task killer (do not set to auto-clean, just use the task killer widget and fast reboot to clean up ram when you pick it up) I have greatly improved performance.I also ran through many launchers and found Nova to be the best with least lag.-------Original ReviewDecent camera - 1.3mp is better than you think, and it doesn't only work with skype so ignore that reviewScreen was pretty clear. Not HD, but its not the poor low quality I was expecting. Looks fineComes rooted (but there aren't any roms I would recommend. Just use a CPU app and titanium backup / other root apps).Nice design. I was pleaseantly impressed. Pretty thin and lightRuns ICS with PLAY STORE - not all of these a13 allwinner tablets run off the real play store.USB host. Just plug whatever you want into it. It has worked fine with a keyboard and a mouse (yes, a pointer appears on the screen). I will be trying it with a USB hub and see if it will run a mouse and keyboard togetherUSB cannot be used to charge. It is HORRIBLY slow, and not reccomended. BUT, if you are in a pinch, a usb charger will let it stay on. So as long as you have a phone charger, you can at least turn it on.Good quality, but only for the price. If you want a tablet that runs like a thunderbolt or higher quality phone, go to the $150 - $200 range and grab a dual-coreCons:CPU! - Although these are all advertised as 1.2 - 1.5GHZ, they are not. Yes, the software will allow setCPU (or others) to set it to 1.5GHZ, but this is just overclocking a 1GHZ CPU. Which is why people are getting horrible battery life and freezing. Just set it to 1GHZ. its not really slower, because any higher than 1.2 freezes up and crashes.wifi speed isnt the fastest. all around, its about as fast as a 3rd gen ipod touch for web. Just about every phone I have had has been faster.Screen - My biggest complaint is the screen. quality was good, but the viewing angle is horrible. you have to hold it just right to avoid bad contrast. ESPECIALLY portrait viewing. You cannot look straight at it in portrait. And the screen is about 5% hidden underneath the black edges of the screen.Battery - I have only had it one day, but the battery life seems to be 3-5 hrs if you barely use it. I dont care to keep mine on the charger a lot. otherwise its about 2-3 hrs if you are lucky.(EDIT) After having it for a full 24 hours I have run a battery test from 100%. Battery has lasted almost 13 hours through the night. Up time was about 5 hours. down time (idle or in airplane mode) was 8. So if you set it down in airplane mode, it will do A LOT better.Laggy - music was skipping a little, if you dont constantly close apps, it will get pretty slow. And if you are downloading / installing an app, it can really ONLY do that. everything else slows up til its done. But again, its a budget tablet. And still does better than others in the price range (EDIT: after changing the cpu settings I posted at the top, lagging has almost disappeared. especially if I keep ram clean.Sound - you're gonna need speakers or headphones to watch anything if there is any noise around. pretty quiet. (EDIT: sound can be improved by downloading speaker boost. dont boost more than 40% or you might blow the speaker.)All in all, I like it enough to keep it. Its not great, but I just use it to browse the web and netflix and a few other apps. Nothing major. If you don't have $150 to buy a tablet, this is for you. Just remember its a budget tablet.

Let me start by saying I was weary on this tablets as soon as I opened them because the screens were already scratched up like they had been used we though it may have been from the manufacturing of them. First tablet came on great, downloaded apps netflix worked which was one of the 2 most important apps for them.However the second game the kids want so they can play with us will not allow an account to be created because the google location services cannot locate it for some reason. Also when attempting to log into an account already made for that game it says there is already an account linked to the tablet even though we factory reset it multiple times.Second tablet came on great. However the touchscreen is constantly having issues. I could see it showing as if it was being touched somewhere, no where near where we were actually touching. This was leading to frustration and getting no response from the tablet without hitting power button putting it to sleep then waking it up again only to have it do the same thing 3 minutes later. Attempted to use the stylus it comes with and same result no response half the time without putting to sleep first.Third tablet....This tablet would not even turn on at all.This is an aggravation, this is the 3rd tablets we have tried since Christmas and the kids still do not have their christmas presents.

They both work fine. Download of Apps is easy and the apps it comes with are very cool and all work.Reviews mentioned batery issues, some things we noticed and settings we changed that helped extend the battery run time considerably are as follows: When you first get the Zeepad the instructions say to charge them for six hours before the first use. Make sure and do that but when you connect the charger the plug that goes into the tablet will not go all the way in until the plug dissapears into the charger input so don't try to force it all the way in. When it \"clicks\" it's in as far as it can go. There will be a little of the silver part of the plug still visible that does not go into the tablet charger port. If you force it you might damage the unit.  After the first charge the instructions say charge for only 4hours. Do not overcharge and it would be good to set a timer so that you don't over charge the battery. The battery it comes with can be charged and discharged over 2 thousand times but it does not like to be over charged. Also don't not store the unit with a 100% charge for long periods of time, these new batteries like to be stored with 50-40% power only. If they are left to sit for a long time with 100% charge it can damage the structure of the batteries.  Rune time: The main killer of the battery run time is,  the screen brightness. Lower it as the screen is super bright and at only 7 inches they cannot build it with a very large battery. Leaving the screen on the super bright setting eats the batteries pretty quickly. The next big juice hog is the wifi. If yu are not going to be downloading apps, surfing or sending e-mails turn on airplane mode which turns off wiifi. Leaving the wifi on all the time keeps the table searching for the wifi signal and commnicating back and forth with the source and that eats the battery. Once you set it up and are using game apps ( what most kids do ) you dont need the wifi for them while they play apps anyway. If you do these two things the battery should last a bit over 2-2-1/2 hours on a 4 hour charge. Not bad. I wont get into the tech aspects as others have covered that pretty well in other reviews but considering these cost a lot less than other brands the main thing I was concerned with was, if it actually did what they were supposed to do. They both have worked fine and side by side to a samsung galaxy they donwloaded apps at just about the same speed as any other andriod tablet or i phone. The build quality is pretty good considrng the price. If you are looking for some \"special ops\" military grade hardware this is not the unit for you but if you need something to use daily under normal conditions these are pretty nice. The tablets are impressive and are worth the money. They come from overseas so shipping is not super fast. If you need them for a birthday order with plenty of time to give them a chance to ship from the factory.  If something goes wrong I will update this review but so far, these little tablets has been a very good purchase and the kids love them. Hope this info helps, The battery is not an issue but I addressed that more as most of the negative reviews had to do with them and that was the main thing I worried about when I ordered them. Happy to say the batteries have not been an issue so far.

There was also a micro USB cable included and we used that to charge the systems for a while but that quit working.  I contacted the company and they were willing to exchange the tablet after shipping it to China.  They also said they'd fix the problem with the charger and sent me another identical adapter.I believe this company is trying to do their best but they don't have an understanding of the US Market, I'd purchase from a different supplier.I also thought the tablet had two cameras, it only has a front facing one.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "My daughter loves it!", "Author": "Kenneth Welles", "ReviewID": "R2S6WO62D8ZQAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome product for the price!

Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day.

The capacitive touch screen is much better than the cheap Archos tablet I had (which quit after a year).  I watched part of a netflix video on the zeepad and it ran well, but the dark scenes didn't show up well due to low contrast.  All other applications I've run were plenty colorful and vibrant.  The processing speed seems better than other cheap tablets.  One little quirk, but so far I haven't been able to keep the time consistently accurate.  It goes back to some factory programmed time zone (maybe China).  The battery doesn't seem to last more than 2-3 hours with constant average use.  Also, the actual screen size is a little smaller than most 7\" tablets but not so much it matters.  The unit does resemble a large GPS navigation system in looks (which doesn't matter to me).

The hyped 3 hour run time (which isn't all that great to begin with) is in reality more like 20 minutes or less.  Charging takes awhile and the charging power supply gets warm so it seems to be working, but the battery is weak.  (wifi on notifications off, screen brightness set to ~80 percent)The screen resolution looked pretty good until I loaded some pictures and test patterns into my Ainol Elf 2 (another bargain priced brand X tablet) and compared them side by side, the Elf wins hands down.  The Zeepad does have a somewhat better viewing angle, but the display looks \"flat\" compared to the Elf.I never could get Netflix to work.  (and hadn't gotten it working on the Elf either until just recently)  Unfortunately my wife has the Zeepad now so I can't try messing with Netflix, but I suspect the newest Netflix app will work on it.If you have problems with Netflix Google for \"com.netflix.mediaclient_3.0.0 build 1010.apk\" That is the latest Netflix app and seems to be working.  No need to register with an app store and it can be found on the net for free.I  haven't decided what to do about the battery problem.  I can replace it for $10-15 but that option isn't going to be open to most of the people that buy these things.12/6  My wife has had it all the time so I don't really get a chance to play with it.  (I got it as a test bed for learning how to update android, etc.)  I'm getting her a Lenovo tablet for Christmas...  Anyhow I'm noticing the screen on hers is scratched pretty badly, my Ainol, in comparison, still looks pristine (and I'm not gentle with it).  I think we are seeing the difference between acrylic and polycarbonate judging by the scratches.Battery life is still bad, but she can get ~1 hour if she turns off the wifi, and app updater (which needs wifi to work).

But I haven't used them.It is very cute, and for what I paid I am happy.  But it seems like the RAM is not really sufficient for some apps.I can run kindle ok, which is what I really want to use it forSome embedded videos in websites don't really play right. I think because there is not enough memory in the tablet.  I installed google chrome and that seems to work better than the default browser.When I start apps, sometimes the screen goes black... but if I wait about 20 seconds I will see the app interface.Once apps are started up, they run ok.To make the tablet run smoother I disabled notifications, that helped a lot.I am happy with the purchase so far.  I might update the review in a few weeks.For 60 bucks, it is REALLY nice.  I can get away from the computer and still do some things. I love the pink.  I bought a pink cover for it.Filemate ECO 7-Inch Tablet Faux Leather Case with Push Button Clasp - Magenta (3FMTC225MG7-R)The cover fits great, so if you want a way to protect your tab, I suggest that one. I didn't really want a keyboard case for such a small tablet. The on screen keyboard is nice. If you plan to be super productive for business, this is not your tablet because it's not powerful, but it is ok for light recreational use like kindle reading.

I am dealing with setting them up and downloading the games and such for the kids, because I want to control what they see.  Here are the issues I have noticed so far with these tablets...1.) Response time is ridiculously slow.  You hit \"Install\" and it MIGHT flip screens 30 seconds later.  If it doesn't it will \"time out\" ... Timing out happens consistently.  I don't know how the games are with response time, I haven't had the patience to even try.  The kids haven't complained, but they are just happy they have a tablet.2.) The screens aren't very sensitive.  I realize that screens can be too sensitive but I shouldn't have to jam my finger on the screen to get it to respond.  Very annoying.3.) Low quality graphics -- honestly, I didn't expect much from a $70 tablet, but just thought I would let you know. It's no ipad or Kindle with the graphic quality.4.) Battery life. .... It. Dies. FAST.  I was just TRYING to download a game on one, it gave me the \"You're at 14% notification\" and literally less than 5 minutes later when I went to plug it in, it was already down to 9%. This is supposedly a brand new tablet.  We literally got it in the mail yesterday. (Please note that we've had the other one for several weeks, so I'm not writing this review without having used this.)5.) Very cheaply made.  The Power Off button feels like it's going to fall off it's so loose. The camera is crooked and my daughters pad is coming apart in the middle. When I say \"very,\" I do mean VERY cheaply made.6.)  The \"User Manual\" is supposedly written in \"English\" however, it doesn't even make sense.  Here is a sentence from the \"User Manual\"  \"#3 Check the music file wherther damaged. Try playing other music, if the file have damaged may lead to serious noise or hop sounds.\"  ---that is letter-for-letter.  Huh?If you're wanting a serious tablet.  Avoid this one.

Thi is specifically about the tablet itself.  In a word... OUCH!I didn't expect much at all for this price.  I have young kids who really wanted a tablet for games etc... I didn't want to get them something that would make me hurt too bad if THEY broke it.As a techie I am aware that my personal standards may be a bit high but I tried to keep my expectations in check for the purposes of  the intended use.  a 5 and 6 year old.I ordered two of these thinking that less than 80.00 a piece for a \"tech toy\" can't be horrible.  Boy was I wrong.  The quality of the propduct build was about what I expected, plastic, and cheap plastic at that.  The screen, while I didn't expect it to be up to par with something like a Nexus 7, I didn't think it would be practically unviewable in portrait mode, and low visibility from certain angles even in landscape mode.I knew it would be slow, I fully expected (thus appreciated) the lag in functions.  The battery life however was a shocker.  One was dead in about 2.5 hours and the other made it about 3 hours.  Not acceptable no matter how inexpensive it was.The other thing that I noticed is that one of the tablets (though they were identical) did NOT have Zeepad branding, it was a generic of a generic, nothing to cry about since as I said before they were identical in every other way.The packaging and contents are also of a generic caliber.  One came with earphones and a cheap sylus, the other came with a cheap stylus/pen and a screen protector.Another thing that really bothered me was the jailbroken state they are in.  Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the company. I can't say that the software was \"stolen\" because Android is largely open source however it did seem to be a bit janky and illegitimate.One tablet was in an Asian language with little hope to change it to english, fortunately I'm used to android and it's icons so I was able to make it through.Overall it just wasn't worth it for me to keep them, Got them on Friday, sent them back today.  Decided to get my babies a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 instead.  They are worth the extra hundred bucks a piece :).If you order this your mileage may vary depending on your expectations of course.

I waited for the package to arrive and it did, well ahead of the other recommended things by amazon.Unfortunately, while attempting to place the writer's, diaries and other apps, I quickly discovered it is not zoned for a worldly market. It is a Pan Asian product that has a time zone setting as far as turkey, and cannot be placed on the Proper timeline. This, I can already see will be a problem when the web based apps attempt to SYNCH. This is the only reason i subtract 2 stars. No thing should ever be a \"Surprise!\", when you cycle through it's features. No, it should be foretold ahead of time and guaranteed to work (in the western Zone).

They fixed many things and this is just another fix needed.______-------Added------_________After ordering a keyboard, I found that the recommended keyboard/case did not work with it.I also found out that the settings on it are very limited and people, beware, Like the spam mail in you In-box, this has many \"go-to\" adds on many of the apps there.so If you are going to give to children, make sure they do not have CC information nor access to it.If you could tther it, even better.

My must-have feature was the ability to do Skype calls and it worked pretty well. It comes with the real Google Play Store, so it would be easy to install your favorite applications. Here some points to ponder:- Only front camera for video calling. The resolution is pretty decent, though the camera application was very basic. Fixed installing another app from the Play Store.- No GPS.- The items on the screen \"stretch\" when tablet is held vertical. No big deal, but I think that means it would be better to use it only in horizontal orientation.- Also, when transitioning (moving the tablet) between horizontal & vertical, the screen gets a little crazy swapping from vertical to horizontal. It calms down when stabilized.- Highly recommended to install the adhesive screen protector immediately after opening. Got some scratches for normal use.- Tested Skype and Youtube and both worked fine.- I couldn't test the ports or the USB cable. Adhesive screen protector and a stylus are included.EDIT: My brother told me they are having problems leaving Skype enabled all the time. I don't know what happens but it shows as if in disconnected status. Also, it seems the volume of the speakers and the sound quality is very low when in a call, compared to a Galaxy Tab 2. I assume it would be better to use headphones.EDIT2: Now that I have it back and using it everyday, I can say that is slow. I guess this is related to the small memory (512Mb). When browsing, switching between applications, or using an app constantly, it gets slower. Sometimes I get the msg saying that an app has stopped, but I just choose \"Wait\" and soon it gets back again. I've installed a memory management app so when the memory usage falls below 25% I run a \"quick boost\" to recover control. I'm using it mostly to watch Netflix in my bed (with headphones of course, as I said the speakers are awful), and it works pretty fine. Also, on the PROS side, is pretty tough; it has fallen a few times, and stands the beats as a champ. I tried to use a microSD card to free storage space, but it couldn't recognize it, don't know if the beats have something to do. The battery life is normal and the wifi reception is good.In summary, again, is pretty decent for the price but as it needs some maintenance, I would say is not recommended for a non-tech person.

So after charging it and getting it boot up she started to use it again(for 2 days).  Then she kept bringing it back to me because she didnt like the way the movies looked and that they kept stopping.  Thats when I started to play with it more. I noticed that the batties didnt last long at all.  3 to 4 hours on avarage.(if you are not watching netflix)  The screen has to be viewed head on like an old computer monitor and freezes all the time when using Nextflix.  I have seen better screens on cheap smart phones.  And this thing is slow!!  I though that the thing was gonna be A LOT faster than this.  So when a 4 year old can pick out things she doesnt like on a tablet like an adult would that should tell you something.  Maybe the Ipad spoiled her but either way I am shopping for another tablet for her Christmas present.  I'm going with the Kindle fire or the Kurio 7 this time.

My daughter who was 9 at the time started downloading apps - Youtube, Sugar Crush, Instagram, Angry Birds.... welllll......................skype didnt work too well, You cant see the whole game of sugarcrush - but Pandora and Youtube work just great (as long as its charged) I would next time keep my money and get a better name brand - but I guess now my 3 year old can have it...", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!

However, it did charge and I've downloaded several apps and have been using it. It's the perfect size (to me) because it isnt so big that it is cumbersome and it isn't so small t hat it is annoying. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold a charge for too long (about 2 hours). So as long as you remember to charge it, you are fine.

My wife and I debated getting our 4 year old a LeapPad for educational games, but I was able to win out by pointing out the cost of many Android games: free.The screen has a small viewing angle and the resolution isn't the best, my daughter loves playing the ABC and puzzle games we downloaded for her. I have not purchased any software for her, but the free games on Play are awesome. This thing even runs Candy Crush (just in case you were wondering :).I wish this didn't have a proprietary charging end on it (it has a USB port, but that is not for charging) but my other tablets also have proprietary charging ports so it seems to be standard for them to make a different port.The box was full of goodies: charging cable, usb adapter (so you can plug in full sized usb items to the tablet), a stylus, AND a screen protector. They really delivered on the packaging.This tablet is really a bargain for the price, it wont win any processor speed awards and it can hang at times but if you are in the same boat and looking for something to entertain your children during long drives or you want to use some type of electronic game/learning system this is priced to be in your top 5 list of purchase considerations. On the other hand, if you are an adult looking for something to surf the web/look for jobs/ do any type of professional work with, I would suggest a different more powerful (and likely expensive) tablet.Willie-B", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for kids", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R1HJVM1FB2GU6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is great for my grandson with downs syndrome.

So they have been through more than six months of regular use. For $70 these are pretty good. They are definitely not iPads, Google Nexus, or Samsung Galaxies, but they are a good buy for your average 4 to 8 year olds. At this point, three of the four are still working and two of the four are working well. They work well for playing games, reading ebooks, watching movies, or taking silly (albeit low quality) pictures of oneself. They do all this just as well a Nexus.About two months ago one the tablets stopped charging, the battery still had a small charge (not enough to power up) and the charger was working. Something stopped working in the charging circuits on the motherboard. So that one is no longer usable.All but one of the chargers has stopped working, I think the wire or plug is too weak and broke, they worked if you wiggled the plug. Also the charging receptacle in the tablets is weak, one tablet's does not work anymore. And the USB port of another does not work. This has probably as much to do with the kids jamming and yanking on the cord, as anything.Fortunately, the USB connector does charge the tablet, so even without any of the chargers you can still use the tablets.The third tablet is very slow to react when tapping on the screen. This is most noticeable on the home screen, but also when playing games, though not as bad.Very odd, seems more of a software based problem than hardware.The fourth tablet, so far (knock on wood) is working fine no problems at all. Battery life has never been that great, two hours or so max. It hasn't diminished in six months so they are good quality, just not that big. Keep a smart phone charger on hand and they will last as long as you've got gas in the car.Overall, I am pleased with these tablet. Especially for younger kids, when you don't want to throw a lot of money down the drain (literally!) Trust me, I know, before they got these, my wife's Nexus, ended up in the toilet when two kids tried to grab it at the same time. Fortunately, it still works fine.We know they can take care of them now, so we will upgrade them one at a time, as they stop working. So far only one has had to be replaced.

I tried charging the tablet and nothing worked.  Needless to say, I was less than pleased.

So not only am I currently out the money I spent on the item, I am now out an extra $26 because I was sent a defective product.

I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew knowing full well it was not going to be a top of the line tablet . It accesses the internet on WiFi only no Ethernet port that i observed . It is relatively fast but again we only talking 512 mb ram so your not talking lightening fast . It has a decent camera with it and also a built in microphone , both as i have said are decent for what your paying . Its only really bad downfall is it's battery life . Even fully charged its battery might last you an hour depending on what your doing with it . It seems to use more power using the internet than the games. Possibly because of it being on wireless .i am assuming you will not be able to use this in a wireless hot spot because you do have to set it up to detect your wireless configurations on your device at home .

There is no customer support. We bought two of these (one white and one pink) for our children to use as e-readers but the i-reader (as it is on this unit) doesn't work. It freezes the unit trying to load then after a couple of minutes a pop up comes on asking you if you would like to stop or wait for it to load. I have waited for over 10 minutes for the i-reader to load with no luck.  The i-reader shows it loaded and is taking up memory it just doesn't work for what ever reason. Good thing it uses Android, I loaded the kindle (for free from Amazon) on it and now can load books through the kindle. I also use the local e-library so the kids can check out books online. The unit is not the fastest but for the kids it is good. It would be nice if there was a customer support or at least more information in the box for use of this unit, or they could load the information on a tutorial on the desktop.  But over all it seems to be an desent unit for the money. We don't let them use it for social media or e-mail so I can not comment on that. They do use it for games and internet research and it apprears to be doing fine for that, so I would assume that the e-mail and social media would be fine as well.  It streams the video's well from you tube. My kids watch the Looney Tunes video's when they finish thier reading (30 min. a day only).  The picture is clear so vidoe is good. The outter case or shell doesnt' seem to be to durable, so I am glad that they have not dropped it yet.  We also bought the case with an external keyboard so it is in that most of the time for extra protection.

Although it took some tinkering in the settings, eventually I got it to unfreeze enough to download apps. (Instructions indicated doing something, but the print is so small and pictures even smaller that even with 20/20 vision I couldnt figure out what it said). The touch pad isn't always all that responsive...but for the most part, it's good enough for a 12 year old. I wasn't using the stylus that comes with it at the time..but perhaps the response from the touch screen would have been slightly better if it had.Ran into some issues of it 'not responding' and not accepting my request to shut the system off to try and fix the problem - eventually I did get it to come out of it's funk and it worked just fine. But it does freeze a bit. Runs a little slow, but with only 512MB of Ram, I chalk that up to the fact it's been a while since I've worked with something with such a slow processing speed.It's a decent reader - the kid prefers the weight and size compared to that massive Nook she got from another relative for Christmas. The fact that it is PINK is possibly the biggest plus. It does run most Google Play apps - so that is a plus since they are mostly free.  The front facing camera is pretty poor quality, so that feature for Skype is there, but know it's about as good as webcams from 10 years ago. If you're kids aren't very patient - might not be for them as it does seem to freeze if you're scrolling through the screens...but I like it over all and would even buy myself one for the reader alone.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "HappyMom", "ReviewID": "R2WKR04QRHS1SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product arrived today.

The manufacturer apparently knew this and included a screen protector.  However, the protector is of very low quality and peels off and/or develops air bubbles after a few days.One of the units had some problems with the internals and if you put your finger on back it in a specific spot it would create a distortion pattern on the screen in the front.One unit was DOA.  The touch screen had a dead spot (which happened to line up with the \"S\" key on the onscreen keyboard making it unusable.  In general, the touch screens are of low quality.  All of them have manufacturing defects like embedded dust particles in the plastic (that become evident after installing the screen protector)  indicating they were produced in a low quality facility.The power button on one of the units has already failed and no longer powers on or off the unit.The screen is a critical feature of a tablet and this one fails miserably on all counts.
