Get what you pay for.", "Author": "Andrew and Brittany!", "ReviewID": "R2LKUUF9UXXZZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As far as a cheap tablet, this is a great tablet. It is cheaply made,  but everything checks out good on it. Works fine. Only problem that I can see with it, is the white plastic hard shell on the build on it is poorly designed. You can see the build in L.E.D Light threw it. Other then that, the tablet works fine so far, great for what I bought it for. I bought it for my little girl, who is 3 years old to play on. Wifi works fine on it. It is a little harder to navigate than others, but you want find any other tablet out there with the options this one has, for the price. Over all it  is a great product. If any other problems occur I will be sure to leave another review as soon as this happens. I plan to purchase another one for my self. Something you don't have to worry about.. Cheap, dependable, and a lot of functions. What much more could you ask for at this price?", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "good little tablet", "Author": "J.Aragon", "ReviewID": "RO8P2PLP7XANJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this item becouse of its great price and its good for all ages im getting another one for fathers day great little tablet", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tablet", "Author": "Eonia Griffin", "ReviewID": "R1NG445KA1QQV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I choose this tabet cause it was the right size for my brother.

This was my first tablet purchase i am in college so the price was perfect but then it actually came in, It was cute and what i expected i was really hoping for the best and then i turned it on it was slow! but the worst part the screen kept flickering the whole time i tried everything to stop it but it must of been dropped during the packaging or defective from the beginning, So now i have to print a label and ship it to amazon, wait untill they receive it then eventually get my refund and it sucks because i was really looking forward to this tablet, I would recommend finding a more pricey name brand tablet which is what i'm going to do!", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good!", "Author": "Sabina Granado", "ReviewID": "R159RFBTWWPYUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent ProductI recommend it 100%, came as it described, very high quality at a fair price, I would return to buy without hesitation", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "good board", "Author": "julio guillen", "ReviewID": "R33W2V9G2B82HC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am satisfied with the quality of the table due to the price but I must admit I expected more.
