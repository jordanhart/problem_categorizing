Cameras didnt work correctly had upside down issue. contacted seller and said it was a system error. Would off loved to be able to replace so i can have a totally fuctioning tablet and would of rated 5 stars and good buy but i wasnt able to. They did help me thou and refunded me part of the total cost. Tablet came with all cables and they sent an extra gift in there which i was happy about. Packing was really good. Apps work well and tablet itself is really good maybe i got that one in 100  with a defect meaning the cameras. They both work but have a mirror upside down issue as said. Quality of cameras is same as other andrpid tablets so i wasnt really looking forward to using them. Arived before est time. Very fast as a matter of fact. Seller was helpfull and answerd my concern really quick.

It  was purchased as a gift, but I checked everything out on it so far so good....The tablet is very responsive . The bonus keyboard works  well. The size is just right , dual cameras lets you take videos which is a big plus. the resolution is clear, The tablet does expand to 32GB, I'm very happy with the tablet and looking to get one for myself. This is a quality tablet and what makes this excellent is the seller Goldengulf.. I have nothing but pros for and no cons, and to boot the price is great.. After A liitle more use I will update this review. Well my daughter bend my charger and I contacted Mr.Li about purchasing another one, and he sent out another one without question. This is and awesome company that backs their products. I was told not to charge via usb as that would hurt the tablet. the tablet is going strong... The family loves it the wi-fi is strong. The playback is good . Your not paying  for an I-pad but you get the same functionality for a third of the price. I only down is the battery life but it is exactly as the product stated so i can't complain.....", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product at a great price!", "Author": "Jack R.

Easy to use and to figure out and that's a good thing, because the manual that comes with it is in the smallest print I've ever encountered for a owners manual. Between the size of the print and the lightness of it, it's pretty much impossible to read with out a magnifying glass.I got a decent router from 'Wally World' to replace the piece of 'shitako' that I brought from Amazon. With the router up I was able to get this unit on line quickly and it preformed well. The upload time I thought was good, but I am sure not fast enough for gamers, but for what my wife needs it for surfing the gossip sites on the net, listening to music and such its just fine.This unit is exactly what you are paying for a working basic entry level tablet with a 9\" screen. If that's what you want why spend 2 or 3 times as much, just to get something fancy that you won't use half of?For young kids and seniors I say this is the unit you want.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet!!", "Author": "Josue", "ReviewID": "R3CP81WGJO69DT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far it's been working smoothly, I'm happy with it and I would recommend it, I received it way before the date expected.This product is awesome and that is why I bought TWO of them, one for my daughter and after seeing its performance I decided to buy one for myself. My daughter accidentally dropped it and broke the outside screen, she was sobbing so I asked the manufacturer if I could buy one from him because for me it is worthy, and I'm a computer geek, so I know what I'm talking about. His response was immediate and so kind. Both the product and the service and help are a top quality. I highly recommend any of you, trying to find a real bargain not to skip this one. You will not regret it!!!And I'm honest and true to this review.Thanks for the opportunity to be fair and give this product and its manufacturer the credit they deserve.Josue Iaheta", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet pc for the price and some more", "Author": "Leo Koach", "ReviewID": "R3OTVLCDWXEEWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my tablet pc, which was delivered very fast... and played with it for a while. This is my 5th tablet pc, all Androids, and response of this one is very nice. Quick image and website load. I am a photographer, I am more interested in colors, and unfortunately colors are not as vivid as I wanted to be, but for this price, I got what I paid for. Even this tablet pc has the worse color on the monitor, I still give 5 stars! I know most of them much better than what I received, I probably got a defected one, which is not bothering me at all :) Other things, such as G sensor, processing time are very very good. Did not come loaded with apps, I wasn't expecting to. I started to download the things I want. I prefer to receive my tablet pretty much blank to be able to customize it without start deleting stuff.Charges very quick. I haven't used enough to know how fast it drains the battery, more than one hour is enough for what I need from this machine.Overall, if you are not thinking to run your office from a tablet pc and don't care about the screen resolution... I say go for it. Very inexpensive, I might even order one more for a backup ;)Forgot to mention, it has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back... which I was waiting to get a tablet with front camera with low low price! so, here it is :)", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Drennen Blocker", "ReviewID": "R39N6QS7AFN6VA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what was hunting for.

Brand new with normal use and fully charged, it went off after 38 minutes. Second, wireless signal is low even if I sit close to the router, making it hard to get connected sometimes.
