{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nexus 7 Updated", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R2TPE6S6DPRB7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google \"Meenova.com\" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google \"Install Flash On Nexus 7\"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10\" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like \"do I need an umbrella today?\" Ask \"Weather forecast (your location).\"Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri \"what are you wearing\" gets her to say \"Why do people keep asking me that?\" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the \"NAvFree USA\" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying \"in 100 meters, turn right.\" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for a reasonable price", "Author": "sidroy", "ReviewID": "R1JUOLVBTVKIPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update:---------Google just announced a newer version of Nexus 7, making this product obsolete. Some of the highlights are -  - A nice bump in the screen resolution - 1920 X 1200 (323 ppi)  - A 5 MP rear facing camera  - Ships with Android 4.3, which has a restricted profile feature that can be used to block in-app purchases and limit access to content.  - The usual improvements in processor, memory, weight, speakers, wireless, etc. You can find the details on the official website for Nexus 7.  - The 32 GB model is $269 now. $20 extra for the new model is well worth it, in my opinion.Full Disclosure:-----------------Let me state upfront that in the last 3 years, my wife and I have purchased 4 iPhones, 4 iPads, 1 Mac Mini, 1 Apple TV and 2 Macbook Airs for ourselves and extended members of the family. I cannot review this product without comparing it to the iPad 2, which I've been using for the last year and a half.Motivation:------------We have an 18 month old son who needs to be entertained with videos and apps while he's being fed and we have an upcoming trip to India during which we'll need to keep him busy during the flight and transits. Here are our requirements -1) We needed a tablet that is more portable than the 16 GB iPad 2 that we currently have so that it's easy to stuff into my cargo pants or jacket and pull it out quickly when required.2) We needed more than the 16GB storage to store his favorite videos because we may have intermittent access to WiFi, at least 32 GB.3) When he's not using it, I would like a tablet that's easy to grip for long hours of reading.Choice:--------Based on these 3 requirements, I restricted my choice to the iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 32GB.Here are the reasons I decided to go with the Nexus 7.The 32 GB iPad Mini was almost $195 ((429 - 249) * 1.0825) more than the other 2 when you include CA sales taxes. It is at least half an inch wider than the Nexus 7 which makes it slightly harder to grip if you have small hands like me. The areas where it's better - slightly bigger screen, iOS app store, rear camera were not that important to me since we already have an iPad 2 and I don't shoot photos or videos with tablets.I chose Nexus 7 over Kindle Fire because I use a lot of Google services and wanted a tablet with a more open ecosystem. I can read Kindle e-books and listen to music using the Amazon Cloud Player on the Nexus 7. We have a Netflix subscription so the loss of Amazon Instant Video was not that important.Review:---------Here are the things that I liked about the Nexus 7 -1) Jelly Bean (4.1) is really good. I had played with Android phones and tablets before and they used to lack the smoothness of iOS. I think it's pretty close now.2) The higher resolution HD screen is great for reading and watching videos.3) If you are heavily into the Google ecosystem, it's a breeze to set it up.4) Android in general is more customizable with widgets etc.5) I was able to download most of the iOS apps that I use frequently with some exceptions. More on that later.6) I liked the auto-update feature on Android. It's an option that you can tick while downloading an app. It automatically downloads updates to that app.7) I liked the notification system and realized why iOS decided to replicate it.8) I also liked the shortcut for looking at running apps and a simple flick deletes them.9) It is easier for my son to hold compared to the iPad 2. He also has a habit of pressing the home button and exiting the app on the iPad 2 and then complaining about it (he's only 18 months old) but fortunately he can't do that on the Nexus 7.Here are the things that I thought were missing -1) There are fewer tablet optimized apps on Android. The quality of apps on iOS for iPad is definitely better. Flipboard was good on Nexus 7 but Zite lacked the polish of the iPad app. NYTimes was good. The usual games like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope were more unstable and crashed a few times. I installed Talkatone to make calls through Google Voice and it worked fine. The usual ones - Netflix, Skype, etc. worked fine. I noticed some lag while using Zinio to read the National Geographic.2) I'm still not used to the Chrome browser on a tablet. It seemed to me that accessing bookmarks on the iOS browser is easier. I found all my bookmarks already synced on my Chrome browser but accessing them requires multiple steps.3) It is slightly heavier than the iPad Mini but not by a lot. The iPad Mini is still ahead in terms of external design and looks but the cost mattered more to me this time. I may have paid $100 more for the iPad Mini because of the iOS app ecosystem advantage but $195 was a very high premium for an optional device.Conclusion:-------------The Nexus 7 is an excellent device irrespective of the price but the price makes it easier to appreciate it even more. If your requirements and expectations are similar to mine, I would strongly recommend it. I bought this product from Office Depot but I felt that the review might help others make a decision.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cream of the crop.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Shanti\"", "ReviewID": "R34LVWG6JUTUBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fist off this is not an Amazon purchase. Sorry Amazon, but it was cheaper at my local department store. Second, I will not compare this android tab to a ipad!!! Thats just stupid, IMO. Oranges and apples. One thing is all apple stuff cost more for comparable products. I dont buy over priced apple products.Ok as for the Android tabs, this one is a winner. The new processor is lightening fast!!! I multitasked, played Netflix, and loaded the thing and its speed held great. Its touch is very responsive. Its res is great too. For the buck, 249, at most department stores and electronic stores, it beats the competitors. The only way to get better is to pay more.There is no expansion slot but with 32 gigs its not really needed. You can Mini-USB it to  pc for file transfer with no prob.It rotates to landscape with no need for an app.Jelly bean is a winner and all new Androids have it so that doesn't need a review. The tablet is made well. It feels sturdy in the hand. The off button and volume are located nicely on the side but toward the edge so they dont get in the way.Its a small tablet with a small voice so sound isnt great. The speakers are tiny and dont carry much.But...plug in quality earbuds and the sound is great!!! MP3's sound the same as on my Sony MP3 player. Streaming movies are clear and sound fine.The tablet streams youtube and netflix with no problem at all.There is no rear camera. I dont know how the front facing camera is because I never use it. I didnt buy it to take pics nor to use it as a webcam.Being a google approved product apps are not an issue. Once you change your permissions in settings for other apps, it excepts Amazons apps too.The battery is good. About 3-4 hours video streaming, heavy web surfing and downloading, a good 6 with web off, playing games and reading. (Turning off the auto brightness helps save battery. Indoors I keep it adjusted to extremely low and only manually crank it for outside.)In sleep mode, I don't know how long the battery last as it barely moves after hours of sitting. I haven't had it sleeping long enough to compute it. It moves a little sitting over night but not enough to matter.Wifi is great!! Gets a full signal from my router better than my xoom. My xoom will have a partial full signal icon while my nexus has a fully filled signal icon, at the same distance from the router. It finds the signal quick too when I turn it on after having it off. No lag.I like that its uses mini to reg USB for charging as any phone AC charger works too. No need for special cords. It also charges connected to a netbook, laptop, or pc.The feeling in your hand is nice. The back isnt slippery, it has just a little bit of grip(texture), enough to help hold yet be smooth, but not slick. I never feel like it will slide out of my hands. Its weight is fine to me. Not so light it feels like hollow cheap plastic junk and not to heavy it feels like a brick. To me its just right.So for 249 and the processor it has and the gigs....its a big bang for the buck.I cant find anything neg with this tablet.If you want tv hook up and a ton of extra frill then plan to spend a lot more money for a tablet pc like the larger xoom, thrive, or galaxy. For the basic 7in tablet, this one beats the rest in the line. And no, Android doesn't support flash. Thats an Adobe issue not a product issue. As for apps, between Amazon and Google Play you can find anything. You just have to know how to look for them in the store app.And unlike kindles, and cheap end tablets, and all pc's, no bloat ware and no in your face ads on the out of box system.So I recommend the google nexus7, 32 gig. Its just a really nice, well layed out, well made, fast running tab.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome -- while it worked", "Author": "C. J. Puckett \"chelseacharming\"", "ReviewID": "R3PNDGPF8ZN5SY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the past month, I have owned two beautiful, zippy, but ultimately defective Nexus 7's.The first worked very well for about three weeks. I enjoyed it. It handled everything I threw at it, the screen was vibrant, the battery life surprisingly good, etc. Then one day it had a meltdown. Understand, I was very gentle with this thing. I never put it loose in a bag or dropped it or even set it down hard, so I was quite surprised to turn it on and see the screen go haywire (I'd describe it as multicolored snow.) It never recovered and I was forced to return it. I then bought a replacement from my local OfficeMax, and it did the SAME THING right out of the box. If you google \"Nexus 7 Won't Turn On,\" you'll see that unfortunately this is a common problem. The factory reset does nothing, and if you open the back to poke around, you'll void your warranty. I can only assume that it has some serious hardware issues, and until these are addressed, I'll be trying my luck with another tablet.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is this the Next-generation of Computing?", "Author": "Tomi", "ReviewID": "RUOTWUX2G5VX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this product with Saturday delivery, because I was spending my Spring break in New York, and wanted this prior to my leave. I lost my iPod touch 5th generation in a cab a few days before;I became very sad and wanted to find a replacement, one which I know wouldn't be lost or as light. In this article, my goal here is to not provide a \"full\" nexus 7 review, but to allow you, the reader, to see several angles to it's use and why it could be a good product choice.The day of purchasing this, I also looked at the iPad mini and a few other tablets. I have used the Mini before, however the price of this, which is about $20-30 cheaper than Apple's choice, provides me with twice the storage and a 3G sim card slot. (more on that later) So, the iPad mini was out of line, though I can understand why some might find Apple's interface a bit simpler.I did not want to buy another iPod Touch, because I realized how light they were. While this could be an advantage for some, I realized how much easier it is to lose one. Personally, the Nexus 7 is a great product for the purpose of having something you are aware of all the time. It is light, however not light to the point where you cannot feel its existence in your pocket. While it will not fit in standard jean's, it will fit in a jacket or a larger article of clothing. For me, I keep the Nexus in my winter coat pocket for now, and as spring approaches, I will most likely find another place for it. The advantage to this is that you don't always need a backpack for carrying it, and you have the luxury of a larger screen.I chose the 3G version for many reasons. When looking at pricepoints, this is only a little bit more expensive than the 32 gig iPod touch 5th gen, and that could be thought of as a more direct comparison. Having 3G means that I don't always have to find a Wi-Fi access point, and can easily access information anywhere I am. For example, I used the voice search feature of Google Now to find a taxi in down-town New York easily, all without having to fish out a Wi-Fi spot.I went with T-Mobile for 3G service. For $25, I have 1.5 gigs of data, which could be thought of as unlimited, since T-Mobile will throddle you down to EDGE speeds (about 384 Kbits/sec) after you go over your limit. While At&t; has better coverage, the data plans are more expensive and can end up being quite costly, especially since it is charged per gigabyte you go over.There is no sim that ships with this tablet, but it is unlocked. It does have \"4g\", though this is *NOT* LTE - 4G here indicates HSDPA+ speeds, which is more like 3.5G (at least that is how the status bar reports it). Still, these speeds are great for even watching Netflix or streaming higher quality Spotify. EDGE is not as good, but can suffice if you're out of your data cap.As I stated, the 7 inch form factor is portable enough to fit in a pocket, yet the larger screen does allow for better web viewing and more space than a 3 or 4 inch device. The battery life is also excellent. I was on a 12 hour trip back home, and listened to Spotify the entire way through 3g;When I arrived, my battery life was at 21%. Admitedly, using Chrome feels more like browsing on a desktop thanks to the design and layout, though the smaller screen can be a bit limiting for full-screen website content. I also have an iPad 2, and compared to that the iPad feels super large now. Still, if all you want to do is casual web surfing, this is a great device, with enough screen real estate to facilitate most pages. The hardware does not feel cheap at all for what you buy. While it is plastic instead of aluminum (which are what Apple products are made of), it Is very nice and firm plastic. I also like how the device does not get cold when you hold it in your hands after not using it in a while. Aluminum, while could be seen as sturdy, does get cold quickly and tends to stay below room temperature.I find using Android to be more comparable to a computer experience than iOS is. You can customize it more with what you want on your home screens, and apps themselves support more functionalities. Take Spotify, which supports queuing on Android but not on iOS, a feature which is also present in the PC version.I do see potentials for this great tablet to one day replace most aspects of computing. Because it is a Nexus device, it has the advantage of getting the latest Android updates right away. You can certainly tell that the quad-core processor is very fast, and performs really well with opening apps quickly.Overall, this is a great Android tablet, and the best for what you spend. It Is cheaper than the iPad mini, and has 3G, double the ram (1 GB instead of 512), and double the storage. It is also bigger than the iPod touch, and includes 3G, making it a bit more enjoyable for movie watching and using it as a computer-type design for work. Consider getting a Bluetooth keyboard, should you wish to get actual typing or work done, though.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great 7in tablet!  (if you have the time to root!!)", "Author": "gadget-o-holic", "ReviewID": "R10RNVPDMLFF9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overview:=============================================For a bit of background, I've owned several android phones, iPhones, iPads, etc...  I've owned the original nexus phone, HTC EVO, iPhone (1, 3gs, 4s, and now 5), iPad 2 and 3 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version.  Right now, for mobile devices, I own an iPhone 5, iPad 3, and Nexus 7.I was interested in the Nexus 7 because having owned the Galaxy tab 7.7 (and consequently selling it) I wanted a tablet to use as a carry around tablet that's light and easy to handle.  The Nexus 7 perfectly fits my needs... it's reasonably fast, easy to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and clear.  I believe this is the best 7 inch tablet on the market as of right now.  The iPad mini will probably sell more due to it being Apple but this Nexus 7 definitely holds its own.  Also, as an FYI, I bought my Nexus 7 at Sam's Club... much cheaper than Amazon at least for now!The Nexus 7 compared to Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version=============================================Overall the Nexus 7, in my opinion, is superior to the Galaxy 7.7.  The only areas where the Galaxy 7.7 may out do the Nexus 7 would be in the screen and the fact that you can get a 7.7 with an option to use it as a phone.  That being said, the positives of the Nexus 7, for me, far outweigh the better screen on the 7.7 and the ability to use the 7.7 as a phone (which would seem pretty silly to me anyway)...The Nexus 7 positives:=========================- much easier to hold in one hand- easier to read because text is sized more appropriately (on stock software)- battery appears to last much longer than my 7.7 while idling- receives updates to android instantly while with Samsung you'll be waitingThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version positives:=========================- better screen on the 7.7... blacks are much blacker to those who care- ability to use the 7.7 as a phoneNexus 7 compared to iPad Mini=============================================As others have mentioned before, comparing the Nexus 7 to an iPad mini is like comparing apples and oranges since they are separate ecosystems/etc...  I'm not going to get in to the pro's and con's of Android vs iOS, but if you had to compare the two tablets just from a pure usability perpective, I'd say that the Nexus 7 edges out the iPad mini slightly (for me) because the Nexus 7 is slightly easier to hold with one hand compared to the iPad mini.  When I hold an iPad mini in one hand, my fingers struggle to get all the way around the device to where I feel like I have a comfortable grip.  With the Nexus 7, however, my hand fits around it perfectly and I feel like I have a good grip on the tablet even with a Blurex Ultra-Slim Case for Google Nexus 7 inch Tablet -- With built in Multi-Angle Stand (Tangelo) + Premium Screen Protector Film attached to it.Nexus 7 Pros=============================================- Great one hand holding (with my hands), even with a case attached- Awesome for gaming (I play Shadowgun all the time)- Easy to root... you may not do this but I highly recommend it as it opens up a ton of possibilities like using the tablet with a playstation 3 controller for gaming (via SixAxis Controller app) or using the tablet with an OTG cable to attach flash drives/etc for more storage- Instant updates to latest android software... it took forever for Samsung to put out even ICS for the 7.7 when I had it- Great battery life!  I've used my tablet with light to medium use for the better part of a week without having to re-charge itNexus 7 Cons=============================================- Not too many compatible chargers... iPad chargers won't work with it and many chargers are hit and miss... if you get one, make sure to keep the stock charger close by.- You won't get ALL the advanced features with this tablet without tinkering with it, which can be a pain for some people...  rooting takes time and so does getting the other 3rd party apps working for using the OTG cable.  This is somewhat expected with android devices for me though...- Have to side load many apps since they are listed as not compatible in app store (nba game time, hbo, etc...)CONCLUSION=============================================I've been very happy with my Nexus 7!  I patiently waited as rumors swirled around a 32gb release for the Nexus 7 and I'm glad I did.  Many of the games/etc can take up a lot of space so having the extra internal strorage space definitely helps out.In any case, if you have time to root your Nexus 7 and tinker around with it a bit, it'll be like having a PS3 AND Media Player on the go!!! With the use of the SixAxis Controller app, I can use a PS3 controller to play many games from google play, and with the use an OTG cable and apps like stickmount I can attach flash drives or hard drives and load my music and movies on them.  While the iPad will always have it's place for me due to my heavy investment in to the iOS ecosystem with itunes match/etc, I'd never be able to do half the things on it that I do with my Nexus 7 and for that I highly recommend it!!!UPDATE (11-12-2012... many comments about expandable storage so updating with instructions)=============================================I noticed another reviewer say that there is no expandable storage.  Out of the box, yes, there is no expandable storage as there is no micro sd card slot but there is a way to get expandable storage!!!  Please see below for instructions...Instructions:1. Root your device  if you want to use Paragon or Stickmount...  (use google for this as there are many instructions out there on how to do it in less than 15-20 mins)2. Install Paragon exFAT, NTFS & HFS+ (requires root), Stickmount (requires root), or Nexus Media Importer (no root required as another poster commented)... I use Paragon personally as I need access to HFS+ drives (mac).3. Get a less than $2 OTG cable, you can attach ANY USB flash drive or hard drive.  I got this one. eForCity Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter Compatible with Google Nexus 74. Use any flash or hard drive and plug in to your device5. Paragon and Stickmount should automatically recognize the drive and mount it6. Use any file explorer or media player to find your files... each app will mount in a different place but generally somewhere under your sdcard mountI have my Nexus 7 working with a SanDisk Cruzer Glide 128 GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ60-128G-B35 and Uspeed USB 3.0 Card Reader 8-in-1 for SDXC, SDHC, SD, MMC, RS-MMC, Micro SDXC, Micro SD, Micro SDHC Card - support UHS-I combined with Transcend 128 GB SDXC Flash Memory Card (TS128GSDXC10E).  That's over 256GB combined of extra storage!!!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's near perfect.", "Author": "Max Harry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2J4HUZSEC01OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be a bias review about my experience with this tablet.This tablet is now my favorite Android device (until a better 7\" Nexus come along). It used to be my Nexus phone, but with this tablet having the same stock Android experience on a larger screen, while still being relatively portable gives it a much better usage experience. It's slim and not too heavy so I can hold it using one hand for a lengthy amount of time, which is more flexible compared to a 10\" tablet or other 7-8\" tablets that are too wide to hold with one hand. Now the only thing I use my Nexus phone for is making calls so I don't have to spend more money upgrading my phone.STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE ON A 7\" HD SCREEN:The 7\" formfactor of this tablet is perfect when being paired with Android 4.2. I feel Android 4.2 interface is not designed best for 10\" tablet yet, however it work just right for a 7\" screen. The screen is 720p and the pixels are just small enough so fonts are sharp, it is possible to do extensive web browsing and reading on this tablet.With a clean stock Android OS, it's better optimized for performance so the interface feel much smoother and faster than competing tablets with the similar spec, which tend to come with skinned overlay and bloatwares. This tablet is more for people who like to fiddle with their device and customize it the way they like. If you know exactly what apps you want to install and how to customize your Android, it is much more flexible than all the competition.Some people will complain about lack of microSD slot. There are couple of ways to deal with the limited storage issue. Google Music have a cloud feature to let you store and stream up to 20,000 songs. For videos, you can easily create a UPnP server in your home to stream videos from. For example, install XBMC to your PC, add videos to your library, then enable the UPnP server feature. You can also buy an Asus router that have UPnP feature, enable it, then connect your harddrive with videos to it. Lastly, on the Nexus 7, install \"XBMC for Android\" or \"VPlayer and its UPnP plugin\" to stream the videos. Make sure you Google for the official \"XBMC hardware accelerated test-build\".LONG TERM VALUE:When you buy a Nexus branded device, it means you will receive the latest Android updates directly from Google and sooner than all other non-Nexus devices. Google will support the software for a long time. Technically Google only promised to update a Nexus device up to 18months from its release date, but more likely if the hardware of that device is still capable, they'll continue to update it.NETWORK INFO (read before purchasing):-Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" (P3100), this device is not capable of making direct phone calls (you will have to use VoIP apps). It's still possible to get network data and do text messaging.-If you intend to use this tablet with T-Mobile, you'll have to use their 'Mobile Broadband sim card' with the plans available for it. However, using a T-Mobile prepaid (phone) sim card will not work as there will be no data, only texting will work.-Right now, if you're in the US and want to get a data plan for this, T-Mobile Mobile Broadband plan probably the best choice if you get good signal in your area. T-Mobile have gotten rid of contract plans completely, ie. the official T-Mobile store and website do not provide any plans that require contracts. The Mobile Broadband $40 option will get you 4.5GB of 3G and throttle down to 2G after that, with texting and tethering. In the future the Mobile Broadband plan should also cover LTE (however the Nexus 7 is not compatible with LTE).-T-Mobile also offer a prepaid option called Monthy Pass, but I highly do not recommend this since it do not offer good value compared to the Mobile Broadband plans. For example, the $35 Monthly Pass option only give you 3.5GB of data, with no texting nor tethering. Also since it is in the \"prepaid tier\", you will get lower priority in cell towers connection, in other word your download speed will not be as fast.CONS:-NO TV-OUPUT: There isn't a dedicated microHDMI port nor MHL support so no chance of physically connecting it to a TV.-SCREEN QUALITY LUCK: My previous Nexus 7 WiFi unit have a great screen, but this 3G unit I received have very obvious graininess and color banding.-NO REAR CAMERA-Not full USB OTG out of the box: You can connect mice and keyboards, but to mount USB flashdrives you'll need root. Various other Asus tablets do have full USB OTG support out of the box.Note: A minor issue when I received it, it had no charge and the only way to turn it on was to charge it for a while, then hold the Power button for over 10seconds. Some people also suggested plugging it to a charger while holding Power + Volume Down buttons.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product, but an important warning!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2X7AQQX475A09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 is incredible! It is super fast, maybe faster than my laptop, and incredibly user friendly. Also the battery life is almost too good to be true. It reports about 8 hours of solid use and I must say that so far I haven't seen less than 12 hours. I don't play games or stream videos constantly, but I use a ton of apps and web browsing, so I was incredibly surprised by how well it stands up. I also recommend purchasing a SquareTrade warranty for accidental damage. I got a 3 year plan for like $80...well worth it when you consider how easy it would be to drop this think down some stairs or in a puddle.One important warning: The seller I purchased mine from did not include the AT&T; SIM card. If you buy directly from google, it comes with a free SIM card with an app to activate a wireless plan. The seller never said they were or were not including it, I just assumed it would be included. Just a fair warning to others!Pro Tip: Try downloading Pocket. It is an offline web browser that lets you save web pages for viewing offline. I particularly like Cracked.com, and this is the only offline web app I could find that properly saves their pages.

And boy was I NOT disappointed!This is a beautiful tablet and has everything one would want or need in a tablet: speedy processor(s); beautiful screen; easy to maneuver once one gets the hang of it (I am a former Ipad 3 user, and have more familiarity with the Apple OS). Android is a bit different, yet similar enough to pick up the basics quickly. I now am totally familiar with it and proficient in its operation.Yes, it's smaller than the Ipad, and that is a beauty and a curse. It is very lightweight and easy to hold for long periods of time. I have a bit of trouble seeing the screen at times, due to aging eyes and the sometimes-tiny print that can appear on some websites. Still, this thing is a beautiful creation, and I bet Google sells a ton of them.One advantage is that the Android OS updates almost instantly once Google releases it. Carrier devices (those sold by Verizon, etc.) can take weeks, months...or never...because the carrier has no interest in helping you prolong the use of your current phone...they have an interest in getting you into a NEW unit. I have already had two updates; first to 4.1 and now to 4.2.In fact, I have become so comfortable with the Android system I have moved to a Android-based phone (a Samsung Galaxy Note). For a former Apple guy, this is huge.All in all, this is the best small tablet in my opinion.

We are still happy with our old Fire and our newer Fire HD but we are happier with Nexus 7, our third 7\" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for about the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive. I am sorry but I can't yet compare the Nexus 7 with the mini iPad because, while I did play with one for a few minutes, I didn't have a chance to test-drive one for any significant period of time.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest.+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core= 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on both- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on NexusNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM so 16/32GB should be sufficient for most of us. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore (they both have it but, of course, the Fire's implementation is much better because that's basically where you are most of the time you are using the Fire= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.2 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. There is no doubt that it will be upgradeable to future versions, at least for the next couple of years. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android will ever get a major Android upgrade even though Amazon may tweak it a little from time to time.+ Chrome, most other Google apps. Chrome happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.2 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature. Our daughter has been using the new Fire HD ever since launch and she's used to it by now.PRICE (advantage Nexus)The Nexus 7 is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration especially when you consider that fact that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using both a Nexus 7 ever since launch and the same is true for the Fire HD. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a clear personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Android Tablet and a good value", "Author": "M.

I also own an iPad3 and I used to own another Android tablet, the SKYTEX SX-SP715A4 SKYPAD ALPHA 2 ANDROID 4.0 TABLET 4GB WEBCAM ALUMINUM CASE which was a dismal and slow tablet compared to the Nexus 7. In fact I was so disappointed in Android because of my experience with the Skytex tablet, that I swore off Android. That was until the release of Android 4.1 and the rave reviews it started getting. Then Google releases the Nexus 7 hardware that also stepped up the game. I took the plunge and am happy to say that Android is now up to the task and this is coming from someone who's been using IOS in iPhone's and iPads for a few years now.The closest real competition to the Nexus 7 has got to be the new iPad mini (which is not Android. It uses IOS6) and I suppose it's fair to put the Kindle Fire HD in there too although it is not a \"pure\" Android experience. There is one big advantage that the Kindle Fire HD has over the Nexus 7 though and that is the ability to play Amazon Prime Videos. You have to jump through hoops to do that on the Nexus 7. It is possible but you must download a Flash capable browser such as Firefox Beta and you must also install an appropriate Flash apk. I've done this and Flash will now play for me quite well. Who knows what security breaches are being introduced by using a less than current version of Flash however... so this \"solution\" is not for the faint of heart.I do not think it is fair to directly compare the iPad Mini to the Nexus 7 because they are different in many ways, not the least of which is the Operating System. The Nexus 7 uses Android (Jellybean as I write this) whereas the iPad uses IOS6. Suffice to say that having used both and having enjoyed using both, they each have strengths and weaknesses.The Nexus 7 has a very nice form factor. The case is not as substantial as some other devices but it is a nice case and has a somewhat textured and grippy plastic back. I prefer the textured surface over something that is more smooth and slippery. If you are using a third-party case then the tactile differences become less of a consideration. The Corning glass screen is a gorgeous, seven-inch 1280\u00d7800 high resolution display. It is bright and sharp. The screen is surrounded by a thin aluminum bezel. Very nice looking. When you grip the Nexus 7 firmly and give it 'ol \"lets see if I can twist the case\" it may creak just a bit but overall feels pretty solid. Not as solid as an iPad Mini, but remember, it's a whole lot less expensive than an iPad Mini too.As for processing power, the Nexus 7 with its quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor gives some muscle to video playback and overall performance. I notice very little sluggishness or stuttering due to being under-powered. There is even a rather robust 1GB of RAM in the Nexus 7. You also get bluetooth for extra versatility in throwing sound to bluetooth speakers and a whole lot more.Initial setup of the Nexus 7 was easy. It walks you through the process as you can see in my video review. You'll get the most utility out of the Nexus 7 if you have a Google account and begin using all the various Google services... Google now ties all of their services together and the Nexus 7 makes it really easy and fun to use them.A new feature that works exceedingly well is the Google voice search function, The Apple IOS equivalent is SIRI. I believe that the Google version has a better, more natural sounding voice and it is quite speedy. It's very useful.Every aspect of the Android Jellybean operating system is vastly improved over prior versions. Google has finally got the performance of Android up to the level of competence that can really compare favorably with IOS. I'm sure it will only improve as time goes on. Apple still has the lead in number of apps but Android has most of the major bases covered and the Android app marketplace is expanding rapidly. I would say that the number of apps available for Android vs Apple is no longer an important consideration on whether or not to get an Android tablet.Streaming video is wonderful, I don't get any stuttering and the display is beautiful to behold. Even the sound is not too bad given that it is a 7\" tablet with little room for a speaker. Yet it produces sound that is fine and when you plug in headphones, it's awesome sound.I'd suggest getting the 32GB model since there is no memory card expansion slot on the Nexus 7. So if you get a 16GB model and run out of space, you're stuck unless you go with a USB OTG solution. At least with the 32GB model, you've got more memory to begin with and you don't have to mess around with attaching anything external. The Quad-core Tegra 3 processor makes the tablet feel really speedy. Screen paging is excellent and I do not notice any appreciable stuttering or slowness in navigating or app launching.The Nexus 7 is a significant step forward for Android tablets. The OS is stable, more powerful than ever and performs smoothly. The version of Android now shipping with the Nexus 7 at the time of this review is v 4.2.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet as well as most Bang for your Buck.", "Author": "stu", "ReviewID": "R4JJM5ZLHMO6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Google Nexus 7 32Gb last week. It is amazing. I already had a Kindle Fire first generation and was ready to upgrade my device. I did my homework and then went to look at the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire 8.9 and the Nexus 10 and 7 and the Ipad Mini as well. When I tried the Larger Tablets, I didn't think they were portable enough for what I wanted. I was used to the size of the Kindle Fire and liked it.  I tried the IPad Mini but I didn't like the speed and display resolution of the device. Maybe when Apple upgrades the Mini with a faster processor and screen resolution, it would be worth the price, but I feel it is too high and not a good value now. I then tried the Nexus 7 32GB and fell in love with it. It has all the speed you want and amazing resolution. It did not hurt that is was the best value as well.I have always had Android Phones and am very familiar with the platform. As I use Google Drive for work, I felt that the Nexus 7 could also be used when I need a smaller device for work. I am able to put presentations on the unit and share them when I do not want to take out my computer. I can also get all of my Kindle Books via the Kindle app. It is the best of both worlds.

Good luck folks.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "It Just stops working, whenever it wants? Next one was great 4 six months. grrr", "Author": "MuseGlance \"MuseGlance\"", "ReviewID": "RWBFV231CY4E5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Modified below.  I was very excited to try the new mini type tablet. Traded in my HTC EVO for the IPhone 4 this last phone renewal. I was sad to be without my Google apps. I love evaluating all operating systems, so when I decided to get a smaller tablet to fit in my purse, The Nexus 7 with Jelly bean sounded like the way to go.I have been a techno geek since the Timex 2K and have always updated my system quite frequently. I got this at Walmart, a nice 32K one, so I would stop maxing out memory for my audible books and apps; and I gave my husband my large IPad 1.This has a beautiful little screen and I downloaded an adorable fish animated desktop that moves with the menu. Very impressive. Got a fabulous case for it that I will add the link to eventually here on Amazon. I confess I was lost initially with the new operating system, still trying to figure it out actually, but attribute that to my inability, not the system. Got on Google Play and bought a tv series season and was enjoying watching those during down times... However...I have had it since Dec. 7th 2012 it is now Dec. 25th and it has stopped mid video, with more than 25% power still on, and the screen goes black. It looks totally dead? I press the on off button to see if I can toggle something but there is no way to know if I just turned it off, or turned it on, because there is no action visible on the screen.The first time it did it. I was ready to take it back in thinking something must have broke inside?  Then I picked it up a half hour later and it came back on and appeared to work fine. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it was uploading an upgrade or something that took the system down.Tonight in the middle of the Google play series it did it again ...twice? Push buttons like crazy.. wait.. try again... then it came on? The little circle went round and round and then it said the processing system is not responding do you want to wait, report or discontinue. First time I waited.. second time I thought I would discontinue and try rebooting. It is once again dead.. totally dead.. no sign of life.. not just the app, or the connection but the tablet.. a piece of metal and glass.I love new giggie-gadgets, but they have to at least pretend to work.  As much as I have already bought games & movies I am going to have to take this back. I don't know if I got a bad one or this is a ubiquitous problem with the new operating system.So beware. Not everything is perfect. SighI got a replacement , and there was a world of difference!!!Apparently I had got a bad one. This connected perfect and fast, downloaded all my former apps within a half hour. So what took me days on the old broken one zipped thru.So far I have totally enjoyed this and not sorry I replaced it. Will check back in in a few weeks if anything has changedApparently the bad one was a fluke.It is mid April 2013 and I love the Nexus, lots of apps tons to explore. I changed my review from 3 star to 4 star. Didn't give it 5 star only because of the first very demoralizing broken one, but if this was truly just a fluke... this item is 5 star.---- Aug 10, 2013Ok I have now had this since December. The bad one, then exchanged for a good one and guess what. The same exact thing is happening. DO NOT LET the battery run out all the way. Now when I try to charge it, I will see it come on then it tells itself it is powering off. Thought maybe there was an update. Later it came on, then off, then on.. all during the time it was suppose to be charging. I took it off the charger and it is dead. I can't awaken it.

I really wish I had an ipdad mini...UPDATE 2/19: They found my Nexus after 7 days and it was repaired withing a few hours.  When we got it back after a 7 day shipping, no kidding, it had the same problem!  I think they may have just sent it out without any work.  I spent 45 minutes waiting for a supervisor who said I should mail it back (for a 3rd time.) When I asked about her supervisor, I was told that they just weren't available and maybe I could hear from them in 2 days or so.  $250 and it is a paper weight.  I want to cry that I have wasted $250 for nothing.  I have owned this for 84 days and it has worked for 34.  This is the only product for which I have ever left a negative review.UPDATE 2/13:  I shipped my Asus back to the repair center, and Fedex says it was delivered 6 days ago.  No one at Asus can find it. Anywhere.  What a mess.  The guy said sorry, but they have a lot of tablets to repair.  I bet they do...UPDATE 2/5:  So after paying over $20 with insurance to send the nexus back, I received it and the original problem had been fixed.  However, while fixing it, they damaged the wifi connector. (This is something I found several instances of on the web.) Prior to the \"repair\", I could use the nexus all over my house, and even say 2 of my neighbor's networks.  Now, I can only use it if I sit next to the router.  Also, they have an RMA Status page to check how your repair is going.  Mine never showed up as having been received even though I had delivery confirmation.  I will be shipping my nexus back to Asus again today.  Again, buy an ipad mini.ORIGINAL: I would have written a glowing review during the first month like so many on here but then the tablet got a black screen while using it. After trying to get it to turn back on for more than an hour, it powered up. Then I couldn't see anything but the battery icon charging. After another hour, it restarted but it no longer would charge when the unit was on and still won't. The touchscreen periodically stops working as well. Now I have to send it back for repairs which take 14 business days plus transit meaning that I will be without this for almost as long as I have had it.If you google \"nexus 7 won't charge\", you will see tons of people are having this problem after they have the unit for a month or two.

If you're considering buying a nexus, please don't be scared off by the negative reviews. Many of them are about 'problems' that aren't even really problems at all.First, I'm giving the nexus 4 stars because it's fantastic, but the battery charges painfully slowly and the charge doesn't last as long as I had hoped (I'm spoiled by my iPhone which goes for days). The only other negative I can think of is that it is, in fact, an android tab (of course, this is personal preference only)... I hate android, but I'm also a college student and simply can't afford an iPad. This was the next best thing. Seriously, that's saying something. This tablet has incredible functionality, is lightning fast, has a great display, and is the perfect size/price. Goes right into my purse and isn't cumbersome. Easy to use for those of us with tiny hands, and feels well built and durable. I especially love the rubberized backing. A nice amount of memory which makes expansions unnecessary, and its always good to have a device from each side of the fence so you aren't missing out on anything :)Some people are writing negative reviews about their tablet not powering on, and they then assume it's useless, awful, and must be sent to a repair center far, far away....No. This is PERFECTLY NORMAL. You have let your battery die. The tablet is in deep sleep. Charge it for an hour and then hold down the power button for... Oh... About forever. Really, it was about a full minute before mine finally decided to wake up, and I had to try it several times. It'll do all sorts of scary stuff, crackling screen, blank screen, etc. All you need to do is charge it, then wake it up (painstakingly), and then it will work like new again. You can find this answer on the FIRST PAGE of results from a Google search for 'My nexus won't turn on'. Lesson to take away from this? Don't let your battery die while the nexus is powered on. Turn it off if you won't be using it for awhile.Also, your headphone jack isn't broken. The jack is really strange, but it works. You have to push the headphone cord in until it clicks. Yes, it will feel like you're going to break it. Keep pushing, I promise it will snap in and work beautifully.Please note: Asus customer support is useless. They will not tell you these things, they will tell you to send it in for repair. The guy I talked to was probably the most useless CSR I've had to deal with outside of AT&T.; I guess this is another negative, although unavoidable anymore... Any customer service is bad customer service when it's all been sent overseas. You want to talk to someone who speaks English? Buy an iPad. Otherwise, you're going to have to troubleshoot on your own.To summarize, this is a great tablet for the price. It has some quirks, but all you have to do is ask Google. There is always someone out there who knows the answer. These are NOT faulty devices... They just have faulty owners. Ironic though...

I looked at numerous reviews of the Nexus on Youtube, as well as videos for its two primary competitors, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, and the store-centric Amazon Kindle Fire HD.  In the reviews, the Nexus 7 consistently rated as a better tablet than these two other competing tablets, which influenced my purchase decision.  The Nexus even compared favorably to its pricey cousin, the iPad mini.  I didn't want a larger iPad sized tablet because of the bulk, and I really didn't want a tablet that was primarily a conduit to an online store.  I don't plan to buy much in the way of movies, TV shows, books, games, magazines, newspapers, and apps.  Instead, I prefer to transfer my own content to the device, utilizing its 32 GB flash drive (even though only 28 GB of it is useable).I have indeed successfully transferred content from my PC to the Nexus, and the transfer process itself was handled easily with the USB connection, where the Nexus was treated as just another drive.  At first, most of my videos wouldn't play on the device until I discovered the existence of a free app on The Google Play Store called \"MX Player\".  After I installed it, all was perfect...or almost perfect.  All videos, regardless of format are playable with MX Player.  Yet, when many videos play on the Nexus, they stutter every few seconds, which is a problem that was mentioned on one of the Youtube video reviews.  The fault does not lie with MX player, because this happened before I installed that app.  Apparently it's caused by an annoying internal Nexus problem which I hope will be corrected in a future update.Many of the notable features of the device rely on the wi-fi being turned on, and this really drains the battery.  Google's claims of nine or ten hours of battery life are somewhat exaggerated, because I'm lucky if I get five hours of usage per every three hour charge, even with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off.  But I have to admit that those five hours of usage are a joyful and surprising delight.The Nexus uses the Chrome Browser to access the web, and it works just fine.  Surfing the web is a breeze, and it's easy to pinch and flick your way through a web page.  Gmail also works great, and there is a separate app for Youtube.  It's not much of a surprise that the Google Nexus is geared to all things Google, and having a Google gmail account really is a necessity.  The Nexus comes with many default apps, and my plan is to try them all and delete those that I won't use.  The Nexus presumably has better screen resolution than the Kindle Fire or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and it also has the latest version of Android, called \"Jellybean\".  This is good to know, but there are a lot of operations on the device which are still a mystery to me, and I can attribute this to the fact that this is my first tablet, and my first experience with Android.  I'm a Windows guy, and it's a challenge to let my fingers do the walking instead of using a mouse, and to type on that tiny on-screen keyboard.  Many of these new features and operations encountered in the Android realm on the Nexus beg for explanations which are not covered in the Nexus User Guide, and there is no support chatline to ask for quick answers.  The Nexus-Android Forum has been some help, but this device is very slow in yielding all its secrets to this Android newbie.But having said all that, holy mackerel, what a machine!  It is oh so sweet to use, and it is so very glossy looking, and so sturdy and solid to the touch.  I have to ask, how on earth can they sell something with all this versatility, functionality, and miniaturized technology for such a low price??  Even the packaging it came in is top quality, with a great functional design.  With the exception of battery life, this little machine is truly an outstanding device.In addition to the free \"MX Player\" app mentioned above, I've found four other apps which are very useful, and three of the four additional ones are also free. \"Groove IP lite\" allows you to make simple and clear (wi-fi) phone calls, tied to your Google gmail account, and the calls are totally free.  Microphones and speakers are built in to the unit, and the sound is clear and crisp.  There is an app called \"Camera Launcher for Nexus 7\" which allows you to take photos and videos with the 1.2 MP front facing pinhole camera.  While this tiny camera is primarily for use with Skype, the photos and videos captured with it are really quite good.  An app called \"Kingsford Office\" allows access (with editing, no less!) to Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF documents either saved to the Nexus, or in your cloud storage. All four of these apps, as mentioned, are freebies.There is a fifth useful app (for sale at the Google Play Store for $2.99) called \"Nexus Media Importer\", which, in conjunction with a small USB OTG adapter, can display content from a USB thumb drive.  So who needs an SD memory slot?  The Nexus doesn't have to be \"rooted\" to utilize the adapter and app, and in theory, you can also attach peripherals, such as a mouse or keyboard, to the adapter.  In my opinion, all of these apps and the adapter should be part of the Nexus package.There are many native features of the Nexus that impress me, but two of them stand out.  The first is google search with voice, which I've tried, and is quite remarkable.  You can ask google search any search-type question in your own voice, and it answers instantly in a female voice which is very human-like, and it usually displays a diagram of the item asked about.  In a YouTube comparison test between Android's voice search and the iPad's Siri, Android won hands down.  And when it can't answer the question in voice, it displays the google search responses.  The second feature that impressed me is the \"Type text by speaking\" feature.  As you speak, it types what you speak on the screen.  And if you enunciate clearly, it does so accurately.  Of course, this technology has been available on PC's for years, and I even owned such a program, but it was very inaccurate.  To see it run accurately on a small tablet is very impressive.Bottom line:  This is an extremely remarkable and versatile little machine, with features and potential up the kazoo.  It is a sweet, sleek, and classy device, and like I said...almost perfect.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love at first power up", "Author": "J. W. Mullins", "ReviewID": "R1M5OFBJZPI8QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my Nexus for almost a year now. And even though I loved it the day I received it I wanted to wait before reviewing it so the 'new tablet smell' had worn off. As a comparison we also have a Kindle Fire HD and a Ipad 2 in our household. And while I'd prefer not to I don't think I can write a proper review without a little comparison to the other two.There are two major reasons I went with the Nexus instead of the Kindle or Ipad, price and Android. At the $200 mark the Nexus offers a lot of bang for the buck. It is thin, light, has good storage and a wonderful touch screen. And while I am not an Apple hater perse I despise Itunes since I use Window computers not MACs. I don't like the lack of control over my OS that I'd have to accept with the Ipad.Ease of moving files. When I want to watch, listen or read something on my Nexus I just plug it into a computer and drag the file onto the Nexus. No software required, no file conversions, no constant Itunes updates. As an example I watch a lot of .avi files on my Nexus and all that was required to do so was drag the file into the movie file folder. Then a quick download of MX player from the app store and I was good to go. I'd often had a headache converting media files on the Ipad and was amazed and thrilled by how easy it was to do on the Nexus. I've found that the Kindle Fire also offers a very simple process similar to the Nexus.Apps, so many apps. Apple has many times the apps as any other system and many are amazing quality. They have a QC process for apps to be added and thus more control that the Google store, that is undeniable. The top of the line games, apps and the like are often developed for the Ipad first and updated more often than for Android. That said I've been able to download free apps to watch every video, any music file, comics, books, and PDF files and had no issue with the Nexus. I do mostly use my tablet for social media and regular media with some web browsing. So the 'lack' of apps in the Google store is a none issue for me. It also means I have access to some fun games and apps that people have developed and don't want to go through the headache of getting approved through Apple. One thing I'd like to note is that while the Kindle App means you can download pretty much any book, you are limited when it comes to magazines/periodicals. Many are only available on the Kindle and if you are wanting to replace your paper magazines with digital versions the Kindle is the way to go.The touch screen on the Nexus is fantastic and I've never had an issue navigating screens or apps. That said there is just no way that the Nexus can compare to the Ipad at this price. The quality and the resolution are great, but with a side by side comparison the Ipad wins hands down. The Kindle Fire is very similar to the Nexus.Control. I love the level of control I have over the Android OS. I can essentially customize it however I want. When I plug my Nexus into my computer I have complete control. This doesn't make it complicated, as its easy enough to plug and play if you want to go that route. But it means for those who wish to you can customize everything from your home screen to your storage and settings. I don't like to pay money for something and then not be able to do what I wish with it. I hate even more to be locked out of software on a system that I own. A quick google search will show the vast amount of possibilities that are inherent with the open source Android system and the massive amount of support that Google offers for it.All and all the Nexus is my tablet choice hand down. While we have many tablets around the house the Nexus has become 'mine' and I use it far more than either the Kindle or Ipad. I do far more reading on it than expected. Couple with a set of Bluetooth headphones I also use it for my gym times instead of my Iphone. I can fit it in my pocket and the battery life means continental plane travel is a none issue for it. I recommend it without hesitation but you do need to really define what you want your table to do when you start shopping.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First Tablet", "Author": "kmr", "ReviewID": "R32R0FL4W5JNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I always wanted a device that is very portable but has a large enough screen for me to feel more comfortable watching videos. My Droid DNA smartphone has an amazing screen, but it doesn't have nearly enough storage. My iPod touch is great, but it is just too tiny, at 3.5 inches. Enter the 32 GB Nexus 7, a cheap Android tablet that fits all my requirements. In the short time that I've had it I've fallen in love with it.HARDWARE:Being a \"Nexus\" device, the Nexus 7 was co-developed by Asus and Google. Asus did the hardware, Google did the software. In general, I am very impressed with the design and build of the tablet. It does not feel overly cheap or fragile, and it is quite thin (not the most important aspect of a device to me, but still notable). So it doesn't have a rear facing camera. I don't care. Taking pictures with a tablet seems awkward and silly to me. Also, if I want to do any serious picture taking, that's what my point-and-shoot camera is for.The screen is pretty nice considering that it isn't retina quality like the Droid DNA or the iPhone/iPod touch. Despite being \"only\" 216 ppi vs. 440 ppi on the DNA and 326 ppi on the iPod, it is plenty sharp enough for me, and it is still leaps and bounds ahead of the iPad Mini's pathetic 160 ppi. This is coming from someone who is spoiled by super high-resolution screens. It may not be the brightest or most colorful screen on the market, but for some people, that's a good thing.The battery life is quite good. Naturally, if you are watching videos or using the Internet extensively, it will drop faster than it would otherwise, but it is still the best I've ever had on an Android device. (Keep in mind, this is the Wi-Fi-only version; I have no idea what the battery life is like on HSPA+ 3G.)SOFTWARE:Again, this is a Nexus. It runs pure, bareboned Android, which is even better than I imagined. It may not have the bells and whistles of third-party skins like HTC Sense, but that's what Google Play is for -- you can add those bells and whistles yourself.Android on its own has come a very long way. Not too long ago I upgraded from a Droid 2 Global, which is stuck on 2.3 \"Gingerbread\" until the end of time. It was probably the biggest upgrade I've ever experienced. Android 4x is like a whole new OS compared to previous versions. I can't list all the changes here, because it would be too extensive. But for starters, you can take screenshots without having to root, and multitasking has become a lot easier due to the presence of a dedicated button (software button on the N7, capacitive on the DNA).Another benefit of the Nexus series in general is support. Not only will my N7 get updates on time (vs. a whole year for the Droid 2, and God knows how long for the DNA), but it will get at least two updates, as opposed to only one before the manufacturer decides to abandon you forever in hopes of getting you to upgrade sooner than later. Out of the box, the Nexus 7 has no third-party bloatware. None. It is all Google stuff. For comparison, my Droid DNA comes with a ton of stuff from Verizon and HTC that can't be removed (hiding and disabling is good enough, though), including things like NFL Mobile, Viewdini, Zappos, Audible, Mobile Hotspot, etc.CONCLUSION:This is a $200-$250 tablet, but you wouldn't believe it. It is simply the best choice for those who want a tablet but are on a budget or simply don't want to spend a zillion dollars. It is also a great device for those of us (in the U.S. only) who want the Nexus experience but can't get it on a phone because of carrier choice -- notably, if you are on Verizon, like I am.

I'm always on the go so I needed something like this to carry around to do homework, research or just read a book watch a movie or play games( the app store has some great deals on some gems if you're patient and on the look out and it allows emulators so you can play classics from the snes,genesis,gameboy,snes,playstation era). I love it but my inner tech nerd isn't satisfied.Being that I have an galaxy S3 I'm able to do a few key things with my phone that I'm not able to do with my tablet unless I root it which voids the warranty. For one I'm able to connect to a USB flash drive simply by connecting an OTG ( on the go) USB adapter. This cost about 2 dollars and simply allows you to expand your hardware's capabilities, for instance attach a flash drive to increase storage or attach a USB peripheral. With the S3 it was as simple as plug and play. I attached the cable and added my flash drive and I can move files to and from without any issues whatsoever. ON the tablet I have to purchase the \"nexus media importer\" app to simply stream whatever I had on my flash drive. Meaning I couldn't move documents from the nexus to the flash drive in case I didn't have a micro cable nearby.Using an MHL cable I'm able to stream the content on my phone to my tv by connecting it with and HDMI cable. Since the nexus has no HDMI out this would have been an acceptable alternative, unfortunately this is not an option. The nexus does not provide any means to stream from the device. This is more than likely because Google wants you to purchase its up and coming devices that are not unlike the apple TV.If you haven't heard it then know that people love telling others that flash is dead and that we no longer need it therefore its okay that its no longer being supported...this is BS. Many sites still use Flash in them and even in your email. So its a bit annoying seeing missing plugins in your email because supposedly this tech is dead when in fact its not true. The same applies for java sites who use it but it won't run on your nexus. Mind you it is possible to have an nice browsing experience  on the tablet and the moments when you come across these issues are far and few in between. But when they do pop up they can be a annoying especially if you're determined to add Flash to your tablet ( its possible but a bit of a wonky experience)Overall I love the product  its fantastic on the go and with a bit of effort capable of many things outside its intended design without voiding the warranty. My gripes are on a more technical level since I know/love  tinkering and find it restrictive ( I love the Android ecosystem because it allows more freedom than App IMO) that I can't get the ideal experience I expect. Ergo the tainted aspect of my review really only affects those that like to go beyond the marketed capabilities.

If you are looking for a long term usage review, or a review from experienced Nexus users you will have to search further.Background:My main purpose for acquiring the Nexus is to replace a Kindle Keyboard E-Book reader; the Kindle is a very nicely designed reader but does not offer color.  I wanted a device which would allow me to read technical manuals and follow color schematics, diagrams, etc.The obvious choice for a Kindle Keyboard replacement would have been the Kindle Fire HD, except that nearly everything I read noted that the operating system on the Fire (Android) has been customized to make the device the best Kindle it can be.  For the same price the Nexus 7 offered Android in a more open configuration, thus allowing more choices when customizing the device.I chose the 32 gigabyte model over the 16 gigabyte model because (a) the extra storage was \"only\" a 25% increase over the cost of the base model and (b) I was (and still am) not quite certain what I will end up storing locally on the device and wanted to maximize my option.I did not purchase the Nexus from Amazon, I purchased it at a local computer store because I wanted a \"hands on\" look at the device before purchasing.Setup:I found the original setup (not to be confused with customizing) the Nexus very simple.  I had my wireless router set to broadcast the SSID (the name of the network), and the Nexus located the network without issue and logged in when I supplied the network key.A Google account is required; I already had a Google account and the device had no problem logging into that account once I supplied the necessary username/password.Customization:E-Reader:I downloaded and installed the Kindle app, which registered the Nexus in my Amazon Kindle account.  At that point all of the books which are in my Kindle library became available on the Nexus.  They did not automatically download, rather they are shown within the Kindle app as \"archived\".  The archive is searchable and clicking on a book then downloads the book into the local storage of the Nexus.  Of course one must have a Wi-Fi connection in order to download books, given that this review is on the Wi-Fi model of the Nexus.The screen of the Nexus, unlike the Kindle Keyboard, is back lit. I have had no issues with eye fatigue, etc. reading books on the Nexus (and I gave it a pretty good run through, since for me this is the \"killer app\" of the device; if the e-reader had not worked well the device would have been returned).One caveat - the Kindle Keyboard is lighter, and has controls for paging up/down on each side of the device - thus making it easy to read one handed with either hand.  The Nexus 7, having a touch screen, requires that the page be turned by swiping one's finger across the screen, from right to left to move forward and left to right to move backward.  This makes reading one handed problematical.The Kindle Keyboard has excellent characteristics for reading outside in the sunlight; I have not yet tested the Nexus 7 for reading outside because that would not be a deal breaker for me.  I rarely read outside in the sunlight.It should also be noted that books on the Keyboard Kindle can be organized into \"Collections\" for easy organization.  That feature is not available on the Nexus (nor on the Kindle Fire HD, as far as I am aware).Email:After confirming that the Kindle app would work well enough to replace the Kindle Keyboard I set up Hotmail.  Although I have a Google account my primary email account is through Hotmail; I use Outlook 2010 on my computers and sync contacts, calendar, and email through Hotmail.  I wanted to have the Nexus sync to that data as well.  Following the on screen instructions after clicking on the E-Mail icon setting up Hotmail was a breeze.  I did not have to manually configure the ports or other settings, the Nexus automatically handled the setup once the username/password was supplied.I've confirmed that making changes on the Nexus syncs to Hotmail, and thus back to Outlook on my computers.  Note that 'contacts' data is shown under the \"People\" icon on the Nexus; modifying or deleting a contact in \"People\" syncs back to 'contacts' in Hotmail.  Calendar and mail, of course, sync as well.Anti-Virus:I installed the AVG Anti-virus from the Google Play Store.  I have some experience with AVG (I am a retired I.T. technician) and their freeware version installed easily, performed a scan quickly, and there are not any overly onerous screen ads.Printing:I installed Google Cloud Print on one of my home computers and following the prompts registered all of my home printers (I have a home network comprised of several computers and printers).  I then installed the Cloud Print app from the Play Store on the Nexus, following the prompts, and sent test prints to an HP LaserJet printer.  Printing was very quick.  Note that Cloud Print allows one to print documents but there is, as far as I have been able to determine, no \"Print\" directly available from E-Mail.  However this is, after all, a \"24 hour\" review and I have not extensively investigated the possibilities of Cloud Print.Edit: 2/14/13 - I found that the computer upon which Cloud Print is installed needs to have the printer \"owner\" logged in; otherwise the HP LaserJet did not print, the job was held in the queue, even though the computer was powered up.  The printer is networked, not connected directly to the computer; the problem seems to be the way Google Cloud Print accesses the IP of the printer.  I resolved this situation by making a Kodak Hero 7.1 ink jet printer the default, and setting up \"Cloud Ready\" printing.  The Kodak software coordinates with Google to give a direct path to the printer, removing any computers from the mix.  I confirmed by turning off all of the computers from my home network and sending a print job to the Kodak from the Nexus; the job printed almost immediately.  I recommended that if one is looking to print from the Nexus on a regular basis that a \"Cloud Ready\" printer (there are many) be used if possible.  Brother Corp has a printer:http://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-2270DW-Compact-Wireless-Networking/dp/B00450DVDY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=70H9A6UDQYQN&coliid;=I266I6ACMF5T49that comes with it's own version of such printing, but I do not own that printer and so cannot verify that it will print from the Nexus independent of computers.Microsoft Office:Office 2010 is installed on all of my computers and is my 'go to' resource for documents.  Obviously Office isn't going to install on the Nexus. I installed Kingsoft Office, a free app from the Play Store, and tested by opening an email attachment which was in Word format. There were no issues, with the caveat that Kingsoft generated a message that there was no suitable File Explorer installed on the Nexus.Edit: 2/3/13 - After installing Google Cloud Drive on my laptop I created an Excel file and saved it to Google.  I opened the file on the Nexus using the Kingsoft Office, edited, and uploaded it back to Google.  When opened on my laptop the changes were in place.  If you need more details on the Kingsoft Office capabilities I would recommend \"Googling\" the software and reading the reviews.  I do not expect to be creating complex documents or spreadsheets on the Nexus, but it is heartening to know that there is some level of document sharing/editing/creating available.File Explorer:Following the message from Kingsoft Office I installed the app ES File Explorer, a freeware app from the Google Play Store.  It installed easily and works with Kingsoft.Google Plus:I set up Google Plus but have not investigated the application.  One can only do so much in 24 hours :-) .Games:I am not a huge gamer; I installed Hearts from the Google Play Store and tested. It works similarly to the Hearts game installed on Windows 7.  Screen rendering of the cards is excellent.Maps:I set up Google Maps, allowing the device to find my current location.  Screen resolution is excellent.  I have not yet used the Maps/GPS other than to install the app.Movies:\"Ice Age\" came licensed on the device; I spent a few minutes watching the movie and the screen rendering is excellent.  The sound is acceptable - but note that \"acceptable\" is totally subjective.  The speakers are on the back side of the Nexus, which is not optimal.Overall:I am well pleased with the Nexus after a day of setup and usage.  While it is obviously not a laptop or even a netbook I think that the device does have possibilities for not just the consumption of content but also the creation of content.  The screen is excellent, the range of apps (while not equal to the number of iPad apps) is extensive and growing, the processor is quick to respond and the price point competitive.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "beware of screen flicker problem", "Author": "D.

I bought a Nexus 7 instead and, while I liked my Fire, I prefer the Nexus 7 in ALMOST every way. Below are some comparisons I've made between the two devices. Which one you end up with largely depends on what you want the device for, but here are some considerations.Android versus Kind-of-Android: As my Fire review attests, I took to Amazon's heavily 'skinned' Android more than I thought I would. But with the Nexus 7, you get Android Jellybean in all of its fullness. The Kindle Fire is the easier to navigate device, as the homescreen is basically a carousel of recent items and a list of categories (apps, books, games, movies, web) that you can select. But the Nexus 7's Android is fully customizable with the traditional five home screens you can use to place apps, widgets, bookmarks, and the like. Full Android takes some learning (ICS is more intuitive than prior releases, though), but if you want customization, Nexus beats Fire. I should also mention the internet browsers. With the Kindles, you get Amazon Silk, a fairly slow browser (yes, it markets as fast, but it is slow by every measure) whose biggest selling point is text-rendering. With Nexus, the default browser is Chrome, but there are some other great tablet-optimized browswers like Puffin and Dolphin; while none of them have text-rendering like Silk, a few are flash-enabled, allow private browsing, and some other stuff that Silk does not allow.Reading, Listening, and Watching: I use my tablet largely as a media consumption device, and toward that end, Amazon is second to none. Those of us locked into Amazon's ecosystem of books, movies, and music will do well with the Fire and its integration into the Amazon universe. Buy a book or album, it shows up on your device (or your cloud). Have Prime? It is easy to stream Prime videos straight to your device. But here's the thing: you can do a lot of this (except for streaming video) on the Nexus, as Amazon's apps are freely available on the Play market. The two things you will (kind of) give up are the robustness of the kindle ebook reading experience (text-to-speech, for instance, is only available on kindle devices) and streaming Prime movies. Of course, I said \"kind-of\" give up because you CAN stream prime movies on the Nexus 7 via a few Flash enabled browsers that you can find by doing a web search. Oh, and as far as ereading apps, you are not locked into any one provider on the Nexus: Google Boooks, Nook, Sony Reader, Mantano Reader, Aldiko - it is all easily available on the Play market (where with the Fire, you have to go through a fairly tedious sideload process).Tablet Hardware: Okay, here, the Nexus 7 is the CLEAR winner. In honesty, the Fire and Fire HD just strike me as somewhat cheaply made (and the Fire is just bulky). The Nexus is not only an inexpensive tablet, but a really pretty and solid-feeling one as well. It is lighter than the Fire (by a lot) and HD (by a noticeable little). The screen is just better on the Nexus than the HD (even though the specs are roughly the same), and the Nexus is DEFINITELY faster than either the Fire or HD. The two areas where I think the Kindle does have the advantage hardware-wise are that the side bezels are thicker (more room for your thumb to grip the front of the device in portrait mode), and the speakers (Fire and HD have stereo speakers that are very good quality, while Nexus has one speaker that is light and tinny).What each has that the other doesn't: The Nexus is more of a serious tablet than the Fire. It has features like Google voice search (like Appple's Siri, but more polished), Google Now (sort of a personal planner), and GPS. None of these are available on the Kindle Fire.On the other hand, the Fire and HD are great media consumption devices: on the devices, you get text-to-speech for most kindle books, whyspersync (where you can buy the book and audio book combo and have the kindle sync them so that you can switch between the two), and streaming of Prime video (per above, a big awkward on the Nexus). While not particularly a feature of the Fire or HD, I should mention that Amazon has phenomenal customer service for these devices, while Nexus customer support is spotty.Really, it comes down to what you want. As you can see, both devices have features the other does not have, but for my money, I still prefer the Nexus on balance. It is a more solid tablet (remember, my Fire HD's hardware encountered problems, which isn't normal, but it isn't abnormal). And it is a tablet that, unlike the Fire and HD, do not seek to lock you into one content provider. If it is available on the Play market, I can get it. And the Nexus's Google Voice and Google Now features are surprisingly helpful.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good stellar product from Asus/Google", "Author": "JDeltree", "ReviewID": "R37RYJTCIRTTX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being my 2nd tablet and 2nd tablet from Asus as well.

I recieved it as a gift, but after a month of use I felt that I needed to tell others about it.I have played with an ipad, a samsung galaxy tab, and a kindle fire so I know my tablets pretty well.I use my Nexus to play games, stream videos, surf the web, and take notes during class, and these are some observations that I have made.PROSHardware- The Nexus 7 boasts extremely impressive hardware including a 1.2 gHz processor, 1gb of ram, and (in this case) 32gb of storage space.Android OS- The Jelly Bean Android OS is amazing, smooth, and works well with the 7in tablet design. For me switching from iOS to Jelly Bean felt like taking the training wheels off of my bicycle. At first I felt overwhelmed but after a day I was able to figure out the OS and am now able to operate it with ease. Jelly Bean is extraordinarily customization since you can find several different customization apps on the Google Play store.Google Play- Apple boasts that it has the largest selection of mobile applications in the world. While this may be true, the Google Play store also has a large selection of apps that allow you to do anything from playing games to streaming TV shows and movies. All of the more popular apps (angry birds, facebook, netflix, hulu, skype, etc) are there.Size and build- The 7in size of the Nexus 7 is perfect for the person who is on the go often. You can easily slip it into a purse or a bag, even with a case, and you can hold it easily with one hand even if you have smaller hands. People tend to complain about the \"rubber\" back of the tablet but I happen to like it. It doesn't slip when its on a desk or table and feels nice and solid in your hands.Battery Life- My nexus can last a couple of days of use even with light video watching. Sometimes I can get through an entire day while only using 20% of the battery (though usually this sould be a day of pretty light use).CONSLagging- Sometimes the tablet will lag quite significantly. A quick restart fixes the problem thoughThickness- Not a problem for me, but some people prefer a thinner tablet. The Nexus is a little thick, especially compared to an iPad.No rear camera- Personally I never plan to take pictures with my tablet when I have a nice phone handy. However it is good to know that the Nexus does not have a rear camera. It does have a front-facing camera that can be used for video chatting.CONCLUSIONIt you are looking for a 7in tablet that will last you a while, look no further. I would definitely recommend that you buy the Nexus 7.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Trend Setter and Game Changer", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UUW9W3LQDD44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like all those things which has proved the greatest Steve Jobs wrong or even has potential of doing it.

Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI (Buy any micro USB to HDMI adaptor). I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART. Seems they have much lesser complaints about quality. We three friends bought this and we are much more than satisfied.

Lockwood", "ReviewID": "R1RKYAQ6DD11Z9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The main points that led me to purchase this tablet were:1. Price2. The amount of memory3. The fact that it is a Nexus 7 means that my operating system will always be up to date.Within minutes of turning the device on and connecting to the internet, it was already starting to update the OS. It was all automatic, all I had to do was watch while it rebooted a couple of times. First it updated to the highest version of Jelly Bean, then it rebooted and updated to KitKat 4.4.2. I was concerned that there might be a performance hit, but I am not noticing anything like that at all. I read that some users have had problems updating this Nexus 7 2012 up to KitKat. They experienced a slow down in the operation of the tablet. Perhaps they should have done a factory reset before the upgrade. The slowdown problem that I read about seemed to have to do with a cache that was left on the system at the time of the upgrade. A factory reset would have deleted that, as well as any other legacy files.Because of all of the security issues with outdated operating systems and software that have been happening lately, I came to the decision that I will no longer buy devices that will be left hanging without official OS updates. Windows and Apple both manage to do this for a reasonable amount of time after purchase.  So why can't Google force the device makers to do this, at least for the first few years of ownership?  Until this happens I will not buy Android phones or tablets that are not supported by Google. Phone and tablet makers who are not willing to help extend the life of our devices and keep our data as secure as possible by giving us the latest operating systems should not be supported in my opinion.This tablet is on sale at Best Buy this week for $149, saving ~$100 over what the 2013 Nexis 7 with 32 GB would have cost me.  There will come a day when it will start to feel sluggish, when that happens it will be time for a new tablet.

My brother found the tablet and put it on the backpack. I told him to throw it away, and that had no chance to the thing work again after all that time inside the water.Well my friends, once more I was wrong,Today, almost two months after the accident my brother gets home saying that have a Xmas gift for me.Surprise!!! It`s my Nexus!He told me he put it on rice few hours after finding it, and last week he decided he would give the tablet a try. So he opened it and spend 4 days cleaning the dirty from the inside. And when he finished:Tadam!!!My nexus is working perfectly!!! He didn`t replace any piece, only cleaned it.I can`t tell how amazed and happy I am.I even baptized my nexus Michael Phelps for being such a great swimmer.All my books, apps, musics and pictures are there. Saved like if nothing had happened, just waiting for me to play.Now, yeah! My brother did an outstanding work, he should be hired for a huge tech company, but only a great product could survive more than 12 hours under the water.Besides being my personal 7 inch hero, even before the accident I notice that the touchscreen is great (better than IPAD), the voice response is super cool (I love ask google to google stuff) and the size is perfect. I really enjoy reading on it, and I am the old kind of person who still buy paper book.Before buying it I was worried about space, but I never get even close to my limit of 32gb, and I have a cable that allows me to connect my pen drive on it.So if I can tell anything about this tablet is: My best amazon purchase!I Would recommend it even for Steve Jobs.PS: Real costumer, real history and real fishes were swimming around the tablet under the river.PS2: My car didn`t get such a great review unfortunately.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not reliable at all, worst device every owned", "Author": "Leigh", "ReviewID": "RSHQD41UIHLT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I bought the Nexus 7, there have been two Android updates, first 4.3, and then 4.4.

The size is perfect for holding with one hand and the touchscreen is very responsive even with an aftermarket screen protector on it. Android 4.2 is currently the newest update and it works perfectly. The screen resolution is and I can look at it for hours and not have any issues with eye strain or pain.

El Cheapo went to its' grave with nearly all my files...thankfully, TF/MicroSD Cards are fairly cheap, and interchangeable with other Android devices, so I was able to transfer those to Old Reliable (an earlier-version Android device I had purchased last year). I then turned to my Facebook Groups, asking what would be a suitable replacement for the A10 Allwinner that had just died. The overwhelming majority said \"Get A Nexus 7.\" Well, I was understandably hesitant...after all, it was relatively expensive ($250+), but the features were far better than the cheap knock-offs (1280X800 display, NVIDIA GeForce Video Processor, a *QUAD-CORE* processor, long battery life, wi-fi, etc.) Well, truthfully, I didn't get much farther than \"NVidia\" before I decided this was going to be my next tablet, as I have NVidia graphics processors in both my desktop and laptop computers. The 32GB internal storage was a real bonus, as was the USB OTG feature (I suppose it has a SATA SSD that could be expanded, but I'm not going to crack the case to find out). The OS is incredibly easy to use...if you've used an Android platform for a few months (or years), it won't be hard to adapt (unlike those incredibly confusing iProducts).I've not used all the features as yet (such as the camera) as I'm still restoring my previously-purchased apps to the device.The one big downside I can see (so far) is the inability for this tablet to accept standard or micro SD Cards. Whether this was intentional, or an oversight on Google's part, I don't know. Perhaps this feature could/should be included in future Nexus Devices.Overall, I'm happier with this new tablet than I ever was with my old El Cheapo. I've loaded music onto it, and am listening to Meat Loaf's \"Hits Out Of Hell\", with all the clarity of the best of CD Players. I think I'll download Skype next and have a chat with my brother in California...EDIT, 5/23/13:Another Amazon User (Kinchas) suggested getting Nexus Media Importer, as did many other Nexus Users. I have to say, that has been one of the most useful apps I've ever used. I still think Google's choice of not including an SD/Micro SD slot is a terrible oversight, but with Media Importer, you're not limited to just a few measly gigs of storage (it was able to handle a relatively small 1GB thumb drive with all my Mythbusters pics on it very well), but, potentially up to the terabytes range...and I do have a 3TB drive not being used. I also like the tablet's ability to use wireless storage drives, like the Kingston Wi-Drive. Granted, you have to set it up like a wi-fi and download the app, but once that's done, it works great.Another downside I've found is the USB port itself. There's only the one micro USB port. Sure, it's very useful for charging or transferring files (both at the same time if you connect the tablet to your computer), but if you want to charge the battery *and* use an external storage device...well, that could present a problem. Perhaps a second USB port would be beneficial.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Becoming one of my favorites!", "Author": "Judy L.", "ReviewID": "R1UFJXD331W9KF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At this point in time I have a number of tablets including a Kindle Fire HD 7\", a Mini iPad, a 10\" Asus TF300, and an iPad 3. The Kindle Fire HD was my first 7\" tablet. I got it because it was relatively less expensive than most of the other 7\" tablets, and I wanted to see if I liked the 7\" vs. the 10\" tablet. As it turned out, I really like the size of the 7\" tablet because of the portability, and it's less weight to hold for reading. Next I got the iPad Mini. I have to say that I love the iPads. Even though you are tied into iTunes for downloads, the applications seem to be more fully developed than most of the comparable Android apps, and the latest version of iTunes is really handy for organizing apps, music, etc, and can also be used to organize apps on the iPads. As many reviewers have already stated, comparing the IOS system of the iPads and the Android systems is like trying to compare apples to oranges.Even though I wouldn't part with my iPads, I do enjoy the Android devices. I posted a review of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD shortly after I got it, and before I got the other 7\" tablets including the Nexus 7. I love my Mini iPad, but I wanted a 7\" android tablet. When I found out that the Nexus 7 was made by Asus, I was immediately intrigued because I have the Asus TF300 and have been impressed with the Asus tablets. I considered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, but after comparing the specs with those of the Nexus 7, decided that the Nexus 7 was the superior tablet.Having had the Nexus 7 for a couple of weeks, I have found that it is very similar to the Asus TF300 as far as quality, setup, and operation. Since the Nexus 7 is Google oriented, it has a sidebar on the right side that contains primarily Google links, and on the left side of the screen there is a bar for the voice Google search. I don't have a problem with this because I use many of the Google services. Aside from this, the home screen and other screens are completely customizable. Folders can be set up to group applications, and they can be placed on any of the multiple screens available. The system is very fast and responsive. I haven't gotten into rooting the system because I haven't had a need for it. I don't think the risk is worth the possible benefits.As for charging the system, it doesn't require anything special. If you have a mini USB to USB cable, you can connect it to any A/C adapter that you have that takes a USB connector. I use the same cable for charging my phone, the Nexus 7, my keyboard, and my mouse. It does not require a special charging cable as many of the other tablets do.As compared to the Kindle Fire HD, the Nexus 7 has much more flexibility, and is much more customizable. The screen of the Kindle Fire HD cannot be customized as  far as showing applications that you have available. The Kindle Fire HD has one screen that shows a turntable of apps that you have used, and they are shown in the sequence that you used them. If you try an app and don't want to use it on a regular basis, you have to remove it from the turntable. There is no organization other than the sequence that you open apps. If you remove an app and want to use it again, you have to go to the list of installed apps to find it. The same is true for videos, music, and anything else you may have on the tablet. In addition, Google android apps are not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. So apps used are confined to the Amazon world. The Nexus 7 can use both Google and Amazon android apps.The only downside that I have found for the Nexus 7 is that not all Google android apps are compatible with this tablet, but they are for my Asus TF300 tablet and for my phone. This may change with future updates to software. I did buy this tablet with the AT&T; sim card, and bought it directly from Google because the price was less than the Amazon price. I would highly recommend this tablet for anyone looking for a versatile and high quality 7\" tablet that doesn't have a huge price tag.UPDATE!!I have had the Nexus 7 for a couple more weeks, and it is still one of my favorite of the tablets that I have. It has all of the flexibility of the Asus TF300 tablet and the size makes it extremely portable. At least for now, this is one of the tablets that I wouldn't part with. The Nexus 7 is compatible with both Google apps and Amazon android apps. Whereas, the Kindle HD is compatible only with Amazon Kindle apps, and not even all of them. The apps must be specifically compatible for the Kindle HD. I also find it curious that the Kindle app for reading books is much nicer on the iPads and android tablets than it is on the Kindle. You would think that the Kindle app on a Kindle tablet would be superior to what it is on other tablets.

Sounds bad, right?  I got it to replace my Palm Pilot, the third I'd owned.  The thing no longer held a charge and I was about to buy my fourth charger.  So, decided I should modernize and get a tablet.  I DID NOT WANT A SMARTPHONE.  Why? Because when I need a phone, it better work.  Smartphones (and the Nexus) need to be charged daily and face it, if they are being used heavily, they may need to be charged during the day.  I live in an area that is decidedly rural with lots of cellphone dead zones.  The plain old cellphone gets way more reliable connection and battery life in this environment.  But I needed my contacts and calendar with me and I'd had a couple of experiences where Internet access was suddenly needed on trips.  So, got the Nexus.  As it has turned out, I am using it all day long and rarely turning on the PC anymore.  This has actually improved my health as I can move from one position to another easily and reduce my incidence of migraines from sitting in one position for too long.I have read these reports about slowness as the Nexus ages.  What I'd like to know is, how many apps do these people have on their devices?  Did they pay the extra fee to get rid of the ads?  Are the apps polling all day long for updates?  Because I'm not seeing these problems.  I regularly check to see what is running and if an app is constantly running when not being used, it may go on the chopping block.  Same with ads.. They better have an ad-free version.  I also check permissions for the apps before I download them and I prevent auto-upgrades to recheck what new permissions are being added each time.  Ripped Facebook off because of its increasing privacy intrusions, in fact.  Anyway, before you believe all those reports, find out what kind of mess those users have created by unthinkingly adding every cool app they come across.

Sharrow", "ReviewID": "R2COGS8M5P6S1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Android device so, I'm still learning a lot about it and cannot evaluate it's capabilities with any degree of expertise.  After a week or so, it seems to be holding up and doing what it is supposed to do and that seems to be that it keeps running.  Before my purchase, I read a lot of the \"one-star\" reviews and finally decided that most of the negativity was due to over expectation and stupidity rather than bad luck.  I have been waiting for my Nexus 7 to summarily quit on me but so far, it is going strong.If \"battery problems\" arise, I know they will be caused by the possibility of a loosened connector and can easily be repaired by opening the case with a guitar pick and correcting the defect.  Apparently, if you mishandle your Nexus 7 and knock the battery loose, it is possible to dislodge one of the battery connectors, causing it to become intermittent and/or disconnected altogether.By reading many of the \"fixes\" for this malady, I have come to the conclusion that one of the battery leads is a trifle short and if the battery shifts, the connector is pulled loose.  NO BIG DEAL!  My take on this is that, like all OEM's, ASUS buys their components from various souces and does final assembly at one or more of their facilities.  In all likelihood, the original design was flawless but as battery technology improved, the newer batteries became slightly smaller and the locations of the connectors changed.  Thus, the battery was held in place by some double-stick tape and one of the battery leads was just long enough to be able to do it's job.  Again, no big deal, and I figured that IF I had this problem, I'd just open that puppy with a guitar pick and take a look.I like to take stuff apart anyway and tightening connectors is just part of normal maintenance so far as I'm concerned.  If needs be, I can lengthen the offending lead, resecure the battery etc.. And then, I know how to replace the battery when it actually does poop out.In a few months, if nothing catastrophic happens, I'll add to this review and probably upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  Naturally, by that time, the new Nexus 7 equivalent will be out, with all sorts of better bells and whistles.  If I like the Android system, I will consider getting the newest hardware but I'll keep my present Nexus 7 for a back-up, knowing that I can take it apart and keep it running.Besides loading a slug of \"aps,\" I did upgade the software to 4.2.2.1, and it was a piece of cake.  This was probably because I decided to order my Nexus 7 through Amazon, paying an extra $10, just to be sure that I got the most recent hardware issued from the factory.  I like factory upgrades and Asus is good at keeping them current.More to follow.UPDATE!:I've given it another star - for longevity, not features.My wife has not been able to kill our Nexus 7 yet.  It still takes a full charge, and has not caught fire or done any of the other scary things that the collective naysayers complain about.Maybe buying from the best source really does pay off!A word to the wise etc.:Beware of Apps bearing permissions.  Fewer is better and read those \"permissions\" carefully.  These \"Apps\" both free and costly, can really screw up your device, and your life!  The Net is a dangerous place but for the vigilant and prepared, it can be a useful adventure.  Complacency can and will \"get cha\"!

I am mainly comparing this model to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, a 7\" with 8 GB storage, but with an expansion slot.  I recently acquired the Galaxy model, and reviewed and returned it.  Recent builds of the Android operating system do not make good use of storage expansion.  You may not install apps to it, and many apps which write data cannot be configured to write to it.  While you can use the storage to copy large media files, I felt that the 8 GB available for apps was too limiting.  so I returned the Galaxy and acquired the Nexus.The Nexus is a near ideal 7\" tablet.  Android runs beautifully on it, with apps opening noticeably snappier than on the Galaxy.  The processor seems faster and the screen resolution is higher.  Additionally the rear of the unit, with a kind of a textured rubber is friendlier for holding the unit.  I don't want to be too disparaging of the Galaxy, as it is a strong and capable unit.  I just feel that the Nexus is better.  (As I write this, there is word of a Samsung Galaxy 3, so the market is rapidly evolving).The Nexus has the latest version of Android (Jelly Bean), and can be set to automatically update the OS and any apps in the background.  Wifi performance has been excellent.  Netflix and HBO streaming video run very well, and it is, of course, an excellent ereader, supporting the Kindle app and others.  The unit has stereo speakers, but for any serious listening, you will want to use headphones.  The audio volume through the speakers is low, and even through headphones it doesn't get really loud.  I am fine with this, and I note also that there are apps available for boosting volume.In short, everything I've thrown at the Nexus has been handled well.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Enjoying Nexus 7", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3M71NUO97BU07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't own a smart phone, and never used an Android device before. I wanted to buy a small tablet, and the top 3 choices were Kindle Fire HD, iPad Mini, or Nexus 7. Cost is an important part of my decision making, so the iPad Mini was out immediately.I'm sure the Kindle Fire HD is a great product... I've seen them in action and have no doubt I would have been happy with it. However, in the end, I went with the Nexus 7 and I'm glad I did.The Android operating system was new to me, but it's so intuitive that within a few days, I felt very comfortable downloading new apps and trying out all kinds of things, from drawing and sketching to games and productivity tools. The portability and convenience of such a small device is really fun. I take it into the kitchen with me when I'm looking up recipes. Luckily, I already had some really nice Bluetooth headphones and listen to all the music I can imagine on Spotify. I've also uploaded all my music to Google Music. I've watched a couple of TV episodes I missed, and have a Netflix subscription. Also, I'm a Kindle eReader owner (older version), and find that reading my Kindle books (using the Kindle Android App) on the Nexus 7 is wonderful! It's back-lit and really easy on the eyes.I was already a moderate Google user (gmail, drive, docs, Picasa), but when you use the Nexus 7, you start to see the puzzle pieces of the world of Google fit together very nicely. I, like many Google users, have also noticed the huge amount of information Google has collected about me in order to fit me into Google World seamlessly... it's a trade-off, I guess. iPad owners have the same issue with Apple.The battery life of the Nexus 7 is incredible, and better than anticipated. I'm impressed with the overall quality and ease of use, the learning curve is not very steep.The only thing missing, of course, is a camera on the back (there is a front-facing cam for Skype, etc). I've also read many complaints of the lack of an HDMI-out port for connecting to an HDTV.For the price, I think Nexus 7 owners have a beautiful piece of technology that serves many purposes and interests... and ranks right up there with the iPad mini.

When we opened gifts, she had bought me one too (I was/am an Android smart phone user).  I spent 18 hours over the course of 3 days trying to get them up and running.  It wasn't me.  Each call was \"elevated\" to a \"senior\" Apple tech rep.  One mini would not stay connected to wi fi, and the other would not accept photos from my wife's ipod to the mini.  A trip to the Apple Store (45min one way) didn't resolve either problem. I returned them both...and to their credit, there were no issues with the returns.  The wife is back with her iPod touch and I went out and bought myslef a Nexus 7 (after exhaustive research).  This thing is fast, dependable, versatile, looks great, terrific screen resoltion and a joy to work/play with.  I've had it 2 months and won't look at Apple again due to price....and their constant \"updates\" that inevitably cause us issues on other devices (iphone and ipod touch).  The cost difference is a no brainer ($199 if you skip Amaon's prices).  The biggest push back I get from family members with the ipad mini is the number of apps available.  Be realistic.  I'm exaggerating but if Apple has 400,000 apps and Android has 300,000 apps, who cares.  Apple is wearing off....and if costs don't come down soon, Android will eat them alive....over time.  This table is FANTASTIC and a GREAT VALUE.  But please note, I bought mine at Office Depot.  Amazon prices for this tablet are highway robbery....and I am an avid Amazon shopper but for this device they are way out of line.

I am writing this review on my MacBook Air. I own an iPhone5, and have an iPad Third Generation. I bought this tablet over the iPad Mini after much contemplation. I needed a smaller tablet that is more portable for my job. I'm in retail, and frequently I need to look up products online for customers and was growing tired of having to walk to a desktop computer with the customer in tow. I was a little leery of Android from all the reports of malware that is reported on the web. However, I bought my sister a Nexus 7 for Christmas (she was VERY specific). I only handled it once, but I was impressed with the fluidity and screen resolution. After a few weeks, I asked her if she liked her tablet. She was so excited to tell me that she was very happy with the Nexus 7.This tablet is very light weight. It feels great in your hands. I do recommend getting some kind of case or shell for it because even though it is textured on the back, it does feel at times like it might slip out of your hands. Android Jelly Bean 4.2 comes standard, and my oh my have they made headway with this OS. It's fast, sleek and smooth. It opens programs rapidly and has a beautiful interface with each. I do suggest that you download Avast! mobile security. It is free, and it also happens to be the top rated tablet anti-virus/malware software currently on the market. I did heavy research before my tablet arrived. One great thing that I have noticed with Jelly Bean is that there are fewer apps that run in the background automatically as in previous versions. I still use Task Killer to shut them down to conserve battery life. Speaking of which, I have been able to get almost 7 hours out of a charge of surfing the internet, playing music, etc. The tablet comes with a free HD movie, Ice Age, and I suspect it's to show off the beautiful screen resolution. Some people think they need a 10\" tablet to view movies, but I've never felt like I was squinting to watch anything.Apps. They are great. I love Google+, Pinterest, and Instagram. Gmail also runs great and has a simple yet intuitive interface. There are of course the others, such as Facebook and Twitter. I don't personally use Twitter, but I did take a peek at it, and it's quite beautiful and crisp. There a several games that render beautifully on the tablet. I also like the Evernote App, it comes in handy for work and also for my other half and I to send grocery lists to each other.Bottom line: If you want a very portable tablet that is fast, powerful and beautiful, this tablet is the one for you! I paid $270 plus a $59 two year accidental drop, spill and damage warranty from SquareTrade that guarantees my tablet repaired or replaced in five days or they'll pay me $300. I've done my research, and they are the real deal. They receive excellent reviews from all the tech websites such as CNET, Techradar, Android Central, etc. This would be a great tablet for a teenager because you wouldn't have $600 in an iPad for them to break it or loose it.

I found this tablet very useful for music and games. The tablet fits my needs due to its 32 gigabyte hard drive it stores all my music and I still have 14 gigabytes left of free space. I also find it useful when I am expecting an important email: I could just turn it on and recent emails show on the main screen. The tablet is like a small TV in the palm of your hands. It's small enough to fit in your pocket. Its light and the back is strangely smooth but contains small dots and looks like a carbon fiber hood. It also has Google Nexus and Asus engraved in the back. I would have found it more satisfying if it had camera in the back. Since I find the front view camera useless. I recommend this tablet its lighting fast compatible with WI-FI and only for 249 a 32 gig its worth the price compared to other tablets.  I prefer having a Google Nexus 7 over the I pad mini because I can use it more freely. Such as the music and the apps. In the android market there is more of a variety to choose from than the ios7. In the Ipad mini you have to buy most of your music from the app store and in the Google Nexus 7 you could just download apps to do it for you instead of paying for your entertainment. I love the fact how the Google Nexus 7 you can multitask and the Ipad mini you cant. Therefore the Google Nexus 7 allows much more freedom in customizing the look and feel of your tablet. They both have parental control features the Ipad mini menu is very limited you will only find Safari, Camera, FaceTime, iTunes, iBookstore, Twitter, Facebook and Siri. Also You can't create separate profiles so if you share your device with your children you have to go in and switch the restrictions on and off each time you hand them the device. The google nexus 7 you can restrict the type of content you want to block such as explicit movies/videos, TV shows, apps and music. Also in the Google Nexus 7 you can have a profile for each member of the family makes sharing a tablet so much easier. The Google nexus 7 overall is a great tablet for all type of use.  The Google Nexus 7 max screen resolution is 1280x800 pixels. The size of the screen is 7 inches. It contains 1 Lithium ion battery that is required and it's already included. The Average battery for this tablet is about 9.5 hours. The tablet has only one camera which is found in the front and it has 1.2 megapixels. The processor that the tablet uses is the tegra 3 quad-core processor. It also contains Gps so you can Google map any address. It contains Bluetooth to send music, make calls ect. Powered by android. i recommend this tablet to anyone because its easy to use and reliable and economical and fits anyones needs.

I have had my Nexus 7 for about 9 months and life has not been easy for the poor machine. I have a 5 year old who loves to play games on it and has been known to drop it, I have dropped it myself a few times, it gets carried in a messenger bag 4 miles every day while I walk the bumpy streets and get jostled in the subway, and I even left it outside on the top of the car (who put it on top of the car is still up for debate) for 3 days which included being driven around for miles on bumpy streets and getting rained on. Thankfully I have a cheap case which seems to do a decent job protecting the device (there was moisture sitting on the machine itself after being left outside for a few days). The Nexus 7 keeps ticking. It keeps providing hours of enjoyment watching movies I have loaded onto the hard drive, as well as through Netflix,and provides plenty of music and light gaming for the families enjoyment. I also use it to access email, surf the internet, read books, and plenty of other things. The device has slowed down since I originally received it, but not horribly noticeably. It still runs well with most thing I use it for and I have had no serious issues, never lost data, never had it malfunction, and never needed it serviced. It is certainly worth the cheap price it's offered at. I hear the new Nexus models are faster, lighter, and better over all , so I may need to pick up another one for the family.As for battery life, mine seems to take a while to charge, however, once charge it holds it's charge for a LONG time. I am not kidding when I say that it was used almost non-stop during a 7+ hour car ride with video or gaming, and never once did we need to plug it in (it has done this trip several times).", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Nexus 7 (7-Inch, 32GB) Tablet (2012)", "Author": "iQ7", "ReviewID": "R2PQYGXTMK5WMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Want to buy the new version nexus 7,found cheaper price for the older version.Fast CPU and everything run smooth.Thanks to amazon i have much choice and save time and money.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply best android tablet", "Author": "Goh Chee Kiong", "ReviewID": "R309XMO5GF1IQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want an android tablet without any additional apps from the manufacturer, get Nexus.

About a 2 months or so ago I realized that every time I shut down my tablet it would not power up again because it would have no battery (It didn't matter that I would shut it down with 100% battery). This was annoying but I was able to deal with it. A month ago while we were on vacation I dropped my tablet on the concrete accidently. That night I played with my tablet and it worked fine. The next day when I got my tablet out it had a crack running along the front of the screen and the bottom half of the screen would not respond to touch. After seeing that it would cost 80-90 dollars to replace the screen and lcd I decided that it wasn't worth it. I would replace my tablet if I had the money because I know that it was probably my fault that it broke.

I love the new Android O.S. Jellybean 4.2. It's very smooth operating. I'm also a fan of Asus for their excellent build quality of the Nexus 7. It definitely  appears that Google and Asus collaborated very closely on this tablet. I was concerned about the tablet. Because it's made by Asus. And my past experience with their customer service, leaves little to be desired! But, after doing research, I came to realize that the support of this tablet software is all Google. Asus is just the hardware. Since Asus builds quality products in general, this should not be an issue. I was also pleased to learn that Google engineers much of it's Android O.S. in my hometown. Here in Pittsburgh! Love supporting American jobs, especially good paying ones. The screen resolution is great. Which is made with Corning glass. Another U.S. based company A.K.A. Corning, NY! It's also very easy to read. The Nexus 7 connected to my wi-fi effortlessly. And my bluetooth keyboard also works very well with it. Love being able to speak to the Nexus 7 and it finds what I want. And it understands me every time. Surfing the net or reading e-mail is terrific. Also great for Facebook and YouTube. Lots of great apps available, including many games. Would have liked a rear facing camera. But, not a deal breaker! I like all my memories to be saved on my Sony Cyber Shot digital camera anyway. You still can't beat a good digital camera for photos. The tablet is also the perfect size. Fits in your hand perfectly, not too big or small. Making it a great portable mini p.c. I feel this is by far the best value for the money in a tablet. With 32 GB of memory, H.D. screen, Android O.S. and a quad core processor. You can hardly go wrong. And great Google support to boot. Google is committed to constantly improving their Android O.S.

The first time I sent the tablet in, it was acknowledged there was an issue.  However, a part unrelated to the screen flicker issue was replaced.  In addition, my tablet was restored to factory settings losing all my apps.  When I got the tablet back, I tried it in the same conditions where I was having the issue and the screen flickering was still there.  I sent it back a second time and my husband and I got two customer service agents involved this time.  It was acknowledged that the first person who processed our RMA did not detail the issue in their system.  It was also acknowledged the proper fix for this issue is replacing the display cable (although multiple online reports do mention that the screen also needs to be replaced to provide a permanent fix) and that the battery cable on my device (not related to the screen flicker issue at all) was replaced last time.  They are also claiming they can't replicate the issue and have eluded to the fact they will not fix the tablet unless they can.  A few things with that - there is no way for me to know if they are testing the tablet in the same conditions that I commonly use the tablet.  I have detailed the room conditions as well as the internet conditions including internet download speeds for the agents.  My suspicion is they are testing the tablet with much better wifi signal than my house ever gets and in rooms with overhead lighting or near darkness.  The screen flicker is most known to present itself in areas of low light.  I use my tablet in a room with a bedside lamp that has a 60 watt bulb and that is when I notice the issue the most.  In addition, my gut feeling is that webpages at my house take a lot longer to load than they do in their corporate environment and thus they aren't able to notice the issue as prominently as you can in my home.So, in summary, even though it was noted that my tablet had an issue the first time I returned it and it was noted that a repair unrelated to the issue I complained about was made it does not look like the proper repair is going to be made.  I've wasted a lot of time and money on the defective nexus 7 and I do not recommend that anyone else do the same.I love my Nexus 7 tablet except mine has one flaw which has lead to it being sent back for warranty repair.  In low light the screen flickers with or without wifi.  I have read elsewhere that keeping the brightness over 30% helps this issue but that is just too bright for me.  I called Asus and they wanted to test it so it was sent back under warranty.  The tech I spoke with over the phone said that usually reloading the software fixes it and if not then a screen replacement will fix it.Other than that, this is an awesome tablet.  It is amazingly portable, so light weight and little but still powerful.  I would recommend the 32GB one over the smaller one because the price difference isn't really that significant and you can store more music on the larger one.  The screen keyboard is quite comfortable and responsive and the battery life is great.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than kindle", "Author": "molly", "ReviewID": "RJGKL3ZJSB70Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i recently purchased a kindle fire hd, the operating system is confusing and not very user friendly; i exchanged it for the nexus 7 its great, u like to personalize this is the tablet for you.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good as it gets", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R60TUA69R7G2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a substitution for an ipad.

Not because of power or flair, but because it's well supported due to being google's own tablet.Android was long shunned because of poor performance and lack of the variety of apps that Apple is able to provide on its own app store. I'd have to say after using it for a few days that the app store is no big deal. Not even a factor in the decision any more.Given that, this tablet does have its advantages over the more expensive Apple counterparts. These include the ability to customize the way it looks (without rooting). This can of course be done on Apple devices via jailbreaking, but I never recommend hacking a device unless you're completely dissatisfied with it. If you want more of an apple themed lock screen, there are some downloadable from the google play store. If want a live wallpaper of swimming koi that you can scare away with the flick of a finger, then you can have it. Overall I think the aesthetics of more recent android versions are better than many iOS features these days.Pros:-Approx. 6 hours battery life on non demanding games-One of the cheapest tablets on the market!-32GB space. I have over 2300 songs on it and there's plenty of space for all the games and videos I want-Great Wi-Fi range. I've seen this one mentioned before and it holds true with my Wi-Fi-Small enough for comfort, large enough for decent viewingCons:-Lower resolution than the full sized iPad. This isn't really an issue that I've found comes up, but there you have it. (still beats the more expensive iPad mini by a fair margin)-Low volume. I've found that a lot of my music isn't as loud as I'd like (probably too loud honestly). This hasn't really been an issue, but something I'm nit picky about because I'm an audiophile sometimes.Well there you have it. If you want to save some cash and get basically every feature you could find on the iPad mini, then get the nexus 7. I do have to make note of the potential upcoming reveal of the \"nexus 2\" though.

Tuesday, Feb 5By the end of last week, I'm still led to believe that they have not recieved my unit (otherwise, I should be seeing status info). Sent several more requests asking for status. Finally, today I receive the following:Although the unit was delivered, information will not be available unless the unit was keyed-in for repair or service.Huh, they've had it nearly 2 weeks and have not decided whether to service or repair the unit?

Your web site that is supposed to provide status of my RMA actually provides no useful information at at all.

We here at the ASUS Service Center may have had your machine for several weeks now... or not.  But, ignoring silly issues of where your machine may be located  right now , we can't give you any status information because, as it turns out, we only provide that information to customers once someone here decides to actually service or repair your machine.  Then, we have to find someone on our staff who still remembers how to key this information in. Assuming that person doesn't make any mistakes (hey! what can we say here, we are all human) it will be only 24 hours after that point that status information will be made available.  And, In your case, it appears that no decision has been made on whether to service or repair the unit.

The Nook was very restrictive about what I could install and it seemed that they went to great lengths to dumb down what an android tablet could do.That is definitely not the case with the Nexus. I still use it as a reading device, but now it has pretty much become my main computer. I've been building my own computers and writing software since I got my first Atari 400, but now I rarely sit down at my desktop, anymore. In fact, when I do use my desktop I am usually controlling it from my Nexus. There are some tasks, like video editing, that are easier to do from the desktop, but I've become hooked on working from this little monster.I have resisted getting a cell phone again, but I'm able to text for free using Google voice. I'm also impressed with all the text to speech and voice command apps that are built into the new android jelly bean os. I have never used Siri, but it can't be as accurate as Google voice. No, it's not 100%, but darn close.The only criticism I have is with the WiFi version. I understand that you need to install a SD card for the 4G version in order to get access to a network, but why remove the slot from the WiFi version. 32G is a lot of storage, but storage space is something you can never have too much of. I tried to load my music collection onto the Nexus and ran out of space. My workaround is to put it on a big flash drive and connect it with an OTG cable when I want to listen offline. Not a perfect solution, but it works when I need it. I would rather be able to put it on a SD.Bottom line, though, is that I'm extremely impressed and very happy with my Nexus 7.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Tablet at any price.", "Author": "aqcrc51", "ReviewID": "R7BDEJNAMIQ0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 is simply put an amazing tablet.

The main purpose was communication - sending and receiving emails, making phone and Skype calls, browsing the internet, Google drive, and connecting to various financial and non-financial services.  All of these functions can easily be performed on a smart phone, but I wanted a bigger screen.  My first disappointment was that many  service apps do not work on N7 so I could not even download them.  As far as calls are concerned, the only application that to my knowledge allows making phone calls from N7 (as opposed to redirecting calls to an external phone which is pointless) is Talkatone and it crashes regularly, about every time I try to use it.  Skype seems to be working OK, but does not seem to support Bluetooth connection.  The touch screen keyboard is a step down from previous versions of Android or Ipad, as it does not have a \"pop-up\" display of letters being touched, it merely highlights them which is difficult to read.  The speaker sound quality is rather mediocre comparing to Ipad. Another annoying feature is that the synchronization function indiscriminately imports every email, phone number, or spam sent to my Gmail or Skype accounts, so my address book is littered with hundreds of totally useless entries or multiple entries for the same contact.The \"upgrade\" to Android 4.2.1 that Google pushed was a disaster - the device became more sluggish in response and crashing from time to time, and Bluetooth stopped working properly - a problem reported by many users.  Google technical support is a bad joke, a complete waste of time as all they send you is surveys how they are doing.  They are doing terribly.So to sum it up, the functionality of N7 is lower than that of my smart phone that I bought some 3 years ago for half the price.  The only functions that work seamlessly on N7 are email, net browser, and Google drive, everything else is at best so-so or outright bad.  Bluetooth does NOT work at all, so this device is useless to anyone who plans to use this function extensively.  It is not a big deal to me, I can use a corded headset, but it is disappointing.  I do not own an Ipad but many of my friends do and they seem to be happy with them.  I wish I could say the same about N7, but unfortunately it gives me mostly frustration and so-so service.

Google play messed up replacement, refused to send another device and refused to give my money back. Credit Card company had to intervene to rescue my money.

Sold it again.None of my devices were manhandled or dropped.

Some is expected, but it has been worse than I hoped for from a Nexus device. If these were the only problems I\u2019d probably give 3.5 stars.HOWEVER, (this is going to be a ridiculously long story skip to the summary at the end if you want)maybe 5 months after I got it, the OS wouldn't boot. Just the X showing forever, restarting the bootloader didn't help. After calling and chatting, Asus agreed to take it back. They sent the RMA form, but no shipping label. Then I had to convince them to pay for shipping, and they caved reluctantly, said they would 'make an exception'.It takes them a month to turn it around. The confirmed that all they had to do was reinstall the OS, no hardware work, and it took a month. Fine. Whatever, it was working again.2 months later the OS stops working a different way. It keeps throwing up Android System errors more and more often, so I try a factory reset (standard fix) but it won't even get through the device setup because the system errors keep popping up and preventing it. So then I go through the same process as the first time - call, chat, RMA, chat again to get them to pay for shipping (this is Feb 10th) I send it back (note: perfect physical condition, just OS problems).After a couple of days I get the confirmation from FedEx that it has arrived at Asus in Texas. 5 days go by, I hear nothing and the RMA status online still says 'waiting' or something. I chat online, the guy says he'll flag it as urgent (which they already said they would before I sent it since it was the 2nd time it broke and I\u2019ve already been without it for a month). Next day I get an email saying it's being shipped back unrepaired because it was received broken. They don't call me or email me to find out if I sent it that way or if it was broken during shipping.I get it back a couple days later and there are multiple cracks covering the whole screen. Maybe it broke during shipping, maybe the tech dropped it on the floor and let it sit there for 4 daysI call Asus and chat with them, and they tell me there\u2019s nothing they can do because they received it broken. I already know that FedEx isn\u2019t going to talk to me about it because I wasn\u2019t \u2018the shipper\u2019.So then I file a complaint on Asus\u2019 website (3/22). This is when I start documenting all of the ridiculousness.On 4/1 I started a chat since I had gotten no response, in the complaint system it still just said that it was \u201cIn progress\u201d, like it had for the last 10 days since I filed it. They tell me that their system is down and they can\u2019t look up anything.Mind you, Asus has set up their systems so you can\u2019t contact anyone directly, so every time I contact them I have to tell them the whole story or tell them to go look up my file then wait 5 minutes (ignoring the initial message it sends at the beginning: \u201cHello Andrew Stevens, thank you for contacting ASUS support. Please give me a few moments to review your information. I will be with you shortly.\u201d and I wait 5 minutes and they know nothing about my case).So I suggest that they contact me when their system is back up. He says that\u2019s a great idea. Guess what, they don\u2019t. I chat the next day, 4/2, their system is back up.They train these people to be closers. Not customer service. They say whatever they need to get out of the current chat session and on to the next one.In this chat session then on 4/3, 4/4, they tell me they\u2019ll escalate the case, they\u2019ll have their supervisor call me and they\u2019re very sorry but Asus doesn\u2019t do replacements and there\u2019s nothing they can do. I don\u2019t get any calls, no help at all. They also tell me I should file a claim with FedEx. I tell them I already did (repeatedly) but FedEx told me (as I expected) that they would have to deal with Asus for the case since they were the shipper. The Asus rep finally tells me that the shipping claim will be handled by \u2018someone at corporate\u2019 and he can\u2019t give me a phone number, can\u2019t check on the status for me, and can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going to happen.Also on 4/4 they finally respond to my original complaint:\u201cI apologize for the issues you are facing. As Nigel had explained we had received thetablet with physical damage that was not reported to us in the inital contact whenrequesting an rma for your tablet therefore we had returned the tablet unrepaired toyou.\u201dand that\u2019s all\u2026.no help at allFinally on 4/7 they call me (outside of the hours that I told them I\u2019d be available, with no call back number) and tell me (once again) they can\u2019t do replacements so I should send it back in and they\u2019ll request to replace it. They don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ll email me the RMA form or a shipping label, they just leave it at \u2018send it back in\u2019.So I chat again on 4/8, I didn\u2019t have to convince them to give me a label this time, but I did have to ask for it.I send it in, they receive it on 4/15.I get a call on 4/22 saying the motherboard and screen have been replaced, and they want me to pay for return shipping. So I don\u2019t care at this point, I\u2019ll pay the $7 or whatever.It\u2019s now 4/25 and they still haven\u2019t sent me the form to provide my payment information for shipping. So who knows when I\u2019ll get it back and if it\u2019ll actually work then.SUMMARY:DON\u2019T BUY ANYTHING FROM ASUS", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Lawrence J.

I actually found this tablet much cheaper than here on sale for $149.00 from that grouping website if you know what I mean.  For that price, I couldn't resist getting this.  Yes I know it is last years model versus the 2013 version but since I am getting this for mom who won't stress this tablet out with any kind of high end applications or music or things that like, for the different in price from the 1 year old version and the new, it was worth it to me in savings.  Since I wanted to check this tablet out and get is setup before giving this as a gift to make it easier for her, I opened it and got things set up.  Initial setup was pretty easy and basic, with choosing the language and email and your Wi-Fi, pretty simple stuff for anyone with basic computer skills.  The most time consuming was the system updates, with the tablet coming with version 4.1 on board but having to be updated three times individually to get the latest android operating system that is currently available (Jelly Bean) I believe.  Not sure why you couldn't just update to the latest version without having to update incrementally.  That would have frustrated someone like my mom who wouldn't have had any idea how to do that.  but never the less once that is complete, the use of the tablet seems very simple and straightforward like most android style tablets.  For those like me, who are not necessarily looking for the latest and greatest to give as a gift, I will compare the new nexus (2013) versus this model (2012) version so you can decide for yourself whether the extra expense is worth getting versus this model.This Nexus 7 had a three-piece layered design, boasting a textured backplate, grey plastic middle and Gorilla Glass front, the 2013 model has a single-piece smooth chassis that wraps around its glass front which for some may make you feel that the 2013 feels a bit more high end.  The 2013 Nexus is a bit slimmer and weighs a bit less than this version although in my opinion, not significantly so.When it comes to software the 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7s are all but identical, with upgrades to the latest 4.3 Jelly Bean version of Android available for both.  Now whether the 2012 version will continue to receive updates that remains to be seen, of course you could also say that next year with the 2013 version.  Like all electronics these days, no matter what version you get, you are almost always out of the loop within a couple years.  But for now, to get the same operating system for a cheaper price, this is the better deal.This Nexus 7  1280x800 HD, 216ppi display is decent but the 2013 Nexus 7, has a 7in 1920x1200 1080p HD 323ppi display which definitely means the new version has a brighter crisper display versus the 2012 nexus.  A definite advantage to the new Nexus but you do pay for that in cost.The 2012 Nexus 7 is fairly powerful, with a quad-core Tegra 3 processor and with this model having 32 gb of storage space.The new 2013 Nexus 7 has a quad-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor.  Although the new version is a bit speedier, for someone like my mom, who will do basic internet surfing and not be playing any heavy duty games, there will be little difference in performance and both tablets will do well.  If you are getting this for a gamer, then the 2013 version would do better for that.The 2012 Nexus 7 only has a 1.2MP front camera designed purely for video calling versus the 2013 Nexus 7 that has a 5MP rear and 1.2MP front camera.  Considering I have a hard time getting my mom to use the digital camera I bought her a couple years ago, the camera difference is not of great importance to me.  I personally would prefer a regular quality digital camera over using a tablet or phone anyways for that purpose.The  2013 Nexus 7 has a smaller battery at 3950mAh versus the 2012 Nexus 7  with a 4325mAh battery.  Granted the power management is better on the 2013 Nexus 7 model but  the 2012 model does a decent job at lasting an adequate amount of time.This  2012 Nexus 7 comes with 32GB version and you can get an comparable 2013 model with a similar amount of space but aside from the difference price per gigabyte is a better deal with the 2012 version.Granted the 2013 version is an improvement overall from this 2012 version but this 2012 tablet is a good tablet overall and should serve the purpose for what I am getting it for, which is a senior who has little internet and computer experience.  If you find the deal, like I did at 149 then this is worth getting for someone like my mom as they don't need the latest and greatest.  My biggest challenge with this tablet is not the specs but is teaching my mom how to use it and getting her to use it so that she doesn't get frustrated and make it a coaster for her coffee.

On top of that, I rarely even try to get it to work anymore, which is disappointing given that it's been only two months since I bought the first one and it clearly has potential.As a note about all Nexus 7s (not just mine), Bluetooth is a little messed up. Things it should pair with it won't. For me specifically, that's my Bluetooth speaker, which I would be very annoyed about if not for the stuff that follows. I know the tablet is cheap, but this is just not right.The first one I got essentially gave me the middle finger whenever i tried to use the internet, whether that was browse in Chrome or stream through Hulu. Given that I bought this device to essentially be my TV (Hulu Plus and NHL Gamecenter, primarily), this was a significant problem. It simply refused to connect to one of my routers and while it would connect to the other, that's as far as it ever got. Note that I have an Android phone and two laptops, none of which have a problem with either router.I bought a second unit to make sure it wasn't just me. Turns out it wasn't. The second unit worked as I expected it to work, connected to the internet, browsed, streamed, everything. I returned the first one and then the day after the return period for the second one, the second one stopped booting. I eventually got to the \"dead Android man\" and internet research told me this could only be fixed by sending the unit to ASUS. This was a relatively easy process (though not free, which annoyed me) and ASUS did exactly what I expected them to do, return a different unit to me (confirmed by serial number). I'll give them credit for being fairly quick and not giving me much hassle when I first contacted them, though I told the rep straight out what I had done, how it hadn't worked, and how the internet said it needed warranty service.It's been a month and I now have a third unit. This one is back to the Wi-Fi issue I had with the first one. I'm planning some more tests to see what I can do because I really want this to work. Like I said, I have an Android phone and this is a nice size for a portable TV (or TV replacement, in my case). I have a stand-case that will prop it up on my desk. I did actually get the third one to get online for about an hour before I took a plane trip and was able to rent and download the 7th Harry Potter and watch it on the plane. That was very cool and confirmed that I wasn't crazy to try this. Too bad I can't do it again.EDIT (05/09/2013): I did go back and try to make it work. For whatever reason, I didn't have to do anything. The only persistent issue I have now is that sometimes I need to actually stop apps that stream content, put the device to sleep, and wait 30 seconds or so. After that, I can turn it back on and stream content again. It's a little annoying, but it at least works. I do use it regularly and am finally at least happy I spent the money on it. Bluetooth is still an issue and the Wi-Fi isn't perfect, but it's also a $250 tablet, so what can I really expect I guess. I upgraded my rating to three stars. I'd give it four if not for the lengthy challenges to get to this point.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't Turn On After First Day of Use", "Author": "Rashid N.

I got the tablet back on after reading different \"solutions\" like holding different buttons down simultaneously, pulling off the back cover, etc, and was eventually able to get it back on. It's working now but this problem seems common and should be addressed. My cheaper Galaxy Tab 7 seems much more sturdy and has never given me any problems even though this Nexus 7 is supposed to be better. I'll give it 3 stars because when it's on, it actually works even though its superiority over the Galaxy Tab 2 is barely noticeable (if at all) in my opinion. If I had to do it again, I would gift another Galaxy Tab 2. It's super lame and embarrassing to give a gift to someone and have it break down on the first day of use.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Booyah", "ReviewID": "R1CR8B4OAM2G89", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the Nexus 7.  I'm not an Apple fan because I think their stuff is overpriced.  But I'm disappointed.I like the feel of the Nexus.  The beveled edges and rubber backing make it easy to hold.  The screen looks great.  Sound isn't bad at all.But there are things I don't like.  One problem is that you can't log out of gmail.  This is probably the most noticeable problem with using a smartphone OS for a tablet.  You don't share your phone, but a tablet is something that not every member of a household might have.  It's a perfect thing to leave on a coffee table that anyone can pick up.  While I'm happy to have other people use my tablet to surf the web or check their email, I don't want them having access to my email account or the ability to download apps without a password.  It's an example of Google not seeming to understand why anyone would care about privacy.  There are paid apps that will put a password on other apps, but they all seem to be laughably easy to get around, even accidentally.  Even if they worked well though, this is a problem that shouldn't need an app to solve.The other thing I hate is the battery life, especially on standby.  It seems like this thing always needs to be charged.  I tested it recently: I fully charged it and then left it on standby without touching again.  It was dead in less than 48 hrs.Another problem with the battery is that you can't easily close programs. You have to go through an indirect force closing process.  If I'm going to be on a long trip, I'd like to be able to squeeze every minute out of my battery, but the Nexus makes it hard to do that.Final annoyance: the home button isn't a physical button but a virtual one that's always on.  It's really easy to accidentally brush that button while playing a game.  That gets annoying.I don't hate the Nexus 7.  It's just needs better battery performance and some OS adjustments that recognize the difference between tablets and phones.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most powerful 7\" tablet on the market, even more powerful than iPad 3", "Author": "Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"", "ReviewID": "R1DNDLW2XOU9FO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So here I am with my first tablet, I swore up and down that I had no use for one because I have a laptop and a 4\u2033 phone. Why would I need a tablet? Apparently for a lot and this is one of the best devices I have used in a long time. It's sleek, powerful, and well designed. Why a Nexus 7? Well, the 7\u2033 size is perfect where it isn't too small or too big. I don't like 10\u2033 tablets because they just feel big and clunky. You are probably wondering what's under the hood, why not an iPad Mini, and is the screen nice?The Nexus 7 is powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipset which is one of the most powerful on the market. Directly competing with Apple's A5x chipset in their iPad 3, the Nexus 7 is extremely powerful for a 7\u2033 tablet. This tablet has a whopping 16 cores, a quad-core 1.3Ghz CPU and a 12 core Geforce ULP GPU. The tablet CPU has a fifth core that is dedicated to running in a power saving mode during times of low processing needs. That is one powerful tablet. The Tegra 3 chipset allows for some of the most advanced graphics seen on a tablet as well. Games like Dead Trigger, Dark Meadow, Zombie Driver, and a few others optimize their games for the Tegra chipset adding extra effects and higher FPS. The tablet has 1GB of DDR3L RAM rather than DDR2 RAM which is in both the iPad 3 and Mini and it twice as fast. The Tegra 3 chipset is even more powerful than the iPad Mini and iPad 3 with the Mini having a single core 1Ghz CPU and the iPad 3 having just a dual-core 1Ghz CPU. Even the ULP graphics chip is more powerful than the iPad 3\u2032s with 416Mhz. If that doesn't impress you...I don't know what will.Asus just stopped producing the 16GB models so only the 32 are available now, but that's fine. 16GB really isn't enough space anyways, but there is no expandable storage options. You can use an OTG cable and a USB stick, but most people won't know to do that. 32GB is plenty for games, movies, music, and books. I have over 30 games on my tablet and still have plenty of room. I found the battery life is pretty decent for a such a powerful device. Running high graphic games you get about 3 hours and everything else will last you most of the day, but that's with Wifi on. With it off it is probably 30% less power consuming.The screen is gorgeous. Being better than the iPad Mini with a 1280\u00d7800 resolution rather than 1024\u00d7768. It also has double the ppi at 216 rather than 163 for the Mini. It also is 16:10 aspect ratio rather than the Mini's 4:3 aspect ratio so it is a widescreen tablet. The text is crisp and and images are sharp and vibrant. You won't be disappointed watching high definition movies or games. I also found the screen to feel very nice to touch and my finger would just glide across. The tablet is also fitted with scratch proof Corning fitted glass, also known as Gorilla Glass to some. The glass is alkali-aluminosilicate sheet glass which is the best out there right now. On the back the device has a bumpy, leathery texture which makes holding the device easier. I love this texture and feels so much nicer than the hard plastic of other tablets with their sharp edges. You also don't have to worry about setting it down and scratching it up. The whole device just looks so sleek and smooth.The tablet comes stock with android Jelly Bean 4.1, but as of a week ago the new 4.2.2 update is out. Nothing else to expect software wise other than a great Google Android OS experience. However, if you're a gamer check out Nvidia's TegraZone app to get started on what games were specifically designed for the Tegra chipset. My only complaint is that there is no rear-facing camera. Just a front facing 1.2MP camera for video chatting. However, most people don't use their tablets for taking pictures (unless you are one of those iPad people)Overall, the Nexus 7 is one of the most powerful tablets on the market, and the most powerful 7\u2033 tablet you can get your hands on. With the 12-core chipset, bright vivid screen, and sleek design, any hardware fan will want this tablet. For the low price of $250 for 32GB of storage...nothing beats it!

I was watching a movie from google play movie, then the movie stopped, I thought i may lost the wifi connection but wifi still maxxxxx, at that point I just want to switch to do something else in stead of watching movie, but the table didn't respond, everything was frozen for a minute, then back to normal saying 'Google Play isn't responding\". That's weird. To make sure it's not the wifi connection, I tried youtube, after few second running \"Youtube isn't responding\" and freeze again. So I press the power button to put it to sleep ( not turn off yet) and ...the tablet DIDN\"T COME BACK ON. My battery was still 72% before it's off.I tried to power it on, nothing, just black screen. I try Power button + volume up for a while, nothing happened.I went online with my laptop, searching for help from Google, they don't even have live chat or email. So I gave up with google support and decided to leave it for a while.after 2 hours dead, I powered it on again, and success at the 3rd times. BUT...THERE'S a BIG BUT here.

It is easily rooted and bootloader is easily unlocked thanks to the Nexus 7 toolkit.  This allows easy installation of custom ROMs to get more out of your tablet.  It is also great for reverting to the stock operating system should one need to return their product for any reason.The 32 gig size does come in handy.  Currently I use 1/3 of the space.  Most of my media is kept in the cloud or on USB flash drives and accessed via OTG cable.  This leaves more room for apps.  Most apps are 10 MB is size, but this does vary greatly.  If one wants to install a game like The Sims Freeplay they should expect to have 1 GB of space used up for the purpose.I am currently typing this review on my Nexus 7 and have a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard connected via OTG cable.  Unfortunately USB hard drives like the WD Passport or anything that depends on a PC to power it do not work with these tablets.  However, USB flash drives work extremely well.  It should be mentioned that one needs to \"root\" the device to get this kind of capability.  Many USB items work with the Nexus 7 like game controllers and keyboards.  However, it does take a bit of experimenting or research to find out what will work with the Nexus 7.  This is most likely a power issue as the Nexus 7 can only deliver so much of an output regarding electricity.I imagine future versions of these types of tablets to forsake USB entirely and that Google and many other companies would prefer data stored in the cloud and that all accessories be wireless.  This is just speculation.While this tablet performs amazing feats I do not find it a suitable replacement for a laptop.  Creating documents for applying for employment and similar tasks is not as smooth.  The workflow is just better on a laptop.By itself it is not a suitable replacement for a computer regarding music and video production.  It seems Apple / PC and the iPad are still light years ahead in this regard.  However, as a MIDI controller it is quite useful.Overall I consider this product a buy.  However, it might be prudent to wait because it seems like Google releases a new tablet every other month or so.  It would not surprise me to hear that this particular model is reduced to $200 MSRP and that the new $250 tablet is a 64 GB model.  The fact that my device is wifi only does not bother me as well.

My last tablet had a rear camera and I thought I was going to miss it, but so far it hasn't been an issue.  If you are looking for a great tablet, this cannot be beat at the moment.  If you are an iOS fan and thinking about making the switch, this is a great tablet to get started with.  The quality and speed meets the standards iOS users are used to and it provides a great user experience.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun, Useful, Just... wow.", "Author": "D.

Its a versatile form factor that does so much. Way easier than messing with the family laptop. Since opening this modern wonder on Christmas Day, I have used it to surf the web. Video performs really well, whether its You Tube or Netflix. I've been gaming a whole lot. Words With Friends is a dream on the Nexus, when compared to my tiny iPod Touch 2nd Gen. I'm also really enjoying the free Tiny Village, and the graphically stunning Need For Speed Most Wanted. Skype also performs fairly well for easy videochats with family and friends. I've even downloaded the Kindle App so I don't wear out my trusty Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers.The fact that you can lock this guy down with a pin isn't all that amazing. The dot-lock is a bit cooler. The one that has me wondering if I'm living in the age of The Jetsons is the facial recognition, right down to the extra security of the \"blink test\". That's right... a photo won't fool this gizmo. Its waiting to see you blink before it opens up. The wife got a new Fire HD, so it will be interesting to see how the two stack up.

Also keep in mind that this will not be a review as such given the fact that there are a number of excellent reviews already here (i.e. Sidroy and D.L.C users).So far the tablet has stood up to everything I threw up at it and laughed it off. I have installed the Flash (version 11.1.115.12) and coupled it with the Mozilla Firefox Mobile v.17.0.1 and it seems to be working flawlessly. Also I am running the latest version of Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean) without any issues (not that any were expected).Anyhow all in all if you're thinking of getting yourself (or someone else for that matter) a 7 inch tablet you should by all means get the Asus Google Nexus 7.For actual reviews visit:Sidroy's excellent review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUOLVBTVKIPE/D.L.C.'s review (another great review): http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPE6S6DPRB7C/", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Glad I bought this instead of the mini ipad!!!!

It may or may not charge unless you sit and hold it down on the charger.

The Tegra 3 processor works very well for games, unlike my other tablets it does not lag whatsoever even in the most graphic intense games. The graphic quality is amazing and much better than most others.  My Note 2 processor may be a bit faster but in games the quality and optimizations are superior due to it having NVIDIA in the mix, NVIDIA has the best hardware\\software combo.The body is great! It's a lot lighter than any other I've used which is really important when you're holding it for hours reading, etc...Taking pictures with a tablet is a bit foolish however, the front camera is perfect for Skype and such. The back is made of a tough material which can withstand a lot of punishment, it won't be damaged or scratched. You won't have to put up with ugly scratches which are usually apparent on tablets made just to look nice.I've put it down without a case on many different surfaces and there isn't a scratch on it.The seller I received mine from gave me one that looked brand new.The Pros:-Very light and thin-Bare tablet that's just a tablet without unnecessary add ons which barely work and just creates bulk.-Materials are tough and allows you to just drop it anywhere without worrying.-Hardware is great, gives the performance you want and the battery life you can only dream of. With the passive 5th core, it consumes very little power while still running all your background apps.-Very cost efficient for what it is, affordable new technology.-From Google, full access to all software-Very easy to hold and fun for playing games/watching movies.-Can be easily rooted which is one of the most important features.-Future proof with the ability to sync with smart tvs allowing you to display your screen on a tv.Cons:-No microsd slot, however with an Otg cable you have an USB slot available for flash drives and game controllers to be used.-Extra unused space could've been used to make the screen bigger or the unit smaller.-Speakers are in the back which defeat the purpose, also not very loud.-Wifi doesn't have the best range I've seen but definitely not bad either.-Requires extra hardware just to add some much needed memory and port.Overall for a tablet it has just the right amount of space for apps, books and a couple games. Light weight and easy to hold, let's you have it in your hands all day. You won't want to put it down. It's a simple tablet that's just a tablet, perfect for doing what you need to do with a tablet.

The thing really works well on the plane, stays discrete.For performance - hardly any hiccups, I've had a few glitches and reboots required, but no more than my others.Maybe my favorite thing is the swipe to type - it work's very well.  I can go about as fast as I want and it usually picks the right word, and it has changed my idea of the tablet handicap for composing text.The most functional, value added part of this gem is the built in true GPS.  I'll confirm that it works just fine, with no wifi.  I took it across the US and across the UK and found the GPS never had an issue getting a signal. Save your g-map ahead of time, or get a navigation app and you are in business.I'm working into the Google ecosystem for music and media, still prefer amazon and itunes though.Battery charge is good - easily makes it through a day of regular use, or a 6-hour flight of constant email, reading, movies and music.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The very top of the budget tablet mountain.", "Author": "Moviedude", "ReviewID": "RGHH5Q6X5VXI4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is good and bad news about the Nexus.First the good: The Nexus is a pretty great tablet. The screen is bright, clear, and sharp; sensitivity is top notch; and although the speakers are small they crank out enough audio that you can watch movies and hear what the actors say. The Nexus has a big beefy CPU and as such can play most Android games and play movies with nary a stutter. And it runs the latest flavor of Android, making top of the line web browsing and all the newest features of the OS available to you. Compared to where the 200-ish tablet market was a couple years ago, the Nexus is a huge leap forward and can compete favorably with other, far more expensive tablets.The bad: Asus had to trim a lot of fat to make such a good tablet so cheap. There is no HDMI out for watching movies on your TV, there is no rear camera and the front camera is only really suitable for video chat, and there is no micro-SD slot, so you must make do with on-board storage or network storage of some kind. None of these are dealbreakers, but it is disappointing that these features, which are available on many cheaper tablets, are absent here. That said, I don't use these features, I didn't miss them, and the Nexus is great otherwise.There are two extra features the Nexus DOES have that bear mention: it has pogo pins so you can sit it in a charging dock for fast charging with no plugin, and it has a magnetic switch that puts it to sleep when you close a magnetic case (sold separately by assorted makers).Overall, the Nexus is a top-tier tablet offering an unparallelled Android experience, but you will need to go further up market for higher grade features. If you don't need them then this is your best bet bar none.UPDATESeveral months down the line we are continuing to love the Nexus. It has great audio for watching a show on the couch with our older son, the screen looks great, and it starts cleanly and quickly. I can't speak to battery life because we use it very heavily- it is now an alarm clock in addition to its other duties as a television, facebook portal, and gaming handheld- and it is almost always on. One thing I have noticed- and this is true for ALL Android devices- is that if you have a lot of apps that run while the tablet is asleep it charges very slowly. The real test of charge speed is with the tablet totally off, in which case it charges very quickly. It also installs system updates very quickly, as we recently found out.Still totally pleased as punch with this purchase.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it", "Author": "jayashankar", "ReviewID": "R19OZJO51T1XCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you to the seller for a quick delivery.Took some time to verify the device and its working awesome.Loving it and slowly migrating from PC to Tablet for daily use.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "Yam", "ReviewID": "R1QYL29X8TUS36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "amazing android tablet that works smoothly with a great screen and performanceand of course for a very good price", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like a Mini Laptop", "Author": "Iris E.

For this, you need an OTG cable and an app like Nexus Media Importer.Screen resolution is quite good, though not as sharp as the iPhone's or iPad's. However, the processor must be superior to the iPhone's or iPad's because downloads are much faster. I've downloaded magazines I subscribe to on these devices and the Nexus completes this twice as fast.Battery life is about 9 hours of regular use, about half if playing games or watching movies.

There's no rear camera, just a 1.2MP front facing one, but I'm fine with that as I always find it silly when I see people using tablets to take photos anyway.

With the Bible app, I don't even have to bring my leather Bible anywhere.I love sitting down, reading, browsing, listening to music, and playing games with it. I have notebook apps for school, planners, calendars, and more. I considered buying an Ipad mini because I don't want to carry large devices (might as well carry a laptop), but when I looked at comparison videos I saw that the Ipad mini couldn't really be carried with one hand like this baby can. This feels really great in the hand and once again, it looks great! It looks like I'm carrying around a small book and can even fit in big jeans pockets or pretty much any jacket pocket. For ladies, it easily fits into any size purse. It also beats the Ipad mini in price by about $100. It even beats the price of most smart phones! I haven't tried it yet, but I heard you can even use it as a phone, albeit a big phone. The stereo quality isn't very good compared to the speakers I have hooked up to my laptop (Insignia NS-PLTPSP2 2 Piece Speaker System), but that's to be expected.Pretty much my only complaint of this device is the lack of a back facing camera. That means, if I want to take a picture of something I have to turn it around and look at it from the side... which is kind of awkward.

Vazquez", "ReviewID": "R35HLFX95ERZ40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a big Google/Android fan for some time now. I bought the G1 (the first Android phone), the Samsung Vibrant (T-Mobile version of the Galaxy S1 line), and the Galaxy Nexus. I love the Galaxy Nexus. It's a very cool phone, it runs Android 4.2, but it has horrible battery life. I can drain it from 100% to 75% in less than an hour. So, I can't use my phone as much as I would like to when I'm out of the house or away from my computer. I decided that it was time to get a tablet for mobile media/internet usage.First off, coming from a phone that uses an unskinned version of Android 4.2 to a tablet that does the same, the Nexus 7 is pretty much a larger version of my phone. The only difference is that the Nexus 7 has a bigger screen so the home page can hold more apps. Well, not the only difference. No calling, back camera (which doesn't matter to me). But I'm used to the OS so I jumped right in, downloaded my favorite apps, and essentially have the media version of my phone on a tablet.The screen is very nice. Bright, sharp, easy on the eyes. While some will point out the average pixel density, the Nexus 7 is not a slouch in the visual department. Unless you need glasses and have to have it 3 inches from your face you won't notice a difference. The speaker on the back is good enough (better than my phone), but I'm more into headphone usage. The form factor is nice. It fits in the hand easily, the rubberized back has a nice feel to it, and it doesn't feel like you are holding on to a $250 tablet. A co-worker guessed it's price at $400.Performance is top notch. Nothing lags, apps load quickly, it's very smooth overall. At work (a restaurant in a residential area) I picked up over 25 wifi signals. One from a coffee shop a block away! So even without 3G/4G you should be able to get coverage if you know there is a signal around. Battery life is great. I had it at 100% before I went to work. 8 hours later it was at 98%. I've been able to get 1.5 days usage on a charge even with heavy usage.I'm very happy with my Nexus. I ordered a case for it (that came in today, a day earlier than quoted), and I'm sure this tablet will last me a while. You can't beat it for the price.Edit 7/18/13:I'm docking one star from my review. Having done some research before buying my Nexus I was aware there was a software issue with Android 4.2.1 and the Asus hardware. I dismissed this as a flaw that probably only affected a small amount of users. That is until it happened to me. Got the battery power down to 17% and my tablet shut down. I restarted and it shut down again. With 17% this shouldn't happen. I then plugged it into my charger, nothing happened. I tried to start it up, nothing happened. I spent two hours online trying multiple solutions and in the end I had to take the back cover off and unplug the battery for two minutes, then restart the tablet in bootloader mode. I've had to do this a few times when I let the battery get low and it stops working.Depending on your technical prowess this may not be an issue. It's an easy fix, but if you don't have a lot of technical know how, removing batteries and going into bootloader screens may be over your head. I also had to remove two strips of plastic to remove the battery, so I'm fairly sure that's voids the warranty.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Far, Well Pleased", "Author": "Brian K.

Now, with that said, I just purchased this within the last week and cannot say anything other than praises for it. First off, it's like holding my RAZR M in a larger version. All of my apps are at the fingertips. The resolution is outstanding in watching Netflix movies in HD quality. Viewing photos are equally a very good quality. I leave most of my music in the Cloud for listening and keeping my HDD freed up for more apps. The sound quality is equally impressive. The HDD is 32 GB, which is plenty big enough unless you are planning to store large quantities of music or videos. If so, invest in Cloud Storage. If you're looking for something with 4g service, this is not for you. For a simpler Wi-Fi connection and 3.0 Bluetooth, this is outstanding. I own an Asus laptop that I have been using for nearly 7 years without a glitch. The product name spoke for itself to me.Overall, I love this tablet. I am sure there are others who may disagree. After reviewing other reputable tablets, I kept returning to this one. Many boast of a 16 GB of HDD space at or around this price.

First the size is great, if you're worried about 7\" being too small, it's not; for media consumption it's perfect; for reading in bed, perfect.  Even for use at work taking notes using a blue tooth keyboard it's perfect.  Mine runs well and is super fast.  The screen is fantastic and it's a good looking quality tablet.For personal use and media consumption I think it's about the perfect tablet out of all that are on the market right now; even watching a movie on it is fantastic.  Use Google Media Importer app and a Micro USB OTG cable and you can connect a thumb drive or even a wireless mouse so there's almost no data limit anymore.  It's simply a fantastic devise all the way around.  I'd highly recomend the Bamboo Solo Stylus and the MoKo slim case; those two accessories are absolutely perfect for this unit.The only thing I've noticed about this unit is that it's very slow to charge, even using a wall outlet and when I run Netflix on it, it's not perfectly smooth 100% of the time like it is on my Ipod Touch.  Every once in a while it'll skip for a fraction of a second; I'm talking once, maybe twice in a 1/2 hour.  Also, it may \"buffer\" a bit more often than I noticed on an Ipad Touch or Ipad.I think this is the perfect \"one tablet to do all\" devise, however, if I was getting a tablet that was mostly for business/work, I'd still get the larger Ipad and match it to a keyboard / case from Clamcase.The other advantage about the Nexus 7 is the cost; it's SO much cheaper than the Ipad!!Gideon", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "buen producto", "Author": "Alejandro Blanco", "ReviewID": "RSEVXNV3O1YCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "producto recomendado, en el poco tiempo  que he disfrutado de el me parece que tiene buena resoluci\u00f3n es f\u00e1cil de manejar y velocidad adecuada para revisar los archivos.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android tablet", "Author": "Rogue Elf", "ReviewID": "R3RCQR6KEXV18D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was the Kindle Fire (1st Gen).

It's a \"nice to have\".  Again, everyone will have a different opinion on this.This is my first tablet.  My primary usage scenario is to have this device in my room (hotel or home) for quick checks of e-mail, news, etc. in a format that is more convenient in terms of screen real-estate than my phone.  Plus, good for taking to meetings and out-of-office activities where I am carrying a bag anyway (phone is all I take when it's just what i can carry in my pockets) and a full laptop is overkill and/or not appropriate for the style of meeting/event.I have this set up as an (expensive) digital alarm clock when I'm not using it, and I can quickly grab it when I need to.  Used it on a flight to see a movie, do some light reading on it, and mostly use it for short e-mail/browsing sessions.  Also convenient to have it for maps.I'm a Google user so it was natural to use Android with its strong connectivity to my Google account and settings.  I use iTunes for music, but this is not primarily an entertainment device for me (I have a nano iPad for my portable music for workouts) so that was not a factor.I think the price/feature trade-offs on this device are excellent. Not paying iPad premiums, but getting all the functionality I need.  Have yet to find something I want to do that doesn't have a free Google Play application/widget ready.  Wifi is great (I have a myfi for mobility if I need it) and so far, this is definitely fitting the bill for me.I'm not \"religious\" about this - I'm sure there are many good alternatives including some with features I would benefit from.  But so far, this is exactly what I thought it would be - even finding myself using a bit more than I thought I would... we'll see if that lasts once the \"new toy\" energy wears off....In terms of this specific device, my only negatives are:* I find the buttons (volume and power) to be not ideal to press, especially now that I have the device sitting inside a protective case that I bought.  The buttons are accessible, but I have to \"work\" to press them.* Would be good to have a camera on the back so I could use it to take pictures and not just for video-conferencing.Other than that, no issues so far... very happy with it.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Kyle B. Kennedy \"D-OveRMinD\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q1FDKZ6TZ403", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my iPad 2, because we are just so invested in Android.  My wife has a Galaxy Note 10, my 5 year old daughter has a Galaxy Tab 7, I have a Galaxy Nexus phone, and my wife has a Galaxy SIII phone.  We have a Macbook Pro and an iPad2 as well.  I liked the smaller size of the Tab 7, especially when sitting in the airport or on the plan or in bed, and I like the \"pure\" google experience without the Samsung, HTC, etc overlays and skins.  Plus the Nexus line gets updates before anyone else.  And finally, this uses a STANDARD micro USB port instead of the proprietary connectors like Apple and, yes, Samsung use.When I took it out of the box, it immediately downloaded and installed Jelly Bean 4.2.2...yes, 4.2.2.As far as performance, I really expected a tiny bit more out of the Tegra 3 on games.  Normal stuff like Pulse, Freely, Chrome, Touchdown, etc all run super fast, all at the same time.  But games like My Little Pony, when there are tons of items on the screen, tends to hitch a bit.  Not enough to kill gameplay, but it's noticeable.As for accessories, I HIGHLY recommend the desktop dock and the car holder, both of which I bought from Amazon and are perfectly built for the Nexus.  The desktop dock is a custom snug fit, while the car adapter is slightly more generic, will fit the Nexus perfectly, but won't fit items like the Tab 7.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NP7R7Shttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8ST36", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good or better than expected.", "Author": "Mark Twain afficionado", "ReviewID": "R294SBVB6OD3S8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 I received 5 days ago meets or exceeds my expectations.  The screen is sharp, bright and clear, providing excellent images, videos, and text.  I was especially pleased by the clarity of the text, as my principal use for the tablet is reading e-mail and news articles.  The touch screen is sensitive and responsive.I experimented with the GPS function on a trip over a known route, and it was quite accurate, once I had figured out that activating it involved settings in two different locations.  I have not used the tablet for a long enough period to fully evaluate the duration of the battery charge.One factor in my choice of the Nexus 7 was that it uses the pure Android OS, and it is not tied to a particular eco-system, such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble.  Although it ships with the Google Store installed, I easily added the Amazon Store to my apps, and also installed the Kindle reader app.I was concerned about memory limitations, since there is no slot for an SD card, but I read about the use of a USB OTG cable, and ordered one when I ordered the table.  I have used this to view and load photos from my camera memory card.  The lack of a slot is not a drawback.I would recommend this tablet to anyone with who wants a small, light, easily portable tablet for browsing the web, reading news articles, and e-mail.

In terms of what you get for bang for buck there is nothing that even comes close. Here is a brief breakdown of the device:Screen: The screen is very clear and sharp. It is set extremely close to the glass (closer than the iPad screen), I personally have a preference for this as it gives the screen the feelings of looking at printed material. The 215dpi means the screen is one of the best on the market.The screen is very responsive to touch, and is almost frictionless.  The downside is the slightly large bezel on the side of the screens, but you will find this on most screens.Battery: I get around 4 hours out of this with intensive use (majority of which is playing graphically intensive games, such as Chaos Rings and Shadowngun). For general web browsing and video watching it will last a good whilst longer. It usually fully charges in under 2hrs, though will take longer if you charge from your PC usb port.Performance: There is nothing negative I can say about this devices performance. It runs every current top-end game without hitch, and can happily multi-task with the game still running. Load up Shadowgun, and then switch to YouTube to watch a video without so much as a pause.Scrolling around the interface is very smooth, though occasionally may pause if you have a load of widgets that need to pull live information from the Internet.Finally: A top end device for an almost budget price, what's not to like?", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet", "Author": "Kathryn White", "ReviewID": "R9AHQ2CKLM5YA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet meets my needs, is easy use.

I had read a lot of reviews on the Nexus 7 and I had a few reservations. The Nexus 7 offered a better processor, a better screen, and a newer version of the Android operating system. However, it did not have the ability to upgrade the storage and it did not have an HDMI port like my Acer had.I looked at lots of alternatives, including the Acer Iconia A110, a Samsung Galaxy, and numerous others. But I kept coming back to the Nexus 7. For the money, I could not get a better tablet. So I went ahead and bought it. And I am very glad that I did.With 32GB of memory, I am finding that it will be quite awhile before storage becomes an issue. And just as I suspected, storage vendors had begun to introduce portable hard drives with wireless capabilities. The argument for not adding memory expansion option to these tablets was that you could (and should) store most of your data in the cloud. So the portable drives with wireless in essence become a portable cloud for your tablet.The screen on this thing is sweet. You can easily use it for reading or watching a movies. The picture is sharp, clear, nicely saturated, and very responsive.One of my favorite Jelly Bean Android features is the ability to create folders. On the desktop of the tablet, drop one app icon onto another and it creates a folder with both apps in it. I use this to keep related apps easy to find and use. For example, I have a folder for my network tools (I am a network geek by trade), a folder for my news apps, one for my social media apps, etc.The sound on this is pretty good, although I have one complaint (and I am not alone in this): the placement of the speakers on the bottom of the unit puts all of the sound on one side when in landscape mode. Since most people will watch movies/videos in the landscape orientation, this is a pain.I also wish they had not put the power button so close to the volume control buttons. I can't tell you how many times that has resulted in me shutting the screen off instead of turning the volume up or down.In spite of these couple of complaints, my Nexus 7 is by far my favorite tech gadget.

I've also used other tablets by way of friends and clients, such as iPad 2 & 3, Galaxy Tab 2 7.0\" and Galaxy Note. This Nexus 7 is by far the best I've used. While I loved the drawing capabilities of the Note, the resolution is the same as the Nexus 7, so the pixel density isn't as good. Anyway, my Nexus 7 has been fast, responsive and problem-free for the couple of weeks I've owned it. My only issue, albeit minor, was when I first opened the package and noticed that one corner of the backplate had not been completely snapped into place. I gave it a quick pinch and all was well. But it did leave me wondering about quality control at Asus, especially after my horrible experience with the Transformer Prime. Despite that, I continued on and soon began wondering why I hadn't bought one sooner.I'd always thought that 7\" would be too close to my Galaxy Nexus phone's 4\" screen and thought, \"why bother?\" And after using the Transformer Prime, 10\" seemed perfect. But now that I have the Nexus 7 in my hands and using it a LOT, I understand why it is so beloved. Part of the reason it works well is because the most popular 10\" tablets are the same resolution as the Nexus 7 (although that is changing rapidly) and so you are getting the same real estate as a 10\" tablet but without the bulk. I can hold this thing easily in one hand and if I put a case on it, will still be able to hold it the same way.I've ordered a case and waiting for delivery, but not even sure if I'll use it at this point.

I'm biassed towards everything non-Apple and I will happily compare it to an iPad, because people need to know that the extra edge you get on those over-priced Apple products, you don't miss it once you go Android...so therefore what's the real plus of buying into the i-hype?K, enough about Apple: the Nexus I got is a 32GB, seriously could not conceive of getting less storage but now that I know it is expandable using the media importer app, I will be trying that out- on to things I love:1) Capacity (using a small low cost cable) to connect either a keyboard or a mouse or anything that has a usb connection basically...not that I've tried to connect much else than the keyboard or mouse. Anyone who's typed on a tablet knows it's a pain if you want to type a lot of words, so being able to connect a real keyboard is an amazing plus. ASUS why did you not do this with the EEE Pad?2) It's a much more manageable size so portability is great compared to my EEE pad. I can take it almost anywhere without adding too much to my load.3) Has almost everything I had on the ASUS EEE pad, in terms of apps that it came with, and the rest you can DL from the Google Play store, so that's great.4) Long tapping for a paste button seems easy here compared to my EEEpad5) Transfer of files via the usb cable works great, and the files can be read even when the message pops up that they may not be readable. I can watch mp4, avi; read pdfs, txts etc6) The \"Play\" music app works great, possibly better than it seemed to in my EEE pad...but of course it would be great if I could figure out how to import playlists instead of having to re-create them.7) Bluetooth - so I can connect and pair and share among other devices with Bluetooth, also possibly connect a headset, but haven't tried that yet - gold!Dislikes:1) Has no pre-installed library app...i checked and double-checked...some people mention this elsewhere online, but this is one of the first things I looked for because I loved \"MyLibrary\" on my EEEpad and have tried to find it for other tablets but it's apparently exclusive to ASUS - and specifically to the EEE pad, because they neglected to put it on my Nexus and it's not available to download. Why?!! It's an ASUS app, Nexus is an ASUS product!! If not for Aldiko, (the free version) and Moon Books, I don't know what I'd do...see now I have to use two apps to do the job that one app did for me previously on the EEE pad, and that is a major fail, imo!2) When I first got it, it seemed to overdo the backspace button action a bit, whenever I clicked one two many times, I'd end up deleting everything I typed without hope of retrieving it...it doesn't seem to do this much anymore, thankfully, but it was a serious flaw in the beginning.3) As mentioned before - there is no micro sd slot (this to me is a no-no) - what's so difficult about including one of those? It's good that there is an option to expand via the usb import cable, but would have been nicer to have it built into the device.4) How do I connect to my TV...? No visible way I can see...no other output ports. If someone can tell me how this will work...like the hdmi output on the EEE pad, that would be great.5) (Added July 2013) I downloaded the Nexus Media Importer app for $3.99 and tried to use it immediately, but it told me something about my license not being recognised. This lasted the first few times but I eventually got it to work. If you ask me, I think they should make the media importer freely available, and if need be, ASUS should subsidise it, because it is their fault there is no way to import media or expand the memory.Note to ASUS: I am getting into the Samsung tablets now, and I will have no compunction in calling a spade a spade...if the Samsung outperforms Nexus, then it will be my new favorite tablet and that Nexus will be the last ASUS product I purchase.Feb 2014 update:The tablet is really starting to have more \"incidents\" where I have to stick a pin in what I think is a reset \"orifice\" ...really not sure...never looked at the documentation to see if there was a reset thingy...but anyway, the tablet didn't come on for two whole days until I stuck the pin there...so I guess that must be it...It also is running out of memory after 14 months...I tend to download things I like so I can watch on my tablet...so now I have to remove some of my stuff to external media and use the media importer app more often....", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "powerful android tablet", "Author": "Shimon Harel", "ReviewID": "RX7J851W4VCTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Nexus 7, I find it exactly the right size, very comfortable to hold in your hand, it's performance is excellent,very fast response, the screen is great to read from (not like a dedicated reader, but very sharp) it's light weight makes it easy to handle without a table and it's Android, what more do you want?", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet ever", "Author": "HerbstFam \"HerbstFam\"", "ReviewID": "R1S0YKT39KOQNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get it.

We had no technical problems of any sort. Google maps awareness feature is very good, it keeps track of our interest and GPS location and it takes entering only a few characters for perfectly relevant search results to be displayed. Jelly Bean improved voice recognition to a level where we now always talk to the tablet rather than type. Auto updates are terrific, it it nice not to be dependent on the cell phone carrier.This is our second Android tablet. We also bought a Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet a few months before Nexus 7 became available. In this review I will compare the features of these two tablets.The big difference between the two tablets is that Nexus 7 always runs the latest version of the operating system. This is because Google is pushing out regular updates. My Galaxy is still on HoneyComb 3.4. I purchased it through Verizon and they are slow with the OS updates. Why does it matter? (1) Some new features available in Jelly Bean OS are really nice (such as improved voice recognition and Google maps awareness features) (2) Eventually more and more applications will not be compatible with the old OS.Nexus 7 does not have a cellular capability. Galaxy 7.7 has this capability, but we did not purchase a data plan. Instead we use the cell phone as a hot spot if there is no WI FI available. The only time this was an issue was when we traveled internationally without having an International cell plan. Outside US we managed by hovering near venues that had free WI FI.The size of the device was one of the major considerations when we were shopping for both tablets. I wanted to have a tablet that would fit into my purse, so I can have it with me anywhere without carrying another item. My husband wanted a tablet he can stick into his pockets (pants or jacket). 7.7 inches works well in my purse, but does not fit his pants pockets. 7 inch Nexus, however, in its neoprene sleeve is a perfect fit for the pockets. I am attaching a collage of 3 photos. Photo #3 shows Nexus 7 going into a pocket.7 inches is also just the right size to use in the car as GPS. It has a bigger screen that our Garmin so it is easier to see the map. My 7.7\" tablet is a bit too big to use as GPS as it covers a more of the windshield and creates a bit of visibility issue. To navigate we use either Google Maps or Sygic. The reason we use both is that Google Maps requires a WI FI connection and in some rural areas of Vermont and Maine where we often travel there are areas with bad cell coverage. Sygic, however, works from its own maps and does not require a WI FI connection. See photo #1 shows Nexus 7 running Sygic navigation as we drive.The speaker on Nexus 7 is not very good. We notice this particularly when we began using it as GPS as we could barely hear it. However purchasing a blue tooth speaker solved this problem beautifully. The sounds now is loud and clear.Nexus 7 has no Micro-SD slot (by comparison Galaxy 7.7 Tab does have a Micro-SD slot). However, we resolved this issue by attaching a USB flash drive to Nexus by purchasing Nexus Media Importer app (which currently costs $2.99).I like that I am able to purchase apps from different sources such as Google Market place as well as Amazon. If I want to dable in writing my own mobile apps, I can do so using my own PC and free Eclipse platform with free Android development plug-ins (either under Windows or Linux) without any extra investment. If I wanted to develop apps for iPad I would need to buy a Mac, since I don't own one already.Google's Jelly Bean really improved voice recognition for searches. Under Honey Comb and ICS the search results sometimes were hilarious, especially if tried searching on foreign names, but update Jelly Bean made a significant improvements in voice recognition and now my husband only talk to his tablet. It gets it right 99% of the time on the first try.Nexus 7 has a front facing camera, Samsung Galaxy has two cameras (front and rear facing). None of the cameras are as good as our other cameras, so we don't use them much.Galaxy's AMOLED display is brighter and more brilliant than Nexus. Neither one of us sees any difference in sharpness of text. The higher contrast does make Galaxy screen easier to read in the sun. However, Galaxy 7.7 cost was almost three times as much Nexus 7. Is the screen three times better? No.We use both tablets on daily basis. I listed pluses and minuses for both. For me the most significant difference comes down to the lack of timely OS updates for Galaxy 7.7. So if I had a do-over I would go with two Nexus 7 devices.

This was not what happened with my product.As much as I love the fact that with the Nexus 7, you get the MOST bang for your buck, such issues are rather unacceptable for such a great product. Considering the price is relatively steep (upwards of 280$), this product should not be having such issues. In terms of the fixes I have seen on the internet, a few have mentioned holding the power button for approximately 30 seconds, attempting to enter into cold-boot menu, ect... In the case of my product, I plugged the item into an AC adaptor and saw the screen flicker on. Afterwards, the screen remained black. At first, I thought this was normal and would take some time... About 25 minutes later, I eventually concluded that the item was indeed defective... The item would not even enter cold-boot as I held down the power button and volume buttons.All in all, I'm terribly disappointed with this buy and would not recommend purchasing this product online or at all even.

The problem with the reset is that it will not reset to anything, it just keep saying 'Unfortunately the setup wizard has stopped.'So I wanted to return to Pricesmart, but the manager says that Pricesmart is not responsible o there is no warranty if you update the operating system, they cannot receive it or refund it.So I guess that this product is useless.

I have an Apple iPod Touch at the moment, and while I was pleased with the product, I decided that the iPads were a little too pricey for what they offer, and were mostly marketed based on the name. It was then that I stumbled upon the Google Nexus. I've always been impressed with the good name of Google and the services they provide and after reading several good reviews I decided to go with the Nexus.I can safely say that I was very impressed with the product. For the first three months I loaded up some apps from the Play store, copied over some videos and music and basically used it as my primary computer, including contacts and calendar. I stored lots of photos and other documents and carried it around all the time.Then, a few days ago, after shutting it off it would not boot. It would constantly stay on the \"X\" logo and never go past that. I tried resetting it many times, searched the forums for answers and then called Google. After some diagnostics over the phone they told me that there was nothing they could do and to call ASUS. I then called ASUS, and after an hour of pressing this button and that they told me we needed to do a factory reset and wipe the device. I shuddered and agreed and then went ahead. After wiping the device completely clean of everything I had on it, restoring it to factory settings, we tried to reboot it and the same thing occurred. It would get to the \"X\" and go no further.The telephone support then told me I needed to package up the device and send it in to be repaired which will take roughly three weeks, IF they have the parts. So after spending over an hour packaging the device, taking it to the post office and having it shipped out, here I sit without a tablet.At this point, only three months after purchasing the device, I have now lost all of my data, spent  over $300 + shipping costs (which I had to pay) and have nothing to show for it. Also, having spent 2.5 hours on the phone and another hour packaging and shipping the device, not to mention the time I spent trying to boot it back up myself. The best case scenario now is that they can somehow fix the device and send it back, basically a refurb, and then hope that it will work correctly and is worth going back and reinstalling all of my apps and data from the beginning.Before this experience I always viewed Google as a quality company and I highly recommended the Nexus to my friends and family. In light of this experience I am not impressed. I will consider this my last purchase of any kind with the name Google or Asus, and the first of many complaints to my friends and family of the poor quality of Google products, and its services.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA Seems Common Problem", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R2B295OX04U5DA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered the 32GB Nexus 7 for a Christmas present for the wife.

Driver", "ReviewID": "R364WL7AY1C75O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For background - I have had a budget Android tablet and several Android phones for personal use, and I have an iPad and an iPhone for work, and my wife has a Nook Color, so I am well-versed in mobile technology and capability.I've had this tablet for around a month, and overall, I quite like it.  I got it primarily for web-browsing, ebooks (via the Nook app), and games, with some light productivity, mostly around the house.  I had expected to continue to use my mobile to listen to music at home, and to check Facebook and email, since it's \"pocketable\" and I have it on my most of the time.  As it turns out, the Nexus, while not something I'd take out with me running errands, fits nicely in a front pants pocket, and I find myself using it almost exclusively as my mobile device while I'm at home, for everything but phone calls.Here are the details:Pros:*The screen is amazing - very crisp, with deep blacks, great viewing angles, and accurate color representation.  Coming from a Super AMOLED screen on my phone, I was a bit worried, since this is a basic ISP panel, but it's awesome.  Touch response is quick and accurate as well.*Super-quick quad-core CPU - this had taken almost everything I've thrown at it with little slowdown.  Oddly, Facebook sometimes gives it pause, but most people I know have some problems with the Facebook mobile app.  Installs apps super-quick after downloading, and loads them up quickly as well.*Smooth, fast graphics - I can't believe how good the graphics are getting on tablets these days.  No complaints - 3d games play smoothly, with very little lag or stuttering.*Super-quick Wifi - I have a 25Mbps Fios connection, and this tablet maxes it out, even over wifi-G.  Downloaded a 1.3 GB game in a few minutes.*Jelly Bean 4.2 interface - Smooth animations, and I love the widgets available.*Swype-like keyboard in 4.2 (you might have to upgrade out of the box) - I got hooked on Swype on my Samsung GS II phone, but was worried about how it would work on a tablet with the larger screen.  While the keyboard isn't actually Swype, but rather an Android-stock knock-off, it works very well. Only complaint is that the function to add words to the dictionary after manually spelling them out is not always available.*Media - video playback is superb, due to the great screen, and the sound is decent-ish without headphones.  Plug headphones in, and the sound is great - not distorted, with decent dynamic range.  Netflix works great, as does Youtube, Vimeo, and other streaming apps.*Form factor/feel - despite minor issues with build quality I touch on below, this is pleasant to hold.  Enough heft you know it's not a cheaply made device, but not too heavy, with a nicely textured rubber back.  The closest thing I can compare it to is the Nook Color - the rubberized back makes both devices easy to hold, although this has a glass bezel, so it gets thumbprints easily.  No worries - the glass cleans nicely with a cloth, or in a pinch, the tail of a t-shirt.*Battery life - lasts from morning to night, while checking email, web, Facebook, etc., watching Youtube videos, and playing lots of games (usually Angry Birds or Minecraft).  Easily lasts 12 hours of light-to-medium intermittent use throughout the day.*Standard Micro-USB port - THANK YOU!  So many tablets these days use proprietary charging/data ports, so this was very refreshing, and since I have several high-current USB chargers, I'm not lacking for places to plug this thing in, when the battery finally does die.Cons*Build quality - as I mentioned above, there are a couple minor issues.  For one, there's a plastic trim ring running around the device, that has a bit of flex in it.  And due to this, it appears the glass on the left side (viewing it in portrait mode) is pushed up a bit.  This is only an illusion - the plastic trim ring has warped a bit, so that the edge of the glass is exposed by a hair's breadth, where on the other sides of the device, the plastic trim is raised above the glass ever-so-slightly.  If I'd spent $500 on this, I might have returned it, but it's acceptable given the price.  Although I do hope Google/ASUS do change this bit of the design on future revisions, as I've read about it in other reviews.  This is what I docked the star off for.*No SD card - worth noting, but since I knew this going in, I didn't dock a star.  I know Google/ASUS wanted to charge a premium for extra storage, but come on - microSD ports wouldn't have added a lot of cost, and wouldn't have required much space.  This was a very Apple thing to do.  That said, 32GB is a lot of storage, and with so many cloud services supported, I mainly only need the local storage for games and to sync Google data.Some apps I'd recommend:Spotify - the best streaming music service I've tried, the app works great on this tabletGrand Theft Auto Vice City - if you liked the original, it will be a blast form the pastMinecraft PE - Minecraft, on a tabletAngry Birds Star Wars - best Angry Birds game so far, IMOGoogle Drive - If it's not already installed (can't remember) get it - this is a great little content creation tabletNook for Android - great reading app, and it works with ePub format, unlike the *other* ebook vendor's reading app (cough, cough)Marvel Comic reader - I'm not a huge comic fan, but after reading a couple free issues, this is the way comics should be readUnified Remote - great remote app to control your PC, with mouse and keyboard capability, it's an awesome app for anyone with a home theater PC who doesn't want to drag out a full-size keyboard.  Get the free version for basic mouse/keyboard/media capability, get the full version for several dozen apps, including every flavor of media player/center, file broswers, power, etc.  My favorite Android app hands down.Advanced Task Killer - lets you easily and quickly shut down background apps, either from a menu, or with a one-touch widgetES File Explorer - easily navigate local storage, and also browse UPnP networked storage.  I use this to pull down movies off my server.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for your Buck", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R1MO9FEBAOVRZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll be honest, I never saw myself owning a tablet, but honestly I felt this one was a bit too good to pass up.Pros:- Cheap! If your not buying off of Amazon, you can find this tablet at $230.00.

The Video is 720P, haven't tested it yet.- No Flash Support- No Radio (can stream online radio)- No GPRS (Cannot connect to 4G, 3G networks, though there is a Nexus that can)- No EDGENow something I love about this tablet is the screen resolution. 1280x800, it has better image quality than the iPad Mini. The Nexus 7 has 216 ppi compared to the iPad Mini's 163 ppi, overall the Nexus 7 has a higher density pixel display. My uncle, who works for Microsoft is envious of it's quality display when compared to his iPad Mini (he hates Microsoft products). The display has a contrast ratio of 908:1, which is very excellent. It's really too bad that there aren't amazing speakers to go with this amazing display, and that's the devices's greatest failure in my opinion.The speakers are soft spoken, and when raised too high emit some weak strained audio. They work, they get the job done, but when it comes to watching some Netflix in bed, I get out the headphones. Otherwise they're okay for the on the spot you tubing and what not, they just could be better is all. Here are the stats on decibels:Loudspeaker Voice 68dB / Noise 65dB / Ring 75dBAudio quality Noise -69.8dB / Crosstalk -72.1dBThe keyboard is pretty intelligent and smooth. There have been updates since it's release and one of them included the swipe keyboard. It works really well. My only complaint is that occasionally it auto corrects something oddly, but that's not something an update could easily solve.Now for me the camera wasn't a very big deal, it's primary purpose I assume would be for skyping. If I'm planning on a skype session, I would probably bring the laptop out. So I don't think I'm ever going to really need the camera. The camera genuinely sucks though, it's pixally and could have been a lot better. Still, I suppose when Google made it, they weren't really intending the user to take high quality photos with their tablet. I'll give them leniency here, since it's a fairly useless feature on a tablet anyways.The Nexus 7 runs on 1GB of ram, and has a Tegra 3 Quad-core processor. Basically it runs very fast. It has yet to freeze up on me, not counting when a crappy app crashes. It can run multiple apps with breeze and smoothly transition through them. Apps load very quickly, as do webpages. Boot up is a matter of a second or so. I love how the unit doesn't overheat, ever.There are two very large copper heat sinks that surround the tablet that give it this ability. I've used this tablet throughout the entire day with multiple apps open, streaming videos, playing games, and it only gives off a mild warmth.The system software itself is amazing. Jellybean works splendidly and is indeed very buttery. Transitions through apps are very graceful and pleasing to the eye. I personally like the color layout the system has (black and a particular blue text). The navigation is very easy to figure out and the tablet is very easy to use. There are a lot of system adjustments you can do, and my personal favorite feature is the message for the lock screen. I have an if found message, being the forgetful person I am I thought this was a nice touch since I don't want to sharpey my name on the device. One of the greatest featues of Android, in my opinion, is the ability to customize your device. There's a nice array of widgets out there, that and some neat live wallpaper. Unlike the iPad Mini, one Nexus' display could look vastly different than the next one, while the iPads only differ in background and App choices. The system is very simple and easy to use, very user friendly.When it comes to browsing the web I've heard a few Flash complaints, since it runs HTML. There are several ways to get around this, but I thought I would just mention that no, the Nexus does not come supporting Flash. The Nexus 7 runs an HTML5 browser, and I haven't had any difficulty with it.With 32 GB of space, you have some room to upload your favorite songs and movies, store some pictures. For $230.00, this is a great amount of memory. Honesty, its a steal, have a look at other tablets and their storage vs. Price - price range.The battery is long lasting. One charge lasts throughout the day on heavy use. Using it lightly, it can last well over 100 hours. This thing is very efficient battery wise. The only thing that drains the battery is the GPS for obvious reasons. Streaming movies, I'd estimate it would last around 11 hours. I've read somewhere that this has to due with it's quad core, and it's extra core. This extra core only runs while it's in sleep mode. This alone helps vastly improve battery life, that and the quad core makes the Android overall very efficient.Finally the design of the tablet. For some, the rubber-pastically like back may be unattractive, to me it's a plus. It prevents slippage, and while the iPad Mini's backing looks more attractive, on cold morning I'd be afraid of shattering it on the floor. There are small indentions all over the back of the Nexus for the purpose of creating more friction. It's supposed to allow a firm grip, even if your palms are sweaty. The face of the Nexus looks very sleek, it doesn't gather much smudge and is very simple to clean. I think the silvery lining around the edge of the device adds a nice touch as well. The face of the screen is made with Corning\u00ae Fit Glass, which is scratch resistant. I have yet to get a case for the device, but from what I can tell, there aren't even light surface scratches.Also just a quick bit about Corning\u00ae Fit Glass, I'm guessing it's a Corning\u00ae product. Asus is using Corning\u00ae Fit Glass in all of its newly announced products. Earlier Asus stated that they would be using Corning\u00aeGorilla\u00aeGlass2 in all of their 2012 products, so I'm not what's really going on. I'm assuming it's a Corning\u00ae product because the title is capitalized, \"Fit Glass\", on all of the product descriptions, other people assume it's just scratch resistant glass that Corning\u00ae fitted for Asus. Whatever your take on it, the glass has so far proven resilient for me, so they are probably using the same technique for making the product as they have for Gorilla\u00aeGlass, or better.Here's Asus' statement on it: \"ASUS TruVivid technology with Corning\u00ae Fit Glass for improved color clarity and scratch resistance.\"Overall I love this tablet. It's certainly the best bang for your buck. It looks like quality, it feels like quality, best of all, it is quality. I enjoy the size, and feel the 7 inch screen is just right. I can hold this tablet comfortably in one hand, and could even fit it inside my pocket. It's the best deal out there when concerning price and quality. Comparing it to my Uncle's iPad Mini, I'd say it can do everything his can do, only cheaper. As for the Kindle Fire, it's nothing compared to a tablet running full Android with access to the Google app store. I've looked through the Amazon App store, there's such limitation on which apps can be used, it puts a limitation on the device itself. Kindle Fire is much too Amazon based for me, and I like the more open ecosystem that Google's Nexus 7 has to offer.*I haven't tried this out for myself, and quite honestly am not certain how to go about it, but the Nexus can run game streaming...

While installing the new battery I noticed that inside the tablet there is enough room for the battery to bump around and get loose, pulling on the plugin for it and making it destroy itself.

This has render the device totally useless, and as I am not in the USA right now, I cannot do anything about the warranty... I must wait to go back...I won't ever buy anything cheap from ASUS again!--------------------------------------------It's an amazing tablet, good screen resolution, powerful, awesome for gaming.The only thing that has concerned me so far is the faulty mini USB port that comes in the Tablet. After a month of normal use, when the tablet is plugged in to either the computer or wall, the slightest move makes the cable move withing the socket and lose the connection, going on and off if you keep moving it.I thought this was a problem of the mini USB- USB cable that comes with the tablet, but I have tried many cables from Nexus and from Blackberry and I figured out it's only a problem of the faulty socket that is not built well enough to hold strongly the mini USB end of the cable inside it.Well, you just have to let it stay still while charging/transferring data, however if you are an avid gamer who plays lots of HD-battery draining games and have to do so with the tablet plugged in, then it's a big deal... other than that, it's an awesome tablet.PD: I bought 2 tablets, one for me and one for my gf, and both have the same issue", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't do it!", "Author": "karoc", "ReviewID": "R78CMDVNXV2JA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't be fooled by the hype!Pros:  Makes a great paperweightI got the Nexus 7 made by Asus for Christmas.

After a lot of research and comparisons to tablets such as the Kindle Fire HD, I went with a Nexus 7.Pros:-The 7\" form factor is really good for reading, which is what I primarily got it for. I can hold it comfortably in 1 hand. The faux-leather backing is also comfortable to hold.-Android Jelly Bean is a big improvement over ice cream sandwich.  I had owned an android phone for a couple years in the past before switching to an iPhone, but it's been a year or 2 since I've used it, and they've made some improvements. Ironically, I feel like they improved it by making it even more like iOS. There are some key differences, as Android has widgets, and has different ways of doing some things. While I guess a couple widgets are useful, for the most part, I don't really see the need for them. I tend to just go into apps instead of viewing widgets. Closing open apps is easy, and faster than iOS.-The Google apps that come pre-installed are well designed. I already use many Google services, so setup was easy. Google Now is also well done.-The screen. While the screen is not on par with Apple's retina screen, it is still very nice, and better than most/all of the other non-retina screen tablets currently out there that I've seen.-Google Play. Being able to stream music from Google play is nice to have.-Price. This thing is a realy good tablet for the price.-It's a Nexus/Google tablet, so you'll receive some future OS updates. I don't trust any non-nexus Android devices, as most hardware manufactures just abandon releasing updates for most of their products.Cons:-Lack of apps. I knew this was going to be an issue ahead of time, but it's a bit more an an issue than I expected. First the amount of quality apps available for Android is really not close to the apps available for iOS. A lot of the news apps, guitar/music apps, and toddler apps my daughter uses etc are just not available for Android. Some popular apps seem to just be behind iOS. For example, the Facebook app is pretty much the app that was on iOS about a year ago. The biggest problem is that very few Android apps seem to be optimized for tablets yet. They're mainly phone-apps blown up to fit a larger screen. Being that I mainly got this for reading (and chose it over devices like the Kindle Fire because I do want the additional functionality), I'm not overly concerned with this, but this could be an issue for other people.-Swiping is not as smooth as I'm used to on the iPad. Swiping from side-to-side simply isn't very responsive. I'm not sure whether this is a function of the device, Android, or both. Vertical scrolling seems to lag a bit in some apps, but nothing too bad.-Android Jelly bean is very good, but does not have the same attention to detail as iOS. I've noticed a bunch of small things...such as background images that come with Android not even filling the full screen; I've gotten an 'applauncher' error message a couple times already; and there are some other things they just don't work as well as they should in some cases (ie, moving the curser in Chrome).-Web Browsing. Web browsing can be a bit cumbersome due to the 7\" size. Unlike on a phone which loads mobile versions of many sites, and large screen tablets which load fill sites, this loads full desktop sites, but the screen size can make sites it a little tough to navigation without zooming in and out.-The Google Play store. While Google has made some good improvements with Google Play, the Apple App Store is simply much easier to use and find apps.Overall, its a great tablet for the price. I like the 7\" size for portability, and for reading for long periods of time. Android is still not as refined as iOS in my opinion, but it's getting there.

It literally loses 10% charge per 30 mins of screen-time when it's plugged in and charging, and 20% if it isn't charging (yes, in safe mode). Search for this device and \"battery life\" and you will see how widespread this problem is. The first week of December 2013 they released an emergency update to fix the fix - and guess what that did? Stopped the units from charging AT ALL. After jerking around with me for that month (being passed from bot to bot getting the exact same script each time), support's next communication with me, five days after my warranty had expired, said maybe it was time to buy another one since after all it's past warranty coverage.

There was an envelope for the card but it was empty and the card was not installed in the device either. I called Google Support and they instructed me to send the Nexus 7 back and get a replacement Nexus 7 in order for Google to send me a Sim card. Seems pretty wasteful on Google's end. Google also charges my credit card for the replacement device until Google receives my defective device. Couldn't they just mail me a Sim card?The Google Support call was good. I talked to an English speaking person that sounded like she was from the USA. I really dislike trying to have a support conversation with someone from Mexico or India or any other foreign land. I was not put on hold either which is amazing!I also had a problem with the Nexus 7 not connecting with my Wifi at first. It did eventually connect. Once connected the Nexus 7 performed very well. It looks well made. The voice search feature was fun and it made very few mistakes recognizing words.  I will add to the is review as time goes on and hopefully be able to end up giving the Nexus 7 four or five stars.03/08: I received a replacement Nexus 7 device today and guess what? No Sim card was included. Please see my video. I called Google Support and they did promised that I would receive an email from a Support Specialist within 24-48 hours about getting me a Sim card. Why can't Google just mail me a SIMS card?03/11/13 On Friday afternoon, I stopped by the Woodland, California, AT&T; store to see if they would give me a SIMS card to use in my Nexus 7. They had one but they wanted a $36 activation fee. I declined. When I called Google support on Friday, I was promised an email from Google Support Specialist within 24-48 hours to resolve this matter. It has been over 72 hours and I still have not received and email from Google Support.  I am looking forward to Google resolving this issue.03/12/13 Called Google Support today to find out what is up with the Sim card since I did not get the promised email from them. Google Support suggested that I go to a local AT&T; store for a Sim card and they said I was supposed to get an email to do that on March 10. I did not get the email. I explained that I already went to an AT&T; store and AT&T; wanted an activation fee of $36 for the card. Google said that the activation fee must be paid even if I got the card from Google. I told Google that the sales person at the AT&T; store said that I would not have to pay the activation fee if I got the Sim card from Google. Google Support said that all they can do is to send me another Nexus 7 with the Sim card. So, here we go again with another replacement process.03/12/13: Email exchange between Google Support and me: I called AT&T; and they will not set up a prepaid account without the Sim card that should have been provided with my Nexus 7. In order to set up a prepaid account I would need to have the Sim card that I paid for from Google. AT&T; suggested that I return the Nexus 7 for a refund because I am not being taken care of properly by Google in this matter and buy a tablet through AT&T.;I have been back and forth all day with Google Support. They finally figured out that I have to return the Nexus 7 for a refund and then wait up to 14 days after receipt for a credit to my account and then I can order another Nexus 7 with an AT&T; Sims card.

Highly recommend, I've owned a couple of Android tablets over the last year... this is by far the best one. The price of the 32GB recently dropped down to the same level as the 16GB, although for most people 16GB is probably enough. If in doubt (use games, plan to store lots of media) go for the 32GB model. I decided to do the 32GB because there is no expansion slot. In general, I try to stick with the \"Nexus\" on the phone as well because these units get updated from Google directly (at least for a 2 year period in the case of my phone). Of course, the first Android tablet I got only had about 6 months of updates (won't name the brand). My other tablet was 7 inch and this was my \"sweet spot\" as I can handle it easily etc. My adult kids have big iPads and the recent mini was somewhat attractive to me. Actually, I bought 2 of these (spouse) and my wife who is technically impoverished did fine with this as she has been using the Android phone. It really boils down to your ecosystem and we've leaned toward Android over the last 2-3 years. Not a retina display, but much higher resolution than the iPad mini, also this unit has a quad core processor and 1GB RAM. I can honestly say it is smooth as butter and we are happy with both Nexus 7 tablets. If you don't have any investment in the Apple line, definitely save some money and get the Nexus... I would say the 32GB Nexus is about $130 cheaper than a 32GB iPad mini and you will be happy with it. Do get yourself a gmail account (free and really a must as it integrates a lot of the things you do on the tablet - although I sync with a email/calendar server (Microsoft exchange) at work with no problem. Some new features of Android 4.2 (as of this writing) are Google Now (a Siri like program), and a \"gestures\" keyboard (a must as I hate tap typing on a keyboard - with this you \"slide\" your fingers to each letter and it is much faster). Screen brightness, battery life, Wifi ease of use etc. all are excellent.

Hunt \"Skipper\"", "ReviewID": "RCMACWONLI5UW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The best feature is the ability to dictate search requests to Google.  The voice recognition is very good, and very fast, and far better than SIRI.  But the results are stuck on a small screen.The Nexus 7 is very fast for Google searches using the installed Chrome browser.The NOW feature seems somewhat helpful, so far for me primarily for appointments, weather and traffic home.  Note that it is VERY hard to turn NOW on if you do not do so during the initial set up (check for on-line tutorials AND additional instructions if you want to, since the NOW option is in a tiny menu hidden under a keyboard if it is not activated).  I suggest you activate it during set up and turn it off later if you don't like it.I had higher hopes for using the Google Maps application on Nexus 7 on the road, but it is usable even without active WIFI and is does give turn-by-turn directions.  You must download the relevant map area, which is not an intuitive process, and the range of the map is limited.  But the real problems are:(i) You must select your route while connected through WIFI, since it cannot create a route without a data connection. You must plan your final destination before leaving WIFI coverage. DONT fully exit the application on the road, or you cannot get the route back - you can suspend it.(ii) As far as I can tell, it does not allow a route to more than one location.(iii) Dynamic rerouting works once you gave a route, but it is not very resposive - it did have the better route than a Garmin once, but you must wait quite a while.  Also, the maps stopped scrolling as I drove.(iv)  Be very careful, since it does NOT incorporate HOV restrictions and tried to route me on a restricted route.(v)  Also, forget about POIs on the road.  But with a WIFI connection, there are some good searching map-based searching tools.Speaking of the screen, for some reason Nexus 7 will not change to landscape mode except for videos and Skype.  It would be much better to have an unlimited ability to change from portrait to landscape to blow up text on the screen.The video playback of Ice Age (included for free) failed on several attempts.  It appears Nexus 7 does not have a very good WIFI antenna.  Playback quality was just ok with a great connection.The one speaker is almost useless - poor sound, low volume, wrong place for a movie.Skype was spotty, probably due to the weak antenna, although it did work very well once.  The pictures of me looked even worse than normal for Skype since the camera creates high contrast images, with lighted areas of my face washed out and shadows totally black.  The pictures of were very small due to the extreme wide-angle lens, which might be just as well given how bad they looked.  Also, you are forced to use landscape mode on Skype, so your camera is on the side - that is a real pain.You can access most Amazon contact using free apps.  Google refuses to allow Flash 9, so you cannot play Amazon movies or see animated radar maps, and who knows what else.  I find this totally unacceptable - an obvious attempt to force you to use the Google Play Store exclusively for movies.Be aware that the device requires you to sync up to a Gmail account for many features.  When you do, you have total Google integration either forced on you (Gmail/Gmail Calendar), or immediately available (Google+).  Good, if you want it.The Google Play Store demands to save a credit card to the Google Wallet on the Nexus 7 even to downlaod a freebie.  I do NOT trust the Nexus 7 to have my credit card number.  The device is not secure.  I am not sure I will ever buy from the Play Store as a result.The Nexus 7 can track your location using GPS, or by triangulating your position from known WIFI locations (a feature available on Google maps).  So, even though it is not able to use cell towers to figure your location like a phone, it may have a rough fix on you.  Decide if you want the Nexus 7 to collect this much information about you, which I am sure it will send to Google.  It can be turned off.The Nexus 7 is good about warning about many privacy issues when you load an app, but there are no details and it is not obvious how to selectively disable features of an app, assuming you can.  You have to wonder about the apps based on all the warnings.There are tow totally annoying ads from the Google Play Store on the home screen by default.  TO DELETE THEM, hold your finger on the ad, at which point an \"X\" will appear at the top of the screen - drag the ad to the X and it and all of its progeny are gone.  However, the top half of the home screen will remain blank und unusable.  If you add more than three shortcuts and one widget, you end up with a two page home screen, each of which is largely blank.There is no way to put the device into screen off mode to save the battery.  The default time is really short, and if you increase it through settings you basically have to live with more battery drain all of the time or turn it off entirely.The Nexus 7 takes some time to start up from off mode, no time from the screen off mode. The device is normally on all of the time, with just the sceen off.So, while I like it, I am concerned about privacy issues, quite disappointed about the Google Maps integration, annoyed by the refusal to allow landscape mode on demand and the insistance on Skype in landscape mode, annoyed by the Play Store ads and the loss of home screen when they are deleted, totally annoyed by the refusal to allow Flash 7, and disappointed by the poor antenna.

I like the physical design and size. The software used is really great. The fact that it is Google makes it even better, especially for syncing purposes. The problem = there appear to be a large number of defective models in existence. The primary issue with my particular device is instability when it comes to tracking my fingers. This has become so much of an issue that it basically renders the device useless. I bought the device to use as a quick reference with PDFs and other documents, and also to search the internet; the stability issue makes it very hard to actually scroll through documents and typing using the 'swype' function is virtually impossible; additionally, the screen frequently experiences 'phantom touches', causing inappropriate clicking and accidental mistakes.

I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.

Went to their website, plugged in the RMA number and learned they are awaiting customer response.  Customer response to what?  I called and got a rude agent on the phone who said they don't notify customers of problems.  She said she would escalate the RMA and I MAY OR MAY NOT RECEIVE WORD FROM THEM. I asked when I MAY hear from them and she said they can't tell me that.  2014? 2015?  They can't tell me. (By the time I receive this thing, the 50th iteration of the Nexus 7 will be out.) I've pretty much written this one off. I could have paid a bit more and gotten an iPad Mini, which I could have marched into the Apple Store had I had the same problem. I've learned the hard way that sometimes it's well worth the premium to pay for good customer service. (Like paying $100 more to fly to Europe on Lufthansa, Air France or KLM instead of nickel-and-diming US airline.)  With the Google name on the product, I assumed it would have quality support.  Not necessarily so.  If you buy it directly from Google, Google will support the product.  If you buy anywhere else, you are left with ASUS's worst-in-the-industry customer support.

Within about 3 or 4 weeks it became glitch, with apps crashing.  But I could live with it because it allowed me to take advantage of the app store.  So for months, I actually enjoyed the tablet even though the screen would not fill with pictures all the way or something else would close unexpectedly and the sound was not all that great.  However, last week, Tuesday 07/09/2013 the sound stopped altogether.  I had already bought a mini speaker to compensate for the poor sound quality.  When I plugged that it in, I got sound from the tablet, but that was the only way I could hear anything.  I called ASUS support and right away they asked had I dropped it.  I had not.  I promptly sent it off on the same day, Tuesday, 07/09/2013.  Until today, I still haven't heard a word.  I called ASUS support myself and was told that they received the tablet yesterday, 07/15/2013 and that I should received a 'repaired' tablet within 7 - 10 days from 07/15/2013 their receipt date.  Mind you, they sent me the label to send the tablet back.  So now, I haven't had the tablet for a week, and probably won't for another week and will now received a'refurbished' tablet, not the brand new one I bought last then four months ago.  I REGRET THIS PURCHASE and now know I should have spent the money on an IPAD.  What a waste!

Another 24 hours later, they Google wrote to ask me for the CSSN number again off the original packaging.  I don't think they were reading my email responses or listening to me at all.  I cannot say how frustrating it was.  After spending a half hour on the phone with their customer support again, they told me they would email the consultants that handle the emailing to see why they kept asking me for a CSSN number.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, and only then did they start to try to cooperate and break through the walls of beuracracy and send me the paper work to get a new device.  Even then it would take 21 days to get a new Nexus and they would put a hold on my credit card until I returned their malfunctioned Nexus.  I bought the Nexus because I was tired of always giving all my money to Apple, but instead I got a poor quality device, was not treated like a human and had to struggle to just get one that worked.  Apple would have made things right instantly, and it would not have been so poor quality to begin with.  DO NOT BUY IT.

The update was fast and seemless.However, having used the Android OS in the past, I knew where everything was. With JB 4.2 things are changed and, personally I found them more complicated and hard to get to. Synchronization and Background data disabling just to mention a few. You also can't kill your most recent apps like you were prior to JB. You can only do so one by one. That's ridiculous.Seemingly, I erroneously assumed JB would've eliminated unwanted and needless apps populating in the background, thereby minimizing sucking your measly 1 GB or memory (RAM). Nope, not even with background data disabled.  I had to install GoLauncher to easily kill the apps and a few other apps like FMR cleaner Fast Reboot to do this on a regular basis. The amount of memory rescued or obtained is simply obscene. I can disable all \"push\" or notification settings but that won't help.Google Chrome is a joke with JB. You get tabs and you can't get full screen view. Kinda defeats the purpose on the tablet. At the same time, you can do so with the Chrome version on iOS 6. The same with Google Maps, no full screen view.I find the device's overall responsiveness rather sluggish, even right after you do a fresh or clean install (restore). There is no comparison to the iPhone or iPad which is silky smooth unless you update your old device with the latest firmware update which can be a problem. Case in point: updating the iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4G to iOS 6.It's quite ironic though. I have the iPhone 5 now. I said to myself, that is going to be my last Apple device I will own unless Apple get's their act together. Now, I am having second thoughts. If a pure Android device like Nexus 7 can perform not well (to my expectations) then how can I expect,  say a Samsung Galaxy 5 or 6 to be much better? After all, Google is NOT known to listen to their customers. They are known to have very horrible customer service and don't respond to customer feedback at all. Look at how they did with the launch of previous Nexus products especially with the Nexus 4 phone?

Android now supports multiple users but it renders the tablet nigh-unusable and everything becomes slow and stuttery. Multitasking suffers, especially. The default Chrome browser feels like beta software and one has to install quite a few apps to make the tablet usable. PC connectivity is as another sore point as the device now announces itself as a media device and the file transfer is iffy at best. many files are not at all visible till you restart and you can no longer play content off the tablet directly. You can't start multiple copy tasks simultaneously. The default music and video players are one of the worst I've seen in a tablet, really poor. The device is basically gimped, there's no USB on the go or any way to mirror the display on to a HDTV.Now, the good stuff: great hi-res screen, but very dull, IMO.

And you can download maps, but you can't use them for anything useful.  It's basically a picture of the map - no search, no directions, nothing)  What else can't you do with the Nexus 7?  You can't use it to watch Amazon Prime videos even though you're an Amazon Prime customer.  You can't use it as a universal remote.  You CAN play music, but the built in speakers remind me of a transistor radio, so playing Pandora on it while cleaning out the garage is a nostalgic trip back to the 70's.  It has neither deep nor rich sound.I've gone online and it seems like there's various workarounds for some of these issues.  And certainly other tablets have speaker issues.  And it's Jelly Beans fault about the Flash files, etc, etc.  In the end, this tablet simply doesn't do much.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "this tablet is very irritating if you previously used an Apple product", "Author": "R.

After being on the charger all night the battery was still not charged. Was able to start it up attached to the a/c adapter.  The tools did not reconized the battery and kept telling me to plug in the adapter even though it was plugged in. Gave it a few more hours on the charger and decided to check it.  System wouldn't start up, kept getting black screen with static nothing else.  I should have just saved my money or bought the Kindle Fire.  My friend has no problems with that.  Sorry Amazon, I'll never doubt you again.****Update****Received my replacement and now I understand what all the fuss was about. This thing is blazing fast. The clarity is awesome and best of all it charges. I will have to change my rating. Even though this started out as bad experience, the customer service and the new working product has more that made up for it. After using it for a week, I can honestly say that this exceeds most of my expectations. It does have a quirk that you might want to keep in mind. To use the built in camera, you will have to download an app from google play to find the app on Nexus. Yes, you read that correctly. There is no visible link to the camera app on the Nexus 7. This doesn't really bother me because I did not purchase it for the camera. So for me it is nothing more than a slight inconvenience.
