Cowen", "ReviewID": "RWYW5ERMLH74E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Double Power GS-918 Dual Core Google Certified 9-Inch Android Tablet  is a nice little tablet for the money.  This tablet has a beautiful display (9\") and displays 800 x 480 pixels resolution. Text looks sharper, colors are more vivid, and games stand out. It comes with 1G DDR3 memory and a 8G hard drive for Storage.  This tablet has a front facing camera and up to 4 hours usage with battery.  This tablet will not do as much as a Kindle HD Fire but it is perfect for simple application and games. I think this laptop would be great to use to play games or watch movies on. The fact that this tablet is under $100 dollars is amazing. I would definitely recommend this tablet.I have listed some more specifications that I considered important for this tablet. They are as follows:* Operating System - Android 4.1 Jelly Bean* Display - 9-Inch Display* Processor - 1.2 GHz Apple A4* Memory - 1G DDR3 memory, 8G flash memory storage* Number of USB 2.0 Ports - 1* Weight - 1.1 pounds* Item Dimensions - 9.40 x 0.50 x 5.80 inches* Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n)Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "...had I known...", "Author": "Rade Radosevich", "ReviewID": "RXLER85MN73IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would have never bought my iPad II!  I am not a fan of Android, and tablets I've messed around with have been miserable experiences... until this GS-918.  We bought a Google Chromecast for the bedroom and wanted something inexpensive to run YouTube and Netflix videos through.  I ordered this GS-918 to serve as that \"remote\", but once I got the unit, I realized how exceptional and versatile the system is!  The unit loads Chrome, Chromcast, Chrome Play Store, Google+ and a lot of other goodies; PLUS it has a small office suite with MS Office compatible apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  The unit is a LOT faster than the iPad, and considerably lighter.  We loved it so much, we ordered a second one!  Highly recommend the system!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "kimberley oconnell", "ReviewID": "R11ZBBS2G2U4L1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good tablet for price, does everything i want it to do. would buy it again. had everything that was listed on it.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gift Purchase", "Author": "Teresa L.
