{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Jeff Richards", "ReviewID": "REX4ML3J1I1OO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet. At such a low price, I was skeptical at first. I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did. This is a great tablet at a low price. I have already put about 5 different games on it and they work perfectly. It downloads the games fast. I get around 4 hours or more on the battery. My son has one of the Samsung Tablets and he argued with me that this one will not work as well as his with the same games he has on his. I definitely proved him wrong. It works just as good as his $250 Samsung Tablet. It is even bigger than his and the display is excellent. At first, I thought it was going to be bulky being a 9\" tablet, but it actually isn't. It's just as thin and lightweight as the Samsung 7\" tablet. This one even included a screen protector, but I ruined it trying to put it on with my shaky hands and while my granddaughter was still up. If you are looking for an affordable tablet that works great, I would definitely recommend this 9\" TouchTab to anyone. As I mentioned earlier, I compared it to the newer Samsung Tablet and it performs just as well. Both my son and my daughter are completely impressed by the performance. Another plus is that it comes with a wall charger and USB cords. I am definitely going to order one for my daughter. You can't go wrong with this tablet. At this point in time, I am 100% satisfied with this tablet. If I do happen to run into any problems with it, I will definitely update this review. I don't foresee any problems though. One more plus is that it has a 1 year warranty. Most of the other ones only have a 30 day warranty. Since I have my 1 year old granddaughter living with us, I even added the 1 year accidental insurance for $15 more. It is well worth it.I just want to update my review:Not only is the Tablet an excellent deal, the customer support is one of the best I ever dealt with. I had a couple of questions and each time I contacted the seller, he answered and resolved any issues I had within a couple of hours. I have been running it day and night and it runs great. I will be putting this seller on my top 5 Amazon seller list. If you want a great tablet and great customer support together, I recommend this seller to anyone.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expected much more", "Author": "Dustin", "ReviewID": "R10CQF17K9V0ZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it doesnt come with the full amount of memory that is advertised...i tried to play some games with it, like the free sonic 3d game, performance was \"OK\" nothing special, and it hiccupped often. My battery lasted like 2 hours, charging took about 2 hours... cant charge through the mini/micro usb port... and wifi reception and RETENTION is poor... it was tough to multitask with internet... it would often disconnect and id have to reconnect... the cameras are pretty bad quality... nothing special at all... i added a 32gb microsd card... pretty much useless since all the apps want to be on the root system... 512mb of RAM isnt enough in my opinion... i often had to stop apps when i was running only around 5 at a time... After 3 days of use, i left my tablet on the charger and something went wrong... white screen no matter what i did... probably 1 in 100... but i just thought id throw it out there... and yes i'm biased against this tablet because i expected much more out of it, then it broke...BASICALLY:if camera doesnt matter: yesif battery doesnt matter(maybe mine was just a bad battery): yesif you want microhdmi: yeslow res screen, but functional: yesnot for gaming or intense apps: yesif you just want for note taking: yesthis tablet wont do anything super special", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked good for us", "Author": "tomi c.", "ReviewID": "RYW08H41AWF4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got this tablet mainly so my wife could Skype with her sister back east.  The neighborhood computer guru helped set it up, and off we went.  Everything worked as promised.  Our issue with this particular model, (I can do computers but tablets are not my cup of tea) was the limited distance away from the router when video was lost.  Inside the house was only about 15 feet around the corner and down the hallway.  We took it outside the house near the room where the router is and could only do maybe 25 feet or so.  The router is supposedly the best that our carrier has and that is Verizon so I can't go changing that around.Bad part is that we sent it back.  Good part is that Adnteck representative Jeff, was very receptive to the problem.  Even though the tablets are not made to just do Skype that is all we wanted it for.  Everything else worked great.  They took back the tablet.  Jeff checked out and even compared it with some other models.  He kept us constantly informed  on the testing status and at not time at all did I feel we were being misled,We will explore other Skype options.  Meanwhile this was by far the best customer experience that I have had when returning a product without being able to find an actual fault with it.  Depending on what you are buying it for, I highly recommend it for the price but even more so for the Adnteck company behind the product.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "TOUGH TAB 9", "Author": "Barbara L.

I could use it as soon as it was charged, but once I shut it down and then tried to turn it back on a few hours later the charge was completely depleted.  Returned it to the seller who was very nice in refunding my money.

One day she asked me how much it would cost to buy a tablet, so we looked it up on amazon to see. We found this one with a very reasonable price and good reviews. We decided to take a chance. She purchased the tablet with her own money and seems to be very happy with it. She has downloaded games, some music, and also uses it for some of her school work. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I haven't used it myself. All in all, a good buy.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Please turn on", "Author": "Scarlet J.

Schlecht", "ReviewID": "RMXJZPOIB5T9F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very limited version of android.  As soon as I received the device I put apps on it but I can not default or move those apps to the storage card like you can on any android phone.  The newer version of jelly bean is worthless if the builder hid most features.  There is no auto brightness, SD card is the thing that gets me the most angry.  I also email support asking why if the device sees the SD and I can browse it that the app management doesn't have method to move off local storage.  If they ever release a build that fixes this my rating would change.I originally gave this this 1 star because they didn't respond to my inquiry.  I now give it 3 stars because the tech support spent a lot of time researching for me and even called my phone to help me.  They have very good tech support.  However, I still can not give it 5 stars because they didn't change the result of the jelly bean.  4.1.1 apparently the tech guy says the chipset or build doesn't allow sdcards to act same way as I wish it too.  I don't know if that is correct but that's besides the point.  The device creates /sdcard and /sdcard1.  The 32 gig storage drive is on /sdcard1 so hench half the apps try to store on /sdcard which is internal storage which is limited to a few gigs.  So you can manually copy all the files over to true sdcard location but many applications can not offload 3/4 of their application size to the true sdcard. Also many music apps don't look in some mount drive that is /sdcard1.  When or if they ever change this I would change my rating.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "For $60, ehh, but I'll make due.", "Author": "Taylor Berrier", "ReviewID": "R194JIFH6RZS4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "NO BLUETOOTH. Saw a review that said you can't charge through the Micro USB port. That's false. In fact, it's way faster than charging through the DC port. Wi-fi is weak, but works fine in hotels and close to routers. There are some games that just plain suck and don't run well on this tablet. I won't comment on the camera, no one should expect any thing good from a generic Android device. I bought this for Google Play Store access, since I am already running Windows 8 on my laptop and carry an iPhone 4s (Microsoft and Apple app markets). Surfing the web, email and some games. Clash of Clans, Bloons TD 5, VGBA I can say all run great. Other faster and larger games not so much. Chromecast was good, even with Netflix. No Amazon app in Google Play store, but no big loss here as the browser works fine. Kindle app, check.SPEAKER IS TERRIBLE. Game Boy Advance games sound better on an actually Game Boy Advance. Starts out slow, but with some fiddling around in the settings, might start taking to class with a silicon roll-up keyboard to take notes with on my Google Drive. Got a case for it at Wal-Mart. All-in-all, way better than my previous $80 Coby.***UPDATE*** This device is not compatible with Candy Crush Saga. I reiterate.
