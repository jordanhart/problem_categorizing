{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price it's fantastic", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "RMZ27FDT5QQET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I've been putting off a new tablet purchase for quite awhile. I've been suffering with an Acer Iconia Tab A100 for awhile now, and while it was nice when it came out it simply doesn't cut it anymore. But I am cheap. A year ago, had someone said that I would be able to get a tablet with a quad core 1.2 GHz processor, 16GB internal storage, Cameras, GPS, and micro SD slot with a gorgeous 1280x800 IPS screen, and that it would be running Android 4.2.1 Jellybean - all for $150 - I wouldn't have believed them. I had known for awhile that at some point prices would come down enough and hardware and software would catch up, and was waiting for the right moment. It came today.Most of the reviews I've read on this tablet have essentially said that it's a solid tablet functionally, but that its construction is weak and it feels cheap. Honestly, I don't see it. While it doesn't have the same ultra-solid feel that the high-end (expensive) tablets have, it doesn't in the least feel cheap to me at all. The back panel, while plastic, doesn't feel flimsy to me. The screen looks and feels high end to me. There's alot made about the newer resolutions like the new Nexus 7's 1920x1200 display, but my eyes can't really tell the difference in most situations. I will say that if you are planning on using this outside on a sunny day, forget about it - it's almost impossible to see the screen under direct sunlight. But indoors it is great, and it has great viewing angles as well. Some reviews complained about the button placement but it doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Some reviews also made a big deal about the back panel extruding slightly past the top screen panel, but I don't feel it's uncomfortable or in the least bit bad looking. The tablet is fairly light and thin, certainly not a burden to hold in one hand for extended periods.The tab comes with Jellybean 4.2.1 and has a build update that will likely launch as soon as you power on and sign in. Engadget reports that it will get a 4.3 upgrade in the \"near future\". The OS is thankfully pretty vanilla, with only a few unobtrusive bloatware apps thrown in. Asus has a skin that IMHO is barely detectable; it's there if you want to use it but you can pretty much ignore it if you want to. This is a fairly lean implementation of Android and I for one appreciate that.Performance seems to be very good so far in my limited testing. I've seen very little lag or stutter, definitely nothing that I find annoying. The screen is very responsive and looks great. The browser (Chrome, I am a Chrome user, and it pays off to be able to sync across devices) seems to run surprisingly fast. I did try a few games on it including Order and Chaos, Shadowgun, Dungeon Hunter 4, Anomaly HD, and Modern Combat 3; all played nearly flawlessly with only the occasional slight stutter, barely noticeable. I'd say this is a perfectly capable gaming tablet, even if not the highest-end, it plays everything I've thrown at it so far. I did experience some slightly long loading times with the games but that doesn't really bother me; waiting an extra 5 seconds to play a level is not a big deal to me. ETA: I just downloaded and played N.O.V.A. 3 on the tab and was surprised at how well it did. I had read that it was nearly unplayable on the MeMo, that is not true. It DID take a very long time to load the first level (a little over 2 minutes), but once loaded it played pretty well. I could notice a little stutter here and there but it's definitely playable. If it'll play that then it'll play anything I am likely to throw at it.Battery life is quite good. With normal usage I can easily go all day long without having to plug it in, and still have some juice left over at the end of the day. I just got done playing Dungeon Hunter 4 for about 4.5 hours and saw battery life was still at 47%. That is pretty amazing. The battery also recharges very quickly, in my experience about 4-5 hours from a dead battery.The camera is adequate. It's not bad, just nothing to write home about. It works, but it's not a reason to buy this tablet. Same goes with the forward facing camera - it works, but it's nothing special. If you want a great camera you should probably be looking at camera reviews, not tablet reviews.I can confirm that the tablet does have its own standalone GPS and does not require a wireless connection to function (although Google Maps and Earth do). Turning off wifi and turning on GPS, I was unable to get a lock indoors, but at my house that has always been a problem (something in the walls or roof); as soon as I walk outside on the balcony GPS Status app tells me I've locked to 7 satellites, not bad. With an offline mapping app like Mapdroyd this will work great as a GPS unit in your vehicle.The wifi seems to run very fast. I ran a couple of Speedtest trials on it and consistently got over 22-24 mbps speeds, which for my network is very fast, far better than my other devices.I am finding the floating apps feature to be pretty useful. I can open up a calendar, calculator, video player, internet browser, and a few other \"mini-apps\" in a window with the touch of a button without exiting what I am doing. Very convenient for a quick check on something, great for multitasking.I recently bought the Hisense Sero 7 Pro for my son for gaming, and while that is a great device for the money this one feels more solid, and more smooth in operation. Also, the extra internal storage is going to be tremendously important. I trust Asus to have better support for the MeMo Pad HD 7 than Hisense, as well. I would say that if you are really into gaming but don't need a bunch of games on your tablet at once then go with the Hisense, but for everyone else the MeMo is superior. The 8GB internal storage on the Hisense really is limiting.I thought about going with the new Nexus 7, but two things broke it for me: 1) cost (obviously, paying less is better), and 2) the new Nexus 7 STILL doesn't have a microSD card slot. I have a large collection of music and offline movie files and don't like having to constantly load and unload stuff, so a microSD card slot is a requirement for me. I need that internal storage for apps, and I want an external card for everything else. Maybe the next Nexus 7...I had wanted a black tablet, but the closest they have is blue. It's a very dark blue and in most light appears black. I got a black TransCover (very nice cover, BTW - makes it look and feel like a premium tablet, worth the money IMHO) for it and it looks for all intents and purposes like a black tablet now, which makes me happy.My initial impressions are overwhelmingly positive. The more I use the tablet the more amazed I am that something at this price point can be so capable. Generally the old axiom that you get what you pay for is true, but in this case you're getting nearly everything you are going to get with a premium high-end tablet in a slightly downgraded package for ALOT less money. This one gets 5 stars from me not because it is the best tablet out there but because it is a solid tablet AND it's the best value out there in terms of capabilities versus price that you are likely to find. For the price I don't think it has any real competition.ETA: 09/04/13 - today I tried to play NOVA 3 multiplayer over Wifi. It didn't work. I think I've found the tab's limit. My son's Hisense would load fine, but my MeMo was unable to join without losing the connection... It'll play solo - though it takes a long time to load - but it won't do multiplayer. I am, of course, trying to push it to the extreme; NOVA 3 is currently a benchmark game for Android. The Hisense is definitely a better gaming tablet. But it still suffers from small storage and lack of support. It took an hour to load NOVA 3 on the Hisense and I had to remove half of my son's games just to get it on there. Again, the 8GB storage on the Hisense really is limiting.So, if you are looking for a powerful gaming tablet, this is not it. It will do everything short of powerful gaming very well, though. I have absolutely no complaints beyond the fact that it won't do networked play for the most graphically intensive Android game out right now... :)ETA: 10/03/13 - Today a firmware update was pushed out by Asus which fixes issues people were having with Netflix among other things. It always ran fine on mine but apparently some people were having problems with it. But this is one of the reasons I went with this over the Hisense or other tablets; I trust Asus to support the device. It has apparently been listening to users' issues and is responding. The fact that the tab already got a firmware update so soon after launch to address issues is a very good sign for support in the future.I am still very happy with mine.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Successive problems mean I have to reduce my rating.", "Author": "M.

Weeks went by and I heard nothing. When I called Asus they told me that had not received the tablet... even though they had provided a trackable FedEx return shipping label. So I went to the shipping dropoff point and got the confirmed delivery information and sent it back to Asus. A few days later the 3rd refurb replacement showed up. Finally they shipped one that did not have the NVRAM Warning error. The tablet still has the poor touch sensitivity that I mention in my review. My advice? Get a Nexus 7 if you want an Android Tablet or get an iPad.UPDATE: 06 Feb, 2014: I've received the second replacement under warranty. Once again when I started up the tablet for the first time, it did not go through the typical first time startup walkthrough. This means that it was a refurb and had not had a factory reset. And again as soon as I went to the Wi-Fi menu, there was a \"NVRAM Warning: Err=0x10\" in the list and this could not be deleted. Every time I try to \"forget\" the network the error immediately reappears. Once again I'll be contacting Asus for another return. I will also mention that the Asus website is terrible to navigate for support and unless you are using Windows Internet Explorer, it is basically an unworkable website. I have reduced my rating further. Asus has completely dropped the ball on this. Quality Control is poor. Communication is poor. The website is poor. 3 strikes and you're out Asus. It's sad because the MemoPad HD 7 has a lot going for it but it's like throwing dice... you might get one that works, maybe not.UPDATE: 22 JAN, 2014: A couple of weeks ago, I went to use my MemoPad and the battery was dead. I attempted to charge it as usual but this time it would not charge. I tired different cables, different charges and nothing worked. It simply would not accept a charge. I returned it to Asus under warranty. It took 3 weeks to receive the replacement (a refurb I assume) and it immediately had a problem. The problem was that when I turned it on, it had already been set up. In other words, a factory reset had not been done because I was not walked through the normal setup procedure. But more troubling was that when I went to Settings>WiFi to connect to my network, I saw an available network in the list called \"NVRAM Warning: Err=0x10\". It appeared as an available network but could not be deleted. When I tried to \"forget\" the network, it would immediately reappear. So I did a factory reset myself in the hopes that the warning would go away, It did not. I'll be having to return this again to Asus and obviously my opinion of Asus has suffered as a result of this.I have reduced my rating to 3 stars/Your mileage may vary---UPDATE: 1/2/2014 - Some bad news. My MemoPad refuses to charge now. Suddenly, I plugged the MicroUSB cable to the MemoPad for charging yesterday and nothing happened. I checked the plug and it was fine but I tried two other cables just to ensure it wasn't a flaky cable. It wasn't. Also checked it with several different AC chargers and on my laptop. NO dice. It won't charge. I then tried a hard reset by holding the power button for 1 minute, connecting USB to power and repeating the procedure. Nothing. My MemoPad is on it's way back to ASUS for warranty repair. I'll leave my rating intact for the time being. I may have to lower it depending on the outcome. I realize that some defects occur so I will give the benefit of the doubt for now.--UPDATE: 10/19/2013 - It is possible to install Flash on this. But you must use Firefox beta browser or the Boat browser. After you install either or both browsers, go to Android settings and set security to allow downloads from unknown sources. Then Google \"Adobe Flash Archives Android\" and choose the Adobe site result which should be the top result. Go to that site and scroll down the page to Android 4 versions and download the latest version. Once it downloads, install it. if you have Boat installed change browser settings to check that flash is enabled. You should now be good to go.. Change security settings back to the way they were if you want to to continue protecting yourself from downloading from unknown sources.---I've been very happy with my Nexus 7. However the Nexus 7 lacked a few important features that the Asus MemoPad HD7 has, such as a MicroSD slot for additional storage and a 5MP rear-facing camera. Asus managed to add those important features, and increase the resolution of the screen while pricing this quite a bit below the cost of the Nexus 7. Of course the newer Nexus 7 now has a rear-facing camera but still no MicroSD slot for easily adding storage.Asus did have to cut some corners but the corners that were cut may not mean much to most people. Perhaps the most significant missing feature is NFC. The case material is not quite as substantial as  the Nexus 7 case. It's a bit more slippery and somewhat more plasticy feeling. Also there is definitely something different about the display surface itself... it feels more like plastic than glass. I don't know what it is, but it's not as easy to slide your finger over the Asus MemoPad display as it is on the Nexus 7. Using a stylus largely eliminates that issue and also eliminates fingerprints on the screen.Setup of the MemoPad was easy. I fully charged mine overnight before even turning it on. When I did turn it on, it walked me through the setup process. Only took a couple minutes if that. I added my email accounts, and Google account information and I was up and running in no time.The Asus table includes what some would consider bloatware. It's not pure Android like the Nexus 7. Asus has created a skin over Android that makes certain things a look and operate a little differently, though not necessarily bad, when compared to pure Android. Play Store is installed so it's easy to install new apps.I have noticed that the screen does not seem to be quite as responsive to taps as the Nexus 7. I am frequently having to tap a button a second time to get the desired action to happen. Maybe it has more to do with the material that the top of the display is made from (plastic or glass?) but I'm not sure. I also will comment on the case a bit more and mention that the bottom half of the case is not completely flush with the top half of the case. It actually has a lip around the edges that just feels a little unnecessary to me. It's a little uncomfortable to hold and if you never held a Nexus 7, maybe you wouldn't even notice.Battery life is great... up to 10 hours. The rear-facing 5MP camera is very nice and I think it takes great pictures. The included camera app gives you some great control over brightness, camera resolution and camera effects and filters that we've all become familiar with due to the proliferation of smartphone camera apps (fill light, highlights, saturation, shadows, tint, warmth, vintage, nostalgia, LOMO, grayscale, negative, sepia, vampire, under the sea, night vision goggles). You also can easily change video resolution (1080p, 720p, 480p, CIF and QCIF) and use video effects (like vintage, nostalgia, LOMO, grayscale, negative). I really like the camera app and the control it lets you have.The quality of the built-in speakers may surprise you. It was much better than I was expecting. I have installed iHeartRadio, Pandora and listening to streaming radio/music is fantastic. I have not run into any apps yet that will not run well on the Asus MEMOpad HD.

In fact, just 2 weeks before getting this one I purchased the brand new Nexus 7 2013!  So when this arrived at my door listing specs that sounded like my brand new tablet that I spent $230 on and boasting the same screen and manufacturer, I naturally wanted to hate it!  I mean, who does it think it is, coming around here acting all cool with it's $150 price tag.  Thinking that just because it's cheaper people will love it!  I felt like it was taunting me because I spent so much more for my new tablet...Then I tried it out...If I ignore the extra apps that Asus includes with this, and if I didn't pick it up (it is slightly heavier and thicker), I would swear it was the same tablet that I just spent $230 for...........But who can ignore the extra apps?I haven't tried them all, but I loaded a video and opened the video app, expecting it to give the usual slow loading and then it goes full screen.  Boy was I in for a surprise!Not only did the video load in no time flat (and we're talking about a full length movie converted from avi format using Handbrake, so not exactly designed to run smoothly on a tablet), but it opened in a small box, which stayed right on top of my other app......Wait, did android just multitask???????????The one thing that I love about my Palm devices is multitasking, and even the Palm only shows one app at a time.  Here I can watch a movie while I surf the net, play a game, or [shudder] work on a project!  And then when I am ready, I can hit the full screen button and watch full size on the HD screen.Okay, I am taking up the entire review and then some talking about video, but you don't understand how rare this is.  NO TABLET MADE BY ANY COMPANY ANYWHERE ELSE CAN DO WHAT THIS TABLET DOES!!!  I've been saying that Android beats IOS for years, and with good reason (better hardware, better software, cheaper, more upgradable, more configurable, more apps, and all by a magnitude of dozens of times (except the hardware, that one is by a small margin)).  But here we have a tablet with true multitasking capabilities, albeit only for video over other apps.  This changes everything we know about computers!!!!!That being said, I've been asking for this feature for years, and it wasn't really a big stretch or anything.  And the S4 came close to doing this by letting you quickly switch between two running apps (which, I grant you, is multitasking).  But nothing has ever done this!!!If you are deciding between this tablet and an IOS device, hit yourself over the head, you might start to think straight again!If you are deciding between this and a random android tablet, look at the specs, you'll see what I mean.If you are deciding between this and the new 2013 Nexus 7, read my review over and over again until you see why there is no comparison!And if you are deciding whether to spend the extra money on this versus a cheaper android tablet, trust me on this one, GET THIS TABLET!!!If you are reading this and comparing with anything on the market today (or expected within the near future, I'm in IT and I keep up on these things), BUY THIS TABLET!!!Okay, I'll settle down now, I've given my speech, and I feel better for having done my small part to encourage other manufacturers to INCLUDE THIS BASIC SOUNDING FEATURE WHICH I ASKED FOR ON MY NON-SMART PHONE IN THE MID-90s, BUT WHICH NO ONE ACTUALLY LISTENED TO ME ABOUT UNTIL AUGUST OF 2013!!!Thank you for listening to me rant!", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's all about balance - 80/20 rule", "Author": "California Person", "ReviewID": "R37D8BJ1PQRGRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only users who may truly complain about the device are gamers, those who need massive computing power (power users), or those who are more concerned about impressing others with their cliquish device (Apple buyers?) instead of the utility of the device.For the rest of us, the 80%, it is what we need.  I own an Asus TF700T 10.1 tablet, so I reviewed the 7\" tablet knowing what my larger, performance oriented tablet can do.The screen resolution is very good.  Other devices around the same price have lower resolution screens.  I had been looking for a 7\" tablet for around $150.00, or less, but none had a decent screen.  The screen on this tablet is clear, the pixels are small enough that letters do not look \"blocky\", and images are smooth.  The movies I streamed from my Flixster App  looked good.  One negative:  the screen does not have automatic brightness.It is powerful enough for everyday use and I rarely noticed a \"power\" lag; however, I am not a gamer.  The only \"lag\" occurred when rotating the device.  The screen sometimes lags when changing from landscape to portrait, but even then, it wasn't consistent and jarring.  The apps all run well, including photo editing apps such as Paper Camera and Pixlr-o-Matic.Battery life seems great so far.  The processer and screen probably help extend the battery life.  Generally, as the power of the processor increases, so does the amount of power it consumes.  The processor in this device may not be the most powerful, but it is energy efficient with minimal loss of use for most users.  Screens really suck power.  As screen resolution and pixel density increases, power usage increases.  The screen is good and could be a bit better, but the tradeoff would be shorter battery life.The most noticeable difference is build materials.  The tablet is entirely plastic, which is not a bad thing per se.  Plastic is less expensive and usually lighter.  Since I keep the device in a tablet cover, whether the material is metal or plastic is irrelevant.  (Table Cover: IVSO\u00ae ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 7-Inch Slim-BOOK PU Leather Stand Cover)One nice surprise: when I close my tablet cover, the screen automatically sleeps and it automatically awakens when I open the cover. One unfortunate surprise: due to the placement of the power button and sound rocker button (on the top right side, slightly under the device), they are somewhat difficult to use when in the tablet cover.The cameras/video are OK, not great, and will do in a pinch.  There is no flash.  There is a front and back facing camera.  I enjoy photography, so I never really understood the need for a good camera on these devices. Wi-Fi only - no 3g/4g.What really drove my decision to purchase this Asus over similar devices was the MicroSD slot.  I like the idea of swapping MicroSD cards.  I can keep movies, photos, documents, etc... on MicroSD cards and swap them in and out as needed.  There is no limit on memory.I would purchase this product again.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine Tablet--great value", "Author": "Wayfinder", "ReviewID": "R2FTUAI1UP7S36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a 7\" tablet and on a limited budget, I'd go with this. At (currently) 150 bucks, it's about twice as expensive as the cheap single-processor Zeepads (which are decent themselves, but slow), and about 50 less than the Samsung Tab 3.  I am a fan of both systems and by no means anti-Samsung... great system.  But I figure the best way to discuss the Asus is to directly compare it with a known factor-- the quality Samsung Tab 3.Comparing to the Tab 3, which would be its most direct competitor:Asus 16 gigs Samsung 8 gigs.Asus quad core Samsung duo core.Asus Android 4.2 Samsung Android 4.1.2.Asus screen 1280 x 800 Samsung 1024 x 600 (both screens are excellent, but Asus has considerably higher resolution)Asus rear cam 5 mp Samsung 3 mpBoth forward cams 1.3 mpBoth have a battery life of approximately 10 hours-- quite good all in all. Much longer on basic music playing.Asus minimal \"bloatware\". Samsung tons of bloatware.Samsung CAN be used as a remote control, whereas Asus can't.  Samsung is kind of unique in this.Asus stereo speakers-- if having two speakers side by side can be called \"stereo\".Both weigh about the same.  They're very light and easy to handle.Regarding the Asus itself.  I had an \"issue\" in screen touch.  It can range anywhere from extremely sensitive to non-responsive.  I would have to believe this is more an aspect of Android than the Asus, as I've seen this on other quality systems lately.  People with dry fingertips will have difficulty using the device and will probably need to resort to finger-covers or a stylus; this is quite common and not limited to the Asus.  A stylus is reported to end this problem.I find the camera app very powerful (it can take panoramic shots) but rather non-intuitive and complex compared to other camera ware.  On the other hand, the results are excellent, even in low-light conditions (there is no flash).Some people have complained about the \"plastic back\" and \"cheap feel\" of the unit.  I find neither particularly unpleasant and would remind potential purchasers they are not paying 350 bucks for this unit so don't expect a Porche body on a Volkswagen Bug.  I think it looks and feels just fine.  I opted for white, but it also comes in dark blue, hot pink and lime green.  (I was really tempted on the green, but settled for white in the end as it's not as distracting and looks more professional.)As far as the response, ease of use, quality, performance-- all I can say is QUAD CORE, 1 gig DDR3 ram core,16 gigs flash, plus microSD card up to 32 gigs.  Far more than most people need.I give it 4 stars because of the touch (which may be Android's fault) and only that.  I give it 5 stars on \"best buy on the market for a QUALITY tablet\".  If someone is trying to decide whether to buy an 80 dollar Zeepad or invest more and get one of these-- get one of these.

W.", "ReviewID": "RTG99F2Z50NWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Usually I wait for products to be out for a while to have plenty of user reviews before I buy.  In this case, I actually pre-ordered this tablet.  Why?  I've had the 10\" Asus MemoPad, really liked it, but it was a gift to the father-in-law.  Also, 10\" was a bit big for travel and to put in the pocket, so 7\" was more desirable.Here are my first impressions with this tablet:1. Setup - simple.  WIFI connected with no problems.  Email setup, including connecting to Exchange server from work, was easy.  Calendar, contacts, etc. all sync'd with no problems.  Date & Time? Just enter your time zone and let the system sync for you.2. System update - downloaded system update to 4.2.2 (almost 60 MB file) in less than 1 minute.  (fast internet connection with DOCSIS 3.0 modem helps!)Why update?  Improve stability -- one immediate improvement was Netflix.  At first, Netflix will load but will not play videos.  After the system update, Netflix works flawlessly.  Wireless connection to my router also seems to be more stable.  Definitely recommend that perform the system update immediately.3. Screen - sharp!  Videos look excellent.  Touchscreen is very responsive both to key presses and screen swipe.  The high resolution really shows, and the upgraded processor keeps up with the demands of the high res screen easily.4. Youtube - super fast response, beautiful video.  When holding the tablet in portrait orientation, you will see the video at the top and suggestions at the bottom.  Turn it sideways (landscape) and the video fills up the screen.  HD videos are very sharp.5. Productivity - As mentioned under setup, email setup (including work email) was simple.  Dropbox install was fast and immediately I was able to access both personal and work files in my Dropbox folder.  OneNote download/install was fast, and notes from my laptop were sync'd easily.6. Social - Skype setup was easy.  I use Skype for both work and personal communications.  Having this in a 7\" portable device is a huge plus.7. Portability - This tablet (without a cover) fits easily in the front pockets of my dress pants, though its profile is easily visible.  It fits just as easily in the pockets of your cargo pants.  This is great for going out and not having to carry too many gadgets in your hand.8. Flexibility - MicroSD slot is one of the reasons I bought this.  Traveling with kids, it's so vital to be able to load videos on MicroSD cards for long road trips.  Disappointed though that there micro USB does not double as an HDMI output (using adapter of course)...my HTC One phone can do that!9. Last but not least, for those interested in gaming...downloaded Gun Bro, (which is so graphic intensive that it causes the 1st generation iPad to crash...note that's the iOS version) and it plays with smooth graphics / scrolling.  Should work just as well for any game you throw at it.With all the pros, and considering that it's almost the same price as many ebook readers out there, this tablet can do so much more.  Forget the cheap knock-off brands.  Compared to the major brands, this tablet is fast, has MicroSD, and is much cheaper.

But this isn't the best performer. The new Nexus 7 (2013) holds that honor (I own one of those too; I got it for the superb 1080p screen; I got the Memo Pad HD 7 for the Micro SD slot).This Memo Pad HD 7 is actually zippier downloading web pages because the WiFi implementation is so good - it's not one of the newer \"dual band\" chips, but online tests and my own experience confirm that the WiFi downloads are blazingly fast (if you have a good ISP and a good router, of course! I have ComCast and an Apple hockey-puck router).There is very little \"stutter\" or \"hesitation\" in any of the operations. Often I am surprised how zippy the operations (swiping a page, opening an app) are. I'm pretty careful, though, about not bogging down the tablet with too many open apps at the same time. I hit the right hand button to open the page showing running apps, and swipe away the ones I don't want.I'm also tidy about what IM/telephone apps I have running at the same time. The Asus apps, for the most part, don't \"run in the background,\" so they aren't a problem, but if you have Talkatone or GrooveIP for free phone calls (via your free Google Voice account, which you set up using your mobile phone to confirm you have a \"real\" number), they tend to want to run in the background to receive and make calls, so choose one but not both; if you have friends overseas, you may have to add or choose from Viber, Line, WhatsApp (the three most popular) rather than installing all three and having all three compete in the background for resources (although I'll give Viber credit for claiming it has a light touch on resources). Then there is Skype, which likes to run in the background. And FaceBook Messenger, which is always active (you can also get apps from within the actual, main FaceBook app, which CAN be swiped away to unload it, but FB Messenger isn't as sparing on resources as FB itself - if you don't use Messenger, you have to manually load the FB app to check for messages).So I recommend that you take it easy loading apps at first to see what apps start to slow down the device. You are going to need FB for sure (right?). And probably the Kindle app for reading books. I uploaded my music collection to Amazon for free, so I install the Amazon MP3 player. I can't get Amazon videos, yet, since Amazon is favoring its own tablet for videos. So that means I have to use Netflix, which runs great. Kindle and Netflix can be swiped out of memory so they are no problem.Asus includes their own mail client, but honestly I feel safer with the official GMail app. If you use Yahoo or Hotmail you will need to check to see if they have their own app, or use the Asus client; I'd probably trust the Asus client over another third party client, but you will have to research this one yourself, just remember that the big companies like Google, Yahoo, and Hotmail can devote a lot of resources to security and updates, so try to stick with them.The included browser is the now probably woefully out of date stock, open source Android browser, the blue ball icon, and while some people say it's pretty fast and slick, once again I prefer the Google branded product, Chrome, in Beta (regular Chrome might be included already; to download Beta, I had to open a browser and Google it, since for some reason a search in the Play Store directly didn't turn it up; YMMV).My device announced it had downloaded and was ready to install 4.2.2 (vs. the 4.2.1 that came with it) so I authorized it to install and reboot. Surprisingly, after the reboot, the Settings page told me I was still on 4.2.1 but when I rechecked several times over the next few days to see if I could re-download the update and re-install, I just kept getting messages that I was up to date, so I assume the update got installed but a glitch kept the update number in settings from updating itself. Oh well. The service rep at Asus told me that 4.3 should be out soon anyway. And the tablet seems to run fine, unlike my Nexus 7 (2013) which had to be sent back due to frequent random rebooting (which the Asus service rep told me is now an identified hardware problem and not software related). The number of affected Nexus units seems small, and the 3 (!) older gen Nexus 7 tablets I owned were all rock solidThe screen seems slightly better than the old Nexus 7 because it is brighter, though reviewers say the old Nexus 7 was slightly more accurate (and of course it's not as nice as the New Nexus 7), which is to say it's not the best on the block but it's good and is definitely sharper than my wife's iPad Mini, though the Mini seems to have more vibrant colors (the colors on the Memo Pad are still vibrant, the Mini is just slightly better). I think they increased the brightness on this Memo Pad 7 and I have no problems with it. BUT you need to go into the Asus Power Saving settings and turn off the reduced brightness that kicks in for certain apps - until I did that, my Kindle screen dimmed to about 60% and I couldn't figure out why or override the dimming in the generic brightness setting tab in the Settings panel. Yep, the Power Saver \"secretly\" overrides your brightness setting.Speaker volume is better than my old Nexus 7, but no different from the new Nexus 7 (what a surprise - Asus makes both). However, the new Nexus 7 has dual speakers located on opposite ends of the tablet. The Memo Pad's speakers are both on the bottom edge, side by side, so the stereo effect is lost. Music quality from plug in earphones is high, I can't hear any difference from my Apples devices although Apple is renowned for audio quality, and reviewers note that some phone companies and tablets have lower grade audio converters or amps.So all in all a great tablet at a killer price. The rear camera is fine for taking pix of stuff to upload to FB etc. The front camera is 1.2 MP, which is funny because the front camera on the iPhone 4s was actually only VGA level, so this cheap tablet can theoretically take better selfies, and do better video calls, than a pretty top of the line Apple phone. (The new 5c is 1.2 MP as is the 5s, and the iPad Mini, 3, and 4 have all been 1.2 MP for selfies). Asus claims on its website that the front camera is autofocus but I believe that is an error. The rear is certainly autofocus.What I like least about the Memo Pad is Asus's insistence on making the stock Google Android experience \"better.\" I decided for the sake of unbiased reviewing (LOL) I would give the Asus implementation of \"extras\" a spin and after a while decided I definitely could not live with their pull-down notifications/settings menu, so I reverted to Android stock in the settings tab. Other stuff isn't as easy to delete or revert, but fortunately it doesn't get in the way. You may, or may not, like the extra menus and the extra home-row key. But at least the don't get in the way. There are some annoying apps that Asus pre-loaded, and unfortunately they cannot be uninstalled. They don't seem to run in the back ground and actually the Memo Pad had more free memory (11gb after initial booting) than I had expected, so apart from being annoying they don't seem to actually hurt anything and I suppose they help pay for the tablet. I just wiped them off the home screens, and ignore them in the screen with total apps listings. Probably the worst thing about them is they will delay the release of 4.3, since all the cr*p Asus adds have to be vetted to run properly on any version update, which slows down the vetting process (and may stop it altogether if an app doesn't spend the money to update, but its contractual terms with Asus forbid removing it). But we have been promised 4.3 and quite frankly from 4.1 up the OS has been pretty slick, for any game-changing upgrades we may just have to wait for a new tablet and give this one away.Unlike my last foray into budget tablets - a Hisense Sero LT from WalMart - this one is not a pokey turtle with a low rez screen. What it is, by way of closest explanation, is a much cheaper version of last year's Nexus 7, with two big bonuses thrown in: that rear camera; and the Micro SD slot. I have a lot of instructional DVD's that I ripped to electronic format, and downloaded them to a 64gb SanDisk card, along with about 39 gb of music for listening to on flights. I can see parents downloading movies for their kids on drives, where wifi isn't available. Although MOST of my stuff is on the web and MOST of the time I have wifi, I think the SD card slot is a great feature. To use a 64gb card in it, you need to reformat the card to FAT 32 from its stock exFAT file format. Then the device will recognize the card. Do not insert your card while your tablet is on or asleep; actually do a power off, insert it, and it will recognize the card and your content when you restart. If you put the card in while asleep, on my device the tablet kept un-mounting the card, until I did a reboot.I hope this helps. If you have any questions I will try to answer them. I wanted black so had to buy locally to get one.BTW pursuant to Asus on 9/20/13, Android version is currently 4.2.1 not 4.2.2, although many reviewers are reporting it as 4.2.2.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eat your heart out i-mini and nexus.", "Author": "Marty", "ReviewID": "R3JP0MNZJVHUMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, understand what I'm liking about it.

I wanted a tablet with a very good screen, but didn't want to spend $500+. The MemoPad HD 7 has 1280x resolution which is what I was after, it makes a big difference. It's very bright, clear and crisp. Excellent quality screen. Battery life was my next big need. This thing has lasted me 3 days of random use with still half a battery to go.

The 10 hour rating, sure, but I'm using it for days at a time between charges so far with my usage (email, websites, PDFs, etc). I'm sure streamed video would take more battery faster. Keep that in mind. So for those kinds of uses, this thing delivers everything with a bright screen and a long life battery for $150 which is way less than the expensive stuff but does the same job basically.If you want something for complex games and intense high definition streaming playback, pay for a more expensive device probably. This is not a substitute for a work station or camera. It's basically a really pretty e-reader, but with very wide open Droid and Google parts/backing.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R22HWX1DUBU3N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Given the price point and specs, I was very eager to compare the MeMo to my 32GB last gen Nexus 7.  I wish I could compare it to the newer Nexus but last gen will have to do.The MeMo comes packaged pretty much identical to the Nexus 7 with the tablet, micro-USB cable and AC adpater included.  Although the quality of the plastic body isn't exactly on par with the other Asus tablets, it's far from what I would consider cheap feeling, esepcially at this price.  I have the blue model.  The only complaints I have with the body is the placement of the power and volume buttons as well as the USB port.  The design of the case causes a tiny overlap of the back panel around the entire tablet.  This is because the back panel is larger than the front panel.  The overlap doesn't bother me during normal use, however, the placement of the power and sound buttons on the right rear behind the bezel make them a little awkward to find by feel. Although I don't have a case yet, I can only imagine a case would make things a little more cumbersome.  Asus also decided to place the USB port on the top of the tablet which also seems awkward considering the standard location, including on my Nexus 7, is on the bottom.  I often pick the MeMo up and try to operate it upside down based on the plug orientation if it's charging.  I guess I just have to get accustomed to it.The display is beautiful.  Colors are nicely saturated and text and graphics are sharp and bright.  The 1280x800 resolution keeps text sharp even when zoomed in.  Asus includes a calibration tool to further fine-tune and enhance the display if desired.  There were no dead/stuck pixels or noticeable light bleeding along the edges.  The screen doesn't feel like it has any type coating nor do I believe it's Gorilla Glass, although I wouldn't expect either option at this price.  There is a fair amount of friction when swiping on the bare screen and fingerprints accumulate quickly.  I plan to purchase screen protectors to resolve these issues.Performance is generally good on the MeMo.  I don't really notice any difference between the Nexus 7 and MeMo HD during normal operation.  Non-demanding apps like financial, weather, email and social networking apps run just fine with no lag or performance issues.  Less-demanding games like Subway Surfers also run perfect, even when the action speeds up to a frenzied pace.  Where I do encounter trouble is with CPU-intensive games like Asphalt 7.  Asphalt ran on the MeMo but with a slow choppy frame-rate that was noticeably inferior to the Nexus 7.  Even the cut scenes were choppy.  My suggestion is to step up to the Nexus 7 if you are an intense tablet gamer and usually play resource hungry games.  Battery life seems a hair better than my Nexus 7.The front camera resolution is 1.2MP but nothing to write home about.  Pictures appear a little fuzzy, especially in low light.  The front cam video can be set to 480P or 720P and does a decent job when used as a web cam for social video conferencing apps like Skype. The one biggest advantage the MeMo has over the Nexus 7, is a 5MP rear camera which is pretty good.  Still photos and video are acceptably sharp and accurate.  ASUS throws in a ton of features for both still and video formats including creative filters, preset modes, adjustable resolution (video only is adjustable on front camera), exposure compensation, white balance, panorama and HDR, and more.The biggest difference between the Nexus 7 and the MeMo HD is the fact that the Nexus comes with plain vanilla Android.  No extra software is included.  The advantage of plain vanilla Android is that you always stay frequent with the latest Android updates first because it comes directly from Google instead of the manufacturer.  My Nexus is on Android Jellybean version 4.3 while the MeMo is still on Jellybean 4.2.1.  In addition to the above mentioned camera app, the MeMo comes pre-loaded with a ton of pre-installed apps and widgets in a similar looking but slightly different version of Android.  It's not the bleeding edge latest version of Android like the Nexus but is still more recent than most other manufacturers.Overall, unless you routinely use apps and games requiring gobs of horsepower, the MeMo HD is an excellent low-cost tablet.  It's basically a less expensive Nexus 7 with a little less horsepower and memory but makes up for it with useful pre-installed apps, a micro-SD slot and rear facing camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good tablet for the price", "Author": "NutRoll", "ReviewID": "RM7JHH3RUBM9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've bought 3 of these.  So far they work great.  One is for me, and the other two are for my kids.  I'm in IT and use tablets on a daily basis.  I've used the iPad, Surface, and the Note.  It's not going to be high end like those 3 devices, but for the price you get a good tablet.  I would say the battery lasts (constant use) about 6 to 8 hours.  This can very depending if you are just reading or playing movies and games.  The screen is very responsive.  The only suggestion I have is get a screen protector, because the screen likes to show figure prints.  With the screen protector, you don't have this issue.  The only con I can think of is that it doesn't have a auto brightness, but that hasn't been an issue for me.What we use them for:- Read Kindle books- Watch Netflix and Plex- Take video and pictures (doesn't take bad pictures) No Flash- Check email- Surf the web- Control my Roku's- Vmware View- RDP Client- Mind CraftIf you are getting it for your kids.  There are some nice apps included to protect your kids.  I set them up with my account, and then use the applocker to prevent them from using the Play Store to purchase anything or making any setting changes.  It also has a parental software, but I haven't use that yet (I use opendns of web filtering).Regarding Amazon.

I also don't really spend much time in physical contact with the back of the tablet, because I keep a cover on it the vast majority of the time.Asus added some software to it that's actually pretty nice. One of the items they put on gives you some cloud storage to use to augment your tablet. It looks like that lasts for a year. Of course, unlike the Nexus line, you can also use a microsd card. (With the revelations about spying on the Internet lately, I think more people will be valuing microsd cards over using cloud storage.)One of the features that really doesn't get much attention for this device is the option of using Miracast. I used it with Actiontec SBWD100A01 ScreenBeam Pro Wireless Display Receiver for WiDi Laptops/ Miracast Devices and was able to very quickly have my tablet screen mirrored to my HD television. This was nice for putting videos up that I wanted to watch on a bigger screen, and for showing off some pictures (particularly to a couple of aging family members who need things to be BIG so they can see them).Miracast basically takes exactly what's on your tablet screen, and puts it on an HDTV (there are some that have this built in, or you can get a separate receiver and connect with HDMI). This is different from something like Chromecast, in that your tablet has to be actually playing the videos or whatever you're doing (where the Chromecast device will take over your Netflix stream if you tell it to). On the other hand, the Miracast approach lets you mirror _anything_ that can show up on the tablet screen. This means no limitations based on who wants to provide special apps or whether they'll give special approval to have their content put on a TV via a mobile device.I've found the performance of this little Asus to be very good, considering its price range. For some people, the extra you'll spend to get up to a 2013 Nexus (or something comparable) won't seem like much, but it IS roughly a 50% additional premium over the base price of this tablet, so that's really not a small difference by comparison.This will run a whole range of apps and games. I'd imagine it'll struggle with the absolute top of the heap Android games meant to be run on devices that cost at least twice as much, but that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. For day-to-day purposes, I've been using it around the house and I took it with me to a technology conference over the weekend (using it as my primary device during that time) and it was easy to carry around and to do everything I needed to do.Note that this won't get Android updates as fast as Nexus (it currently runs 4.2.2, while Nexus is at 4.3). However, many people haven't realized this yet, but Google is working toward having most of their functionality-boosts for Android distributed without having to go through device OEMs for special builds. This will make it less important to be sure that you're buying from a manufacturer that's serious about updating quickly.For the vast majority of people (who want to check email, go to social networking sites, play Candy Crush, and that kind of thing), I'm very comfortable saying that this will be able to meet their needs and the price point is very good for what you get. I truly don't think most people will see enough of a performance boost from going with something more expensive that it's actually worth the money.

Great wife, great kids and the Memo Pad HD 7!", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RMKINF9IYM5S9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update:We wanted so much to like this tablet. It has so much going for it. But about every 5 to 10 minutes, it would turn on for about 5 seconds and then turn off.  This was especially frustrating at night with the tablet next to the bed on the nightstand.Also, the SD card would randomly unmount and then remount. It made watching a movie difficult as it would unmount the card several times through a 90 minute movie and each time, we would have to find the place where the movie had just quit. We are not sure if these two problems are related.We returned the original and Amazon sent a replacement but within a week, it also suffered from the same problems. We are also returning this one in exchange for a Nexus 7 (2013).Original review:Wow!  Where to begin.  Just a note on our background for perspective.  In our family, we have a Google Nexus 10, Samsung Note 8, Samsung Galaxy S3 and a Samsung Note 2.  I have also used an iPad extensively for training purposes.  We just purchased the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 for my son who just started college.Asus has come a long ways in the last couple of years.  My wife received an Asus notebook computer for Christmas last year and it has run great for the last 9 months.  When we saw that Asus released the Memo Pad HD 7 for $150, I was intrigued and decided to take the plunge.  My son has been using it for the last 6 days and he is very impressed.  We visited him yesterday and I got to see the Memo Pad for the first time.  I was impressed and here are my thoughts.A little bit about resolution and pixel density.  Apple settled on a resolution density of about 260 to 270 ppi because, as they claimed, the human eye can not differentiate the pixels at higher resolutions.  That begs the question of why Google released the Nexus 10 with a resolution of 300 ppi.  The extra resolution may be waste but they got a lot of mileage out of it claiming the highest tablet resolution.The first thing I looked at on the Memo Pad was the screen.  OK, it does not have as high of resolution as my Note 2 or the Nexus 10, but honestly, it doesn't matter.  Why?  Because I could only tell the difference when I looked really close at very small characters on the screen.  And I had to really look for the difference.  So how high of resolution is practical?  Well, I could tell a slight difference when the tablets were about 5 or 6 inches from my face.  But I don't use tablets this way.  I usually have them about 12 to 18 inches from my face while using them.  At that distance, I honestly could not see the difference in clarity and sharpness.I have looked at the new Nexus 7 and it has a very nice screen.  But I couldn't help asking myself why I would pay an extra $130 more for the Nexus 7 (32 gb version).  I would gain a slightly better screen but would only be able to tell the difference at unrealistically close distances.  But I would loose storage expansion since the Nexus does not have an SD card slot.  By the way, while visiting my son, I wanted to copy a couple of movies to his device.  I could not do it with my Nexus 10.  I had to use my Note 2 to copy the movies to his card, put the card back into his Memo Pad and voila, he had the movies.  Sadly, this is not an option with my Nexus because it does not have an SD card slot. :(Some reviews have complained about the location of the power and volume buttons.  Asus moved the buttons further toward the back, more on the back radius of the device instead of being on the side.  Both my son and I love the new position.  When the buttons are on the side, it almost requires two hands to push the button, one to hold the tablet and then the other to push sidewards on the button.  But by moving the buttons farther towards the back, all that is required is a \"pinch\" with your thumb and finger to engage the button.  From my perspective, this is genius!  I love the button placement.My son installed Google's new replacement for \"Talk\".  It's called \"Hangouts\".  Basically, it's Google's version of Skype and allows video conferencing.  It worked perfectly on my son's Memo Pad HD 7 but my Nexus struggled with the sound.  The sound was choppy and the volume was very low.  A little research revealed that this has been a problem with the Nexus 10 for about a year. It will never make sense to me how Asus can get the application to work flawlessly on a $150 table while Google can't even get it to work correctly on their flagship product, the $500 Nexus 10!  It works great on every other Android device that we have.  But the Nexus 10 couldn't handle it!The camera on the Memo Pad HD 7 seems adequate.  I don't use the cameras on the tablets because my Note 2 has a better camera than any of the tablets.  I always have my phone with me but I don't always have a tablet.  Camera's on tablets are not a big deal to me.The only real negative to the device is that it has no ambient light sensor so the screen will not automatically dim or brighten depending on lighting conditions.  However, I am not sure how much of an impact this actually has.  On my Nexus 10, outside in bright conditions, the brightness never goes to maximum automatically.  I always have to go into the settings and manually set the brightness to max when I want full brightness.One last note on the cheap feel of the tablet.  I don't see it.  Sure, the iPads are always touted for their great build quality and feel.  I personally prefer the lighter weight of the Nexus 10 over the iPad.  The aluminum is cold.  The rubberized back of the Nexus is warm and easy to hold.  The Memo Pad HD 7 does not have the grippy back like the Nexus but it doesn't feel cheap either.  It is slightly thicker than what I would prefer but that is almost a non issue.  I even commented to my son that if Asus simply charged $200 more for the device, people probably would stop commenting on the cheap feel.  They simply have the perception that it must feel cheap because the tablet is so inexpensive!The only three cons that I see in this tablet are:1. SD card size is limited to 32 gb.2. No ambient light sensor.3. Does not have wireless charging.However, every one of these negatives is overcome by it's price.  Asus has created an incredible tablet at an unbelievable price.The bottom line is this.  I know that Asus will soon be releasing the Memo Pad FHD 10.  It will be very similar to the Memo Pad HD 7 only with a larger screen.  The price will probably be somewhere between $300 and $400 and should have Miracast (wireless display).  If I were to sell my Nexus 10 and buy the new Memo Pad FHD 10, I would gain an SD card slot and may even put a little bit of change back into my pocket!  I'm seriously considering it! :)", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from earlier verson of Memo Pad 7", "Author": "suzatm", "ReviewID": "R1UP496MOX2F82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received mine yesterday and I am very happy with it.  First thing you notice is how light it is - a good bit lighter than the previous MeMo pad.  It is even a little bit lighter than the Ipad Mini.  The next thing you notice is the beautiful screen resolution. Videos are up there with the Fire and the crispness of the print in ebooks is very close to the print on the high resolution Ipod touch 5.  This is a wonderful tablet that allows for a lot of customization.  You now also have the ability to designate where you want your default main storage to be - device or SD card.  You have the ability to set your power saving mode to turn off wifi automatically when you are reading your book and turn on automatically when you move out of your book. You can change the color intensity/scale of your screen. It was easy to set up and wifi has a really good strong hold - no dropped signals so far.  The camera does a very decent job - I think better than the Ipad mini. I didn't notice the back of the device or the screen  being more of a fingerprint magnet than any other device though I am waiting for a screen protector to arrive. The lowest light setting is still not low enough for me but then the Screen Filter app is pretty good at helping to lower the light intensity. I gave it a full charge last night and sitting with wifi on overnight it only lost about 3 percent where the previous Memo would drop a lot more than that.  I bought it mostly to have all of my ebooks from all sources (Kobo, Sony, Amazon, Nook) on one device and to be able to carry it with me all of the time (Ipad mini is too expensive to do this without worry). So for what I bought it for - it is wonderful.  I'm still playing with it but I don't think my opinion will change other than to go higher.

The Nexus FHD is a great tablet and affordable; however it has a few bugs to work out and I refuse to buy a tablet with no expansion (MicroSD card) slot.  (Yes, Apple, I am speaking to you too!)  This is the Nexus 7's big downfall as well.  Sorry Google, I don't want everything I have to be living in your cloud.

The Samsung Tab 3 8 is a great 8 inch tablet and that extra inch of space (diagonally) is really kind of nice.  But Samsung wants $299 for it.  C'mon guys, its good, but not that good.

The charger is not a smart charger.  Consequently, you cannot just leave it plugged in.  If the charge on the Asus MeMO 7 gets too low, it has issues with charging.  I had to use a high quality (Apple IPod) charger with a micro HDMI cable to get my unit to charge when it discharged so much that it would no longer charge with the Asus charger.2. No magnetic sensor for auto on and off with a tablet case.3. The back is a slight bit slippery (smooth, not textured).  You need a case to hold this rascal.  Otherwise, keep a good grip on it...4. Only 1GB internal SDRAM.Observations:To keep it affordable you get a lower screen resolution than the Nexus 7 FHD - I hardly notice it.To keep it affordable the processor is a bit slower (but still quad core) and you only get 1GB of RAM memory instead of 2GB - (well you get what you pay for!!!)Suggestions to ASUS to improve this tablet:1. Give us a smart charger with this tablet!2. The MeMO HD 7 needs a sensor to turn the tablet on and off when a tablet cover is used.3. Give it some texture on the back of the tablet to grip it a bit better.4. Find a better place for the power button!  I'd like a power button on the front of the tablet for easy reach, but I guess it is cheaper to have a solid piece of glass on the front of the tablet. Maybe put the power button on the top of the tablet in the future for easy access.5. The obvious stuff - give us more internal memory (32GB), a higher resolution screen and an extra MB of RAM memory (up to 2GB) when you can do it at a good price.6. The cost of your case is a bit high. Other manufacturers are offering leather and leatherette cases that seem more practical to me and at a better price.I really want to thank ASUS for making an affordable tablet with some great features!I heartily recommend that you buy this tablet!  At this price, you won't be disappointed!!  I absolutely love it!For those of you who are considering an 8 inch tablet:I recommend you look at the ASUS MeMO 8 for $199.  There is also the Dell Venue 8 for $179.

Even though this looks like a basic charger, it comes in two pieces. The charger is actually made up of a micro USB cable and the part you plug into the wall.  This allows you to charge your memo pad tablet or supply power to it as you're working with it.  Because this is a micro USB port, it also allows you to transfer data from your computer to your memo pad or from your memo pad back to your computer.  You need to remember that your tablet will only charge from the computer when it is in sleep mode.  So you have to remember to turn it off, if that is the way you prefer to charge it.

Well again you get what you paid for. The Galaxy is a very good looking Tablet, but as far as performance that is a totally different story. The first issue was the Wifi, could not get it connect to my home network. It went into a loop and never came back. Research on the internet and found this was a common problem. There were 2 fixes. 1. Root the Tablet and then access the system folder and delete the DHCP_xxx file or 2. Get Root Explorer and have it access the file and delete it., I choose number 2, and that work the first time, but anytime you switch WifI it does it again and you have to delete the file again, that is because it saves the last (DHCP) assigned by the Router DHCP Server and tries to reuse the last used IP address when connected back to the same SSID, if the address is not available it goes into a loop and never connects. With that said the performance suffered greatly. When streaming video (Netflix, HBO GO, MAX GO, YouTube) it was choppy, and constantly said network connection error. So the Galaxy Tab 3 went back to Fry's, so I got the second best choice, The Nexus 7. Now off to see what this one will do, but before leaving the Fry's parking lot I decided to check on the web about the Tablet I just bought, to make sure there were not any gotcha's with this model, well guess what there was, the Nexus 7 does not have a microSD slot, and my daughter has tons of mixes on different microSD cards, to include movies and the sort. Well thank GOD, I checked, it was fairly easy to return because I never opened the box and I just bought it 20 minutes ago. So now it is the last on the list the Acer Iconia 7.9, guess what Fry's is out of Stock on that model. So now what? The closet match that was in the price range was the Asus MeMo Pad HD 7, and it was on sale regularly $149.00, but on sale for $129.00, I had a credit of $317 from the Nexus (a difference of $125, I save).Okay the review...Got the tablet home, was apprehensive about this, never really look at the Asus, I thought they were motherboard manufactures for the most part. Opened the box and powered it on.The SetupThis was the easiest setup I have gone through, easy, fast and in 2 minute your on the Home Screen. The speed was amazing. Fast and no lag.The WiFiIt connected to my Wifi with no issues, preformed a speed test and my Download speed was 40MBPS and my upload was 37MBPS (I have Comcast Bussiness class 50M/50M).The GPSFound my location within minutes, I also notice that you do not have to have the WiFi on to use the GPS a plus in my book, and it include Google Maps and Navigation. 2 item The Galaxy Tab 3 did not have.The PerformanceLaunch Play store and it was so fast that it update all my apps before I could find in MYAPPS, the Netflix and the HBO Go, and the MAX Go Application. (one note MAX Go is not supported on this device), But Netflix launched within second and I was streaming the Avengers without a hiccup . HBO go loaded slowly the first time but after that it take a few second and the clarity of the screen was very impressive. Application pop, they are so fast that I often click on the next screen because I am so used to the lag that I anticipate the next step, well I need to break that habit with this tablet. Web Browsing, YouTube (and Flash can be Supported go to adobe achieve and download Adobe Flash for ICS 4.xx), there was no wait on loading. And then it happened, while watching YouTube I click on the menu bar and the video was now in a window, I could drag it to any part of the screen and the video was still playing without losing sync or even being choppy. I could now browse other item even other website while still watching the video. I am impressed.... I cannot comment on the performance with games, my daughter (okay I went back and bought another one for myself, hey 2 for the price of just 1 Nexus 7, wouldn't you?)  Really just play movies, streams video, edits pictures and chats with her friends. She did say that the Front facing camera is kind of washed out at times but with Skype it was perfect, and video chatting was flawless.OverallThis is a fantastic product, a product that I would have never thought of looking at because I thought it was and off brand, was I ever so wrong. This is a Quad Core 1.2 GHZ and it has its own on board GPU with 1 GB ram. Internal Memory is 16GB (the Galaxy Tab 3 7 was only 8GB and it was $50 more), it has a 1280 by 800 (Galaxy was 1024 by 600) the Camera were about the same spec, the Asus does not have the IR Blaster but my daughter or me for that fact are not going to use this as a remote to my entertainment system, I have the Harmony One and I am not changing that for nothing. I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with this Tablet. I keep throwing things at it and it keep chewing them up and spitting them out. I have yet to bring it to its knees.ConclusionLet's be honest everyone has an opinion. And opinion and perception can differ greatly when talking about likes and dislikes. But hear me and the others that have made almost exactly the same comments about The Asus MeMo Pad HD 7 (ME173x), it's price to performance is stellar, it's display is top line, it feature are impressive. What else can I say just go and look at it, take it for a test run in the store, bring a microSD, loaded with the hardest to play movies and put it in the tablet and play it, then tell me if all of us who rave about this Tablet are wrong....", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING VALUE - do yourself a favor and buy this tablet.", "Author": "Sally \"Sally\"", "ReviewID": "R3V9ATLL17G9A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put about six days into researching tablets and ended up buying a 64gig Blackberry Playbook. I had it one day before I returned it. Its wi-fi connection was super slow and there were very few useful or common apps in their store.I had already eyed the MeMoPad HD7, but was nervous about it because I was not familiar with the brand and honestly, I felt nervous because of the low price. After reviewing the specs thoroughly, and re-discovering that it had everything I wanted, and no other tablet from any other manufacturer had this combination of features at this price, I purchased one.I am not going to list the specs because you can see them in the product listing, but I will say this - I have zero buyer's remorse; after I took shipment back in September 'til now, it's been a true life love affair.I love how I can have all my emails come in through the one client, and it gives me access to everything I need to do with my social media outreach for business.The long battery life is stellar and the product is super fast.In the reviews I saw before I purchased, the only negative I saw people mention was the placement of the power and volume buttons. I admit it's a tiny bit unusual and a wee bit awkward, but I am willing to overlook that to get this fully loaded product for an incredible price.The unit has worked perfectly since the day I got it and I look forward to using it for a very long time.

It really makes me wonder why the iPad costs so much when something like this can do just about everything it can do at such a more affordable price.  The size of this unit is slightly smaller than an iPad Mini.  It's very light, fits well in the hand, very good quality, does not feel or look cheap.

LOL I purchased a 10 inch Acer tablet from Woot! 2 months ago. It died within 2 weeks so I was nervous to say the last about trying again. But I had been watching this Asus HD 7 tablet for a while now, watching and reading reviews from C-net and other places and it seemed a brilliant buy for the price.Web pages are a little harder to read on a 7 inch tablet than a 10 inch but the text is clear and crisp and the display is just beautiful. I love all the pre=loaded aps and if you don't like them they are easy to remove. The battery life is awesome, even when using the camera and video recorder which I have a lot. I know a lot of people say that this camera is just \"ok\" but I really think it takes an awesome picture, even in lower lights. With no flash it doesn't do well in really low light though. In daylight, outside, pics are just beautiful. There are lots of tweaks that come with the tablet as well, to change photo settings etc. The video recorder is also great. My family is involved in Dog Obedience competition and we wanted something to record training sessions as well as at shows. This will work perfectly.Sound is great, picture on screen is great, plays you tube videos. Comes with a Kindle Books app which is great because I can download ebooks from my local library for free in Kindle format.All in all I'd give this 4.5 out of 5 stars. Why not 5? Well the case is plastic instead of the metal like my iPad and the glass is not gorilla glass and it does smudge; however it makes for a lighter tablet than the iPad. but I bought a nice PU leather cover for it tht came with a stylus (it was like 12 bucks here on Amazon) and the nice thing is when you close the cover the tablet hibernates; open the cover and it wakes up.

At the new price of $129, it is a fantastic value. As I expected, battery life has stabilized. I get better overnight results if I turn off Wifi (even though I have the power-saving mode that is supposed to turn it off when sleeping). Others have complained about button and USB port placement; for me, these are not issues. I rather like the fact that I can hold the tablet in one hand without worrying about accidentally pressing a button. As for USB port on the top, if you don't like it, just turn the unit upside down; the screen will adjust automatically.One minor concern has surfaced. Occasionally after carrying the unit in my pocket (suit jacket or slacks), I have noticed what appears to be a little moisture in the screen. It appears as a dime-sized spot that gradually diminishes and then disappears. This does not seem to affect the screen from functioning, but does make me a bit concerned. If it continues, I will check with Asus to see if there is a simple fix.Original review:I bought this tablet to replace an aging Nook Color that I had set up as a full Android 2.3 tablet. After researching the options, the choice for me came down to the new Nexus 7 32 GB ($269), the Samsung Galaxy 3 Tab 7\" 8 GB ($199), or this Asus MeMOPad HD 7 16 GB ($149). Everything I read suggested that the Nexus is the best tablet in terms of performance and screen ... and I love the Samsung Galaxy phone that I have ... but when I compared these three tablets in the store and via on-line reviews, I couldn't see that either the Nexus or the Samsung was going to be significantly better for my needs--certainly not enough to justify the extra cost.The fact that the new Nexus 7 lacks a Micro-SD port is a major consideration for me; even the 32 GB model would be a step backwards in total storage from my current Nook, and the less expensive 16 GB would be completely inadequate. In addition, the new Nexus 7 is quite a bit bulkier (longer) than the MeMOPad, which would be inconvenient for me, since I usually carry my tablet in my inside suit jacket pocket. (The MeMOPad fits very nicely.)The Samsung is a nice tablet, but after looking at a number of on-line reviews, including side-by-side reviews between the Samsung and the MeMOPad, I concluded that these two tablets are very similar in performance and screen--a conclusion borne out by my own side-by-side comparisons--so I opted to save the money and go with the Asus.After using the Asus MeMOPad for several days, I am quite pleased with my decision. Its performance is a huge step up from my old Nook, plus it has all the bells and whistles that I had wished for -- GPS, Bluetooth, and front and rear cameras. Movies play well (I use the MX Movie Player app rather than the built-in app so that I can play .AVI files), and streaming from Amazon Instant Videos is very smooth (unlike my old Nook). (Note that I added Adobe Flash, following instructions widely available on-line; I use the default browser to view flash-based videos.)Thus far, every app that I have installed has worked flawlessly. The one exception is Titanium Backup, which requires root access. I may investigate rooting the tablet down the road--I have already seen that there are various instructions on-line--but for now I don't see a compelling need. Some reviews suggested this is not the best tablet for the most demanding games, but it certainly handles the few games I play (mostly Temple Run and Angry Birds).I am still getting a sense of the battery life. I would say that so far it is acceptable, especially in terms of active use, but it has seemed to discharge a little faster than I would have expected when in sleep mode. My recollection is that it usually takes a while for a tablet to \"settle down\" as far as the battery cycle, and I have just barely begun to explore the various power-saving options that are available.To me the build quality seems very good. I have not noticed any squeaky or loose plastic. The texture of the case is pleasant to hold, and as noted above, the size is perfect for slipping into an inside pocket in a suit jacket. One important note is that the unit is essentially exactly the same size as the original Nexus 7; therefore, widely (and inexpensively) available accessories for the Nexus 7 may work well with this unit. For example, I bought a bluetooth mini-keyboard designed to function as a snap-on cover for the original Nexus 7; it works perfectly with the MeMOPad (both in terms of connecting and in terms of snapping on). One word of caution: full covers for the original Nexus 7 will lack a cut-out for the rear camera, and the micro-usb port for charging and transfer is on the top rather than on the bottom. Neither of these issues affect the mini-keyboard, since it only attaches over the screen.Bottom line is that this unit appears to me to be the best bang-for-the-buck available for a 7\" tablet.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "You cannot go wrong with this 7'' Android tablet.", "Author": "Phalen", "ReviewID": "R30LIW5ROK32GH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wireless: As soon as I got the ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 connected to wireless it updated to Android 4.2.2.  Fantastic.  Quick.  No connection drops.  Stays connected throughout my entire home (basement + 2 floors) with the router on the top floor in a corner bedroom.Display: 1280 x 800 display is very nice. Images do not need to be stretched or distorted into some crazy resolution. This results in images scaling properly. If you scan a pic of a 8.5x11'' book, for example, containing both images and text, and pull up the resulting image on the HD 7, it will be smaller (of course), but will still be clear and readable.  You can then two-finger zoom.  Still clear. The importance of a native resolution of 1280 x 800 cannot be overstated.  Viewing angle is good.  The previous version of this table (non-\"HD 7\" version) had a horrible issue with off-angle viewing.  This one has no problems with any reasonable angle.  Screen is as bright as you need it to be.  I have not tried it in direct sunlight but I will check it out and report back.Performance: Snappy.  Tried multiple apps and all performed well.  The Universe\" on Netflix looked great.  Occasional, very slight, stutter.  But a 720p show on a tablet? At this price point? I think you can live with a stutter or 2.  Note that I'm not trying to run Photoshop (or whatever the Android equivalent might be) on this thing.  Because I'm not silly.If you're looking for an Android tablet to use with the Kindle reader app, you're going to be happy.

Don't make that joke...don't be that guy...Also, there's a microSD slot.  You need one.

That happens to be about the same size as a paperback book but much thinner.  It's a handy size for carrying around.  We have the 2012 Nexus 7 and iPad Mini in the house and they have similar specs so I'll compare those.First off the iPad Mini screen is 1/2\" wider than the MemOPad HD or Nexus 7. That extra screen space is nice but the Android tablets are easier to hold in the palm of your hand. The MeMOpad is slightly thicker than the Nexus 7 but it actually makes it a little easier to pick up. Camera quality on the MemoPad HD is nice and seems on par with the other tablets but I don't use those cameras often.  Even under fluorescent lights the results were nice. Even though the MemoPad has half the RAM as the Nexus 7, the performance seems about the same. The build quality on both of the ASUS tablets is similar though the Nexus seems a little nicer and solid.  The MemoPad back feels like plastic.  Of course the iPad feels really nice but at more than double the price it should.I think most people would get as much use from the MemoPad HD as the Nexus and save themselves about $80.  One difference most people will notice is that the MemoPad is not a \"Nexus\" device so they will have to wait longer to get updated versions of Android over the air. The Nexus also has a higher resolution screen but honestly I don't see a big difference when using the device. The Nexus 2013 comes with HDMI support via a non-included adapter cable but both should support MiraCast (see video) with a compatible TV or by adding a MiraCast receiver to their TV or monitor and I think more people will be streaming content to their home theater over the next year instead of using inconvenient cables.  The MemoPad has the ability to expand memory and transfer files though a microSD card slot and I think most will find that feature more valuable and it makes this tablet more \"futureproof\" since storage space won't be an issue.=================1=Bad, 10=Good=================Browsing Web 9Reading Book 8Watching Netflix 8Reading Email 7Creating Documents 5Connectivity 7 ( no HDMI)Battery Life 7LCD Quality 7Material Quality 7Responsiveness 7Speakers 5=================ASUS MeMOPad HD (Android  4.2.1)$1507-inch 1280x800 IPS4 Core, 1.2Ghz MediaTek CPU1GB Ram16GB Storage302gWireless:802.11b/g/n, BT, GPSConnectivity: microUSB, 3.5mm audio, microSDCameras: 5MP Rear, 1.2MP Front197mm x 121mm x 11mmASUS/Google Nexus 7 FHD Tablet (2013)(Android)$2307.02-inch 1920x1200 IPS4 Core, 1.5 Ghz Snapdragon S4 CPU2GB Ram16GB Storage290gWireless:  802.11a/b/g/n, BT 4.0, NFC, GPSConnectivity: microUSB, HDMI (with extra adapter cableCameras: 5MP Rear, 1.2MP Front200mm x 114mm x 9mmApple iPad Mini (2012) (iOS 6)$3407.9-inch 1024x768 IPS2 Core, 1 Ghz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU512 MB Ram16GB Storage308gWireless:  802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, BT 4.0, GPSConnectivity: lightening, 3.5mm audioCameras: 5MP Rear, 1.2MP Front200mm x 135mm x 7mm", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional tablet & Great price", "Author": "Lori", "ReviewID": "R1RV53QYYBC5HF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered this tablet after much research. I wanted to stay within a strict budget of less than $200.00. Being a satisfied owner of an Asus Netbook for the past couple of years, I was happy to see Asus was coming out with a new HD version of their MeMo pad. After comparing several similarly priced tablets, I went with Asus because it has features some others didn't such as SD card expansion slot and bluetooth. I also liked that it came in a variety of colors.After three months of using this tablet, I am very happy with it's performance, graphics, and features. There has also been at least one system update and I am hoping rumors of an Android Jellybean update to 4.3 are true.The only disappointment when I first got my tablet was that it did not come with Swype writing capability pre-installed. But I quickly remedied that with a download of Swype for Android from the PlayStore.I read a lot of library e-books so this tablet is great for this purpose due to its light weight and ability to run the must popular e-reading software such as Kindle reader - which I use frequently.I also find that I use this tablet for nearly all of my web browsing and YouTube watching instead of my netbook.I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a great tablet for an outstanding price. Matter of fact, I paid $149 back in August, but today on Amazon. com I see it's down to $119!", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm using it more than expected", "Author": "Shala Kerrigan", "ReviewID": "R29DOOTZFROXK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tablet because it was inexpensive, had a decent enough camera and would work for the apps that I use to promote my webpage. Then my computer died and it wound up getting a lot more use than expected for a couple of weeks.Everything about this tablet is better than I expected, the build, the display, the wi-fi speed, and how quickly apps load. The camera in it certainly won't replace a good digital camera but for using it with social networks, it does focus nicely and is easy to use. The microSD slot is a really good thing for being able to store more photos or transfer them to a computer with a card reader super quickly. The display is very clear and easy to see at a lot of angles except in bright sunlight. Bluetooth connectivity is good- I've been able to listen to music in my room on a mini speaker while this is in the living room- through 2 walls and another small room.I'm not a gamer, but have a few free game apps loaded to it and they all work well with no lagging. So even though I bought it primarily for social networking, it's also been just wonderful for keeping my family members occupied while waiting for me to finish errands.The battery life is good and it will run nearly all day on a charge for normal use. Playing games does use up the charge quicker.Because of the price, the one thing I dislike is a very minor issue. The shiny, smooth  screen takes and shows fingerprints worse than any device I've every used. I wind up wiping it down several times a day.I like the bright, pretty green color, and will probably pick up a second one in a different color for my husband.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "4.5 stars is my true assessment", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RMCFOS7NCRM82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I opened this today and I am writing the review after some hours of enjoying it.First, the packaging was beautifully crafted, simple, secure, and protective.  The contents were basic too--and I like that. I had it set up and running in less than 10 minutes.  And if my home wifi was more cooperative, that timeframe might have only been 3-5 minutes.The processor is very quick. Tons of memory and micro SD supports an additional 32GB if you want.I spent the day downloading my favorite apps with no trouble and very little wear on the battery (I use the battery optimizer).The touch screen is very receptive and easy to use.  Yes, it attracts fingerprints.  That doesn't bother me.The sound is a decent quality for a tablet of this size. It is not an audiophile's dream, but let's remember we are talking about a 7\" tablet here.The video and camera are clear and are HD when HD is available.  I have seen some reviews complaining that the picture was pixelated and grainy--just remember that on youtube, there are a lot of videos that are not loaded initially in HD, so you can't do anything about that.  The ones that are in HD, are crisp and clear on this tablet.There are a ton of ways to customize this tablet to your liking in the settings menu.ONLY CON I can come up with for myself--I haven't figured out how to watch amazon PRIME instant streaming videos.  Android doesn't support flash player after 4.0 (ICS), even though you can find it on the adobe flash player archive website and download it yourself.  It is still hit or miss as far as usability for me.  I will figure it out though.I am a basic user.  Like to check/send email, surf the web a bit, check my bank accounts, play a few simple games, read some online magazines.  I don't take a lot of pics or shoot video, but I might just start :-)  This is a perfect tablet for someone like me.  I had a generic tablet I paid 1/2 the price of this one--and I got exactly 1/2 the satisfaction and functionality from it.  This is a very reasonably priced piece of social technology.  I think user friendly enough for any age group (I am wishing my mum had one when she was housebound with illness).  And if you are worrying about \"keeping up with the Jones' \" and all their toys, you will not be ashamed to whip this out at the coffee shop or at the PTA meeting.I am sure I will get the hang of all the additional benefits of a high quality tablet like this very soon.Hope this review helps.

With a built in 16gb drive and the ability to add an additional 32gb via the microSD slot, you will have plenty of room for your pictures, movies, music, apps and documents.So far, I have run the tablet for over 6 hours continuously, but I suspect I could run much longer if I turned off the GPS and WiFi. Overall, I'm impressed with this tablet and more impressed with the 149.99 price tag. The base ipad mini is still going to cost you over 300.00.

One of the reasons I wanted an Android device is because I like to listen to Pandora using headphones.  I like the option of being able to equalize the stream with one of many good equalizer apps.  This is something that is not possible on an ipad.  With equalization the sound quality is very good through headphones.I've had to restart the device a few times for various reasons.  Once while trying to use Google Hangouts I received a message stating no camera detected.  This was corrected with a restart.  On one occasion after the tablet was idle overnight Pandora froze while opening and required a restart to function properly.

After all you can't excpect too much from $130 tablet right?  WRONG!!!This tablet surprised me on every level of performance. Let me just mention that I have over 20 years experience as s professional IT and this would be my bread and butter.When I did my research I narrowed down 3 models: Galaxy, Nexus and MemoPadApple was not even an option in my research because of price/functionality ratio and the limitations imposed by Apple's proprietary approach. I like my computers and mobile devices to be open architecture rather than closed proprietary. But that's me.Being a computer builder for many years, I am well familiar with ASUS as I use their mother boards in most computers I built. They make some of the best motherboard in the market.Back to my research, the galaxy, although was an excellent candidate, was above the price I wanted to spend. So we are down to Nexus and MemoPad. Being produced by the same manufacturer (ASUS) I knew they both has the same quality. So now we are really down to feature comparison and of course price.These are the factors that helped me make final decision:1. The MemoPad has both front and back cameras. The Nexus has front camera only2. The MemoPad has SD card slot which allow you to expand the storage by 32GB. The nexus does not support external storage.3. Both devices support 1280 x 800 and showed excellent image quality when played a starwars movie converted from blu-ray4. Both devices come with quad processor5.

If you like the product, I hope it doesn't die on you as it has done for so  many others.I am just happy that I was within my store warranty period and was able to bring it back. What follows is my original review, what I thought of the product when it was just out of the box and actually working:********What I really wanted was an iPad, but I could not justify the price as I have an iPhone and a laptop that I use a lot. I just wanted a tablet to read magazines on, and so I settled for this $150 (Cdn) tablet that I saw in a gaming shop. I'm not an Android fan at all (I went through four Android phones before finally getting an iPhone), and I'm still not an Android fan, but this tablet is worth the price and let me tell you why.It's great for reading magazines. And that's what I wanted to do on it.  Also, if you want to watch any videos, they are crisp and clear. Gorgeous visuals.So, I got what I paid for and I'm satisfied.Now here's what you need to know about Android: the battery life is terrible. Do yourself a favour and charge the device every day, or else one day you will try to turn it on and it will have gone black, meaning you have to recharge it for many hours before it clicks into gear and you can use it.Don't expect great email service. Even though the tablet connects beautifully to wi-fi, my email accounts were not syncing, so I ended up deleting them from the tablet. So there's a glitch you may want to consider.However, while I wait for the opportune time to buy a full-size iPad, this little tablet is just fine for the purposes for which I bought it, and the price simply cannot be beat, so thank you Asus for putting tablets within reach of all who want one.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for the price", "Author": "S.

I've had no performance issues with it at all. I simply wanted a 7\" tablet with which I could email, surf the web, use Skype (which I have yet to try), and read books - and do them all well. After reading many reviews of how tablets with non-HD screens might be unsatisfactory, I waited for the Nexus 7 HD to come out. Just before it was released, this ASUS was announced, and that it would cost $80 less. Studying its features I found it would do everything I needed, whereas the Nexus would do more, but features I don't need. The $149 price for this was therefore much more palatable than $229 for the Nexus. (Despite that, I almost sprung for the iPad Mini, but it is too large and is in need of an update.) My only complaint is the lack of a comprehensive manual. It comes with a very small, several page printed one, but it's just to get you started turning it on. I had to do a search for a \"real\" one, and found one on the ASUS site. Though it is 106 pages, it is still not comprehensive in the way the one for my iPhone 5 is. Maybe because Android is so customizable it is impossible to devise such a manual. Oh well.

Reedy", "ReviewID": "RGNE8KWFIF513", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this tablet for about two weeks now, and I'm still torn about what I think about it. I love the fact that it cost me $150. That was great. It is also FAR superior to my 1st generation Kindle Fire that I have now passed down to my 3 year-old. All in all I'm happy that after less than two years I've gotten many more features and better performance out of a tablet that cost me 25% less than my previous one did. However . . .I don't feel like this has the build quality it should. I haven't had a lot of experience with Android devices outside of my Kindle, so I can't quite say that it's a lot buggier than other devices out there, but it is certainly buggier than I expected. Here are a few examples:1) One reason I bought this over the new Nexus 7 was because of the SD card slot. I put a 32GB card in, because I plan on using the camera a lot for both photos and videos. The problem I am having is that every time the device goes to sleep it has to re-detect the card in the slot and it doesn't always do it. At least 5% of the time it doesn't notice the card is there, so when you go to take photos the device yells at you because it doesn't have anywhere to store the photos. The only way to fix it is to pop the card out and reinsert it. The last time I tried that the card \"popped\" 2-3 feet into the air. Needless to say the photo op was gone.2) Probably four times in the past couple of weeks the device has refused to wake from sleep. At first I was worried that something had shorted and I was going to have to send the device back. The device seemed completely dead. Then I tried simply holding the power button and it did, eventually, reboot.3) The last straw before writing this review came because I have started using bluetooth headphones with the device. They've been working fine, until just now. I tried reconnecting headphones and it didn't work. So I turned off the bluetooth connection and tried to turn it back on. Nothing I could do would let me turn the bluetooth setting back on. It was as if it wasn't detecting the blutooth module on the device. Eventually I restarted the device and it is working fine again.4) Finally, and I don't know if this is a Google issue or an ASUS issue, but there are a number of apps in the Play store that state that they are incompatible with the device, though I can't think of any reason why that should be. A few examples include the new Microsoft Office 365 for Android app, the Starbucks app, and the mobile banking app for Citibank. They all say that they should work on Android 4.0 and later. I would say it has only been about 5% of them, but enough to be annoying.(UPDATE: I'll agree that #4 is probably a developer issue, not an ASUS issue. I don't know if this is the problem, but all of the apps I've found that are listed as incompatible have permissions settings that require access to dial the device's phone. I wonder if the Play Store assumes that a phone is necessary for the app to function.)In addition to these issues I have to agree that the build quality isn't spectacular. What I seem to notice most is that the quality of the glass doesn't seem to match the quality of the Gorilla Glass that Amazon used on their Kindles. It doesn't seem as stiff and it seems to attract and hold oil worse than the Kindle did.I feel somewhat guilty giving the device a 3 star review, but I can't quite bring myself to give it 4 stars. I'll hold onto it rather than return it because I am a fault tolerant person. If you are as well, then this might be a good deal for you. The price is certainly excellent. But if you are not fault tolerant, and especially if you don't think you will need extra storage, I'd probably recommend trying to find something more stable.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "CUSTOM ROM AVAILABLE!!!!

Memopad HD hands down.", "Author": "rob", "ReviewID": "R249H6KYFVDLK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review title may seem kind of silly, given that Asus actually makes both the new Nexus 7 and the Memopad HD, competing with each other in the same market segment. There's also no disputing that the Nexus 7 is better equipped in terms of hardware.The \"dealbreaker\" for me is not in terms of price, although it's pretty hard for the average Joe to ignore that 35% premium for the 16GB N7 over the 16GB Memopad HD. No, it's this simple: the Memopad has a microSD slot. The Nexus 7, by design (and Google's insistence), does not.Listen, Google, if I wanted to pay more for willfully-less usability, I'd be an Apple person. Go on all you want about The Cloud. You know as well as I do that transferring several gigs of data to a mobile device is a couple minutes of my time using cheap external flash memory vs. a few hours minimum via the ballyhooed cloud. And there's stuff I don't necessarily *want* going through someone else's servers. The \"OTG option\" doesn't matter when you don't include the relevant cables in the box, and I don't want a USB dongle getting in my way on a portable device. So: no microSD slot, no purchase. It's that simple. I won't be buying any Nexus-line product until Google stops pretending this isn't a necessary feature and/or trying to trump up their margins Apple-style by selling two or three different models of non-expandable hardware.In other areas: is the N7's higher-res screen better than the Memopad's? Yeah, sure, it's very nice. The Memopad HD's 1280 7\" screen still looks fantastic. Yes, you can tell a slight difference comparing side by side. But bring the Memopad home and you won't care any more.The N7 is a faster piece of hardware on paper, too. But the Memopad HD is very snappy and responsive, probably the fastest-feeling Android device I've personally had to date. I thought my Galaxy S3 was pretty impressive, but the Memopad bests it at least in terms of \"immediate response\" feel.The size / feel of the Memopad HD in your hands is absolutely perfect, and the 7\" screen is surprisingly usable even with the large-format PDF books and articles I read a lot on my tablet. I was worried I'd have to keep my 10\" TF101 for reading those; no more. (This all said, I don't mind or have a problem making out somewhat-small-but-sharp type.) Battery life on the Memopad is really great so far, and I have seen some pro press that suggests its battery may actually best the new N7's.Headphone jack and USB / charge port are on the same side, and Asus has wisely placed the power and volume rocker keys right together on the adjacent facet. This is the way it should be for usability's sake, and you'd be surprised how very, very many tablets (including Asus' past designs) get this wrong.I do not personally feel the device \"feels cheap\" at all, but the first unit I got *did* have a sort of disturbing creakiness to it in handling, the kind that I normally associate with laptops *after* I've beaten them to death in a couple years of use (just before you start seeing stress fractures). I brought it back, and the second unit I got did not exhibit this problem out of box. I would recommend slapping a case on this soon as you can, but I'd recommend that for pretty much *any* tablet. At least, unlike the iPad, you don't need to worry about the backside aluminum scratching in the first few hours of responsible ownership.The one main complaint I have about the Asus, and I don't know yet if it's even a real complaint, is that the manual makes a big deal of not leaving it perma-connected to the charger and only using their charger. The charging circuit *should* be smart enough to let me leave the thing plugged in for a week at a time without any trouble if I want. Again, this may just be some kind of weirdly-motivated instructional hyperbole on Asus' part and/or may be something you can safely ignore. I don't know yet, but personally I'll wait for other Memopad users to \"do what comes (more) naturally\" to find out.The Memopad HD is pretty much *the* 7\" tablet sweet spot for value and performance as of this writing. It is definitely the snappy, stable, eminently usable, well-sub-$200 7\" Android tablet I've been waiting for literally for years (and frankly expected much earlier).One last note: I was surprised to find that, unlike my last few Android devices, Flash wasn't working out of box. It turns out this is an Adobe-giving-up-on-mobile issue, not an Asus-build issue. Not the best news in the world, since so many of the sites I routinely visit are *still* addicted to Flash.

That said I can get about 3-4 days of use before it needs charged.

After searching the web on how others deal with this very common problem I found the best action was to crack the plastic case off the back..which you can do with your fingernails...and unplug the battery connector for about 5 seconds.  Then plug it back in, snap the case back on and it will then accept a charge.I have a hard time believing Asus did not know about this problem.

She was previously using my Nexus 7 1st gen. Needless to say the tablets are so similar in size and construction, it was a flawless transition.The build quality of the Asus isn't up to par with the nexus 7 2012, simply because of the plastic backing that gets scratched very easily. With that said, comparing the screen quality of this tablet to that of the nexus is like night and day. Surprisingly the Asus just appears a lot more vibrant and sharper. Maybe its just my nexus, but I think the responsiveness is much better as well.This tablet isn't the fastest thing out there, as you would probably expect. But with one gig of memory and a 1.2ghz dual core processor it isn't too bad. It scores somewhere in the region of 13k on antutu, so youre looking at a galaxy S3 level of performance. Some apps to happen to slow it to a complete crawl sometimes however.Since the tablet is built on the mediatek architecture you're not going to get a lot of custom ROM support for it. I did however manage to find one that gives you some kit Kat goodies and some much needed stability improvements.We did experience the problem a lot of reviewers complained about: the tablet drains the battery and then will not turn back on. While I don't think you should have to go through this kind of thing with any product, this kind of thing happens, I guess. I contacted asus and opened up an RMA because it happened only 40 days after purchase, so amazon wouldn't let me send it back. But then I decided I'd try to fix it on my own.I popped the back cover off, removed the battery connector from the main board and shorted the terminals, kind of like a \"clear CMOS\" procedure on computers. Needless to say, I plugged it back in and connected the charger, and everything was good to go again! The problem hasn't happened since, and we've had it for about 3 months now.Overall if you're on a tight budget I would recommend this tablet without hesitation. The price is awesome, the screen is really good, the front and rear cameras are surprisingly better than my iPad mini retina's own, and its great value for the money. If you can manage to throw on about $80 more however, I would recommend the nexus 2013.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This tablet does support 64GB microSD cards with the latest Android 4.2.2 update.", "Author": "Drad", "ReviewID": "R30VVD3R2MUXNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those of you who need or want a lot of extra storage, hopefully that helps. I've had this tablet for a few days and so far it's the best price/performance value on the market. I use it primarily as a media player and occasional web browser. I also have a first generation 32GB Nexus 7, but I really wanted the expandable storage. The Nexus is a bit faster and the build quality is better, but the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 is a full hundred dollars less than what I paid for the Nexus a year ago; I can accept a few compromises in this case. The Memo does everything I need and the slightly weaker CPU isn't an issue for my purposes. The screen resolution is the same 1280 x 800 as the 2012 Nexus 7, which seems to be better than most tablets in this price range. The screen's very responsive. Apps and pages load quickly with only the occasional and very minimal lag. 1080/720p HD video plays just fine with MX Player. Streaming depends on your connection. Heavy 3D gamers may want to look elsewhere. I don't game much, but I suspect most Android games will run fine on this. Sound quality is excellent (for a tablet) due to stereo speakers instead of mono. I can't comment on the camera, since I don't use it. Clean Master (Google Play, free) will keep the tablet running quickly and smoothly if it starts to slow down. There are some comments that the device feels cheap. I suppose that's true if you're coming from a tablet in a higher price range. In my opinion, the build quality is good for a tablet at this price.Overall, I feel that the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 is an excellent value for the money. It's exceeded my expectations at a very reasonable price.

He is 8.  He had another c-grade (archos) tablet last year for Christmas.  I actually got 2 different archos tablets last year for Christmas, 1 for son and 1 for daughter.  Both were broken, worthless in about 60 days.  I am hoping the quality of the ASUS is superior to Archos.  Google uses ASUS for their Nexus tablet so I assume they picked a good hardware partner.  So far this MeMO has worked great.  We've done some video chat via Google Hangout.  Camera quality seems good.  Play store is great.  Plenty of content.  Touch screen seems fairly responsive.  I do notice on some light gaming apps (Temple Run) there is some screen lag/ jitter.  I use the 'Task Manager' widget to stop/kill background apps and I installed and use Clean Master.  These seem to help.  My 2 ISSUES (Maybe only 1) are:1. Amazon Prime Video - DOES NOT WORK!!!  This stinks.2. Adobe Flash - 'NOT SUPPORTED ON THIS DEVICE' as quoted on Adobe web page when trying to download Flash.  I think this is the reason for issue #1 above (Amazon Prime I think uses Flash).Also, the old, broken, junky Archos tablets both had HDMI interface (one of the reasons I got them).  I wish ASUS had put HDMI on this model.

Got mine on Amazon for $129 + Free shipping!!!", "Author": "hesty24", "ReviewID": "R2SCYC6NCFBBP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these for my children, but would not mind one bit owning one to use.  In fact, if I was allowed to use it for a week, and then the Nexus 7 2013, I would probably end up buying the MeMOPad.These are neat little tablets.  I already own and operate a Nexus 7 FHD (2013) 2nd generation, so this is what I am comparing it to.  I will say that this tablet holds its own next to the N7 2013, but is probably a bit better than the N7 1st generation.  This is because of the 5MP rear camera, and the fact that you can up the storage with a MicroSD card 32GB + 16GB on board memory.I do like the camera options on the MeMOPad a whole lot more than the N7 2013.  There are far more options with the MeMOPad than the N7 for all you picture takers out there.  The display is adequate and rivals that of most other non-N7 2013 tablets.  The speaker is loud and has no distortion at max volume, although one speaker at the bottom rear of the device, it is more than adequate.  I am using a Bobj Rugged case for the tablet.  I highly recommend that case (although it is way over priced at $21) for all those who are less than careful with your geek stuff.  Read my review on the Bobj case for more info.  Aside from the hardware differences on the tablet, the software differences are way different than the N7.  The N7 rocks a clean Android system that is upgradeable to 4.4 at this moment (not the best in the world with a lot of incompatible app issues right now, but functional).  The MeMOPad is upgradeable to Android version 4.2.2, and sports a vast plethora of ASUS apps (but they are all very nice).  I just wish that the N7 had them.  The lay out between the two take a little bit getting use to if you primarily use one device.  The screens and app opening and closing are very snappy.  The load time differences for some simple gaming apps is about 7-8 seconds longer (Hungry Shark Evolution).  Not that big of a deal to me.They MeMOPad does have a nice inclusive battery optimizing app, that is very simple to operate that states that it helps prolong the battery life.  I have charged the MeMOPad about 3 days ago, and left the WiFi on, installed some apps, rearranged the desktop screens, screen brightness remains at about 70%, and had my kids play some of their education games it for about 1.5 hours, and the tablet still has 81% of the battery left!  Additionally, I am not sure what the button is called, but there is a 4th button next to the \"go back button\", \"home button\", and the \"Recently used apps\" buttion.  It is very nice, and appears to have nice little handy apps associated with it i.e. calculator, audio wizard, video player, unit converter, countdown timer, stop watch, compass, web browser, calender, and email.  It appears to be modifiable, and just adds one more spot for quick app access (wish the N7 had it).  A missing option on the MeMOPad is that ASUS and/or Android didn't include a auto adjust screen brightness option.  I usually use this option on my N7 for battery conservation, but so far, I have not seen that the MeMO needs it.Pros:  Made by ASUS, Memory card expandable, very inexpensive, great speaker, rear and front facing camera with excellent software, Android OS, awesome little included ASUS apps, Extra shortcut button at the bottom of the screen.  Mini USB charging port on the top and off centered (very out of the way of your hands when holding tablet landscape and charging).  Magnetic activated on/off switch on all supporting covers/cases (I hear you have to turn this feature on in setttings.)Cons:  1GB of RAM, Screen resolution 1280x1080, no screen brightness auto adjustmentBottom line:  If you are in the market for a 7\" tablet, or something of that size and are on a limited budget, I would definitely recommend this one!  It is a budget tablet, but there is nothing cheap about it.  Don't waste your money on those cheap tablets that no one has ever heard of (Prestige, Dragon Touch, Chromo, Prontotec).  Those tablets are cheap for a reason. . . . they are CHEAP!!!  You will definitely regret it if you buy one of those as I have heard many people state.

It is my first tablet and I bought it to learn first hand the pros and cons of Android tablets vs  laptops.  I use it for monitoring and  responding to email, storing photos to show friends and family, querying the  internet, reading periodicals, novels and technical books, and news related videos.  The ASUS tablet does amazingly well given its size and processing power for email, internet queries, novels, and periodicals. The screen is bright, colors very good, and even the smallest fonts are readable.  The tablet comes with a number of very useful apps for email, internet queries, books and novels, maps, and GPS.  Although the email apps are focused on Google mail I found it easy to add my Hotmail account and have been able to use the core functions of Hotmail.  The Google search voice interface works extremely well.  I receive e versions of Newsweek, US News and Report, PC World,etc by email.  Most of the time I am able to read articles and watch news videos. However, there are times when the screen is so clobbered with advertisements it is difficult to see the text when the ads overlap the borders .  I have not yet purchased any apps specifically designed for displaying media on an Android tablet, but the included apps are generally doing a very good job.  I have experienced a number of problems with the screen freezing and having to back out of a query or e-periodical.  However, so far the system has not crashed and Chrome on the ASUS seems to stumble less than Explorer  on my desktop.  I am convinced that almost all of the these problems are the result of the advertisements overloading the processors, use of conflicting protocols, and in the case of Explorer on my desktop computer, conflicts resulting from my high security settings.  I always use  cases to protect both my ASUS tablet and Kindle ereader, was surprised to find out that when cased they are essentially the same size, and plans are to take both when on travel.  The apps included with the ASUS can work in conjunction with the GPS, and unlike my Garmin  can provide  true alternate routes.  This feature can only be used for planning because it requires Wi-Fi connectivity.  When not totally discharged, the ASUS recharges in several hours and battery life seems to be around 8 to 10 hours, depending on use.

Because the body is plastic it twists a little, if you push on the top right and bottom left or hold the bottom left and press the top right. This twist is so slight it's hard to notice UNLESS you have an SD card because it becomes unmounted and remounts over and over while handling the device. Sometimes it unmounts  just by holding the wrong way, yes it twist just the slightest. Also why have a device that supports OTG but not enable it (had to root to use)?

But with so many different electronics out there these days, it can be a difficult decision. Tablets have came a long way since the Palm Pilots and the Iphone 6 years ago. But everyone has been on the Apple Ipad bandwagon since it came out 3 years ago. But with all of that, many might want to feel they are not wasting their money on one company, or just one product either. But with tablets it is very hard to find, not just in speed, but in battery life as well. ASUS has just gone into the tablet game awhile ago, and they have definitely a lot to prove with every other computer company as well. Well, there have been so many tablets on the market, but they have fell shy, not just in price, but productivity. Well, ASUS has tried their latest to the test, and it fairly does the job well.The ASUS MeMoPad HD 7 is definitely one of those tablets worth checking out not just in battery life, but also in playback and speed to get online as well. It has good wi-fi connections to get online, without the hassle of getting into a 3G network, good media playback and noble speed. What I do like about it is that it is very simple and easy to understand after a little time, and not longer unlike other tablets. I also like the fact that on this one you have a storage space for your external memory with a micro SD card expansion slot. This I like, because you can get more with a fraction of what you would pay for the Ipad. You can store as much as a 32 GB Micro SD Card, and it works nicely. What I did have a bit of a tough time with it though was trying to get online, but after awhile I found it quite easy. It also has good bluetooth connections as well, so you can use a wireless device flawlessly with it, from headphones to a computer keyboard. What I do wish for is that it would have better voice recognition, it has just as much of a lackluster connection as is with Apple's Suri voice recognition.  But at the end of the day, it works out mostly well for its money.All in all, if you really are looking for a tablet for yourself, I definitely suggest you give the ASUS MeMoPad a try. It definitely is a nice alternative to tablets that are more popular from the Barnes & Noble's Nook to the Apple Ipad and Ipad Mini. You really get nearly everything you want in a tablet or a smartphone, without the hassle in price. This is definitely a tablet I like from the speed and the connectivity, to a better value for your games, and communicating with others on the go.

Had to ship it to TX to the Asus service center where they replaced the battery. It took almost 2 weeks for the repair and then they shipped it back to me via FedEx with signature required.  As I work full time during business hours I was unable to be home to sign for the package.  FedEx told me to ask Asus to change that requirement and Asus refused to help. I was lucky enough to have an ex-husband close to the FedEx station an hour away, and he was able to get the tablet, but it delayed getting the tablet back for my son for another week. It was torture for my 8-year old to be without his favorite toy for almost a month.  Then the second tablet quit working in April! Same problem. I paid another $15 to ship it to Asus. This time the screen got cracked in shipping (?? I had it wrapped good in bubble wrap and newspaper!) and they sent me an email a week later saying I needed to pay $161 for a new LCD screen. I replied saying I wasn't going to be able to pay that when it was more than the tablet was worth, and I waited to hear back. No reply for week. So I emailed again, did 3 live online \"chats\" with Asus and was just told to email again to ask if the tablet could be fixed without fixing the screen each time. Finally on May 23 (a full month from when they received the tablet) I heard back via email from Asus saying they would not fix the tablet without fixing the screen first. I replied saying to please ship it back to me to my workplace so I could sign for it there.  I received a generic email on 5/27 saying they would reply within 48 hours and have not heard anything since then.  My next move is to spend part of my 1 hour of time after my sons go to bed calling Asus to see if they will send back my son's tablet. I will have to find someone else to fix the screen before I have to ship it back to Asus if I want it to work again.  I have already had to purchase a new tablet (a Kindle Fire) so that my boys would each have a tablet to play with.  This has been the worst experience I've ever had with a product.  I would have accepted the bad battery on the first tablet as bad luck, but to have both of them quit working within 4 months says to me that Asus is not a good quality product.

This is actually my second of these tablets. On that note, if I ever buy another of these I will buy it from Amazon.I've owned Galaxy tabs, offbrand tabs, 4 or 5 different ones, and returned them all because my cell phone has been faster, better screen, etc...and I saw no reason to have a \"large cell phone without calling capabilities\" as I saw them.  Everyone would tell me all the things they would do with their tablet, I would jump on the bandwagon, and 3 days later take it back to the store completely disgusted. On a whim I bought this one and my attitude changed.This tablet is incredible.  Let's start with the price. $140 is a great price for a tablet. To go cheaper you're either getting a refurbished one or some oddball no name one.  I actually looked at this, a Galaxy tab, and an iPad while at the store. What sold me what the size, 7 inch as opposed to larger (I like to put them in my purse, and with a case this one barely fits), but the big thing was it has a quad core 1.2 GHz processor. That's right, quad core. It's fast, it plays games and videos without lag, it also has bright great graphics, and best of all something called \"smart saving\" that helps your battery life. I'm a hardcore gamer (curse you Clash of Clans), playing mulitple games all day long when I really should be getting other things done. Instead of charging my phone twice a day I use the tablet and charge it overnight. That's it. I take great pictures of my cats and put them on the internet (might have the next grumpy cat phenom, you never know), and bluetooth them to my other devices. The camera is much better than most tablets cameras that take pictures like the old Kodak Instamatic cameras from the 70s.Downfalls. Sounded too good to be true, right? You'll notice I said this is my second of these tablets. These little gems have one very noticeable and well documented problem.  Don't let the battery run completely down.  There are no charging lights, there's a symbol for a second but otherwise you don't know if it's charging.  If it runs down you can't turn it on, you plug it in and get nothing.  Blank screen, dead tablet.  This happened to me a week after buying the first one, after charging for over an hour with nothing turning on I returned it and bought another.  17 days later I forgot to plug it in at bedtime and I knew the battery was very low.  When I got up in the morning it would not work. Wouldn't turn on, charge, anything. Tried 3 different chargers, my computer, nothing. Called ASUS, was told to send it back and they'd fix it or give me a refurb (which I HATE, if it's under a month old I should get a new replacement, not a repaired one).  After 8 hours of charging it showed a charge symbol on the screen for a second. Finally got it to turn on, and it showed battery at 48%.  Would I be this lucky again? Probably not. My luck doesn't work like that, I'm honestly shocked it finally turned back on this time.  It charged completely and the other thing that happened is I lost my pictures, which luckily I'd already bluetoothed to my phone anyway.If you can remember to charge the tablet I'd say buy it without question. It's the best I've seen, and I've owned tablets that cost hundreds more. Many hundreds.  Where are they? Back at the store. Where is the cheap little quad core? Sitting next to me. I carry it, my book, and my phone at all times. Speaking of, my game is calling me.

I found it was a nice device with a good deal of memory and display. However, after using a month, the power supply was gone. So  I shipped to ASUS repair center. I had to pay for shipping, warranty does not cover for shipping for repair. Customer service is good and promptly responded. However, I am not sure if that was caused by their systems or persons, even though I called customer 3 times to make sure that my return address is correct before shipping back. They recorded my returning address wrong.  I have found out when FedEx started processing my shipment. I had called back and forth to correct my shipping address. Fortunately, it arrives to my correct address.After a few days of using, now I got another problem. Micro-SD card slot was broken. I cannot use for external storage. I need to ship back to ASUS repair center again.  That is pretty annoying. This year I have bought 3 ASUS tablets. The other two are refurbished. But those two are working fine. I got so many problems at brand new one.  That makes me reluctant to trust ASUS Quality on their own brand new products.04/07/2014 -----I think I need to update this to share my experience. After receiving back, I could only use about a week. This time, micro-SD card slot was broken. It could not read the card and the card was jammed inside the slot. The other functions work fine. I have no clue why hardware caused so many problems. Then I called customer support. This time, ASUS provided shipping back. But emailed me a few days later and told me that the motherboard was damaged and will cost me $191.85 plus shipping charge. That surprised me. Wasn't that happened at their own factory? My wife used that Tablet not even a month, mostly sitting on the table without touching since we bought. I asked them to ship it back if ASUS cannot provide any warranty their product's reliability, I would rather spend that money on non-ASUS product, than fixing that crap. It cost me $129 plus tax when I purchased. I still haven't got any email reply from ASUS yet. I will update this review once I get back my tablet from ASUS.05/15/2014 -----ASUS replied my email and told me they would fix the tablet without charging me. That makes more sense for accountability. After receiving my Tablet from ASUS, I have tried to use every day to see if any issue would show up. Everything works fine. They told me the damage was due to inserting micro-SD improperly. I don't think I had inserted improperly. I had a number of microSD devices. I have never had any issue like that. That must be mechanical design issue or QA issue. Now I have to be very carefully inserting microSD card. Anyway, I appreciate ASUS took care of its product and shows itself accountable. My suggestion to ASUS is to put more effort on QA by considering every corner case which could lead the product to damage and design to prevent it. Reliable quality can win customer confidence.  My suggestion to buyer is to be careful when insert microSD card. For transferring information from micro-SD card to computer, use USB cable. Files transfer using USB is pretty fast for ASUS tablet.

White for one, Pink for the other.Had originally purchased the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 but didn't realize they only had 8GB ROM, lesser screen quality, and older processor.The Asus is perfect, long battery life, nice screen, and runs great. It is a little laggy scrolling in the App drawer, but it is a huge upgrade over the Lenovo A2100 from just Dec 2012.There was an immediate updated to JellyBean 4.2.2 not sure of the enhancements as ASUS has its own skin. There are some Apps that come preloaded from ASUS, have tested them so cannot comment.It does have a Parental lock that can be setup and then monitored via web browser to set and change device time allowances. But it has to be activated each time the tablet is turned on, so not very efficient.Since they are for my girls , I haven't played with them too much outside of initial setup. As an e-reader/video streaming device it is great. Kids games it works great too.The only device I would have gotten over this would have been the LG GPad 8.3 or Kindle Fire HD(X).

Compared to how much I paid for my Archos 7 three years ago... well, let's not compare because there is no point.Anyway, here is the short list of Pros and ConsPro:a) the tablet has not crashed even once. I use it every day to read books, watch videos, write emails, browse the web, run some simple utilities, install games and such, but nothing extra-fancyb) with the Wi-Fi constantly on, the battery life is quite impressive. I recharge it once a week (depends on how much I use it, but I am saying on average).c) speed is very good. Much much faster than my old Archos but that goes without saying. Faster than Galaxy Tab 2, that's for sure.d) I found very nice and inexpensive case and accessories for it (tablet kit by Birugear with screen protectors, case, travel chargers etc)e) display is good (not Retina-great quality but very good for my purposes). Unlike some other older displays, the viewing angle is pretty widef) had no problem working with microSD cards, no problems with connecting to my PC to transfer dataCons:a) as I said the screen is OK, not great. Decent... not sure if that can be listed as a con but wthb) some areas of the screen (corners) seem to be slightly less sensitive to the touch than others... not by much but still.c) power and volume buttons are located a bit awkwardly, it  takes a while to start properly pushing them. The other side of the coin (positive side) is that you will never push them by accident (at least not when it is in the Birugear case)OVERALL: for 110 bucks it is an amazing bargain.

Then again, I am not editing excel, powerpoint, or video...just consuming content.Many options between the ASUS installed apps, Google branded apps, and everything available on android/play. In many cases many there is overlapping in uses/purpose among these 3, so you have many options to choose from.I compared to other known brands under $150. The Walmart 7\" (was it HiSense?) which had a mini-HDMI port but only 8gb, no expandable memory, and I think worse screen. Also compared to the Kindle Fire HD and I think the Memo HD had faster performance (and I liked the idea of sitting outside the Amazon pay gardens).One cool feature is the ability to set up several user profiles so different family members can manage their own desktops, apps, and profile logins. The downside is that it appears to install duplicate copies of apps if both users install it (ie 2 copies of Facebook app). This might eventually affect storage capacity but with 16gb I'm doing ok.One small issue was that, at first, I had trouble using earphones. The earphone jack would not enter all the way into the plug--even with a somewhat above normal amount of pressure. Therefore sound would cut back and forth between the speakers and earphones as connection with the half-inserted jack was made and lost. After a few uses, I was annoyed enough that I decided that I would just force the jack all the way in and return the whole thing if something went wrong.

I can access my music directly from the card using the \"Play Music\" app and the sound is pretty good, especially in \"movie mode\".The screen is bright and crisp and while I sometimes have to tap it more than once, it is generally responsive. Many online reviewers have complained about the quality and feel of the Memo Pad, but it's really not that bad. I would not even have notice the slight overlap of the back cover if it had not specifically been pointed out to me.Another common complaint is that the power button and volume rocker is in an awkward spot towards the back of the tablet. Actually, when holding the device in your left hand in the portrait position, the volume rocker is positioned perfectly to be reached with the fingers of your left hand, thus leaving your right hand free.

It washes out a little easier at different angles and has an appreciable gap on the side. So it is a lower quality display but for the price it is not that bad. On the inside we have a ASUS quad core A7 1gb of ram. The performance seems snappy with Android 4.1. There are quick launch apps on the home screen with different options to launch Google now or Gmail.  So for the price 129-149 is hard to complain, it performs above that price class.

I immediately had to watch some videos on netflix to compare and petty much as most reviews state both the picture and audio was quite impressive. neither of us are hard core gamers but we both play a lot of casual games so of course I had to try \"angry birds star wars\", and just for the hell of it \"temple run 2\" both ran perfect, no stuttering or lag.

At first was a bit hesitant because I'd never used Android OS before, but with $150-$200+ difference between this and a IPad 3/4, decided to give this a try, especially after reading overwhelming positive reviews both here and on tech sites.Got it last week, my impressions so far is, for the price it's a excellent tablet.  It doesn't have some of the high end functions that more expensive tablets have, like mini HDMI or camera flash, but small grips on the whole.  And the housing seems to be a bit less durable than other tablets (IPad), but easily fixed with a nice protective case/cover.  Also the Google Play store isn't as robust in offerings as the Apple AppStore at the moment, but quickly catching up.It's got a nice, easy to use operating system (especially after it updated OS version), tablet screen itself is nice (not quite as sharp as with the Retina IPads or higher end tablets, but still quite nice) and responsive (i'm sure in no small reason of the x4 cores), screen itself seems to be quite responsive to finger tapping and dragging. Memory and slowdowns don't seem to be a problem, and even though it only has 16 gigs of storage memory onboard, it's easily enough fixed with a 32 gig micro sd card ($20-25 here on Amazon) and have read that you can use even higher sized micro SD cards, once formatted properly.So far it's done quite well, main uses are for Facebook, light web usage, picture album and some games here and there.  Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a cheaper/starter tablet without sacrificing performance and build.

Fonts are 'sharp' and colors are very vibrant. Screen angle is good. HD videos will look very nice on it. Asus included an app called \"Splendid\" which allows you to control the hue, saturation and temperature of the display, a very nice touch.Build:The device is light and easy to hold with one hand for a prolonged period, good for reading on bed. It's probably not a durable tablet and the screen is not made of Gorilla glass so buying a case and screen protector to avoid scratches is a must.Usage:This tablet is ideal for web browsing, ebook, video chat, and especially watching videos and streaming. The processor should be adequate for all these tasks with few stutters. However, it's highly recommended to speed up the device by installing a third party launcher and disabling built-in apps you don't need. It's GPS actually gets good signal and can get a location fix in a short time so it could be ideal for offline maps. With support of microSD card you can load in a lot of media. It will struggle for realistic 3D games. It was very choppy with Asphalt 7, but general popular games like Temple Run, etc is no problem.I can't confirm the battery life, but the general consensus seems that the MediaTek processor in this tablet is energy efficient which warrant Asus's claim of 10hours battery life. This may coincide with the device staying cool. It does get warm on the top half of the tablet for intensive tasks, but not too uncomfortable.Comparing to the Nexus 7: Comparing to the original (2012) Nexus 7, this MemoPad have a better screen, slightly better speaker I think, rear camera, microSD slot, longer battery life, but somewhat lower performance. However, if you can spend more money, the newer generation Nexus 7 is going to be a much better choice since its at least twice faster and have a rear camera as well. However, Nexus devices never gets microSD slot which can be a minus, this is the primary reason why the person I bought this tablet for wanted it instead of the Nexus 7.A nice bonus, they included a cheap tablet stand in the box.Update: It seems the 4.2.1 firmware of this device it experienced incompatibility issues with a few games, but only a tiny few so I wouldn't be worried. The games that crashed when I tried to run are Fruit Ninja, Let's Golf 3 and Flow. Most other popular games work without problems.

The display is fantastic with no color distortion at odd angles.Minor nits: Lack of any vibration was a surprise; I guess after using Android on phones for so long, I just expect it. Also, the speakers could be better. ASUS makes a big deal out of the audio quality, but it's just marketing. It's the same flat, tinny, no-stereo-separation speaker you'd get with any tablet.

Rarely ever has any hangups unless it's also auto updating apps, which you can disable that through Google Play. Has a micro SD car slot. Has a great outer camera at 5.0 mega pixels. Which is great for a tablet. Speaker quality is good. I bought 4 of these tablets, 3 in blue and 1 in green for my children.The Bad: Out of the 4 tablets I have bought so far. One of them the touch screen stopped working. Still was able to turn it on with no problem, but couldn't unlock the screen. I called Asus and they had me do a factory reset hoping it would fix the problem. Factory reset did NOT work. Screen was still not responding to touch.This happens to be a known issue by the way. I was going to do an RMA, however Asus won't honor their warranty even with a manufacturer defect if there are any scratches or marks of any kind on the tablet. The tablet has never been dropped and has been in a protective case since day 1. However since my son's name was put on it on the back so he knew it was his without turning it on (3 of the same tablet color) they said it was abused. At least I purchased an extended drops and spills warranty so they covered it. I sent them the tablet and received a gift card for the price that I paid for it.I'm debating weather or not to purchase another Asus Memo Pad tablet for my son since their customer service is terrible and they won't honor manufacturer defects. My son loved that tablet and took good care of it. He didn't cause the touch screen to malfunction and stop working. So buyer beware if the newer tablets still have the same manufacturer defect. My kids and I are keeping a close eye on the remaining 3 tablets to see if there are signs that it will do the same thing.Warning Signs That The Touch Screen Will Stop Working: Touch screen starts to act funny, like a ghost is touching the screen by moving characters during game play on it's own without user input. Touch screen randomly stops responding to all touches intermittently. This is what my son's did for 2 days before it stopped functioning all together.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Telescope Control", "Author": "W.

We now are sending out the second tablet we purchased. The keypad function suddenly stopped working. These tablets are well taken care of. They are screen and tablet protected completely and my sons are monitored in their usage of them. I am beside myself that both of these tablets after only four months of usage needed to be serviced already. That is absurd. I have a feeling this will be happening again. I'm happy that the company is willing to fix the issue, but to have to pay to ship to them, then my sons losing all of their info and games and such, it's just quite a pain to deal with this. Why can't they just work properly? I find it hard to believe that these are solid, well built tablets when in purchasing two of them, I've already needed them BOTH serviced after such a short period of use. I'm staring to believe they are junk tablets. Yea, the price wasn't $300 but we did pay $129 for each tablet and for a family on a budget, that isn't cheap to us! I expected more out of these and am feeling let down by the whole brand itself. Such a bummer. :/My advice is that if you have ANY issue that cannot be resolved, contact the company through a live chat. They will work with you on what is the problem and will need all of your info on the tablet itself. They then create an RMA for you to fill out and send with the tablet to Texas for servicing. You have to pay the shipping, but they pay for it on the way back to you. Anyway, good luck to those that own this! Another two cents...if you're considering these tablets...don't!Bought two of these for Christmas as a gift to each of my sons, who at the time were 6 and 7. One of them suddenly stopped working recently and we contacted the company directly, in which we live chatted with someone on the issue. After trouble shooting some things, we realized we weren't getting anywhere and the company then sent us a form through an email so we could pack up the tablet and send it to them so it could be checked and fixed if possible. Within two weeks we got the tablet back, just like new. We lost everything as far as what was downloaded game wise (as that's all they play on their tablets) but we expected that and it was not a problem whatsoever as all the games were just free downloads. We had to pay nothing (except shipping TO them, which I was fine with because we just wanted the problem resolved) and had the tablet back so fast that it was just a very simple process overall. With that, I am very satisfied. The company came through on that retrospect fully.The only issue I have is that they never said what the problem was directly, and that is something I would have liked to have known. I don't understand why that is, but I think they could have least told us what was wrong and possibly why. But we got it back fixed and I'm happy with that. So far, so good. We'll see how these hold up in the future. At least I know I can turn to the company for help when needed as they did come through the first time around. I fully back up going through them if you didn't purchase a warranty through Amazon, and especially if you are after the time frame through Amazon as well. Do not go through what's listed in your booklets...I had to google the company and choose United States to get with someone here. They are located in Texas.

The reviews that talked about the merits of the tablet itself are the ones I paid attention to. One thing that seemed to fuel my purchase were the constant comparisons to iPad minis and Samsungs. I know in some aspects, comparisons must be made to make a judgement, but the ones that put down the Memo Pad because it wasn't an iPad were ridiculous. This will be a review based on personal experience with the Memo Pad HD.Over the last month I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. I worried about using a 7\" tablet because I was used to a 10.1\", but it was so heavy! Once it died it was the perfect reason to look into small form factors. Having a smaller budget to work with and knowing what I wanted in a tablet left me with a small group to choose from and this Memo Pad was always at the top.Here's what I like about it:-The 7\" size is a perfect fit for me. Fits in my bag nicely and doesn't add much weight. I can hold it in my hands for a long time without my hands, arms or shoulders getting tired. I have wrist and shoulder injuries and can't hold much weight for long. I bought a case for it and I love that too. It fits perfectly with access to the buttons and camera without having to remove it. It's great!-The speed. The quad-core processor was a huge factor in my decision to buy it. I didn't see another tablet in this size with a quad-core processor AND all the other features I was looking for in my price range.-The memory. 16 GB with 32 GB expandable where my 64GB micro sd works and shows up just fine.-The sound is awesome for such a tiny tablet. Louder than my laptop!-The battery life. It's excellent. Heavy usage all day after a full charge and I never need to charge it more than that. I just plug it in before bed.-HD quality. It's high res screen is evident as every color is bright and vibrant and can be even more enhanced with the built in software.-And finally, it's hot pink....HOT PINK!! :)But there's no HDMI output? ...

But a few issues (see updates)", "Author": "Eduarrdo Nietzsche", "ReviewID": "RT7LE2Y07ZH82", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have resisted getting a tablet for a long time because I already have an excellent 11.6\" Thinkpad mini-laptop for portable use plus a very capable Android smartphone, in addition to a full sized laptop for home/work use, and couldn't imagine any extra functionality that a tablet could possibly provide.Well, until it dawned upon me that rather than waking one of my laptops up from sleep throughout the day to check email, Facebook, news, weather, calendar or to-do lists, I could simply do that on something bigger than my smartphone, which would severely cut down on the battery wear and tear of the smartphone as well as the overall wear and tear of my laptops.At the same time, I was reluctant to plop down $300-500 for one of the premium-level tablets (and definitely not an iPad, since I hate Apple products on principle as well as from experience). That basically left the Google Nexus 7 as the best bang-for-the-buck option, but I was annoyed at its lack of a microSD card slot since I anticipated using the tablet to play music through my car stereo's AUX input during cross country travels.The Asus MemoPad HD 7 pretty much does everything I really need it to do, and at an amazing pricepoint: my local computer geek chain shop had it for a hundred bucks (it's the \"Lite\" version which has 8GB instead of 16GB of onboard storage, which is irrelevant unless you intend to download tons of games and apps), and I found an open-box one for eighty...truly an offer I couldn't refuse.And am very happy with it so far. It has a relatively limited amount of manufacturer-installed bloatware that cannot be removed or disabled (unlike my girlfriend's Samsung smartphone, which is full of Samsung's proprietary crapware), the 4-core processor (mine has a MediaTek not an \"Intel Celeron\" as Amazon lists here) and 1GB of RAM that provides a pleasantly snappy user experience, the screen is plenty bright and sharp for my needs (I honestly couldn't see a huge difference with the new Nexus 7's supposedly state-of-the-art display), the battery life is decent...no complaints, really. Caveats: I have a TomTom standalone GPS in my car that I'm very happy with so I can't comment on how GPS navigation works on this thing, and I am not a gamer at all so my graphics/speed requirements are modest at best.One unexpected BIG happy surprise: even though Asus officially says that this tablet only accepts a maximum of 32GB microSD card, it works perfectly fine with my SanDisk 64GB SDXC card! From what I've found via googling, Asus is legally obligated to claim a 32GB max because Microsoft owns the \"SDXC\" patent/copyright and would demand a heft licensing fee for mentioning its compatibility. Or something to that effect (I'm no lawyer, heh). Anyway, 64GB is ample room for all the music (and video) you could want to take with you.Sure, the back of the casing is a slippery and slightly chintzy plastic that doesn't sit level due to the curious protrusion around the rear camera lens, but hey that's easily taken care of with a seven dollar case that I ordered (you'd be stupid to use a tablet without a case, anyhow).My only niggly complaint is that the capacitative touch screen is not quite as precise and consistent as I would like...about 25% of the time, more than one tap may be needed. This I'm willing to live with, considering the price and overall usefulness of this device!UPDATE 3/26/2014:Have noticed that various malfunctions pop up whenever the tablet is not being held flat on a table, desk, or generally in a stable downward-pressing position. Specifically, using it while supine in bed = a nightmare of missed keystrokes, unresponsive touchscreen presses, random predictive-typing choices automatically chosen for you, the screen auto-rotate going bonkers (I just gave up and turned off the darn feature), the microSD card somehow becoming dislodged such that the tablet thinks you've manually ejected it without electronically unmounting it first---and on and on!  Unless this is a problem universal to all tablets, my guess is that the innards of this device are not securely held together tightly enough, probably part of the cost-cutting measures that resulted in this tablet costing under half that of its higher-end clone, the Nexus 7.  Sigh...it's not a dealbreaker given the price, but it does merit me reducing my rating from 5 to 4 stars.  Just hope that this is not a harbinger of more serious mechanical/hardware breakdowns to come...perhaps I should spring for that Square Trade warranty after all.UDPATE 4/4/2014:The microSDXC card dismounting by itself is becoming a more frequent problem, not limited to only supine use.

Quad core is pretty useless if it only has 1 gb of ram--it produces a bottleneck.I bought two and one of them immediately started having a battery problem.  It would charge fine but if you restarted or powered it on without it being plugged in, it would report as having 1% battery left and then shut off.  It was incorrect because the tablet was indeed charged 100%.  You had to make sure you turned it on while it was plugged in for it to report correctly.  I contacted Asus and they wanted me to send it in for warranty service and we would have to be without it for a couple weeks.  This wasn't going to cut it because we used that one for my autistic son and he wasn't going to tolerate it being gone (he wouldn't have understood why).  I wanted Asus to charge me for a new one, let me return that one, and then have them refund the money upon receipt of my return.  They were not willing to do this--a major lapse on their part I feel.  Even though it was after the initial 30 days, a VERY helpful Amazon rep sent me one OVERNIGHT and let me return the malfunctioning one.  Yay Amazon!Now the replacement is having similar battery reporting issues.  It had powered off for low battery last night, I plugged it in while off for a bit, then turned it on.  It reported that it was charging and was at 7%.  It remained as 7% for an hour!  I tried different cables and chargers, still would not increase.  I turned it off and let it charge for a bit while off.  When I turned it on it reported having 40%.  It was charging the whole time, but the meter was not changing.  I have a different battery app on it and both were reporting incorrectly, therefore I must assume it must be something about the hardware around the battery.I really hope this doesn't get to be like the one I returned.  My son relies on this tablet and I hate worrying if it's going to reliably charge or not.  I have to check on it like it's a baby.  Very silly.Otherwise, the screen is good...good responsiveness.

I was getting tablets for my 9yo twins, so I was looking at price, durability, and something that they could grow with. I didn't want to by some child specific built tablet which some were even higher priced than the ASUS or the cheaper ones that didn't get very good reviews. In my weeks of research it became evident that the best bang for the buck for this size entry level tablet was between this and the Nexus 7. Both have their pros and cons but they are pretty close in comparison. Everything will tell you the Nexus 7(newer model) is best but it will cost you more too. They said the new ASUS MEMO HD was closely designed to the previous Nexus 7. For me it was not worth the price difference since this was going to be for my kids first tablets. These also had the sd card expansion the Nexus does not. We have had these for about a month and they are used non-stop by my boys. If you are used to using and android based smart phones you will have a easy learning curve in setting up and using these tablets. It runs fast. We have had no issues with internet or running games. My boys run Netflix constantly and there has been no lag. This also has a front and rear camera with decent quality. I set them up with Skype accounts so they can video chat with the grandparents anytime they want. Looked good on our end and my parents said the picture on their end was good too. I find myself grabbing their tablets a lot to use vs. my laptop or cell phone now. I think the viewer angles are good. The only \"con\" I can see as noted by others is this unit does show finger prints easily. But that is only a issue depending on how the light hits it and come on, how hard is it to just wipe it off. They do sell screen protectors for this that helps with this issue, but honestly ours is in a case and I always tell the boys to wash there hands before they use them. Battery life is really good. My boys can use them almost non-stop playing games, streaming movies, internet, etc. and it would be at 20-30% battery life. This has parent control features but I have not set them up. This is a good entry level tablet and perfect size for portability. Will fit in your purse with a case easily ladies. We bought the Procase ASUS MeMO Pad HD Protective case here on Amazon which fit perfect and are very durable( Also come with free stylus). If you been looking at this tablet or want a good entry level tablet this is it. I honestly don't know why anyone would need to spend 300+ for a tablet. If your one of those people who can do everything from their phone but just would like to have a bigger screen to look at then this is your answer.

Its a very bright screen. You get glares from time to time when there is a lot of light in the room so get a MATTE screen protector not a CLEAR and your problem is solved. It has so many features i usually end up finding new ones everyday. i only play slow casual games so i don't no about how good it runs with all the fancy games. Movies look really good on this and it can fit in the back of your jeans if you don't feel like carrying it around.

When I read the specs on this tablet, it seemed almost too good to be true.I recieved the tablet as a present, and here are my impressions.The tablet is very well built.  It has a nice heft to it, but is not too heavy.  The only complaint I have with the tablet is the screen.  It is a hard plastic rather than the \"GorillaGlass\" that I have seen some of the more expensive tablets advertising.  However, I have not had any issues with the screen.The sensitivity of the screen is excellent, although it doesn't seem to like styluses nearly as much as it likes fingers.  I also purchased a Cross Tech2 pen/stylus combo, and the stylus functionality is hit/miss probably 30% of the time.  This happens with a Targus stylus as well, so I don't think it is limited to the Cross pen.The tablet is POWERFUL.  I was shocked to find a tablet with a quad-core processor, 16gb of built in memory, AND a microSD card slot for under $250.  I was even happier to find one for under $150!  I have tried quite a few games on this tablet, and although I am not truly a tablet gamer (I stick to slot games and the occasional Candy Crush Saga), it has performed admirably.  I am however, working on my tablet on a very regular basis (daily).  The tablet is unbelievably nice to carry to jobsites.I had no troubles updating this tablet, although I purchased a white one for my wife, and she encountered an issue with a firmware update that improved the performance of NetFlix.  She is not too worried about it, as she does not watch netflix on the device.  Installation of apps, including the Amazon Appstore was painless.I have installed a 32gb microSD card, and have loaded several digital movies onto the system.  Playback is gorgeous in HD, although the sound only comes from one side when one is holding the tablet in a landscape orientation.  My suggestion, get a nice set of earbuds.All in all, an insanely featured tablet for an unbelievable price.  I have recommended this tablet to QUITE a few friends, and so far, none have been unhappy with it.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, works great", "Author": "Anson M.", "ReviewID": "R2TR1749RGXIVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great screen Quality, functions smoothly without any hangups, good solid build quality to it.

But for this price range, I think this is one of the best.I didn't get any wireless connectivity issues so far. In fact, it works flawlessly and quite fast up to now.The camera works fine and can take average to good quality pictures in daylight or fully lit environment.Power and volume buttons are activated with right amount of pressure.I had the impression that a 7-inch tablet would be too small for me, but it just doesn't feel that way when holding and using it.The Asus apps are actually very useful.I've already installed like 20 apps and they all work perfectly without any issues.Cons:Glossy back is prone to smudgeSome lags when swiping through screens and screen rotationsCamera could be betterI don't know if this will be the case in the future, but I wish it gets updated to android 4.3I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a tablet for this price range.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good quality midrange tablet", "Author": "Busy mom", "ReviewID": "R1XB0ZA6Y5J5SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No troubles so far with this tablet.

I was shopping for a tablet that was around 150.00 which is cheap but didn\u2019t want a CHEAP product and I think this has been accomplished. The performance is pretty good and while it may not play the best games at the best performance (which I was not looking to do anyway) it will play some games and play them well. The screen is nice to look at and the colors pops out at you. The hardware is plastic but meh I have a case for the device so I rarely see it. I am not worry about screen fingerprints or anything because I have a screen protector I use which works well. The battery life is real...I played with the tablet when I first got it pretty strongly for 6 and 1/2 hours (including several games for long periods of time) and I still had 35% battery left....so I am sure it would have made the 10 hours it claims which is excellent. My battery times thereafter have been right about the same doing about the same load on the battery. Good job!I think what this tablet accomplishes is for 1st time or novice users getting them a tablet that they can start from to decide if this would be something good for use by the children or something you can use for yourself without breaking the bank while still getting a quality tablet and that's important. I did a lot of checking into the tablet before buying it and the reviews have been spot on with what I should expect which made me take the leap, well that and getting a lot of Amazon gift cards as gifts recently which made the thing close to free *grin* but I still would have paid the 139.00 for it regardless.I have had other ASuS products in the past for my personal computer builds and such and they have never let me down and neither has this tablet. I think it's well worth the money with good performance, good quality and don\u2019t forget about that lovely SD Slot! Cheap tablet but not a cheap product.

I like it better than the Apple iPad I had formerly -- it is small, easy to hold, and it is easy to enlarge text.  Because it so easily retains sites visited in Google Chrome until I specifically choose to close them, it is a wonderful way to revisit pages I am not done with yet.I use it as a reader, finding it as good as the Kindle Paperwhite I bought when the iPad proved impossible to read books on (too much glare, too hard on the eyes).I listen to music on it, especially now that Spotify is available for Android.  The sound is thin, but works as an accompaniment to my reading or my browsing.What I don't like is Netflix -- which will not work on my Asus 7 HD.  I called Asus, and they were very helpful -- except that no matter how many times I reinstall Netflix, it doesn't work.  So watching movies is not possible -- though you can watch all sorts of YouTubes with no problem.So a great, easy, functional, very portable computer, which has problems with Netflix and has a battery which maybe doesn't last the 8-10 hours it is touted as lasting.  I do like it very much, and use it daily, so this is a very positive review.

It has an HD screen, yes, and a quad-core processor. It's slim, easy to hold, and it has tremendous battery life. It does have a MicroSDHC slot, something that iPads do not. It does NOT have a very high-resolution camera (the rear camera is only 5MP). Its HD screen is NOT 1080p (or equivalent). It's capacitive screen is not nearly as sensitive as an iPad's. Still, this is a powerful little machine with just exactly what you'd need for handling daily business, keeping in touch with people, reading books via the Kindle app, or even doing moderate work. It's also CHEAP; at about $150, you'll be hard-pressed to find another quality tablet with all the same features. As a public school teacher, this machine is ideal for me, because it's powerful enough to handle the entire Google Drive suite, Kindle, and other utilities that I use in the classroom, while at the same time remaining cheap enough that I needn't fear the spills, falls and other potential damage that can come with working with kids (and in fact, it's pretty darn durable, and a cheap case makes it even more so). Ultimately, if you're looking for the latest-and-greatest, this is not the machine for you.

My requirements are very basic - mostly general online activities, email, viewing photos and the occasional video. Not a gamer, so the fairly modest processor of the MeMOPad has been more than up to the task, as has the 720p HD display. Battery life was only OK until I figured out to turn the GPS module off and now it's much improved. Also nice to have the MicroSD slot, something missing on many higher-end tablets, especially for photo files. Immediately popped in a 32GB card so there's plenty of storage. The only real issue I've had is the occasional dismounting of the MicroSD card. Doesn't happen enough to be a big bother though. Some \"professional\" reviewers complained about the MeMOPad's plastic construction and fit & finish, but keeping in mind that it's not a premium priced tablet, I don't find it off-putting at all.

Nope, this is just a story of an older tablet-deprived woman, looking high and low for a tablet to suit her needs, not wanting to spend a lot, and finding the tablet of her dreams.My needs were fairly simple, below 200 dollars, decent ratings, able to handle netflix, skype- very important, at least 1/2 the reason I was getting a tablet was the ability to Skype home when we are traveling, something to look up stuff when we're traveling, download a few apps for fun, play spotify, and take a picture or two.The ASUS MeMo was rated fairly highly both on amazon and through other websites, the price was right, the size was right, so we took the plunge and found the tablet that does everything I need and want.Netflix plays wonderfully, the screen is really crisp. The ASUS is friendly, I tap away and it responds and we are happily learning about each other. I do sometimes have to tap twice with my stylus, it's not something that bothers me.The battery lasts a long time. I played with it and my sons played with it and my husband played with it and I have had to charge it once in 5 days, so not bad.The pictures I take with it are fine. If I was shooting a wedding or something then no, but for a quickie shot or a fun selfie - because it has a camera in front and back- it works just fine.I like the sound quality. Spotify sounds good and the movie sounded good.The fact that it easily orientates from up and down to landscape is a bonus. It responds fast, too.I don't find the tablet either heavy or light, it doesn't feel flimsy to me, although I do have it in a rooCase. I find it easy to hold and operate if I'm sitting up or laying back on the couch.I'm sure that a 600 dollar tablet might have more gizmos or something, but for the price point I was looking at, and the functions I wanted this is the perfect affordable tablet.*Update 12/1/2013We love this tablet so much we bought one for the family to share (this one is mine!) and will probably buy another one for each to have later one.

What I will do is a very short comparison to the two other 7\" tablets I own with this one.Here it goes: compared to the Samsung Tab 2 7\" $170 and the Acer Iconia A100 7\" $300 the Asus MeMOPad HD 7 $150 is AMAZING!  You won't find another tablet that performs this well at this price point on the planet.  Don't get me wrong the Samsung Tab 2 is a very nice tablet  but it weighs more, doesn't have an HD screen, dual-core vs. quad-core and costs more.  The Acer (is dead by the way) is an all around failure.  It was their first generation tablet and the general slowness, heaviness and suckiness shows, however it did have an LED flash... Hurray for Acer!  Oh I almost forgot it costs twice as much as the HD 7.I also own the Asus Transformer $350 and Asus Tab TF300t $400, both 10\" tablets. The HD 7 is just as responsive as the newer TF300t and outperforms the older Transformer.I was blown away by the build quality of this $150 tablet.  Yes its plastic just like almost every other tablet out there.  It has a solid build with a very good quality HD screen and the full compliment of hardware Quad-core Processor, GPS, Bluetooth, micro SD Slot, stereo speakers, dual cameras, 16GB storage, Android 4.2.1 etc.I can't emphasize this enough, you won't find a better tablet by a major manufacturer at this price point.

I blame Microsoft for this inconvenience, not Android or ASUS.I found that it was not easy to get information off of the ASUS customer service site.  I don't think they have yet entered this product into the support data base because it does not recognize model number,model name, or automatic recognition.

The outside is a bit cheap feeling, but the internal features are great. I own a Surface RT, Surface Pro and an iPad 2. I was considering getting an iPad mini to replace the iPad 2, but after using this device, I'm not sure that is necessary. I wanted something smaller and lighter that still allowed me to browse, view videos, get email, compose small documents, get directions, view eBooks and Skype. This device seems to have the bases covered. Not to say the device does not have flaws. Read the pros and cons below for details. But for the price ($130) this device gets 4 stars from me.Pros:I like the size, weight, screen resolution and battery life of this tablet. It plays Netflix videos well. I can use this all day before needing a recharge. And it runs in idle mode for days without a recharge.The viewing angle is very good.I like the access to system setting and notifications with a swipe down from the top.The floating apps are also nice.After I received the 4.2.2 Android update, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I can now add multiple user accounts to the tablet, each with his/her own password and personalizations.Cons:My biggest complaint is the power button. It is too small and hard to find.I am not a fan of the Android file system.The keyboard does not provide great feedback that a key has been pressed. The key changes from dark to blue when you press it. It would be much better if the key got bigger for a moment.The compass app does not seem to work and there appears to be no way to calibrate it.The rear camera that sticks out on the back prevents you from laying the tablet flat on a table, which makes it difficult to type or tap on it without the tablet jiggling or moving.Windows 8.1 has several nice gestures for switching, killing and getting at app features that Android 4.2 is missing.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrell Xskinner", "Author": "Xskinner", "ReviewID": "R3DTD3SK9S2PSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product by a reliable company like Asus.

This is the last time I buy Asus! The specs look great for this tablet but in the end its not worth it. It has everything I wanted: GPS, bluetooth, IPS screen, plenty of storage, quad core cpu. I bought this tablet to replace a generic tablet that I use in my car that doesnt have GPS. Primary use has been connecting to 4g, streaming music via bluetooth to the stereo. For that function my generic tablet works GREAT, never have any problems with it, but I wanted GPS so I bought the Memopad.Problems started when trying to connect this to my Virgin wifi 4g hotspot. After less than a minute the connection would freeze. It would say it was connected but it wouldnt transfer data and give network errors. My other devices (phone and Acer laptop) have no problem maintaining the connection to the hotspot. After hours of trial and error the only way to make this work was to disable wifi security on my hotspot. I did this and then the tablet would stay connected. What a terrible work-around, but I could live with this.Next was syncing the bluetooth to my car stereo, which wasn't a problem. But once the bluetooth is connected the tablet displays \"bluetooth has stopped\" errors every few minutes. This is really annoying when trying to use google maps for nav. Nothing I could do would make this error stop, except disabling bluetooth altogether.After a full charge, which surprisingly only took 1 hour, the tablet lasted for about 2. Far cry from the 10 its advertising. For my purpose wouldnt be a problem because I would keep it connected to the charger at all times anyways but buyer discretion anyways. For full disclosure the screen was on most of the time of this 2 hours which probably drained if fast but it advertises up to 10 hours! 2 hours is just long enough for one movie - which you would be using the screen the entire time for anyways.Now I cant even get it to turn back on! The screen is black and plugging it in to charge doesnt bring up the battery charge indicator anymore. Since this is a very common charge plug (samsung style) I have many chargers laying around but none of them work so that's ruled out. I have let the tablet sit for most of the day hoping it would recover but no luck. Dead as a nail leaving me no choice but to return it. Sad because Ive only had this thing for two days. Actually I should be happy that it died now instead of in a few months outside of the warranty.This is my 2nd bad experience with an Asus product. My other purchase was their high-end touchscreen 1080p laptop. Nothing but problems with every aspect of that laptop and had to return it. This is the last straw for them.

I figured the other functionality would be a bonus.I\u2019ve had a kindle paperwhite for a while now and I LOVED it.  Being able to read in the dark without an external light is amazing.  I wanted to upgrade a bit so I figured I\u2019d shop around for something to replace it.  For the price, I noticed there was a whole line-up of tablets available.  I was so excited to see I could get a tablet in my price range!When I buy something, I research it at great lengths before I make the purchase.  I probably spent 3-4 hours combing over the different tablet sand their features.  It came down to the Asus MemoPad HD 7 and the Kindle fire HD 7 (the new version).  Since I\u2019d already owned a kindle I was leaning that way\u2026but the Asus was 10 dollars cheaper (at the time) and it was more android friendly.  What I mean by that is it runs a fairly straight forward android system (4.2.2).  While the Fire uses android, Amazon tweaks it to the point where you don\u2019t recognize that it\u2019s android.  My though was, \u201cI\u2019ll just put the kindle app on the asus and POOF, instant kindle with full android features\u201d.The degree to which I was wrong is immeasurable.  Out of the box, this thing felt like something you\u2019d give a child.  The tablet was actually flexing and creaking when held.  I instantly knew I had made the wrong choice.  Booting up, I could see the Asus logo was pixelated and the boot times were incredibly long.  I had to manually install two system updates (to upgrade to 4.2.2) which took about an hour.  At times I thought the unit was simply frozen because it went so long without doing anything.  Once it was up and running, I say down to read with the kindle app.  The first thing I noticed was the light grey background to the books.  I thought that was strange since I\u2019d never seen that option before with the app.  Turns out the light grey that I was seeing is Asus\u2019s version of white.  The text was jagged and hard to read against that background.  Even changing the background the sepia created a washed out look.  I couldn\u2019t believe how bad this \u201cHD\u201d display was.Day 3 was when I finally decided this thing purchase mistake.  I went to power it on and got no response.  I thought that was odd and held the power button a bit longer and still nothing.  So I think that the battery died and I go to plug it in\u2026with no response at all.  Uhg. I head to the internet to research what\u2019s wrong. It Turns out this is a very common problem with this unit.  I had to hold the power button (I timed this) for a full 1 minute and 22 seconds to get the unit to power on.  At this point, I couldn\u2019t return it fast enough.My advice:If you want a device mainly for reading and at least some tablet functionality, stick with the Kindle line.  This is even more so if you\u2019re a prime member.  The integration of the various amazon options (like the Kindle store and prime instant video) is seamless and hassle-free.  I\u2019ve since had the pleasure to use the new Kindle Fire HD 7 and Kindle Fire HDX 7, both creating an incredibly enjoyable experience.TLDR; At this price point, buy a Kindle", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "good purchase", "Author": "howard", "ReviewID": "R1TW6Q0IA2265Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good thank you for your ratings got it based on the positive feedback now very glad I did.Great buy..I work in the desktop support field .

I could not be happier with this purchase.  It was less expensive than the Kindle and has expandable memory, microphone, and front and back cameras.  The only thing that is not quite as good as the fire is the sound.  The sound on the memo is very good, but the dolby on the fire was incredible. I would highly recommend the moko cover for it.

Overall this seems like a good tablet for the price, especially considering the features)Lacks the multi-user setting. We bought this tablet SPECIFICALLY for use between my wife and my two preschool children. Other Android 4.2 devices have a multi-user setting. I cannot find it on this one, it is NOT listed under the \"Settings:Device\" menu like the others.This is ridiculous.At a glance (Day 1), the tablet is very fast, seems to be plenty refined and feels good in the hand. No complaints about the build or quality so far, but I will not rate this any higher than 3 stars until they fix this lack of multi-user function, or until I find it buried somewhere in the settings menu in a place that no other device seems to have it.[EDIT]Despite attempting to get the pad to do software updates to get to using Android 4.2.2 yesterday (and being told every time that I was up to date), it decided to update today to 4.2.2. This DOES give me the multi-user function, but it's very buggy.On my secondary  user account, apps often seem to freeze unless you switch from one app to the other using the floating app key. If you momentarily leave an app, and return, it will be running fine again and complete whatever command you gave it that froze it. Doesnt' always happen, and doesn't happen on every app.Either way, at least the multi-user function is working.I have had no other issues with the tablet, and for now I will consider these to be minor bugs that will be worked out.MARCH 2014So far this tablet has been pretty good, but we've simply abandoned the multi-user setting now.

My ASUS picked up wifi wherever located & all was well in our relationship until Monday, Dec. 2. 2013. Not for all the money in the world & all the tea in China would the bloody thing pick up wifi.

After taking it to the I.T dept. at work, who swore something was wrong with their three different wifis, and after shutting down and rebooting 70-11 million times I had to do a factory reset. That solved the problem and wifi connectivity returned. And mind you, the tablet was seeing all the wifi connections it just wasn't connecting to ANY!

I ordered the blue.  I was sent a black.  No big deal.  I ordered the blue because I thought it would show fingerprints less.  I've still managed to get fingerprints ALL over it.  I'll need to get some type of plastic cover.  It immediately found my wireless from my Actiontec DSL Modem (GT784WN).  The tablet is very unresponsive to my finger touch.  Maybe it's just me.  I have the same problem with my iPhone too.  No problem with a stylas.  First thing I did was sync the included kindle app with my amazon account.  I already have kindle for pc.  It synced right up.  It will now download to both the app and pc at the same time.  All with one login and one account.  There are quite a few apps loaded on it that I haven't gone through yet.  I also bought the IVSO ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 7-inch Slim-Book PU Leather Stand Cover Case.  It comes with a stylas/pen.  It helps since my fingers don't seem to want to do the walkin'.  This tablet fits in the case just fine, but doesn't stand up like it's suppose to.  If buying something other than an ASUS HD 7 case, make sure it has an opening along the bottom back where the speaker is.  I was going to buy the Acer Iconia A1 810 tablet.  It's an 8 inch tab.  But, this one is cheaper and the only real differences are the slightly bigger size and an HDMI out on the Acer.  Since the ASUS also make the Google Nexus, ASUS has the inside track of having updates to the Android system sooner than other brands.  This ASUS is my first tablet.  I'll update as I find out new things.UPDATE: February 20, 2014 - My ASUS MeMO Pad is DEAD!  Lasted six months.  Not sure if I'll try to send back to ASUS to be fixed or try a \"fix\" on youtube.

My initial reaction to using it was quite impressive, but then things started to hiccup. On some applications, like Candy Crush, the touch response feature has become quite unbearable. Pressing hard and multiple times with a stylus brings no response. It does this only intermittently, but frustrating none-the-less. I have tried loading music with the micro USB cable from my laptop with Windows 7 on to a brand new 32 GB Class 10 micro SD card, but the device could not recognize the files to play them after inserting it into the on board memory card slot. Something about a wrong format. I also tried loading the music files directly into the internal storage drive, but again could not get the Google music player or one of the top rated music player apps to either read or play them. Today, the unit stopped recognizing my AT&T; U-verse wireless internet connection stating that the signal is not strong enough. Powered unit off and back on with no success getting the wireless antennae to work on the unit. I then tried contacting ASUS for support using their live chat function, but the service is only available M-F during normal business hours. Humph! I've read most of the reviews here, but have not been able to find anyone who has mentioned the transferring music files problem. The Micro SD card also unmounted two or three times for no apparent reason while still being seated in the units on board slot. What's that all about? This is my first tablet experience and I wanted it to be frustration free. It's not going to happen with this unit. I will try to contact ASUS support on Monday to see if there is a fix for these problems.Update: Had to do a complete factory reset to get wireless working again. Humph! Have to start over from scratch now an reload all apps. Need to start over from the beginning on Candy Crush. Bummer! Does anyone know if the Memo Pad requires a special format to install music from a Windows 7 laptop using the Synchronization Function from the media player device? I just used this same function to install music to my new Moto X Phone that also uses the Android operating system with out any hiccups. I'm still on the fence about returning this unit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We'll see if ASUS support will be able to help with the music play problem on Monday.Update: I've just learned from another reviewer that the Asus Memo Tablet will only accept MP3 downloads. What does this mean to the rest of us? Any CD's that you have ripped to your computer using Microsoft Media Player will not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What? It is a format problem! How come I read all the reviews about this tablet on Amazon and a host of other sites that never mentioned this? I know rhetorical question, but OMG you mean my several hundred dollar library of CD's have now become obsolete! Then how come I was just able to transfer all these files on to my new Moto X Andriod 4.2.2 Smart Phone and play them with out any difficulties! This is absolute nonsense for Asus to have done this, maybe in conjunction with Google, and maybe to try and pry more money out of your wallet. Come on guys these are not eight track or cassette tapes!!!! If I had known this in advance, I would have looked elsewhere for a tablet. If I can't find a program to convert these CD's to an MP3 format, it's going back to Amazon and I will keep reading PDF books on my smart phone that can handle these things.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Happy with this", "Author": "George R.", "ReviewID": "R359HIJB9H93UF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this tablet twice the first one worked about a month.
