In fact, I am writing this review on it. This is the kind of device I expected the original Microsoft Surface to be: full Windows, a dock that holds the tablet at various angles, lighter than most iPads, etc. The original Surface disappointed. Acer Iconia does not. On a side note, I was getting frustrated with Windows 8 (on my non-touch screen laptop) like many others but Iconia made me appreciate the OS and the maturing ecosystem.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does What It needs to", "Author": "Andrew B.

You had to plug it in the wall to turn it on ,Some random reboots,Etc however after about a week or so Acer released an update that fixed most of the issues and They seem pretty consistent with the updates.I had the Tablet for about 6 month's now and I love it.It hardly lags video is clear and crystal,Games work with very little issues and the battery life on this this is beautiful.I probably charge it once or twice a week over night.From Constant use you get a good 6-8 hours out of it which isn't bad.I have seen worse .I was scared that the Intel Atom Processor would hold it back ,IDK if that was the original issue and the firmware update squared it away but this thing flys now.My only other issue is the Size of windows 8 + all the Acer crapware will leave you with like 8 gigs for your self.Which at least for me isn't hard to fill in 6 months full of content.I removed most of the crapware and used a Spare 32GB MicroSd I had from an old smartphone and pushed all my library content to the sd.I recommend you do the same or just dish out the extra for the 64 gig.Also utilize Skydrive.I am curious to see how this handles windows 8.If it will make the product better or worse,but for right now I love it.Also Google chrome on windows 8 tablets sucks,at least the last time I used it since it isn't optimized for touchscreens yet ,no pinch to zoom and the keyboard doesn't automatically appear in text boxes. IE10 Works great once you get used to it.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Forget Apple, forget Andriod, forget Nooks and crannies--i mean kindles.

Not even things I really love! But this Tablet is just too perfect. At least for me it is. To keep things short and simple I'll just say this device provides the \"all-in-one\" feel with fewer limitations than other devices I've purchased, tested, or considered buying. There are many tasks I prefer to do on my Windows PC at home. This tablet gives that same experience without the butchered \"mobil app\" look and feel. I particularly like that I can view web pages better than on an iphone/ipad because of flash player, I can still use itunes for my music, I can going online to full websites (not the mobil crap), use googles online tools and features, and even read my books! With the kindle and nook for PC programs its all available without the incompatibility issues. I've found that when it comes to reading ebooks, comics, and PDF's the secret is to turn the brightness down a lot! It'll look really dim at first but your eye will adjust. You'll see that with just enough back-light to make the text legible in a well lit room you wont strain your eyes.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this tablet!", "Author": "Warrior", "ReviewID": "R1F2JW63IBKGRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a good substitute for a laptop as it comes with Win 8.

I have a wireless mouse and keyboard set from logitech. When I need the desktop part of the computer, I hook it up to my monitor. It also works great as a tablet, and does everything I need a computer to do. I use it for Microsoft Office type things, math equations, listening to music and audiobooks, youtube, internet and email. The ipad is not compatible with windows programs or hardware, while this is and comes with Windows 8. I'd really recommend it for people who have to travel alot, where buying a full computer would not work, as this is basically a full computer in a small size.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The machine is Dead within one year of use", "Author": "David F.

Lin", "ReviewID": "R2Z733GDE6IDT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You gotta know what you want when you're considering this tablet.I wanted a tablet because I already have a nice and light laptop for travel (Samsung NP350U2A-W01UB) as well as a desktop workhorse. The tablet's niche would be for daily use - looking up stuff when watching TV, carrying around when I don't want to take even the 12.5\" laptop but still more than just my phone, don't have to worry about the battery running out quickly, and still have the capabilities to run serious applications if necessary.The W510 fits this bill. Very light, very portable (same as taking a tablet, easier than laptop). The Modern? Metro? Whatever Start screen is slick and smooth - enough to make me eventually ditch my Galaxy Note 2 and get a Windows Phone. Running in desktop mode is mixed - some things are fast, some (occasionally when opening some programs) can have quite a bit of a lag time associated, but not enough to say I wouldn't use the desktop mode on this and that I'm not regretting not getting a Surface Pro-level tablet instead with the extra bulk/weight. Took a little bit of time initially to apply all the updates (downloading via app store took a bit longer than I would've expected as well as the requisite 3 or 4 restarts). Battery lasts a long time. One complaint is the microUSB (instead of standard USB) output. I knew before I ordered it that it'd need a dongle to adapt regular USB devices, but it still kind of sucks nonetheless.Overall, a great buy and a much better tablet than the other ones on Android as well as (in my humble opinion) iOS.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I've Met My Companion (The Best Tablet/Laptop to be made yet) +affordable", "Author": "Patricia Hendrickson", "ReviewID": "R2FACEQAZLTSUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I remember when the Microsoft Surface was released during the end of last year. I would see pictures of it and drool, once my eye's hit the price my face would sadden. Recently I had been listening to the Secret and learning about the law of attraction. As I got home one night and was listening to my book, An urge overcame me to thinkk about the hopeless feeling I would get when I saw that treasure. I remembered something the author had mentioned in the book and that was \"When we see things that we want that we want but can't yet have. We shouldn't hold self pitty or grief. We should rejoys in those items like they are our own. Visualize them becoming apart of your life. So that is what I did. I copied pictures of tablets, I would write \"I own a nice tablet\" \"I will get The Surface.: With all of that constant emotional rearranging, positive self talk, hope, faith, and belief. One day it happened, the thought came to my head to try and sell my old 85 truck on ksl. II am new at this type of stuff so it made me a little nervous. Within a week a guy contacted me saying he would pay 700 for it and come pick it up. Lol I was so anxious to get that Surface RT that I just had the guy send me the money  via paypal and I bought it right off of ebay for six hundred $s, I think that was including the keyboard they also charge you for. This day was a sad day for me....when I loaded up my favorite program to install and no go. WTF!!! I thought. lol. I did some more reading and im sure im not the only one who had been upset but Since the Surface RT was being made by an alternate processer, it could not install apps unless you want to *TRICK* buy them from the Microsoft store. (which carries nothing) Well the day came where the Surface Rt overgrew its welcome so I went and checked both pawn shops. The first one told me $250, and the second $350. So I pawned it. It hurt to waist that much money but the Surface RT was not serving any purpose. It has been about five months since I got rid of it. Honestly There is nothing that I miss about the Surface except how it was small. As I was browsing amazon for a new screen for my laptop. Somehow I began browsing tablets, slates, touchscreens. After looking through them over and over this one just seemed to really hold me. I didn't purchase the lapdock until the next week, but I would DEFINATELY include the lapdock,MEMORY...Yea disk space isn't the greatest on here. I purchased the 32 which left me with aproxamately 14 GB left. I'm happy as a kangaroo it comes with a micro sd slot. I'm not sure what the product details says it can handle a 64 GB Micro SD card to stick inside. You can keep all of your media on the card while still having your computer display all of it in your library folders and windows media player. Oh and if you want to keep you C drive low there is a change you can do in the registry that will make it so the app store installs in a different locations (such as your sd)", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen to washed Out - Half the Viewability Of Say An Ipad", "Author": "Bobby \"Deals\"", "ReviewID": "R37LWI9XF5WQL8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love Acer products and have always in the world of laptop parity Acer products has the edge in quality.
