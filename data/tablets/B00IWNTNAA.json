It works great for her needs and was the lowest price for a large 10 inch screen like she wanted. It comes with a usb charger which works but the wall charger is European or Australian (not for US plugs basically). It says it in the product details so I was prepared but that was a surprise for her when she opened the box. Just an FYI; plan ahead to either not use that charger or go ahead and buy a converter for it.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Dual-core Android Tablet 10.1\"\n1GB DDR3 and 8GB flash memory\nWith Front and rear Cameras\nSupport HDMI Output\nBuild-in Wifi, support external 3G dongle", "Name": "Riin 10.1-inch 8gb Tablet Allwinner A20 Dual-core Android 4.2 1gb DDR with Dual Camera Hdmi Output(white)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41I2U%2BJevjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IWNTNAA"}}
