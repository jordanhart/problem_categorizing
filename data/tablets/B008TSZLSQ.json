They first said that tech support would contact me to resolve the issue but they must have realized that obviously there was nothing they could do with a non responsive touch screen. Id rather try out the ainol novo flame english edition and hope for the best with that tablet.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tursion 10 in", "Author": "Ron Urbanski", "ReviewID": "R3BMEM22PVML8M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "nothing more then a paper weight, t's a piece of crap, don't waste your money. worst thing I ever bought, and no support.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Merilyn Perez", "ReviewID": "R1W92LBF43C2ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product the best. and the company always ontime..thanks for be honest.
