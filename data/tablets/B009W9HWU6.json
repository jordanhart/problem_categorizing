{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2EBIZ57N5JG0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.  It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day!  It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have.  I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system).  I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version.  I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version.  I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010).  However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once.  I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day.  I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.).  The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will.  If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device.  In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc.  I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting.  Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVING THE NEW IPAD 4!!  HERE'S A BREAK DOWN", "Author": "Bigz \"BIGz\"", "ReviewID": "RM1Y65IQTWOX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.Externally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.

Well, this is essentially an iPad3 with a few improvements that I really like.I already own an iPad2, but decided to upgrade to this because I needed to bump up to 32GB.  That, and a deal on this iPad which was incredible convinced me to upgrade now. I still use my MacAir and my Dell laptops, but the iPad is my daily go to device and where I go an iPad is going. Great battery life and minimal problems make this a much loved convenience.The improvements are not overwhelming, but the truth is I already love the iPad and this makes it better. I've always thought the screen image was very good, but this is an obvious step up. It is clear, bright and vivid with the improved retina display.The iSight camera at five megapixels is very good, but I wasn't complaining about the pictures I took with my old iPad. Still, it is a nice improvement and it takes a much clearer picture than my old iPhone.The new processor is really fast. I didn't think it was slow before but when I have a lot of apps running I've noticed that it is faster. You'll have to trust me on this one. I tend to run a lot of stuff at the same time and the old iPad was slower, but not to the extent that I found it irritating or irksome.I like the new lightening connector which is an 8 wire adapter. Just me, but it seems less clunky. However, if you have a lot of Apple products that use the old 30 wire adapter, this may be a pain. I'm going to have to get another car charger/wall charger and I'll have to take two chargers to cover both adapter types when I hit the road.Another thing I like is my personal secretary Siri. Depress the screen button and Siri is ready to roll. It is voice interpretive intuitive software that retrieves information. While this will probably seem like rudimentary artificial intelligence in a few years, I get a total kick out of it. It's nice to get directions or find out where the Sox are playing or get the earliest showing of a movie. Love it, though I am still playing around with it and probably haven't scratched the surface yet. I don't know if there is any truth to this, but I've heard that the Suri software may be available for the earlier versions of iPad at a later date.As for the size and weight, minimally larger but I'd be hard pressed to say this except I compared the specs.Here is the thing. If you don't care about a better camera or a better display or a faster processing speed or having your own cyber slave to talk to, go with the less expensive iPad2.I like Apple products. I have been using the iPad for two years now and it is fairly trouble free. The few problems I've had were the result of software upgrades. I am absolutely no techie type, but the problems have all been fixed with minimal grief.This product is getting 4* because the differences between this iPad and its predecessor are slight when you look at the overall big picture. This takes a great product and kicks it up a notch or two, but it hasn't reinvented or reimagined the iPad.Update: I am liking this better each day. The updated processor is nice but this also seems a bit more intuitive if it can possibly be so.The imaging is incredible and the pictures this takes are amazing in their clarity and level of detail.I found that my pricey Joby stand case, which was supposedly made to fit with my iPad 2 works with the new iPad despite very slightly different dimensions. I'm delighted that it doesn't have to be tossed.The only problem I've encountered thus far was an upgrade to the software. This is Apple's problem since it screwed up our other iPads with the same problems, most notably with mail. There is a fix that I found on an Apple forum.Love this, but it is still a 4* considering everything.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "You need one too!", "Author": "Lionsfan \"LionsFanForLife\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0NIXN13N3MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a MacBook and our household owns 3 Ipod Touch devices, and I made the mistake last year in buying the Nook Tablet.  It was ok, but I really didn't use it much because it was a pain to even access web pages, just clumsy overall.  So I plunked down the cash this year and took to leap.  I bought this IPad on Black Friday from the Apple store and it is getting heavy use every day at my house.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros-Awesome Retina display- this is pretty nice.  I wouldn't say it was a selling point, but is nice to have.Nice chip- this has the newest chip in it, and you can't get that with the mini.Apps- I love the apps.  My Nook was a joke compared to the immense amount of choices I have now.Great for kids- My 4 year old loves it...and I mean LOVES it.  There are so many good free apps for her to learn with.Voice dictation- This is it folks.  This was where I dropped the extra $130 or whatever.  You can build documents just speaking.Lightweight- it feels really good as all Apple products do.Charge time- I run this thing all day long and just plug it in at night.Capabilities- I feel like I am just scratching the surface, seriously.Cons-Handling- You need a case, absolutely.  I bought an Otterbox Defender.  This thing almost hit the floor 2 times when I got it.  It is just slippery and is pretty solid so one wrong shift of weight and it might fly out of your hands.I have no other complaints.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad 4", "Author": "E.

Below are some of the improvements with this latest model and some of my impressions.Pros- Dual-core A6X with quad-core graphics means games and apps runs twice as fast compared to the 3rd Gen iPad. No slowdowns on apps that i previously had problems with.- Wifi speeds are also twice as fast. The improvements are noticeable, downloading on the Appstore, watching Youtube and just browsing are quick.- It runs cooler. Using this device for several hours won't burn you, Battery life is also the same to the previous model.- Front facing camera is 720p, back is 5 megapixelCons- Lightning connection port means some accessories won't work without an adapter.- The camera quality wasn't that impressive.Overall the upgraded version has many improvements, if your undecided about making the purchase all you have to do is ask yourself, are you happy with the performance of your current device? if your not a gamer and your not using apps that require a lot of processing power then you don't really need it but if your experiencing slow downs, this is the device you need.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warning Defective iPad!", "Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R17MWPL4MIUCNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love apple products, just like most of the world does!I sold my ipad3 to get the new ipad4 due to the HD front facing camera and the blazing fast A6 chip compared to the A5 I had in my ipad3.Long story short, Biggest mistake ever! The ipad4th generation has an issue with Wi-Fi, if you don't believe me or if you are skeptical just Google it and it will appear right away. It is not my intention at all to harm apple, in fact I plan to return my ipad4 and buy an ipad3 because it was perfect.Also, Just to let you know, after I received my ipad4 I sold it and bought another one just to discover it had the same problem with Wi-Fi.Apple made a huge mistake with their new generation ipad4, and they should either fix the problem or stop selling the unit. The new ipad will disconnect every 5-15 mins constantly! It's terrible, it will make you angry, frustrated ,and this is far from what you would call quality.It's your money and your call, just don't say I didn't warn you.

For this it deserves 5 stars. As an owner of the \"New iPad, aka iPad 3rd generation,\" however, I feel that Apple did an injustice to those who purchased it.The previous version was released to much fan fair in March 2012. This version was released a mere 7 months later, in October 2012. When I called Apple to find out why they would release a newer version so soon after the previous one, the representative who I spoke with informed me that there were problems with the 3rd generation, and as a result, Apple removed it from the market and introduced the generation 4.I have no problem with the fact that technology constantly changes, and that computers are outdated in short order. What I have a problem with, is the fact that Apple prematurely introduced the 3rd generation of the iPad knowing full well that it wasn't ready to be sold. While Tim Cook was onstage last March promoting the 3rd generation of the iPad as the most revolutionary product ever offered by Apple, he knew that it was just a stop-gap measure until the components were ready for the model that you see here.I love Apple products and have always thought that the company treated their customers in the highest regard. As a result of the above, I now feel differently about the company, not the products. As of this writing, Apple sells the iPad 2 and the iPad with Retina Display, aka the 4th generation. They do not sell the 3rd generation at all, as the one listed here is what the 3rd generation was supposed to be. I feel that this is very deceptive on the part of Apple and believe that owners of the now obsolete 3rd generation model should be given the option, for a fee to upgrade to the model presented here. I spoke with customer relations at Apple regarding the above and was told that this would not be an option. They readily agreed that there were \"issues,\" with the 3rd generation model, but refused to tell me what they are. In this regard, they are certainly not being very transparent to their loyal customers.So, the bottom line is that the iPad with Retina Display is a marvelous device, however owners of the previous generation got screwed. I'm giving the model presented here 5 stars, because that's what it deserves. On the other hand, if I had the option to grant stars to the way Apple treated owners of the previous version, I would give them just 1 star.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lemon, not Apple: wi-fi connectivity issues", "Author": "Bea Haven", "ReviewID": "R2FOXOVPREEH8N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I would love the iPad, but I don't even like it at this point.  I love my sister's iPad, my son's and others', but mine won't stay connected to wifi.  I tried to troubleshoot using Apple's website, called AppleCare several times, and ultimately sent the iPad to AppleCare for repair.  But my iPad still doesn't work.  In the same locations that my iPad is nonfunctional, I can use my sister's iPad (she has the iPad w/retina display, too, and I set hers up the same as mine) with no wifi connectivity issues.  But every time I try to access the internet, I get the message that my iPad is not connected to the internet. I go to settings, select the wifi connection, and if it connects at all, it's only briefly.  This happens not just with my home router, but at my place of employment and other wifi access public places (where other iPad users report no difficulty and I have no problems with my laptop, etc.). The AppleCare folks sent my iPad back in 2 days (fast service but the porblem is not solved) with a form letter that states my iPad meets Apple's specifications for acceptable performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my standards. I have a $700+ lemon. I know the Apple iPad is amazing when it works (and it usually works, according to the vast majority of reviews). If Apple replaces this lemon with an iPad that actually works, I will update my review accordingly.Update-1/13/13: I spoke with AppleCare again and was instructed to send the iPad back for maintenance--this will be the second time. Why should I expect it to work this time? What a a waste of time! Another week+ without a functional iPad. If the problem persists after this encounter with AppleCare, I was told the iPad would be replaced. I am becoming more disillusioned with Apple. I have had experience with other iPads and know they can be wonderful when they work, so I would not advise against buying this iPad. But purchase with the knowledge that there is a significant problem with wifi connectivity attested to by many consumers on Apple's own discussion forum. I'm thoroughly frustrated with this lemon and my experience with AppleCare!Update-1/28/13:  After a few returns for maintenance without improvement in performance, Apple replaced my new iPad with a refurbished one. It connects to the internet, but is slow.  I've updated my router, called my wifi provider, and it's still the same.  If I could, I would return this one. One of the big selling points of the iPad is the ease of use and mine has been anything but easy to use with this wifi connectivity issue. Another big selling point is the fast connection speed--not so for me.

I work at BestBuy and people always ask me \"APPLE or ANDROID.\" Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy.

Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking.

It does some things faster, and much more efficiently than my laptop.As a Musician, I can use Garage Band, and video editing apps, for our live footage, and even editing our music videos.

Likely because fonts and such are all still the same size. For photographers, the increased resolution will result in extra sharpness, but for most users it won't make a bit of difference.-- The latest iPad really hasn't added much; it's competitors have been adding innovative designs and features since it came out. Apple needs to come up with a creative twist on the iPad that makes the cost difference worth the purchase.Bottom Line: I have bought iPads for work use, to test products and features we develop.

I'm very happy with the upgrades.  Like with my old iPad I'm basically using it to surf the net, watch streaming videos/podcasts, and read books.  I don't take pictures with it or store music.  I'm also not a gamer - so I can't comment that much on the retina display - but I will say the colors are brighter and I find it easier to read books.  The big difference that I notice is in the processor.  Even with my crappy internet connection I notice a huge improvement in the speed with opening apps and streaming videos.  Battery life is longer than the iPad 2. However, because the battery is bigger on this device it takes a lot longer to charge.  I like to kill the batteries on all my electronic devices before I charge them and from a dead battery to 100% charge on this iPad it took over 8 hours to fully charge.  I wasn't using it when it was charging.  In fact, I read on a couple of review sites that this iPad will continue to charge up to 2 hours after it says it's fully charged.  My advice is to allow yourself extra time and charge it overnight if you can.All in all I'm very happy with it.  Since I carry it with me everywhere I bought the OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Pink Alpenglow for extra protection.

I found myself in a job where I am on very remote locations with quite a bit of downtime and finally decided that I could use one.I have been absolutely thrilled with this device. It is extremely stable, even with the new iOS 7 operating system. I am very happy that I chose the Retina model, because the screen is basically perfect. For everything from web browsing to watching Netflix, the quality of video and images is second to none.App performance on the iPad Retina is superb, and many of the iPad specific apps are simply mind-blowing, particularly some of the art apps like Sketchbook Pro and Procreate. I recently acquired an Adonit Jot 4, which is a pressure sensitive stylus that connects via Bluetooth, and it works like something out of the future. Just crazy good. For forum participation, writing Amazon reviews, etc., I prefer my laptop simply because I don't like typing on a touchscreen, but that's just my personal preference. I can get around on the touchscreen and if I really wanted a physical keyboard, there are several available. But that's not really what the iPad is all about. It's not there to replace your computer; it's a different type of device that excels at browsing and media consumption and is portable in a way that no laptop is.Though it takes a bit longer than I would like to take a full charge, the battery life is excellent, and I rarely find myself needing to charge when I am out and about.As a media consumption / web browsing device, the iPad Retina is ideal. The screen is so amazing that it is generally preferable to me over a larger computer or laptop screen for these purposes. I take a star off of my rating because USB connectivity would be REALLY helpful for those who would like to watch movies that they have stored on an external drive. There really is no reason that the iPad shouldn't have USB.I love my iPad, and it is so usable in this current configuration that I don't see myself having to replace it with the latest and greatest for many years.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very cool", "Author": "TSKPP", "ReviewID": "R1AUZXO9SSK1RI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first ipad!

But even though the Amazon Market Place's packaging for shipment was as good as required for shipping and delivering this type of merchandise, and that the Apple iPad factory box was undamaged, both wrappings intact and unopened, the iPad screen came with a noticeable two centimeter hairline scratch on top center, right below the camera lens. The scratch was visible through the factory envelope-like cellophane wrapping around the iPad itself. That type of scratch, could not had happened at the seller's warehouses, nor during transportation/delivery because it requires direct contact with the screen to produce it and as I explained the delivery package and product box where undamaged and unopened, so responsibility lies with manufacturing facility during or before final boxing of the iPad, which says a little of quality assurance and control in this case. That is, I do not blame Amazon nor the seller for the problem in this particular case (first time ever).That aside, the new iPad is working nicely and has a great retina display (colors, graphics, resolution...) and great speed. But I still will not give it the fourth and fifth stars, because contrary to what I'm used, and expect, to get from Apple products, this one didn't have that mint condition look that I expected from and Apple's new item. Instead of going trough the process of returning with all the time delay and implications (customs in my country for once)I installed a anti-glare/mate screen protector to \"hide\" the scratch, which somehow defeats the purpose of the great retina displayIMPORTANT UPDATE: IOS 7 have a feature that cannot be turned of, which verifies that the Lightning connector is certified by Apple, and as soon as I update to IOS 7, and connected my iPad to be charged with the Lightning connector that came with the iPad in the original, brand new, sealed and unopened factory box I got a pop up display that stated that my iPad connector isn't certified and my not function properly with my iPad. I reported this to apple via chat support and the agent told me, after running an online diagnostic, that my device and connectors were new and that it was a glitch in the IOS 7 verifying routine that would be fixed on a next release (update of IOS 7), so I dismissed (every time) the message and charged my iPad without problems. But that was until today, after connecting the new iPad with the supposedly original Apple lightning connector and receiving the  warning message, the iPad stop charging after reaching 27% charge. Beware, either don't buy this model or wait until Apple issues some kind of correction or update removing that verifying routine from IOS 7. Right now for me, living outside the US this is a disaster, returning the device, for me is not an option. So I will have to take my iPad to a Venezuelan authorized service center, testing and probably buying a new \"original\" lightning connector, cause if I buy the Apple care plan in the US It won't be applicable in my country.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This bad boy rocks!!!!", "Author": "SB", "ReviewID": "RYZ0PSEQ2M0H1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything good about this device which you may have heard by now is total truth.

This is a good generational jump from iPad 1 to iPad 4", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R2DOL5W2KM6Z4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had an iPad 1 for about 2 years.  With the apps that I use through the Apple store, I have gotten more than enough use out of it.  The iPad 2 was not enough of a generational jump without upgraded graphics, and the iPad 3 wasn't enough because of the resolution of the camera.  However, this model is truly a wonder and it will be with me until iPad 8 comes out, I suppose.The integrated camera has excellent resolution, as does the video.  The processor is perceivable faster for graphics intensive games such as those by Gameloft, EA Sports and the like.  Sound seems to have improved, as well.Although the latest rendition uses a different port from the predecessors, it's easier to use since either orientation will work.  It does essentially make my accessories, though, obsolete.  That means a new speaker dock, car charger and whatever else I may need.  However, I have become accustomed to using Bluetooth peripherals making connectivity more seamless.Operation is pretty much identical, and then there's Siri.  I find limited use for Siri since I have a Wifi-only iPad.  I can type faster than hold the Home button to talk, and voice recognition is ok.  Not great.  I can touch type must faster than Siri can understand me and react.  However, I'll give it more time.The housing is as small as iPad 2 and 3.  Battery life is essentially the same since Bluetooth and Wifi are always on with a 75% brightness.  The volume control is responsive.Since I have over 1200 apps, I'm pretty much stuff with Apple.  That is the main reason I haven't considered other operating systems, apart from the Kindle Fire.Overall, I'm pleased.  If you don't have an iPad, this is finally the one.  If you're waiting to upgrade from iPad 1 or 2, then it's a no-brainer.  iPad 3 is certainly not that much behind.  Intuitively, I prefer to have a jump in processing, graphics, sound and resolution before I plan to update, again.I love this device.Two thumbs up.Update:I decided to jump up in memory to the 128 GB version.

If you have a lot of peripherals that fit the older connector, you will need to a buy an adaptor if you want to keep using themI find myself using the iPad for roughly 80% of the activities that I used to do on my laptop. It is now my first choice for web browsing, and it is great for reading e-books. And it is more and more often my preferred way to watch movies and TV programs.Before buying, I compared this iPad to other high-quality tablets such as the 10-inch Nexus. As far as the displays go, the iPad was the clear winner. If the quality of the graphics is high on your list of priorities for a tablet, the 4th generation iPad is far and away the best choice.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple I-Pad 4", "Author": "Dorinda Morpeth \"POTTERSAILOR\"", "ReviewID": "R10UZ94IOXJ1CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gift for my husband, who had been drooling over his brother's I-Pad 3.

Started with an Apple in '81.  Switched to Microsoft pc's in '84 due to lack of software for Apple. I've always heard Apple was user friendly and intuitive  ----NOT.  Especially not their tablet.  File transfers from computer to tablet (iPad) very cumbersome.  Can't just drag and drop from MAC or PC over the network.  Have to go through multistep process with iTunes.  Have to transfer photos in albums.  Once you transfer you can't delete just one photo from the iPad.  You have to delete the whole album, go to your MAC or PC (if iTunes program on your PC works like Apple says it is supposed to - mine doesn't), make a new album with all but the one photo you want to delete from your iPad, sync the album back to the iPad.  On other tablets, just access the network and delete or drag and drop the desired files.  So getting on your home wi-fi network with your iPad only allows you to get on the web.  Doesn't allow you to access the directories of other computers and transfer files with drag and drop or cut and paste or use most printers on the network (only Air printers) like other tablets, desktops or laptops can.

Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems. There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work.

It is the first apple product to hit our home since the iphone 3 failure we had a few years back. So we got the ipad last night and proceeded to set it up. Everything was fine until we tried to use it. The first app we used caused the ipad to restart. So we tried again. Again 1 min into use and it restarted again. We thought, oh, maybe this thing cant download apps and use them at the same time. If that were the case I would return it for sure and not buy another because that is just ridiculous. Luckily that was not the case. The third time we tried an app we had nothing downloading, updating or anything, and it restarted again. I went to apples site to try to talk to someone about it and when I entered the serial number the site said it was out of warranty and no tech support could be used. That told me that there was an error or I was just sold a used ipad. Since amazon doesn't print the serial numbers on the receipt there is no was for me to prove I bought the ipad that same day. I then spoke to amazon about this and they said since I bought it thru a marketplace person we couldn't exchange it but had to return and buy it over. I thought fine...I will go and do that. Well, while I was on the phone the ipad timed out and went to sleep, but it wouldn't wake back up. So I called apple this morning and spoke to them about it. They told me it is possible the item was used before but there is no way for them to find out. They had me do a hard restart which made it possible for the ipad to turn on again but about 5 min after I hung up with the guy it turned off again and wouldn't turn back on. So I made my mind up. I hard restarted the thing, wiped it clean, and will mail it back Monday. Meanwhile, later today I will go to the apple store and buy one from them, brand new, with warranty. I figure this is apples 2nd strike against me. The only 2 apple items I have own were both defective, so either I have the worst possible luck or apple has fairly low quality standards. If I get a third defective product from them its over.Lesson here....check the serial number on apples site as soon as you get your item.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, but not a huge leap from iPad2", "Author": "PositiveLogic", "ReviewID": "R1TWEXARNCGHED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own an iPad because it has business apps I use that are best used with a touch screen. One pros side, there's not much I can add to what's already been said. It is great and I'm glad I upgraded from an iPad 2 to iPad 4.But I'm deducting one star for the following reasons:Apple wants to upsell you from the iPad 2 to the iPad 4 mostly on this criteria:1) Siri. There's nothing revolutionary about it. For most it's answers it just spits out Google search results and then you do the rest. People are fascinated by it because it throws a few human-like colloquialisms.2) Retina display. I upgraded from an iPad 2. To quite frank, things do no all of a sudden jump out at you in iPad 4. Yes, I do like it. And it's very nice to be sure. But the Retina Display is just a name someone dreamed up that makes it sound more innovative than it actually us. High resolution is everywhere. It's just that Apple give it a snazzy name and suddenly, it's like the a new invention.3) \"A6 is 2x faster than A5\" Huh? Reality check. This one is probably where I feel people are misled the most. To me the A5 is noticeably faster and that's nice. But in real life \"twice as fast\" means 50 mpg vs 25 mph. Or flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 8 hours instead of 16. To me the speed difference is more like flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 14 hours instead of 16.All in all, there a lot of hype that used to make the iPad 4 sound like a quantum leap rather than the incremental improvement that it is. Thus we pay more for it.That said, I like it a lot, but mainly for the reasons that people have liked the iPad ever Steve Job unveiled on that big screen behind him...not because of these minor improvements.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "maybe refurbished", "Author": "andrewaa", "ReviewID": "R2IQPAI7UES2H4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it as a new one.

The screen is a bit yellow, and its overall performance is on a par with HTC One. iPad 4's hardware technically is faster, but no any difference is found on system speed so far. Therefore, iPad has no advantage over HTC One, except the much bigger screen.On the other hand, Android is of course MUCH freer and easier to use. The iOS and iTunes always takes me hours to do something that can just be done in three minutes on Android.

I even set up 1 of laptops for dual os usage--- Linux and windows. I really loved Linux the bests but apps are hard to find. So,after nearly 35 yrs of computer usage,I feel I can objectively rate the apple iOS on my new ipad. I heard,read,and researched info. About apple and thought I should change over after conferring with my husband (senior software engineer) who said apple now has business apps for the professional population. That said: here I am after only one week of owning an iPad and I AM CONSIDERING getting rid of it, the main complaints about windows are: 1) windows 8 2) privacy, 3) the wga genuine harassment (paid a lot of money for msn windows 7 and EVEN with re-doing I'd numbers back and forth --- I constantly got a \"not genuine\" tag that constantly pops up no matter what I did--- I had been using the same os and upgraded to professional, and after a year, for some reason,it started popping up the WGA harassment!  4) during os scans,Microsoft data,,virus,identifying, LSO ,was the #1 culprit that were \"infecting\" my computer!  With these 4 windows os  ( there are FAR more) issues , I decided to leave that os. NOW The iPad issues : 1) apple support (for HOW to use this iPad--- not repairs or apps , all of which are general) I am being forced to give the serial number which I know to be a \"record\" of my personal computer. And NO I am NOT interested in a relationship with apple EVER. Don't I have the right to know how to use this expensive piece of ----- I hadn't even turned it on because I didn't want ios7 automatically downloading on my ipad! And the rep lied and said it wouldn't  and I have full control. Over it not happening. Well, it DID auto download without my permission! Even though it isn't installed, IT Is the manipulative,greedy, way that Apple is controlling over what I want to download . Now,I can't get rid of it,and this nagging update flag is in plain sight on my computer every time I turn it on, this control reeks of dictatorship without any regards to MYRight to use my computer! 2) I didn't buy this iPad for facebook or twitter or ANY social Media at all! Instead of going to the media website and installing it BY MY choice, it is everywhere ---- my settings, shows up in website address bar as I am typing which website I wANT to go to. And if my finger slips on it or I accidentally tap those sites, I get connected or it begins to install itself! This alone disgusts me no END! 3) all software downloads have to come through the apple store---how proprietorial is that! That , too, I didn't know. What I was told was that apple apps are virtually virus free without \"bug\". So why can't I download the free open office word processor directly from the Internet? Another  dictatorial control of apple. (4) the web browser is awful! No way of setting privacy features such as third party cookies (instead there is an \"always\" , \"never\" or when I visit,to always accept all cookies. A site by site \"allowable cookie\" option is not available. And I can't even get redirects stopped when I do a first party website connection,  No add ons, and I have to remember every time I leave the site or shut down, to have all browser history deleted and cookie deletion. Safari is the ONLY web browser because all other browsers have to go through apple's  exclusive browser and it slows down Internet service. (5) email is not user friendly. It is difficult to have all email sites linked to this feature. In fact, using emails other than gmail,yahoo is almost impossible. I don,t use them at all. (6) having to constantly use a password each and every time I access they apple stop is time consuming and the iPad doesn't allow me to have it automatically saved.Well there's the review.like I said ,i am considering getting rid of my ipad. In fact, I am trying to find a reason (s) to keep it.

LOL!What wasn't really funny is the fact that I purchased the Newest, 4rth Generation IPad, the 64GBS Version, White, Standard-sized, with the Retina Display screen, and Siri onboard; and I guess, ready to \"speak\", but I won't ever know now, as I am having to return it, and fortunately for me, through a 2nd Party Buyer. Why is THAT a \"Plus\", in my favor? Because another large, corporate entity, that DOES stand behind their customers, will be behind me on the return of this Defective IPad, and literally, right out of the box! The Second Party ALSO, has deemed it \"defective\", formally, which will help.In short, I charged this brand new, IPad, for 12 hours straight, and it only went to 83% battery charge. after 14 hours of continuous chsrging, from TWO different charging stations, ( I also have an Ipod Touch, but that's for later. ) it only reached 95% charge, if NEVER reached a Full Charge, and this is on it's first one! No \"lighting bolts\" in battery, for me to see! I have since packed it up, and am awaiting the \"call-tag ALREADY marked as \"defective\" from the Secondary Partner with Apple, and then I am sending it back ASAP! whether the trouble is the battery, or something technically more involved, I am NOT going to be the one left hanging with it THIS time!Three months ago, I bought my first Apple Product ever, and it was the IPod Touch, also in White, and also the 64GBS-version. It also was my first mp3 player, but I waited more than 3 years to finally decide to get it, as I have had problems with JUST how expensive Apple Products are, but if they work well, after all, \"they\" are the industry standard for the best there is. PLUS, they DO have their own network, IOS, which was very important to me, as well, At any rate, I got the IPod Touch, and it took 3 times, AND a Senior Technician, to get me on-line with the thing, and I told him THEN, that it shouldn't have been that difficult to get it to sync with my in-home wifi. It hadn't been with my other devices, including my workhorse computer. They are supposed to be such \"user-friendly\", people, with a Customer Service Center, and assistants, that are purported to be the best in the world. That is what I have been told, what is advertised the world over, and I have had some friends who have gotten Apple Products themselves, down through the years, and they have sworn by them, mostly. I FINALLY decided to make the leap, and get the Touch. It gave me NOTHING but problems, also right out of the box, and they just started with the problems with the initial set up. There were several others, and within the first two months of owning it, it went into Repair 4 times in turnaround shipping, they had it in their possession MORE than I did! On the fifth trouble call, and me madder than a wet hornet, I FINALLY got myself a Senior Advisor there, who took stock of the several complaints ALREADY lodged, and documented, mind you, and got me a Replacement IPod Touch, and........ It worked like a charm, also right out of the box, and it still is! The thing was, you see, it wasn't defective in the First Place! It has been working just fine, since I was issued it, and thank heaven's for that Senior Tech, as I am NOT sure that Apple Care wouldn't have left me hanging in mid-air, with the original IPod Touch, and I really think that they would have. I have come around a bit since THAT experience about not only Apple's Customer Service, but also concerning Apple's Quality Control Standards! What the heck is up, with that?After that fiasco, WHY was I willing to buy the New IPad? Because it was supposed to be a \"second computer/backup\" which it technically can be, btw, businessman even use them. It also is very portable, and also supposedly, easy to work with. Of course, I won't ever know that now, as I am having to return THIS one due to defectiveness right out of the box. It certainly HAS had an effect on me, I am waiting until AFTER the first of the year, either in January, or even February, before I make another move about getting something for my computing needs, and choices. I WON'T go through THIS mess again, I can tell you that! Besides, what were the odds that the same type of thing would happen to the same person, with TWO DIFFERENT APPLE PRODUCTS? I thought astronomical, that's WHY I took the chance on the purchase of the IPad.Which only goes to show, there are \"Bad Apples's that DO Fall From the Apple Tree\", and sometimes, lightning DOES strike in the same place!
