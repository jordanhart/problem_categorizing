Plays the games without a problem.It is a shame they discontinued this product, and replaced it with a less storage, lower memory version which is the Matsunichi Marquis. I read all the specifications before buying, and for about the same price this is a much better bargani.The sound is very loud like the Galaxy Tab1 that we have. It goes at lightning speed to the internet, I saw some of the games download in minutes. There is an Open Office free app that can be installed. I don't use that, but it will work. The camera is the usual  cheap kind it has only one. Still for me works perfectly fast to the net , emails, plays music it has 8 gb storage which is acceptable.The only con I seen is that it doesn't have an icon to lower the volume on the screen. The thing that I like the most besides it performance is how sturdy it is it has metal on the sides and on the back is a tought plactic it is quite heavy I like that. I will be always very greatful that I can find  items that I need or want at an affordable price even if it breaks tomorrow, (which I expect it will never happen) I still be happy and it will just send it to repair it looks like an Ipad and for my needs it works like one.  Bottom line is a great product a very good tablet.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D7YRP3G"}}
