{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I haven't found a \"groove\" for my iPad", "Author": "R S", "ReviewID": "R2GATC2JQQF16T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got my iPad a little over two months ago. It's a nice device that can do lots of stuff, but I guess the problem for me is that it doesn't do anything my laptop/iPhone can't do, there's plenty of stuff that my laptop can do that my iPad can't do, and the things my iPad can do, it can't do as well as other machines.Apple's marketing for the device gives you many impressions. For example, that the iPad is thin and light, and therefore easily portable. That the iPad \"puts the internet in your hands\", giving you the ability to browse the whole internet with swipes of your fingers. That it's \"magical and revolutionary\". That $499 is an incredible deal for all of this. Unfortunately, the longer I own my iPad, the more I drift to the conclusion that none of these claims are true.The iPad is certainly thin, no thicker than my first-generation iPhone. It's fairly light, at 1.5 pounds, much lighter than my laptop or even my netbook. The question is, does that make it any easier to use? And the answer is no. The bottom line is that the iPad is still a 10\" device, and once you take into account that it needs to have a case to be protected, it becomes thicker and heavier. (By the way, Apple's case for the iPad is going to run you about $40.) I'm a student that lugs around 10lb textbooks on a daily basis. It doesn't make a difference to me whether the computer in my backpack is a 4.5lb laptop or a 1.5lb tablet. The iPad is no more portable than a laptop.When in use, the iPad won't seem like a thin and light device. Unlike a laptop, which can rest on a desk or your lap, you have to pretty much constantly hold your iPad at the angle that's best for you, and since you need one hand to interact with the device, the job of holding it will be delegated to the other hand. This becomes tiresome after a very short period of time. Although I like the idea of being able to watch a movie on Netflix or read a Kindle book for iPad for extended periods of time, this really isn't feasible. Both of those activities are better-suited for a laptop (or a TV/paperback if you're old-fashioned). If Apple could make the iPad less than a pound, it would greatly help. You could also buy a stand for the iPad,[...]. There goes another $30.So the iPad is no easier to carry around than a laptop and its weight makes it difficult to use for extended periods. So how does it perform when you're actually using it? It does fine for almost all tasks. Netflix videos load quickly, movies rented or purhased from iTunes look fantastic, music from the native iPad applications or Rhapsody or Pandora sound great, etc. I do wonder, though, if the touch interface used by the iPad is really logical. The touch interface in the iPod touch/iPhone makes some sense, because it allows the screen to be much bigger (instead of having many small buttons). On the iPad however, constantly flicking the screen doesn't seem as intuitive. Scrolling through a long list of musical artists for example takes much more grandiose hand movements than it does for an iPhone. Am I saying the touch interface doesn't work well, or can't be fun? No, but I am suggesting that using a mouse or track pad for a screen this large might make more sense. The touch interface of the iPad is not compelling. When using Safari I often think that my laptop can browse the internet much easier.Typing on the iPad is another problem. While the on-screen popup keyboard is a decent size (about the size of the keyboard on my netbook), trying to do serious typing with a 2-dimensional interface is tough. Again, it's easy enough to type with your thumbs on an iPhone because all keys are within easy reach. But if you try to type on the iPad at anything above 40 words per minute (I type 110 words a minute on a proper computer), you will make myriad mistakes that Autocorrect won't fix. The popup keyboard also has the unfortunate side effet of obstructing a third of the screen, making everything feel cramped. Also, you frequently have to interrupt your typing to access a symbol that's much easier to access on a real keyboard. Overall, typing on the iPad is a frustrating experience. Typing up comments on a blog post on Safari might be doable; don't even entertain for a moment that you might be able to type up an entire document on the iPad. Of course, you can buy an external keyboard for the iPad which would make text input a lot faster and easier, but then you have the problem of how to hold the iPad and type at the same time. If you want to go this route, Apple's keyboard will set you back another $70 for the wireless keyboard and $80 for the keyboard dock.I will touch upon one final subject, the apps. It's really amazing what you can do with an iPod touch or iPhone with the thousands of apps available for those devices. My iPhone is at once a phone, text messaging device, calculator, voice recorder, camera, MP3 player, video player, pocket computer, game player, metronome, etc. On the iPad, the apps aren't as impressive. A laptop can already do all of those things for free, so it doesn't feel thrilling to pay $3.99 for a simple metronome app in the App Store, or $7.99 for a word processing app when Open Office is completely free. The iPad is really quite a limited device in what it can do, and again the touch interface more often is a hindrance than a compelling benefit. I bought a music composition app for $12.99 that's absolutely dreadful; I wish I could get a refund because it's now a worthless placeholder on my home screen.  Finally, games on the iPad are often awkward because of the size of the device. Devices like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS are designed to fit into your hands nicely. The iPod touch is small enough to work as a gaming device. The iPad is too large and not designed for gaming at all, even simple gaming. For example, the game China Town Wars is quite fun on the iPod touch, and you would think that the generous screen of the iPad would make it even more fun. Unfortunately, you have to stretch out your fingers to even reach some of the controls, greatly limiting the fun potential. Games like Doodle Jump which force you to physically move the iPad quickly get tiring because of the weight of the machine.Ultimately, I think what people want from the iPad is an exciting and easy new way to browse the internet and consume media, but the interface that's used by laptops and computers is by far the superior way to do those things. The iPad has made me realize that I never had a problem with the way my laptop functions, and that part of the reason the iPhone works so well is because it fits into your pocket. The iPad tries to bridge the gap between the two, and the result is an anemic compromise. You get neither the portability of the iPhone nor the power and ease of use of a laptop. On a related note, 16GB of storage memory for a device like this is pathetic. My music collection alone is 40GB, and movies are at least 1GB a pop. You can get a more expensive iPad with slightly more memory, but at that point, the iPad becomes more expensive than half-decent laptops, and you have to start wondering when you have to give in to reason.I would give the iPad 1 star, but I'm giving it 2 because of the build quality (the aluminum backing is nice and the touch screen does work very well), and the battery life, which is sufficient so that you don't need to carry around the charger with you if you decide to take the iPad out. The iPad starts up from sleep in just a couple seconds, app load times are shorter than program load times on computers, and the sound quality from the speakers is better than most laptops. The iPad looks and runs smooth; it loses no points on presentation.As someone who owns a laptop and iPhone, I have failed to find a groove for my iPad. There's never a time when I think \"My iPad can do this better than my laptop or phone.\" If you don't have an iPod Touch or iPhone, get one of those instead of an iPad. If you don't have a laptop, get one of those before you get an iPad. A netbook costs only $285 these days and will give you 10x the storage, more RAM and processing speed, a bigger screen (10\" vs. 9.7\"), a physical keyboard, a webcam, etc.The iPad is an interesting device, but can't currently compete with the form factor of a laptop or handheld iOS device.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "PC users beware!", "Author": "Deej", "ReviewID": "R131H2VAZNT6IA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17\" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads \"Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding\". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads \"not charging\". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the counter and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. If your bathroom has a fan, you won't hear it while showering. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest \"Batman\" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17\" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed \"OMG\" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted \"OMB\". I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. It fills the screen with the sheer blue coating that prevents you from doing anything until disable it which I have to exit from the page and return.Most apps or pages allow you to enlarge the font on the screen or do the finger stretch thing but some don't and if you don't have the greatest vision could be hard to read.  Mostly I find this on the iPhone apps I installed on the iPad.The search function on the iBooks app leaves a lot to be desired.  You can only search exact titles or authors. If you want a subject matter like \"gay\", the results will not bring up books on that topic. You have to know the specific name of the book or author.It has one speaker so watching movies with the speaker on won't give you stereo but if you plug in headphones, viola! stereo sound.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws. If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "it's not you, it's me . . .

Even though I'm a Mac-only person, I never had an iPod or an iPhone, so I think that many of my problems arise from that and will probably go away in time.Right now I'm not sure how to answer the great Wizard of Oz question:  good witch or bad witch?GOOD WITCH:~light, small, and I didn't have to play the whole \"how many books in my purse?\" game for the transAtlantic flight~beautiful screen~great battery life -- I read the new Maisie Dobbs all the way across the pond~holds a massive number of books and movies, and I've got just the 16gb model~gets you into many interesting conversationsBAD WITCH~hard to keep it turned off when not in use and that's bad for draining the battery~steep learning curve if you don't have an iPhone or iPod-touch~pages on book-mode turn too easily unless you keep a perfect grip on it~hard to prop up on a table to read while eating~no substitute for a real book when standing in line, sitting in bright sun, falling asleep ...~no way (yet) to directly up-load pix from camera~no real photo software~hard-to-use documents software~wireless connection not all that enthusiastic compared to my laptop~sloooooooooooow to charge up, which is a real issue when there's only one outlet in your hotel roomSo am I glad I bought one?  Well, sort of.  If I weren't traveling, I might be more grumpy, but the book/movie thing alone is certainly sufficient reason for getting an iPad.PS/News from the front on 4/15::~the Netflix thing -- which doesn't work in Europe, so I hadn't tried it when I wrote the review -- is AWESOME.  Netflix has really stepped up the available offerings, too.~there's a KINDLE app now and you can get books from Amazon that the iBookStore doesn't have.  The special effects aren't as cool, but it's still fabulous to be able to get a book in 10 seconds.

More deceptively, there IS a filter for that, but it still gives you iPhone apps, which don't look as cool or work quite as well on the Pad.~I'm very very very glad that there is a Kindle app, because the bookstore is low on new releases, at least in mysteries and thrillers~I still worry constantly about dropping it and eagerly await the arrival of the Apple case.~The wireless problems I grumped about are now famous and no fix in sight.Summary?  still glad I have it.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "The first affordable tablet computer worth buying!", "Author": "Chris A. Kantack", "ReviewID": "RKMINUXIWV6Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's an update to my original review.  I bought the iPad on April 3rd (first day it was available).  Best gadget purchase I've ever made.  The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.Here's what I really like about the iPad: 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.  With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes  about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a \"standby off\" which uses virtually no power and  allows \"instant on\" capability.  2. Superb web browsing experience.  The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom  in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text  perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.  True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal \"hardship\" as the iPad has  other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen  Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7\" size seems  just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on  a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but  what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided  you are not in direct sunlight.  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.  The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course  it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.  In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several \"streaming radio\" apps  available that allow you to use your iPad as an \"internet radio\".  6. Huge library of new and existing applications.  There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a  decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,  there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.  My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather  sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many  free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.  Another great built-in app is \"Maps\". \"Maps\" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability  to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can  often compute your approximate location.  7. Great battery life!  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll  get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.  With the lastest software update from Apple, battery  life seems even better.  Even after several months of regular use, I'm getting 10 hours or more of use  per charge.There are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.  My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, \"Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?\".  Indeed, now  that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting  conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the  iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find  on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.  2. Awkward to hold without a case.  When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,  the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the  experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy  to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad  when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit  without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad  anywhere without it.  3. Not a stellar \"WiFi performer\".  I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the  iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect  at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to  a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect  even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not  very sensitive) WiFI capability.  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.  Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the  same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering  alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.  5. Kind of a heavy unit.  1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one  to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has  bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass  and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.I've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.I've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Rate it for what it is, not what it isn't...", "Author": "J. Flood", "ReviewID": "R30GIGSNY94PPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought the 32G Wifi and been using it for about 10 days now.  This is a review of what the iPad actually IS.  It's not a lot of other things so it's kind of silly to complain about that.  Don't buy it if you want to do something it currently can't do.  Hardly a reason to trash it. We are a mixed Mac/PC family with 3 students scattered from elementary school to high school.  This was bought as a gift instead of a Macbook with the enthusiastic consent of the 13 year old who will be the primary user.  It is still probably riding the initial rush any new \"toy\", but I can tell you I'm seriously contemplating buying another when the 3G version comes out.  The second would be a pure luxury purchase admittedly.  This first one though is definitely going to be over subscribed for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell. To begin- It's a fascinating piece of technology.  It would probably make a great primary computer for someone who doesn't really need a real desktop or laptop most of the time.  (Grandparents, etc.) Going forward I'll recommend this instead of the Mac minis I've steered people to over the last couple of years. So far we've only gotten the black cover from Mac as an accessory.  It synced easily with our existing iMac and iTunes and immediately uploaded the existing iTouch apps.  I also bought the Pages and Numbers apps for 10 bucks each.  I downloaded both the Kindle app and iBooks to compare.  I also added NPR, Netflix, The Weather Channel app, and the 14 dollar Elements Book/App.  I synced his playlists and tossed on about 500 pictures from last year and this year.  I'll delve a little deeper into most of these.The Screen- The screen is very impressive.  It really makes the device what is it obviously.  Then again it sucks up fingerprints to an amazing degree.  Cleans up easily though and you adapt pretty easily to the change.  I can't see how to avoid this problem when you're touching the screen constantly and still expect a flawless picture.The E-readers-  iBooks wins on the pure look and feel aspect.  It may just be a temporary effect, but reading in iBooks just felt more like reading a real book.  Kindle wins on the amount of books and cross platform compatibility.  I think I trust Amazon more at this point to keep any purchased books in a format I can count on for a longer period of time.  I have to admit, I'm not fully confident in either company's willingness to port this format 10 or 15 years down the road.  I'll probably stock up on any free books in iBooks for now and purchase anything I need from Amazon's Kindle store.  I haven't sat down and read a full book \"cover to cover\" yet, but I've done some lengthy stretches with both apps.  Please don't hate me, but I found reading on this to be more enjoyable than reading on a Kindle.iPhoto-  Pictures look amazing on this.  I was very easily able to set up slideshows and pair them with tunes from iTunes.  Most of the shots I used were a little over 5mb originally and ported with the ability to zoom in close quite clearly.  I included 1 shot of us standing next to the 20th Maine monument at Gettysburg.  While not really in view in the original shot, I was able to zoom in and read the individually inscribed names very clearly.  This app really wows people with the clarity of the screen/photos.  The sound is pretty good for the size of the device but not amazing.Safari (Browser)- I'm familiar with and use Safari regularly at home so I found the web experience to be normal for the most part.  I noticed occasional blanks where I guess flash apps would be, but I'm more of a news reader.  I haven't spent a huge amount of time surfing on it, but it seemed fine when I did.  No complaints from the other family members.Netflix - This was a surprise.  I didn't realize how well this would work.  We were watching The Office within a couple of minutes and the screen is big enough that two can watch and still have it be an immersive experience.  Of course not everything on Netflix is available for instant view, but it's a free app and we're already members so I can't complain.  This was very easy to setup and I'd recommend trying it to anyone.Pages- this the Apple version of Word and on the iPad it's the light version to boot.  That said, it a pretty nifty little word processor that he's used to do homework already.  You have to sync it to iTunes and then open the doc with the full version of Pages or Word.  Here I have a pretty big beef with Apple.  I've got Pages 08 which I bought in late 08 as part of iWorks.  To sync you have to have Pages 09?!  Word 97 is supported but not Pages 08?  I happen to have Word for Mac so it wasn't a big deal but I was really ticked off at the time.  You might even be able to export as a .doc and then load into Pages (didn't think of it at the time) but I don't know for sure.  Either way I can't believe Apple wouldn't support this out of the box.  Anyway, it worked out fine even if it wasn't terribly intuitive.  Going forward he can do it on his own with no problem.Specialty Apps - NPR/Weather Channel - I can easily see people getting a little out of control in designing their own apps for no real reason.  Both of these were free and pretty well executed though.  There are many of these out there but I had read reviews on both of these so we started with them.  I imagine we'll add and delete apps frequently over time.The Elements: A Visual Exploration- A very impressive educational e-book app that was highly recommended and that I spent a lot of time playing with and reading.  This was a little pricey for an e-book, but it was also rebuilt as app to take advantage of the iPad video capabilities including 3D (haven't gotten the glasses yet).  It's really another wow factor app when showing the app to people.Pro's.  Undeniable cool factor right now (that will fade, I know). Beautiful executed form and basic functionality. Reasonable cost factor for the level of functionality COMBINED with the ease of use and intuitive UI. No wifi connectivity issues so far. Light weight.Con's  The things it doesn't have - camera specifically. The Pages 08 incompatibility. Learning curve for some basics functions Printing more cumbersome than it needs to be.This is the longest review I've written by far for Amazon, especially considering I didn't even buy the iPad here.  I thought it was important though to get a fairly evenhanded review (yes, I know I like Macs) out there from someone who has actually paid for and used an iPad.  It is not for everyone.  If you have a Kindle already there's no reason you shouldn't keep it and continue reading with it.  If you're an Apple hater because of their DRM/closed garden, I totally understand.  If you're a power PC or Linux user you'll probably have something you can tool around with to your heart's content shortly.  For a pretty large group though, I think this is a very viable option to do a lot useful/fun things without traumatizing your already overworked friend/relative who's also your IT guy.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad's Achilles Heal", "Author": "SeaKeithRUn", "ReviewID": "R2K4CBJB89H64O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased an iPad for my wife who loves the instant on, the very portable form factor and the many uses for this device provided by the multitude of varied Apps that you can purchase for iPad.I had heard about the scuffle that Apple and Adobe were going through around Flash support for the web browser but didn't think the issue was of much consequence.As my wife and I have been using the iPad it is becoming very apparent to us just how much Flash is used on the internet.

I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price.

This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pros and cons of an iPad", "Author": "Jaffrey W. Ali \"Relentless Pursuit of Technology\"", "ReviewID": "R1163TL0NF65OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many others, I too was faced with the delimma of buying a netbook v. an iPad. I spent a lot of time researching the products and spent my $ buying both an iPad and what I consider to be the very best netbook on the market today - The Sony Vaio X (unfortunately, Sony has just stopped selling the Vaio X!).Let me clarify up front that the iPad simply blows away each and every netbook you see in stores like Best Buy in the sub $500 range. Whether it is design, performance or build quality you'll regret buying one of those netbooks for an iPad. So here is my Sony Vaio X v. iPad comparison.1. Cost:iPad 64 GB wi-fi: 699 (3G wasn't available). But equivalent pricing for features would be + $130 (for 3G) + $ 40 (case since the screen on the ipad is exposed) + $30 for VGA connector + $30 for SD card + usb adapter = $930 (still missing camera).Sony Vaio X(64 GB): $1299 (includes Verizon 3G inbuilt)GAP: iPad Appox $300 cheaper2. OS:iPad: iphone OS - instant on, app store, multi touchSony Vaio X: Windows 7 Professional - powerfulAdvantage: Depends (personally I prefer Win 7 for most things)3. Design: Surprisingly in terms of weight and thickness both are about the same. However, the carbon fiber body on the vaio x is gorgeous! The Vaio X is NOT like any other netbook in terms of how it is built.Advantage: Tablet v. traditional notebook. Again, tablet is better for media and web browsing. Traditional for productivity software like MS Office.4. Battery: The Vaio comes with a standard 2 hour battery which is blown away by the over 10 hours on the ipad. However, the Vaio also includes a 12 hour extended battery. But this battery increases the weight of the Vaio to 2.5lb, making it about an inch thicker (at its widest) and a pound heavier than the ipad.Advantage: Slightly to the ipad, unless you don't care about the extra 1 lb weight added by the XL Vaio battery.5. Features: Vaio wins this hands down with much better array of expandable memory slots, 2 usb ports and ethrnet cable slot and included VGA port, front facing camera and ability to connect an optical drive if needed (I have a super slim usb powered dvd drive). The ipads biggest advantage is the app store, which is more of a software rather than hardware feature.6. Screen: ipad's IPS LCD wins this one hands down. On paper the larger, higher resolution LED backlighting Vaio looks more impressive, but the better viewing angle and high quality glass on the ipad screen makes it much easier to read text and watch movies etc.7.Performance: The biggest advantage of the ipad is that you don't have to wait 60 seconds before you can start using it. Also,the ipad is much faster at connecting to a wifi network.8. Others: While the iPad gets a lot of attention, so does the vaio x. The fan on the vaio x can be a little distracting when it is on. Overall if I think of the intangibles such as the variety of apps on the app store, the speed at which you can turn on the device and start browsing the web, the email client, the photo viewer app etc etc...the ipad is just a much more compelling device. Last but not least the ipad simply destroys the Vaio or any netbook when it comes to gaming! The ipad is an amazing gaming device. If you haven't tried it....you're missing something.MY FINAL ANALYSIS: If I didn't have an iphone or ipod touch I'd say this would be a no brainer. The quick access to email and the internet when compared to a netbook like the vaio x is just too great of an advantage for me. When you have to wait for a device for 60 seconds to wake it up from hibernation and remember to put it to sleep so that it does not drain the battery it's just not as convenient as the ipad. Also the screen on the ipad is just amazing....However, I own BOTH an iphone and an ipod touch. Therefore for me the Vaio X is a more useful device. I also have an ebook reader, so while the ipad is a fantastic ebook reader it would be duplicating another device that I already have. I have decided to return my ipad (I am a day away from the 14 day return period) and it will cost me $70 for re stocking and another $50 or so I spent on ipad apps. Hopefully, I'll be able to use some of these apps when I upgrade to iOS4 in the near future. But $120 was the price I had to pay to know for sure that I don't need an ipad (right now). Of course IF my Vaio X were to die, I'd get an ipad in a heart beat :)", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very pleasantly surprised", "Author": "Terrybfla", "ReviewID": "RADBH7SFPQ72P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my iPad in May so this is a 7 month review.In general, I dislike Apple for the restrictions that they place on their hardware, interfaces and software (especially iTunes).  Loyal PC/Windows user since 1985.  I generally subscribe to the open-source mantra \"If you can't open it, you don't own it.\"  I have only personally owned one other Apple product (the clip iPod shuffle which I liked for its size, simplicity and durability).  I have never owned an iPhone and though my wife has an iPod Touch I was never a big fan of that.  I have heard reference that iPad is a big iPhone or Touch...possibly as I never fully explored either of those two options.With all that said, I absolutely love my iPad.  I did not think I would and was looking towards a Kindle or Sony E-Reader when I got the 64g/3g as a gift from my wife.  I will not rehash the specs or the features...instead, this is what I like and dislike:What I use it for:- Time Wasting: #1 use.  This year I had to spend lots of time in hospital waiting rooms.  This was a Godsend!!  Movies, books, games, Facebook and email.  It kept me from being too bored anywhere I know I will be waiting : Airport, DMV, Dr Office, Parole Board, Parent-Teacher meetings...- Reading: In bed at night, at the gym on the elliptical, on the plane.  The reader is a good one.  I have lots of ePubs and it handles them very well.  Magazine PDFs look great.- Web Browsing: I prefer Atomic vs. Safari and the browser works well.  Miss Flash, but not terribly.- Facebook: Using the Friendly app due to lack of Flash conflicting with the picture uploader FB uses.  Easy to use and quick.- Games: At $0 to $5 (for most game apps) the iPad is an ever changing game platform.  I probably have bought 50+ of them by now.  Get bored?  Get another cheap.  Sure a PSP functions better, but try cycling through 50 games in a PSP...big $$$ and trips to the store!- News: USA Today, NPR, CNN, SkyGrid and Instapaper are my primary news apps.  I review them in the morning on the elliptical at the gym...no way to do that easily with paper.- Travel Apps: Flight Tracker, Weather, GPS, Maps, UrbanSpoon, Goby, etc.  All useful when traveling.- Crossword Puzzles and Words With Friends: hooked on both these apps.What has it replaced?- Calendar/Contacts: Synced to my online and Outlook calendars it acts as a planner substitute.- GPS: in the car using the $3 Motion X Drive GPS.  I like it better than the one integrated into my car (that I paid more than $3 for).- Books & Magazines: Like going on vacation with a library without the bulk.- HP 12c Financial Calculator: Expensive app ($12) but one less thing to carry.- Laptop:  Not a true substitute but pretty close for much of what I used it for - especially for traveling (browsing, email, picture storage, etc).  I have not fired up the laptop since I got the iPad.- MP3 player: I use it, but I am not wowed by it.- Smart Phone: Possibly...not sure on this one yet.  The phone can do most of what the pad can do but it is SO small!!- VCR/DVD: We have a TV connection cable and it becomes a portable video player for travel.Like- Build quality:  It's heavy and well finished. It feels solid and looks sleek.  The Kindle, E-Reader, and other readers do not measure up.  Even the Galaxy (which I view as the closest substitute) does not \"feel\" as good.  Not very scientific...but it is what it is.- App Store:  With 300,000+ apps, the app store seems to have at least one app to do whatever I am looking to accomplish.  THIS is the key to the iPad (and probably iPhone and Touch as well, though I confess ignorance here).- Size:  I am 47 and now need glasses for reading.  The screen size is great.  Can't imagine squinting at a SmartPhone screen for some of these functions.  Typing is very easy compared to a smartphone though not as easy as a PC.  About the same as a small laptop.- User Interface Experience:  Smooth, seamless, instant response.  Very, very well polished.  Have played with Android devices (Galaxy Tab and Droid X) and don't see the same polish.- Camera Interface: Basically an SD card reader for the iPad.  Backs up my camera easily.Dislike- Size:  Need a \"man-purse\" or \"European Should Bag...it was a gift!\" to carry it.  Most of the time I keep it tucked under my arm.  It is also pretty heavy to hold and read a book.  I keep it propped up somewhere to do read extensively.  But...heavy = build quality.- No Flash:  Should play it.  No reason not to.  I personally have not experienced a lot of problems with this but I do not frequent youtube or gaming sites.  I see it on maybe 15-20% of the sites I visit and generally can work around it.  I am told HTML5 is the cure...we'll see.- No Camera:  Should have one (or two) and should shoot video too.  Bad oversight.- Charging:  Though battery life is OK (I must charge mine every night), the 10Watt charger is annoying.  Wish the standard 5W USB would work.- Cases:  Yeah.. you will want a case.  2 options - minimalist or protection.  I use the Apple minimalist case and like it, but it does not offer much protection and the viewing/display options are limited.  With more options and/or protection, size becomes even more problematic.- Photo Album:  I can move my videos, TV shows and Books around...why can't I organize my pictures!?!?!  More of an oversight than a flaw but annoying.What to buy?- Want an eReader?  Look at the file formats they can handle and the hardware quality (controls, viewing, etc).- Want a tablet (I think this is the genre)?  Look at the apps and the ability of the hardware to handle them well.  This is the key to the whole experience!!  Software that works well with the device, which can be downloaded on demand and managed in modules. Apple appears to have done this well.In summary, although not previously an Apple fan, I really am impressed by my iPad.  I liken it to my first digital camera (a gift device that I also did not want) which changed the way I viewed and used photography.  The iPad fills a gap in lower end mobile computing that I didn't really even perceive was there until I got it.  The Apple control/oversight is both restrictive and enhances the user experience.  So far, I have found it to be more useful than detrimental.

I find that the built in speakers and the lack of a camera like its cousin, the iPod, a little irritating. That is the only reason for me not giving it a full five star rating. The sound is great when using earphones, ear buds or external speakers.  But the fact that there are over 200,000 apps, something for everyone, is incrediblle. I have the Wi-Fi only version which I use at home, hotels and Wi-Fi hotspots. I decided that the 3G AT&T; monthly charges were a little to pricey for my pocket book. Watching videos and movies on the LED backlit screen is of great quality, beating even some of the HGTV's. I love the fact that depending on what you are doing, you can turn the iPad either horizontal or verticle. The keyboard is of good size, not like the tiny one on the iPod. I find that the 32GB flash drive is quite sufficant for me. I have approximatly 1200 songs, a couple of books and 3 or 4 movies stored on it with room left. This is a nice little 1.5lb bundle of joy.

I have bought the English version of the IPod 64GB. Well, a lot of things have been said about the product's features and how great it looks and all. Time to point out some negative facts and reasons why i would not buy an Ipad again.I noticed that people praise the product based on their first impression rather than on actual every day experience.Here are some disturbing facts about the all new and shiny iPad.-Overpriced! If you consider that you can buy a netbook for half the costs, which outperforms the iPad in just about every way this latest Apple toy is clearly overpriced. Ok, it's not a netbook and it's not a laptop. But hello? One wonders why Apple's profits have skyrocket in recent months! A retail price of (maximum) 500 USD would just about be acceptable. But 800 USD for a product that offers less features than the late IPod 4th Generation is a joke.Unlike the iPod 4G, the iPad has no still camera and no video camera. It's also impossible to do Skype calls at this time. The obvious benefit over the iPod is obviously is  the big screen and as a result from this, the better resolution and picture quality.-Another major drawback: Apple does not allow iPad/iPod users to view flash content. Yes, that's right! If you want to watch a video on the internet that requires Adobe's Flash Player, your outta luck! And since 75% of all internet videos use the Flash Player, this is a major setback!According to Apple, the use of Flash Player would lower the performance of the iPad/iPod and also would lower resources to a rather low level. Excuse me? If am i paying 800 bucks for a so called \"premium product\" i get to decide which content i want to play and not Apple!Here we go again, with the comparison to the cheap but solid netbooks of today! All the netbooks can play Flash content, not to mention the other countless applications users have become to appreciate such as Skype or web bases games. Netbooks have more disc space to offer, you get to decide what programs/applications to install and so on. They also offer a real keyboard and countless plugs which are essential today. What does the iPad have to offer?Obviously no USB, no HDMI, no mic, no firewire etc. And again, for double the price over a modern netbook that is!But the list of flaws goes on even further. Many of the apps that you can download from the apps store and iTunes are loaded with bugs! I recently purchased an eBook and after it finished downloading i tried to open it only to get the following message thrown into my face: \"failed to load book because the requested resource is missing\".That was it for my first reading experience. I am still unable to open the book and i now have to contact iTunes for further assistance.If Apple wants to sell Computers to the mass, they need to re-think their price strategy. If you want to buy a protective hard plastic case, or a similar  nylon cover, you end up paying between 20 and 80 (!) USD. That's insane, knowing that the production costs for an iPhone/iPad plastic shell are in the range of 25-40 cents!Wake up Steve Jobs, success is one thing but endless greed will always keep you under the wings of big Bill Gates, who remains to supply 90% of all Computers to consumers around the world.

Every other app is rock solid but this one.  It's also slow, confusing yet primitive, and crashes and errors constantly.  I cannot gripe about this enough.  Unless you are running a mac, steer clear of this product! - Very slow web-browsing speed compared to even the lowest end laptops.  Total lack of caching means flipping back a page forces a reload of the page from the web.

I was looking for a device to read text books in pdf format. I was looking for a device with at least 9.7\" display. The Plastic Logic device doesn't seem to be coming out any time soon and I wasn't sure about the Iliad. I was on the edge  between the Kindle DX and the Ipad. I checked out the ipad and looked at some pdf's and was concerned about the display size, practicality of zooming in every time and prolonged reading on a back lit screen.After much deliberation (and research) I bought the Ipad. I unpacked the box at around 4pm. I couldn't put down the device until 2 am! It took all of 5 minutes to connect to my 802.11B Linksys router (it negotiates the WEP/WAP, key number and simply expected the Password/Key that I had used for security). I have worked on many high end LCD monitors but I have never seen a display so plush! My jaw literally dropped when I saw Magazine covers on zino (its a free app). The choice of applications on iTunes is mind boggling. At first I was sceptical about watching movies at this size. But the Netflix app rendering is so smooth, I felt like I was watching at 1080p on some high end SONY Bravia. Wall Street Journal , although expensive, is laid out so well that if other papers followed suit, it will bring the demise of their physical circulation immediately.Battery life is another thing that is so surprising. I had the device on, almost constantly, for almost 10 hours, and the level fell barely to 80%.Finally what really blew me away, is the finger swipe movement. I have never used an Ipod touch or Iphone before, so this was new to me. It is extraordinarily accurate and smooth and beats 20 years of Mouse development! The virtual keyboard is perfectly sensitive.Oh, and yes, I downloaded the GoodReader app and finally got around to reading my pdf text books. The screen is a bit small for reading text books with tables and network diagrams, but the pdf reader has a great margin-crop feature. Using this feature in landscape mode, with constant zoom, reading the most complex pdf becomes a breeze.

I have a nice PC, and an iPhone, but I have never owned a laptop. I needed something with some portability that would allow me to have a good e-reader, do some light Excel and Word document editing, and some internet browsing around the house. I have an infant son and it is not convenient to always have to be in the office doing things that I can now do downstairs on this unit.This is amazing. I have a router that is at least 5 years old and I haven't had any problems with the iPad (or my year old iPhone 3GS). It works remarkably similar to the iPhone, except it is obviously bigger. I have PDF textbooks for class and it was simple to email them to myself, open and save them in iBooks. There were no formatting errors, nor was there any for .doc files that I converted into Pages. It was much simpler than I imagined. Actually, until I looked closer at buying this, I didn't even realize I had the option to convert .doc and .xls files into usable files on any Mac unit, so that was the clincher for me. The internet is very fast and easy to navigate. I synced it with iTunes, had my PDF's, a few .doc files imported, email set up, some music and photos transferred within 30 minutes and I did some homework on it.As an afterthought, I have a huge collection of sheet music that I am going to scan into PDF format and transfer to the unit. I can just set the unit on my music stand; the back light will serve me well.This is a near perfect unit. I got the 16 gig wifi unit because I already have a big music archive on my iphone, I don't need my entire photo archive with me everywhere I go and if I am going to watch something while traveling, a few good episodes of the Simpsons will be fine. I will probably just read on it anyway. If you have an ipod or iphone I don't understand why you would need 3G and a huge storage space. This is a great supplementary computer for me and having used it for a little bit I know a MacBook will be my next purchase.Also, the bluetooth keyboard works great. Wall Street Journal app is incredible too. The only problem with Apple are the huge lines and wait times while at their retail stores.I read a lot of reviews and I have not yet experienced the Wifi connectivity problems that others have complained about. Like I said I have an old rabbit ear style router, and it is upstairs. I have been using the iPad downstairs, on the far end of the house and I am getting full bars.

She got hers in November and I got mine recently. This device rocks. It reminds me of my Iphone 4 on steroids with a much bigger screen. I started to go blind playing games on my iphone. The ipad seemed like a logical choice. I am very happy with it in most areas. Feels good to the hands, light, easy to tote around. Very easy setup and a breeze to use especially if you have an iphone and or ipod touch. I was using it within minutes right out the box. Web browsing is easy. Very handy for checking e-mail. A ton of programs of course through the Apple app store. So why not 5 stars. There are two things that bother me about this device. It has major issues with downloading games from the ipad app store app. Why that is I don't know. I have tried and least 3 games and ended up just downloading them on my main laptop and syncing. Easy enough but why the extra step?. I never had problems with iphone like this. Second of all it does not do flash video. Apple stupidly made a decision not based on customer needs but based on a stupid conflict with Adobe. Flash is still widely used throughout the internet and its a pain to not have this capability. You can use Cloud Browse app as a work around but its clunky and not worth the hassle. On the positive side the battery life is great. The ipad is the beginning shift to major laptops having touch capabilities and I would not be surprised to see lets say a macbook air with  boot capabilities to run both ios an mac os as well as windows 7. Stay tuned Apple has some tricks up its sleeves but for christ sakes get flash to work on this device. At over 600 plus dollars there is absolutely no reason it can't. Steve Jobs is stubborn. Com'on Steve loosen up. Flash will not destabilize the iOS operating system. How come Android OS can do it with no problem.

Then reality crept in, and for a while it seemed like I had purchased a very overpriced netbook without a keyboard. But with the Kindle app for reading and Netflix for movies, it was really great for those two uses. And then more apps came on board, iTalk for recording meetings, Goodreader for opening all those different file formats, Atomic web browser with all the features missing from Mobile Safari, plus more. And the games. All those games. My PS3, Wii, Xbox, and PSP are collecting dust. Games on the iPad are great, getting better, and relatively cheap, usually under five bucks, compared to fifty or sixty for console games.There came a day when I realized that I hadn't touched my netbook or laptop for weeks. I still lugged the netbook around, mostly out of habit, but I never used it. Things were easier on the iPad. And faster, overall--I could turn on the iPad, load an app like Mail or Facebook or weather and be done with it, and have the iPad back in the bag in the same time it would take my netbook to completely wake up (not just for Windows to show up, but to get to where I could actually run a program). Plus, the iPad seems to have endless battery life. Plug it in every few days, and it's fine. I've become used to seeing 5% battery left and not instantly saving everything and looking for an electrical outlet. 5% is plenty of time. Also, if I have to type something long, which the iPad is pretty poor for, you know what? I use my desktop computer. There isn't really a use when my laptop is a better choice than either the iPad or my \"real\" computer. But I have big fingers, so I find the keyboard on my netbook to be only slightly less useless than the iPad's virtual one, and my laptop to be a poor substitute for the full-sized keyboard on my desktop.The only things I don't like about the iPad after using it for these many months are: The weight. About half the weight would be good. And the AT&T; 3G. It is essentially useless where I live. I unsubscribed and turned it off for good after about a month of frustration. If and when there's a Verizon 3G iPad, I'll think very seriously about getting one.Overall, I love it. I use it constantly.

It is the almost-realization of the idea that our media consumption experience should be centered around a single device that is portable and intuitive.What I love most about Apple's product is web browsing. Never has the interenet felt so engaging and interactive. Since I first used the iPhone, perusing the web by touch just felt natural and now, with iPad's larger screen, it is my preferred method for checking email, accessing the latest news, and downloading content. While it is disappointing that the screen is not wider to allow for a full-sized touch keyboard, it is still much less constraining than the iPhone's and other tablet devices' out there.Listening to music, watching videos, viewing pictures is all better on the iPad thanks to the size of the screen and the larger capacity. While it competes with eBook readers, it does not exactly stand as an alternative to buying a Kindle or a Nook as the reflective glass on the front makes reading for extended periods of time can be difficult in bright lighting conditions - even with polarized sunglasses on.The iPad may end up being your go-to gadget for a lot of the things you would otherwise use a computer or phone to do, but at this point, it still must exist alongside them rather than replace them.

Then, in April after they were released I tried a couple of them at a univerity and immediately felt that I must have one.This is the kind of device I have long waited for, a fantastic tool for reading technical manuals and books, access to internet, weather radar, GPS information, e-mail, etc. Having communications available anywhere anywhere I can get wifi or AT&T; cellular is more than just a novelty for me, it has become important and useful. iPad is a surprisingly good tool for writing. Some really excellent apps, like the iAnnotate PDF reader, which is vastly better than the Adobe reader (and it allows you to create your own bookmarks and annotations in the PDF.) In summary, the iPad redefines what a personal computer is for me.Addressing some concerns I and others have had:1) It requires you to have a PC or Mac so you can initially set it up, and you need to connect to your PC to perform some kinds of operations, like setting up some e-mail accounts.2) Eye strain has not been an issue for me, and I use it mostly for reading. The display is fantastic.3) The keyboard seemed at first glance like it would be horrible. This is not the case at all. I am surprised at how good it is, and I can touch type with it efficiently when using the wide screen, or use it in Blackberry fashion when using the narrow screen.4) There have been some usability issues on web sites because not all of them support the iPad yet, at least not fully. There seems to be an effort afoot to replace Flash with a new standard, but meanwhile many videos cannot be viewed because the iPad does not support Flash.5) Magazine subscriptions are not widely available for the iPad.6) I am a life-long \"book person\", and have had bad previous experience with electronic books and PDF documents. I must honestly say that reading with the iPad has been superior to using a physical book in all ways but one: the ability to pre-read the book quickly, and as I use it more, I think I will find ways to approximate the value of a good preread. It's truly amazing. I have not tried the latest Kindle and similar devices, but I assume they are comparable to the iPad in readability and responsiveness. If you are a book person and resist these electronic gadgets, as I did, I recommend you try one out at a time when you can spend at least 15 minutes with one.

I purchased the 64-Gig Wi-Fi version on day one and immediately had problems with it. I arrived at my hotel from my business meeting at about 5pm and wanted to play with my new toy. It took 3hrs to sync my 50 Gig iTunes Library because it kept crashing, it was nightmare because it kept finding \"corrupted\" files during the sync process and crashing - these are files I purchased in iTunes and had to DELETE before the sync would work and to make matters worse I can't re-download those files, so if I want another Digital copy of Terminator - that work, I would have to buy it (even though it had always synched fine before). It's why I loathe DRM. The hotel that I was in only used a hard wired connection, so I had to go down to the lobby to use the WiFi and set up all my apps which wasn't cool. Due to the lack of multi-tasking it took almost two hours to set up my apps like the Kindle, Marvel, etc. Because I could only download one book at a time and I had to sit there and watch the download progress bar. It was almost 11pm by the time I finally got everything setup.At the Airport, I didn't want to pay $10 for two hours of WiFi (another reason I hate WiFi only devices, most places charge too much money for it and it rarely works well), so I tried to watch a couple of movies and the screen completely washed out in the \"bright\" light. I couldn't see any movies that were \"dark\" like Harry Potter, Xfiles, etc.  After one day of minimal use this thing had Smudges all over the place, it looked ugly when turned off. Luckily the smudges don't really show when it's turned on.The real trouble started when I got home. The thing refused to stay connected to my Verizon Fios network. Every time it woke from sleep not only did I have to reconnect but I had to re-enter my Network ID, reading web sites became an exercise in frustration because it disconnected literally every 2 or 3 minutes. And a lot of Apps simply \"crashed\" the second the connection was lost. So it failed miserably at it's most basic function. I found it to be too big, heavy and uncomfortable to actually read in Bed, I actually had to lay it down in landscape mode with a little prop stand provided by the iPad case to read it. If I had to do that, I'd might as well use a laptop. I'm assuming I would have gotten used to holding if I had more time to play with it, but I only had an unreasonable 14 days to return it.When Apps work, they were beautiful to look at and use - Plants Vs. Zombies, Marvel, Comixology, ABC, Yahoo (surprisingly amazing free app), Kindle, Zinio, etc. The Apps is why you get this. The problem is a lot of these apps are way too much where they are .99 or 2.99 on the iPhone, they are inflated to $10 and up on the iPad. The price inflation is ridiculous, especially considering most of these apps won't work on your iPhone. I'd be willing to pay $7 or $8 if they worked on both.For a device that's $900 (it's only worth purchasing the 3G 64 Gig Model - you will fill up the 16 and 32 gigs quickly when the apps are averaging almost a gig), it's damn difficult to actually get my files onto the device. I have a bunch of Comic book .jpgs, word docs, etc. that I would like use, but have yet to figure out how to actually get them on the device. I broke down and bought the Pages App because that was supposed to make it easy, but it did nothing to help me get my files over. So that was a waste of money. Apple just screwed over iPad users by delaying the release of the SDK 4.0 that brings multi-tasking until this fall.So yes, I returned the WiFi version, I'm tempted to get the 3G version but $900 is just too much for a device that's only based on potential, and not what it actually is today. It also kills me that I kind of miss having it and I would be rewarding Apple for making the WiFi version so Gimpy that I'm forced to purchase the 3G when I already know how bad AT&T;'s 3G is.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "defective, incomplete product w altered serial number on the box", "Author": "mnl", "ReviewID": "R2W6LWZ0CESKZ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i ordered an ipad1 from IMG Direct through amazon and it came today.  the ipad was DOA (dead on arrival); it would not start regardless of the type of reset i tried.  the ipad is a 3G device but there was no sim card in the tray.  when i looked at the box, the original serial number was scratched off the barcode label, telling me that the vendor had sent another (broken) device instead of the one that was originally in the box.i have returned the product to amazon and requested a refund.  it's a miserable business practice to ship defective, incomplete and altered products, especially when the vendor clearly knows what they are doing.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "TTN", "ReviewID": "R1MM73BWT22UPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first start off by stating that I am not the biggest Apple fan when it comes to their OS. I have always been a tech geek and love all things tech; so with that said I usually like trying everything. I purchased this iPad 64 during it's first month of launch and here are my thoughts.Hardware: Like with all Apple products, their hardware is always top notch. The design is very seamless and everything just blends together well. If you own any of the iPod Touches then you will be right at home here, even down to the scratch prone back. In terms of weight, the iPad feels light initially but after a few minutes of web surfing or book reading you will soon realize that you're holding a 9.7 inch screen device. Not to say that its heavy, it just takes a little getting use to. I've read many reviews where people complained about the large screen bezel, but I rather like it because it gives you more real estate to hold the device comfortably without accidentally triggering the touch screen. Final verdict on hardware? It's worth every penny.Software: Here is where my love-hate relationship with Apple starts. I have never been a fan of their computing OS or their mobile iOS. If you own an iPod Touch (which I own 2), then the interface is identical. Although there are a few tablet optimization on the iPad (like the calendar and email), I don't think its enough to justify this purchase if you already own an iPod Touch. In term of usage; pretty much everything I do on my iPad I can also do on my iPod Touch. I think the software has potential and will grow as the developers create more tablet centric apps. Final verdict on software? If you have an iPod Touch, been there done that.Overall use: So what do I use my iPad for? My iPad actually get heavy usage, I work in an ER and I consult patients on a daily bases. I use my iPad to input and extract data during my consultations. Extremely useful and handy in that regards. I love the ability to have my iPad boot up instantaneously (as appose to my lap). Being able to talk to my patients and swipe and flick through my forms is almost effortless. I also use my iPad to create art work using SketchBookPro. There are times when I have to contribute to text book chapters and a figure or diagram is needed. I actually create and draw those figures on my iPad and import them to Photoshop for final touch ups. I think being able to do these 2 things makes the iPad purchase worth while.

Being able to zoom-in on the text makes it easy on my eyes and the full-color screen displays the graphs very naturally. I'm so happy to have this instead of a traditional text book (and at $250 it cost just as much as some single-use printed texts).> Aside from being an e-reader, it's pretty much a very-large iPhone.The internet displays pages nicely. Some pages even look better on iPad than on my computer. I generally just use one page at a time though, computer still has it beat on multi-tasting.I like the email, when the iPad is displaying on it's side, you can see your inbox and selected message at the same time, making it easy to flip through them quickly. I prefer to check my email on the iPad.I like that I don't have to start it up. I can quickly check my email, look in a book, or do some basic web browsing without starting up (like I do my computer).> This does not replace my computer, and I never asked it to.Some people have iPads instead of computers, in which case buying the oldest model is probably not what they're going for. But as an e-read and mid-point between computing and iPhone, this is great.It's light enough to carry like a book, and low-profile enough to take where a computer would seem conspicuous or in the way.The only downside, is that I wish I'd bought one with more memory.

I got this after my laptop failed on me and I went to get a warranty replacement.  My main reason getting an iPad is that it was light, easy to carry around and the touchscreen was easy for me to use.  For me this is very important due to a physical disability that limits my range of motion and limits my hand use, only able to grip something pretty light.A laptop was awkward for me to move around and difficult to carry if I was using my manual wheelchair.  I don't have the money for a second gen iPad, so, I went this one.  I've had it for about a week and couldn't be happier with it and the ease with which I can use and move it.  Like some of the other reviews have said, it does have it's limitations, especially since I do a lot of photoshopping, which has always been best done on a desktop for me anyways.Other then that I use for school, I go online, and for my books for school, regular books (the iPad makes it easier to read books and newspapers because I do not have to mess with pages nor try to keep the book open), the touch interface does not require a ton of pressure and the swipe to get though falls within my range of motion perfectly.  I would drop stuff trying to press buttons bore while I tried to balance and work a mouse too.I'm not sure about writing a full document, such as I would for school, yet as I ran out of money to purchase the program I'd need to write it then export it as a .docx (format required for my school).  I have even gotten Dragon for speech to text on here and it works better (so far) then my version on my desktop.

When I wanted to get a tablet I decided on the ipad since the reviews were mostly through the roof, with the exception of a disgruntled customer who bought a used one and is mad at the seller. I also wanted to try an Apple product out and see what all the shouting was about.Now that I have had the device for over a month I can tell you that it is well built and solid. I like the simplicity which some might find limiting since unlike my Droid phone, there is only one main button for navigating in and out of applications and a volume control & on/off switch. That's it. The virtual keyboard is plenty large enough for most tasks but is really not designed to replace a laptop computer... yet. I have the ipad first generation 64gig so there is no camera and that's fine with me.The nitch I typically use this device for is reading e-mail, reading news stories, watching Netflix movies and playing games. It usually does these functions flawlessly. I didn't get a case since it adds to the bulk. I keep it stored/protected in a thin cotton bag that doubles as a screen wipe. I know I know, some may find this sacrilegious, especially Apple heads. Like I said the device is solidly built. A friend of mine commented that the ipad is just a big iphone or ipod touch. I don't know, I don't own either.The only negative I have found is that some apps require an additional step to load into the ipad. A text window appears telling me I have to go to the Apple App store from my desk top computer, link my device to the desk top and finish loading the app into the ipad from there. I haven't done that yet but why the additional step with some apps? Can someone explain that to me? All the apps I want to add to my Droid phone can be done in one step by simply going to the Droid market place. If you are considering a tablet, the ipad is a good choice.

For the price there are a lot of disfunctional aspects.  For instance it would not accept the email server request for my comcast email account.  It will not play embedded flash video, a vital component for some websites.  Yes, it will accept documents if you email them to yourself and then export them to pages or some other file handler, but you cannot do anything like file management. It is limited to the charging port for any I/O functions so if you want to back up pictures or video, you have to buy an after market adapter which is far from dependable.  In short, if you want a bigger platform for your iphone games, its your ticket although some of them do not enlarge, you just get the iphone footprint in the middle of the screen.If you are going on a business trip and need to work on your files, there are a hundred good notebooks with a similar size that have real keyboards that already include a cover, use the same software you use, and have a variety of I/O ports.

My wife loves this things and is constantly on it when she has any free time.  Our family basically fights over who gets to use it.  We are planning on getting another one.What we love about it--Long battery life - somestimes you can go for days with constant use.-Smooth touch screen interface - Its the most responsive touch screen of any device I ever use, everything is smooth, feels natural and polish.-Easy to use, great user interface.  I tried to teach my dad how to use a PC to do basic web surfing, it is almost impossible.  But he seems to OK picking this up and knowing how to use it.-Reading Books - (tip) you can convert (using Calibre) any book format (lit, doc, html, pdf, etc.) to epub and sync it using itunes to the ibooks app.  Also, you can send the epub file as an attachment to your email.  As long as you have iBooks app installed, you can open the attachment on your email using your iOS device and it will automatically put it into the iBooks app.-Internet - is great for web surfing.  Its instant on when ever you want to look for something on the web, very convinient.  Fun when you are watching tv shows, you can look up trivia or information.-Online Shopping - Amazon has an app and many other retailers as well.-Find reviews - example we use the Yelp apps often to find reviews of resturants in our area.  Much more convinient than booting up a computer.-Online Banking - I would rather trust the iPad banking app than using a PC to do banking.  I know a few people who lost money to fraud when they use the PC for transaction.  Too many virus these days.-Watch TV shows - One of the best Apps is the ABC network app.  We love watching Modern Family on it.-There is over 300,000 apps and games.  Many are either free or very low cost ( 99 cents).  My wife loves bejewel bliz on it and she can score higher on it than on computer because of the touch screen.  She also loves all the \"dash games\" like Diner Dash, etc.  Though I generally don't play video games, I found myself addicted to many of ipad games as well.

I would love to tell you a nice story of all the fun time I had waiting in line talking to all the people waiting to get one. But my Apple Store in Atlantic City had no one waiting for it I walked in picked mine up paid and walked out no line at all.Well jumping ahead 8 months to today my Ipad goes every where with me, to work, shopping to the doctors out to eat it is like my new best friend (gee I may need to get a real life). At first everywhere I went people were like \"is that really an ipad I have yet to see a real one in person\". They were amazed as I showed off my Ipad my sister was in awwe and was second guessing buying her daughter a nook until I told her the cost of the Ipad.The unit melts into your life you find your self reaching for it to do everything. If I am in the kitchen cleaning or cooking I watch shows from netflix on it. Sitting on the couch I scan the news while watching TV. In bed before going to sleep I play some quick games or read a book. It really fits nicely into your life allowing you to do some many things so quickly and easly.With the latest upgrade the added combined email mailbox is great reading mail is quick and easy. some of the apps I use each day are:PandoraEmailApp AdviceSafariTodoABC NewsABC PlayerYahtzeeScrabbleGoodreaderAnd belive me there are many more in fact this holiday EA put almost all of thier titles on sale for .99 each. Now that beats a PSP or GB game price hands down. Battery life is outstanding I use it all day and it stays charged.Now some of the downside of the Ipad. Keeping the screen clean can be a full time job. Storing shows or movies on the ipad quicking fills your Ipad up. If I am on a long trip and need to have a lot of videos with me I take my Archos 7 which has 5 times the storage space of my ipad 160 gigs. I had my Tivo transfering tv shows directly to my Ipad and it quickly was filling up. Syncing is another issue it takes a while to sync your unit in Itunes and working with phots on your unit is not easy if you sync folders with your pc then you cn not delete any photos from your ipad. You can also not really take notes on your ipad unless you can type really fast on the touch keyboard handwritting notes has a very long way to go on the ipad.And again we are back to my pet peve WHY IS THERE NO VIDEO PLAYLIST ON THE SYSTEM. Before the update there was a work around but now that is gone you like watching music videos you get to listen to them one at a time. If you read any of my other reviews of products like this you will know I hate when a simple function is left out like this.So yes even with these short commings I love my Ipad and no I am not sorry It does not have a camera on it I have a phone that has a camera.

It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have \"Facetime\" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!).

The first thing  noticed from opening the box is the built quality. It is superb. It is very sturdy and had a nice heft to it while you are holding it. It only had four buttons (screen lock,home, volume rocker, and screen orientation lock). It fits very nicely in your hands and is made from very high quality materials. I would definently recommend a case though because if you drop it then you are screwed.The screen on this thing is amazing. Watching movies is a pleasure. I have a couple 720p movies on here and they look absolutely fantastic. Normal definition movies also look very nice. The bad side to the screen though is it gets many fingerprints. They are not very easy to wipe off but with a lightly damped cloth they come off easily and the screen looks brand new.The internet browsing is very fast on this. Pages load quicker than my net book. The multi touch is great when needing to zoom in. You can have numerous web pages up at once. For some reason though every no and then the Internet starts to preform very slowly but fixes itself after a couple of minutes, but this is most likely my router causing this. Typing is very good and I got adjusted to it easily. I prefer typing in landscape because it is easier as in portrait mode it is a little awkward. By the way this whole review is being typed on the iPad without the Bluetooth keyboard attachment. The lack of flash player is not a big letdown to me because YouTube still works fine and I do not go on many flash websites.The speakers on this are very good. They are surprisingly loud but the sound quality is not lost much when cranked up all the way. When played at normal volumes or through headphones you will be amazed at how well they preform. The only problem is when you start to turn up the volume the device starts to vibrate a bit, but it is most likely no big deal.The apps are very good. Gaming is great, although most of the good games you have to pay for. They're are a couple good free games like tap tap radiation and air hockey but besides that not many. Some good paid games I would recumbent are x-plane, nova, real racing, touchgrind, need for speed, and plants vs zombies. Although these games are great they come at a cost. All of them combined are over 50 dollars. These games though will keep you entertained for hours and most are redisigned for the iPad while adding new features. Also they're are many good apps ranging from some similar to word to others for keeping baseball box score. One very creative app I enjoy is magic piano which is very fun to play around with. There are also apps like netflix and abc player which are very cool also.The battery life is insane. It lasts forever. I have gotten 9-10 hours on this with extremely heavy use. This includes hours of YouTube videos and playing very graphic intensive games like x-plane and real racing. Video playback time will easily be 13-14 hours at half brightness.It take about 3-4 hours to completely charge it. And also right out of the box it comes completely charged.The Only cons would have to be-Fingerprint magnet-Lack of flash( but only a con for some)-Apps are expensive and not many good free ones-Connection problems(but most likely only my router)-Apps take up a lot of memoryI would recommend getting the 32 or 64 gb version(like mine) because memory on this will become very limited with 16 gb. Most apps or games are between 100-200 mb.Also adding movies and songs will take up a lot of memory. My iPad had over 25 movies and more than 120 episodes of family guy,  more than 400 songs, and with about 20 apps and games installed and it takes up about 40 gb of space. I would also not recommend buying movies from iTunes as they are very expensive and take up more space. A normal 2 hour movie is 10 dollars and takes up 1.5gb of space so download them online for more space saving.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Out of all the devices...", "Author": "Meerz", "ReviewID": "RDJRYUJ428ALN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can truly say that out of all the devices I've owned, this is the COOLEST!  I am absolutely in love with the iPad. I do all my readings on it since I got it. I read books, pdfs, documents.. etc. The gaming experience is MUCH better than iphones and ipod touches. I use it a lot so sometimes I get into a state of \"ergonomical fail\" (if that's a word) and it could get heavy on my hands and it hurts a bit. But other than that I am absolutely fine with the product I think it's sleek and advanced. You could do a lot with it and it's much more practical that a laptop, given it's weight. I once used it as a GPS for an hour and a half drive -WiFi model. So you could do a lot of serious work with it.

For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.I bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!But, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.Next thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.You can probably see where this is going.- I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).First the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.Let's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.My first thought:- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the \"refuse to reconnect\" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, \"guns don't kill people\", but you see what I'm getting at.My next thought:- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying \"yeah, but it can do other things!!\" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams \"gimmick\" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).So on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.In other words readers:-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.So...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic \"NO\" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft \"YES\" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.

Let me start with the pros.Pros:1. beautiful, and sleek display.  if you are accustomed to the iTouch or iPhone you will like the large display2. battery life says up to 9 hrs while surfing the web3. portable, slim, and lightCons:1. so far it feels like really just a big iTouch or the same as the iphone minus texting and phone2. does not have the capabilities to attach photos or files in emails3. moving your fingers across a large screen is much more work than using a mouse4. no flash or java applets capabilities5. pay another $30 monthly for the data plan eventhough you already have an iPhoneThough the iPhone remains my favorite device, the iPad will not kill the laptop anytime soon.  Once Apple figures out how to address the attach photos/files in emails, flash/java, and costly service data plan then it shall be given 3 stars.

Does exactly as advertised and more.What I love:1. VideoNetflix, ABC, iTune transfered movies, and an amazing app called AirVideo that allows me to play video from my iMac or PC directly on my iPad without transferring it to my iPad.Stunning smooth video, no complaints.2. emailI've got 7 email accounts on this thing and it functions flawlessly.3. Internet browsingI'm very happy with the browser, especially the speed and finger gestures. It's intuitive and fast.4. Work appsI'm an IT admin and this thing is a great tool for admins like me.VPN is built in.VNC and RDP function nicely for remote access to my work environment.Dropbox keeps my files synced.And a little app called TeamViewer lets me fix my family members computers remotely.5. Planning and keeping track of my daily activities is easier with the multitude of To-Do apps, calendar, and Notes Pro app.  Everything is in one place.6. Kindle/iBooks are great. Super convenient in a way that's got me reading books again.7. KAYAK Flights is a fantastic app to check flight pricing whenever I want.8. Keeping up with the latest news on USA Today, SCI FI Wire, TUAW, DVICE, Ingadget, as well as Twitter, Woot, eBay, Newegg, and Craigslist couldn't be more convenient.9. Blogging, Cooking, weather, games, music on Pandora, movie times, tv guides, Yellow and White pages, writing pad (handwriting recognition), millage tracker, etc are just a few of the \"useless\" apps people complain about and I use every day.As far as the iPad shortcomings, we all knew what they were before it came out.  So why buy it if it's not what you want?I'm good with no camera.  I've got a camera on my iMac and video calls are uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Why would I want it on my iPad?People complaining about the lack of high-def video-out kill me.  It's a portable device, not a 50 inch plasma screen!  Use it for what it's intended for and get over it.Lack of Flash can be annoying, but that shortcoming wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I don't miss it.I own a netbook. It's been sitting on my desk for months, unused. Video stutters, internet is difficult to use, audio is terrible, battery life is weak.  And that's after upgrading to 2gb of memory.In other word, it's not better than my iPad and I'm selling it.The biggest plus of my iPad is convenience.  It's always on and ready.  I rarely use my computers anymore.So, if you do some due diligence and actually find out what an iPad does, you should be able to make an educated decision on whether it's for you or not.I don't believe a windows based tablet can come close to functioning as nicely as an iPad. An Android tablet might.I don't think I'm the only one happy with these, close to 1 million have been sold.  And that's before the 3G models have hit the shelves or sales outside the US have started.Ya, Steve Jobs really messed up with the iPad.

I love my Ipad and yet, I'm still not totally sure what it is. Is it a laptop? Is it a pc? Is it a phone without being a phone?I still don't really know, but I do love it. It's not too heavy, it has decent graphics, it has a great charge time. I can only speak to what I use it for and that's gaming, movies, reading and writing:First, writing. I have written several books on my laptop, which always got super-hot because that's how they are. The iPad NEVER gets hot, so great! I do hate virtual keyboards though, so I got a Rockfish case/keyboard to go with my Ipad and if you write, check out my review on it. Having that case/keyboard has really brought my iPad use full-circle. I love it.As for movies, my review on that part is mixed. My favorite app ever would be Netflix. I pay about 10 a month for their dvd / online membership. When I try to watch Netflix movies on my Ipad, sometimes I get stalled movies a little, sometimes a lot, but I do get stalled every single movie I watch.I also love to watch ABC, which is a free app. I LOVE IT. I can watch my Cougar Town and even my soap if it were worth watching ;0)Also, I play games. So does my son. There are THOUSANDS of free games (apps) and I love them on the Ipad. I have poor eyesight and it's so much easier to see them on the Ipad than on Ipod etc. We love Skeeball and Angry Birds, and lots of others. The fact that there are sooo many free apps makes it worth the Ipad price alone, I think.Lastly, reading. I have mixed feelings on this. I love reading without a book, something I never ever thought I'd say. I love the feel of a book! But now, a book feels archaic. Old. Out of style. I love reading on my Ipad. The only thing I do not love, is that other readers like Nook etc have that INK setting where it looks just like a real book. The backlight on the Ipad sometimes gets hard on the eyes, so it's really a love/hate thing for me.I hope this review helps some folks decide if they want to get an Ipad or the 2.

So far no issues regarding the item, its use or convienience. Not sure what MaxP. below was expecting when he slammed this product. If he wanted the features of a PC, maybe he should have gone that route instead of assuming they would be similar in an iPad. Research is the key with purchasing any electronic device in today's tech crazed world. Anyway, my problem is regarding the warranty. I bought the product in November 2010 as a Christmas gift for my son. The iPad arrived quickly and when my son opened it on Christmas morning he was overjoyed. It performed (and still does) as advertised. Now the issue: when my son attempted to register the item through Apple, he was unable to do so because the serial number did not match the date that I purchased it. After speaking to Amazon's customer service and Apple, it was determined that the purchase date in Apple's system for that serial number was actually 46 days prior. It seems that the vendor (GO4COMPUTERS) actually \"purchased\" the item on the date as shown in Apple's database. So THAT is the actual date that the warranty began, NOT the date that I purchased it. So effectively I have lost 1.5 months of a 1 yr warranty! I do not suspect that there is any intent to deceive by the vendor, but they were unable (unwilling?) to do anything about it. Apple will not change the date nor will Amazon. In summary, although I rate the product itself at 5 stars, I feel that some \"shine\" has been rubbed off this Apple product purchase due to the warranty issue.

In some ways it is, but it does much more, although it still can't make calls.  I find it easier to use, and of course easier to see, than my iPhone.

The iPad is easy to turn on and off and to set the airplane mode when flying.  I bought a few extras to go with my iPad, such as a case with an adjustable stand and a bluetooth keyboard.  Both are necessities to me.  And of course the apps are plentiful and useful.  My only caution about the \"free\" apps is that many aren't really free.  They might be a 30 day free trial or you need to upgrade (for a fee) to make them work best.  They often don't tell you that in advance, or at least I didn't read far enough in the description.

It is the perfect device for the consumption of content. (I don't read books outside in open sunlight.) I am happy now to store tons of magazines and books, without the requisite piles of paper in my home, and the ability to take those books and magazines with me. I love to watch movies via the Netflix app and TV programs via the ABC app, in addition to iTunes rentals and purchases. (I tried the Hulu Plus app but the Hulu library for the iPad app differed from the library available if you watch on your computer. That was unacceptable for me.) As a graphic artist and photographer, the iPad is a perfect device to display images/designs to clients and some photographers are able to wirelessly transmit images directly from the camera to the iPad, allowing clients to view images as they are being taken. Amazing.I have not had the wifi or syncing problems cited in other reviews and I have owned both a wifi version and a 3G iPad. (I prefer the 3G device for its hardware GPS. The wifi version is able to give you your approximate location but \"close enough\" was not satisfactory for my usage. If you're traveling and need the GPS function in say, a moving car, you'll need the 3G data plan unless your car is equipped with wifi, which is unlikely.) Some complain about the lack of an SD card slot but I have no problem with the optional Camera Connection Kit, which provides both a plug-in SD card reader as well as an USB port (which can be used with your own USB card reader or even USB headphones or mics).While I use the onscreen keyboard when necessary, I prefer to use the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard. I do not miss Flash on websites. (I usually click through flash intros anyway.) I don't miss the lack of a camera because, as a photographer, I've never been happy with the results of a camera with the optics/resolution limits required to install it on a phone/mobile device. I find the device's attempts to correct my spelling annoying (if I don't watch, it will change both my first and last names). And while the iPad response is snappy, no multitasking or ability to run programs in the background made using the device just a bit inelegant, having to always end one app to start another.The lack of multitasking changes with iOS 4.2. While not yet available to the general public (it is slated for release this month), I couldn't wait and installed the Golden Master release (almost ready for prime time) and it has transformed my device into something more along the line of \"magical.\" Switching back and forth between open apps speeds up the process completely. A double-press on the iPad's home button reveals the multitasking menu, screen orientation lock, screen brightness and volume sliders and play/pause controls. While I don't have a new AppleTV, I can send audio items to my Airport Express with speakers attached through AirPlay. I have not been able to preview AirPrint (where you'll be able to send iPad documents to some printers) as it requires a Snow Leopard update for my desktop computer that is not yet released. In the meantime, I had no problem emailing items I wanted printed to a computer but look forward to seeing if AirPrint will have the same effect on printing what AirPlay has on streaming content.While other tablets can claim to be more capable (a Windows tablet can run full-fledged Windows applications and this able to do many more things) none will be able to compete with the elegant interface and ease of use that the iPad presents. Apple's iOS is designed for mobile devices, taking full advantage of the Apple multi-touch interface, making the iPad the most intuitive tablet you'll ever find. If you're interested in video chatting (and using Apple's Facetime), I would wait until iPad 2.0, which will likely be announced in the first quarter of 2011. For myself, I'll leave the video chatting to my phone or laptop. The iPad is perfect for my use as is.Printing, which also comes with iOS 4.2, is still not available to me to preview as it requires a pre-release Snow Leopard update to my laptop computer. While it poses no problem for me once the SL update is released, I might be upset if I found out, after the fact, that in order to get the full function of the iPad, I need the newest Mac OS release.

Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called \"gold rush\" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery.

I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.

With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17\" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads \"Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding\". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads \"not charging\".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest \"Batman\" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17\" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed \"OMG\" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted \"OMB\".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word \"gay\" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.

Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad 16GB 3GS", "Author": "K.

As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me.

Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14\" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.

There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking \"Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99.\"  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a \"go back to your previous app\" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.

I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "No FLASH - The Real Reason", "Author": "J.

Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue.

Apple play the same trick time-after-time.

Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way.

And by now, we have all heard the tales of people who have never used a computer (including Senior Citizens and the autistic) whose worlds have been opened up and expanded by the intuitive comfort level of the iPad.\"Back in the day\" - my Commuting Gear included a briefcase/backpack, 2\" Daily Planner, Cassette or CD Walkman, associated Cassettes/CD's, a Book, and current magazines, plus any necessary files, etc... for work, and later - a 15\" laptop.HEAVY - even as late as 2007 !TODAY - Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Notes, iPod/Music, iBooks, Newsstand, iBooks (again) are all = iPad !Files are now PDF's - which I store either in the iPad's iBooks App, or on a USB Flash Drive.The Original First Generation iPad does have a slower processor than current models, but for most day-to-day use (including video), you will not notice any difference in performance. It will successfully support all versions of iOS through iOS 5.1.1The 64 GB capacity is what I would recommend to anyone who has a \"healthy\" music or video library already in iTunes. While books, magazines and apps are relatively small in size, they WILL \"add up\" and you'll appreciate the small investment in the extra storage capacity so you truly can \"take it all with you.\"On the other hand, I would only recommend investing in the 3G Connectivity if you are a commuter who is not regularly within range of a Wi-Fi HotSpot. I owned my iPad for almost a year before activating the 3-G, and that was only when Wi-Fi would no longer work on my local train. If you do choose the 3-G option, be VERY mindful when using the 3-G. Use \"Settings\" to turn it on ONLY when Wi-Fi is not available, and be conscious about what you do while on the network. Streaming Video, File Downloads, etc.. will quickly BURN through any Data Plan. If you are mindful - you will be able to get by with the smallest $15/month data plan (...but even that adds up to apx. $200 a year....)I would strongly recommend the \"skin tight\" Original iPad Case, which SECURELY and elegantly holds the iPad, and the \"book cover design\" affords privacy from (potentially) prying eyes of the commuter sitting next to you, or you can fold it back behind the iPad itself.

The presentation software is stunningly beautiful and sensitivity a pleasure to operate. Students can, for a relatively small fee, have a research tool in their hands.This gem lets students research the worlds online literature, create an e-book shelf with the obvious access to volumes of books within each of their shelves, and create reports from these sources (can attach a keyboard), and present findings to the class via projector or world via the internet. It feels like a self containing research unit.  Can even take, work with, and share images with it.Disadvantages would include the lack of a port to external memory - but although not ideal files can be e-mailed to another system and backed-up this way (there is always a way around). Other in this form have also listed more technical disadvantages - so be sure to roam these. Sure, it will be upgraded in the future but this is nothing new in the computational world as Moore's Law (computer capacity doubles every 18 months) is still in full swing.Ultimately for the price, this is a bargain. It is the way of the future and laptops will probably be leaving us in the future as such devices replace them, perhaps not in the immediate future, but soon.

Unless you really love touch screens.  The touch screen is about the only thing the ipad really does well.  Apple built its reputation on making great operating systems that were far and away the most user friendly in the business.  No hassle computing.  And true to this spirit, the ipads touchscreen really does open up a whole new world of possibilities to make operating systems even more user friendly.  Apple has done great job of highlighting this potential in the ipad.Unfortunately, what the touch screen has given it, apple's new-found shortsightedness has taken away.  This is not a machine for surfing the web and if you buy one, mainly with that purpose in mind, you will be quite disappointed.  The main reason is the ipad will not run flash player- A technology that is ubiquitous on the web, and something that apple has intentionlly decided not to support.  This means a good portion of web pages that you are used to running flawlessly (on windows and apple OSX) on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, IE, or Safari will simply crash Safari for the ipad.  So if you buy this machine, you won't really get the world-wide-web, you'll get the apple-wide-web. Steve Jobs has commented how flash will (eventually) become unnecessary with HTML 5 and that's why they don't support flash.  Well, maybe...I think it's appropriate to quote John Maynard Keynes here.  Apple, \"in the long run, we are all dead,\" and would love to surf the real web on a great tablet today!Unfortunately, this approach to Flash is sticking with the spirit of the machine in general.  Consider you can only get Apple approved apps at the Apple appstore (unless you want to hack the machine and jailbreak it).  With this machine you ultimately are pushed content that Apple has chosen, rather than given the ability to find the content yourself in an unencumbered access to the jungle of the web.It really sad to see Apple go down this road.  I grew up on Apples and have always paid the extra money for that, oh so friendly, user experience.  It's too bad that a company started by \"two guys in their garage\" with a vision of great computing has turned into a corporation with a vision of higher returns to the shareholders.  The world would be a better place if Apple just stuck to making the best operating systems in the world and forgot about the whole business of trying to own as much of the world wide web as you can stake your claim on.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't expect iPad to be an electronic book reader", "Author": "Jeffery A. Lewis", "ReviewID": "RURUJRCFKGUA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There has been a lot of hype about iPad being a Kindle killer. There are three reasons why the iPad will not make a good book reader. You should be aware of these reasons if you are buying the iPad expecting to read books on it.Reason 1) You will want to read outside and the iPad will not look good outside. Lets face it. Readings a novel is relaxing. Reading outside on a beatiful day is really relaxing. An ebook has to address reading outside. iPad has an LCD screen which will wash out in sunlight. Devices like Kindle and Sony Reader use e-ink technology, a completely different rendering technology, that actually looks better in daylight.Reason 2) iPad is too heavy. The iPad weighs 1.6 pounds. That's about 26 ounces. A Sony Reader and Kindle weigh about 9 to 10 ounces. The iPad weighs almost three times as much. You should be able to hold an ebook with one hand suspended in the air. This will maximize the number of comfortable positions you can achieve with the device. At 1.6 pounds, you will find you cannot hold it up for long with one hand and will have to rest it on something. This severly limits the ergonomic possibilities for the device. You may think this is not important, but you should not overlook how important this is for the reading experience. As matters go, the iPad is not a good device to watch a two hour movie on. Since it is heavy, you will tend to rest it on your lap. That will force you to look down on it. Two hours of doing that, your neck will be sore.Reason 3) Battery life is too short. Ten hours seems like a long time, but for an ebook, it is a hassle to keep it charged to just read, especially when you are on the go. When you toss a small 10 ounce Kindle in your suit case before leaving for a week vacation, you will not have to take the charger, and you will not have to be concerned about plugging it in at the hotel. Devices that use e-ink use power to render the page and to say on standby, but do not use power to leave the page displayed. E-ink devices essentially sip power compared to LCD technology that has to constantly backlight the screen and constantly render the screen. This takes much more power.In iPads defence, iPad could be the better device to read a newspaper. You generally don't read the paper for very long, and you don't read a newspaper linearly like a book. Beautiful layout, color, and multi-touch input could lead to a better newspaper experience. Plus a newspaper is updated daily. An easy way to get daily editions is essential to reading a paper.

Those are available on the Apple website.Physical and Visual Attributes (Snobby sounding, huh? Maybe the statistics that say most iPad owners are stuck up are right...)Firstly, it's just a big black and silver rectangle. It's not really what I would call beautiful, but it is pleasing to look at. Oh, who am I kidding! It's beautiful! Uhem.The brushed silver back is nice. It doesn't show fingerprints or scratches as much as the chrome or plastic that backs most portable Apple products. It's also cool to the touch, which I like.It isn't too heavy to hold, but it's going to be set on my lap most of the time anyway.iPod, Videos, and Photos (or, to go in chronological order, Photos, Videos, and iPod)The Photos app is actually incredibly nifty! When you open it up, granted you have put pictures on it, you're greeted with folders. Each one looks like a couple pictures laid out on a table.You can peak into one of them by pinching slightly or open one of them by pinching a lot. This is awesome and has to be seen to be fully appreciated. If you're not a fan of pinching, you can also just tap on a folder to open it right up.There are a few other interesting things that you can do with this app, but mostly it's for viewing all of your captured memories. Flicking from one picture to the next is fast and smooth.I really like the new look of the Videos app. It's much more...muchier. The bigger view of the DVD and TV show covers and the effect that happens when you click the play icon are both great. Oh, and I love watching stuff on the big screen!The iPod is a lot like iTunes. Instead of cover flow, there is a grid view of your music library. Other than that, everything is pretty much the same.Web Browsing and YouTubeAll of the people out there that don't like the iPad wish that Safari could view flash. That honestly hasn't been a problem for me, but maybe that's just because I don't make a habit of viewing flash-intensive websites.I think browsing the web on an iPad is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Sliding your finger to scroll down a page and tapping or pinching to zoom both feel really natural.  I'm really happy that it doesn't take long to load pages and that I don't have to zoom much.YouTubeAs I've said before, the big screen on the iPad makes watching stuff really enjoyable.  The YouTube app adds tons of videos to it without taking up much space at all.  (Yes, I actually got a 1,000...GB iPad!)Using the app feels like you're on the actual website, but at the same time much better.  The quality of the videos are great, and searching for a particular one is...fun.That's one thing I think is really cool about Apple's gadgets.  They make doing everything fun!  How do they do that?GamingPlants Vs. Zombies HD is the best game app there is! Alright, now that I've got that out of my system, let's me just say that playing games on the iPad is a blast!Racing on it is like having a Wii in your hands.  However, I don't think the iPad could replace a Wii or DS.  Apps can really add up, so make sure you watch how much money you spend on them.Mail and KeyboardThe Mail app that's on the iPad is much more better than the one that's on the iPhone and iPod touch.  In portrait mode you see one of your e-mails, and in landscape mode you see a split screen view of one of your e-mails and a list of any others you've gotten.When you want to compose an e-mail, all you have to do is tap on an icon in the upper right hand corner.

If you're in portrait mode, the keyboard that pops up will be smaller than if you're in landscape mode.They keyboard is much easier to type on than I thought it would be!  I can type almost as fast on it as I can on a physical one.ConclusionI'm not sure how Apple managed to make such a great tablet computer!  One of the things that's great about it is that you can add to the things it can do by getting apps.  Maybe that's one of the keys to it, the iPhone, and the iPod touch's success.

My evaluation?  An outstanding device.  I use it in three principle areas; a book reader, entertainment i.e. games and for work.  I'll talk about each in turn.As a book reader.  Very easy to use and easy to read. I downloaded the Kindle and Barnes and Noble apps so I have access to three separate bookstores and can download books from all of them.  The Ipad thus is much more flexible than dedicated readers that allow access to only a single bookstore.As a game machine.  If my grandkids are around, I can't use my Ipad because they are queued up to get a turn.  I have apps that the three-year-old can use, the four-year-old can use and other apps the older ones can use.  The amazing thing about the younger ones, is that the apps are educational and they love use them.  I enjoy the apps the older kids use, namely Doodle Jump, Angry Birds and Plants vs ZombiesFor work.  This is where the Ipad really shines.  I'm an author.  I spend hours each day chained to my computer in my office writing stores or revising them.In addition to writing/ revising stories, there are other business aspects of writing.  A brief list includes creating new characters and plots, writing blogs, marketing work, email responses etc.  In the past I had to stay at the computer or use a pad and pen if I worked away from the computer. Now I use the Ipad and I'm freed from the desk and computer.  It makes writing and creation a pleasure.  I'm writing this review while sitting in a recliner in the TV room.  Earlier, I worked on a different writing project outside on the porch.Overall, I have to say that the Ipad changed my work habits and improved them.  It fitted  almost seamlessly into my work.  How seamlessly, is amazing, but then I'm an Apple fanatic and I expected nothing less from the Ipad.  To be clear, the Ipad doesn't replace my computer; it is an adjunct to that computer, but one that gives me a large measure of freedom.As you might suspect, I give the Ipad five stars out of a possible five. With the Ipad, my Iphone has been downgraded to a cell phone, for the most part.Tales From Gundarland: Eight humorous stories from the land of the incongruous", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Its not just a Big iPod", "Author": "Ismael E.

S. Alsuhaim", "ReviewID": "R3RZV8USNZGSFW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a chance to hold and play with the iPad that one of my student brought to me. I am not an apple fanboy, I just evaluate gadgets and buy what works for me. My first impression when it was announced is that it would be nothing but an iPod touch on steroids. After evaluating the iPad and playing with it for an hour, I still have that impression. The iPad has an upgraded processor and memory. It is faster, it has a good battery life. For the one hour I used it, I only lost about 5% of battery. It does not feel awfully big or heavy, but it is not something you carry in your pockets.At $499 for the 16GB/Wifi, there is a great potential offered by the bigger display of the iPad when compared to Touch screen netbook. Please note that 16GB on this iPad are solid state with no moving parts.The only reason why I would buy or recommend such a product is to use it to take notes during classes for students. If you can get a stylus and proper software to take notes, the iPad would really shine at a great value. I would recommend the cheapest iPad if you are on a budget.The screen is clear, and feels nice to browse the web. I reviewed the 64GB/Wifi model and I picked up a decent wireless signal while I was in the university's lab, which was placed in a basement. I heard complaint about signal quality.The virtual keyboard passes with A+. I tried to use it like a normal keyboard and I typed a couple of random sentences with no errors. It sure won't feel like a normal physical keyboard, but I think it is possible to hook wireless keyboard to it (which beats the purpose of getting the iPad)PROS* Virtual keyboard is very usable with minimal mistakes.* There is a great potential of the bigger screen. The possibilities are endless: Drawing, sketching, note taking. I actually I got to impress my student with a quick anime-style drawing.* It is not only a toy. You can use it for education. Children can learn in a fun way, and also adults may use it for note taking. Provided that apps would be available for those purposes.* Battery life is great. I read reviews saying that it even exceeded Apple's expectation.* More apps and things to do than Amazon's kindleCONS* The lack of a camera on the front really cripple the potential of the iPad (and the iPhone, iPod touch as well). You can not make video chat session using an iPad (nor iPhone or iPod Touch). Imagine if you can make Skype calls using the iPad!* Connectivity with other devices requires iPad dock.* I only use this for an hour, but I believe using it for too long will strain one's hand. One could consider using it on a table instead of holding it with one hand.FINAL THOUGHTSI advise people to only buy this if they think they will make a good use of it. Please keep in mind that you are buying a tablet computer. I wouldn't buy it in a heartbeat. I would still keep evaluating its uses that best serve me.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Matt Goodwin", "ReviewID": "R1PW9XV8SCNWCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Who doesn't love a tablet, especially an ipad.

She giggles and laughs all the time while playing with it. I must say that when they are not here I am on it with Facebook,pinterest and of course amazon. So much easier to take from room to room where ever I decided to sit for the evening and want to just play. So glad that we downsized in toys because we get so much more out of this.

I love being able to grab my Ipad, push the home button, and just like that it's on.  It's not like my older laptop which now takes a while to get going.  It's also a lot easier to lie around and surf the web on your tablet than it is on a laptop.  The Ipad is so simple to use and is a fast tablet which I think anyone would enjoy.  If I had any criticisms toward the Ipad it would be the usual criticism of Apple products, which is no flash support.  It's a little annoying to not be able to view the videos you want on a product that is otherwise so great.

Once set up, you will appreciate the larger, although grainier display than the smaller iPhone and iPod touch. However the larger display means that Everything you do on it is slower than the aforementioned smaller devices, including the original versions.The iPhone and iPod touch come with a number of handy apps that are missing from the iPad 1 (weather, stocks, clock, and voice memos), so you have to hunt for substitutes on the Apple App Store.YouTube works much as it does on any laptop or desktop, that is, somewhat more disorganized, disorderly, and slower than on the iPhone and iPod touch. It does not seem to be capable of streaming video on a full screen so that the user has to switch to a small window to get the video running but it still endlessly halts in the videos. So it will probably be better once Google releases their version of YouTube.The email app takes a very long time to display opened emails. And once you open one, you cannot close it. Rather, you have open the next or previous one. This is extremely annoying, unless your thought processes are as chaotic as the person who designed this app.ITunes works very nicely.

The 16gbs is enough for me because i already have a zune and an ipod touch to listen to all my music on that.  I use this device to mainly read books, surf the web, and do some email.  I did run into a small problem.  The ipad seems to freeze up when i used email and some web browsing activity.  For the email problem, i simply changed some settings so that when i deleted emails, so that it wouldn't stay on the servers.  As for the web browsing freeze, all i can recommend is to do a hard reset by holding down the hold and home buttons for a few seconds till the apple logo appears.  Also, itunes just sucks, i'm sorry but it just does.  Whenever i tried to sync my podcasts or add videos, it wiped off my data and settings.  I was able to backup my original settings, but i had to sync my data back onto the ipad.  Other than that, this has been an excellent purchase.  I didn't need some of the features of the ipad2 like the dual cameras because that just seemed like a waste and i saved about 100 bucks.

I'm glad I decided for iPad after all, will surely use the other additional functions, too. All the issues such as playing different video files etc can be quite easily solved with various apps.

I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi but I recommend spending a little more for the iPad 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t.; The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad.

I have had it about 11 months.If I had to sum up the iPad in two words it would be \"needlessly disappointing\".  On the surface, it has everything except removable storage. It is fast, can surf the web (sort of), plays video and music, and has apps out the wazoo.  However, it has MAJOR limitations including the lack of removable storage, no real file management system (I don't count syncing video, music and pictures through iTunes as file management), and the much lamented lack of Flash support.I had hoped to be able to use the iPad for work. I am an attorney and wanted something very portable, but big enough to read, that I could use to transport PDFs and other case documents. Apple says \"there's an app for that.\" I tried several including MobileMe, HD Air, and Goodreader. They will allow you to move files to the iPad and view them, but moving multiple files is dicey and takes an inordinately long period of time. The bottom line is that as a substitute for a laptop, the iPad is not ready for prime time.I am not a computer programmer or a web programer so I dont know the technical merits of Flash over HTML 5. What I do know is that about every other web page I have viewed has Flash content that can't be viewed on the iPad. Because Steve Jobs and Adobe are feuding, this does not appear likely to resolve any time soon.  This is a big time deal breaker for me. I don't like the \"there's an app for that\" solution -- who wants to have to jump back and forth between a half-dozen apps and Safari (the Apple web browser) to do what you should be able to do on just a browser?Another major drawback is the very limited print functionality. Don't buy the hype. AirPrint works with only a small number of HP printers. If you don't own one of these expensive printers, forget printing.The aforementioned problems could be fixed with software, but Apple refuses despite customer complaints. In fact, they have raised customer disrespect to an art form by releasing the iPad 2 with the same limitations.On the pro side it has all the features you would expect of an Apple device. It has a great music player. Videos are superb and with an optional av cable, the iPad can output movies to an HD TV.  I am not a fan of iBook, but the Kindle app is great. In fact, I prefer reading books on the iPad over the Kindle 3 (I like back lighting).My recommendation on this product (and also the iPad 2) is don't buy it unless you can live with the limitations I have noted. The Motorola Xoom has better hardware and purportedly will support Flash in the future.

Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called \"DocsAnywhere\" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible.

You have to measure the functionality of your technology with the price that you're willing to pay and I have to say that neither the ipad 1 or 2 is worth what apple is charging. With all of the problems and glitches of the ipad I personally wouldn't pay over $300 for it. If you don't believe me go online and search problems with I pad 1 or problems with I pad 2. The problems that you see are not fictious their real and if you buy the ipad you better be willing to do some troubleshooting. Some people have problems with the wifi, but me personally, I had problems with it syncing to itunes . You should know that any old usb port won't work with this device you REALLY need a USB 2.0 port that is directly linked to the motherboard of your computer, and even then it won't charge directly from your computer. You will need to plug it into the wall. Secondly I must tell the reader that you need to watch your accessories . Even though some cables and card readers say that they work with the ipad the ipad is so finicky that they may not . I have a card reader that was supposed to work with the ipad, but it doesn't hence it must be sent back.All in all I have to say that the ipad isn't perfect, but it is over priced my advice would be to buy it used if you really must have one and to get the higher amount of GB (32 or 64) as you can easily run out of space. I bought mine used (for about $300) and it didn't have a scratch on it so it was pretty much new . I got the charger and all the paperwork that came with it, so I had some help, but not nearly enough. My advice to you would be to get used to the sites that offer Ipad fixes before you buy and to anticipate problems. THIS DEVICE IS WAY OVERHYPED AND NOT PERFECT.Well that's it to summarize get it gently used, anticipate problems and glitches and don't pay over $300. Trust me when the problems come (and they will) you won't feel so bad. And definitely get on those apple web sites that offer fixes. I was able to get mine working with their help and I'm glad that I looked them up. They saved my sanity. And watch your accessories sometimes they work and sometimes they don't . Just make sure that you don't pay through the nose for something that you can't even use.Good LuckP.S - If you are the type of person who is not tech savvy the ipad is probably not for you. This is definitely for the person who knows their way around the net and who knows what they are doing. The ipad was not my first tablet and i've learned that when picking out a tablet reviews are definitely key. This is still new technology so you can't expect it to be perfect.

It is just another innovative idea that all Apple fan-boys and Bandwagon jumpers can rave about. While the technology is convenient on an iPod touch, once you double the size you would expect more. The iPad runs at a processor speed of 1.00ghz, which is the same speed my phone runs at. Another big disappointed is the iPad's incapability to run flash websites. It has the same apps as the iPod Touch and iPhone. The hard drive size on the iPad is also very disappointing, having the same size hard drives as the iPod Touch. The WiFi is faulty at times, but that is not to terrible of a problem. The price is also ridiculously high for what you're getting. Similar tablets, such as the Archos 5 lack the apps, but can do much more that the iPad can. Why pay around $800 for a tablet that can barely handle the tasks you would expect it to, when you could purchase a netbook, at less than half the price with a much large hard drive, much faster processor, and can do almost everything you would expect it to do?

(Some of the moments when releasing a product before engineering was done with it, notwithstanding.)However, I see the iPad as an offering where Apple attempted to get back to basics and fully accomplish a \"design cycle.\" I'm impressed with the power and options of this machine. The clarity of the display and the intuitive nature of the touch screen were drawing qualities. I was up and running, and I mean effectively, right \"out of the box\" with just a few probing \"trial and error\" type checkouts. The \"pop-up\" touch screen keyboard is very good, for the size of the unit. I was pleasantly surprised at that. I got the iPad case, turned it sideways at an angle, and find I can type with relative speed (not as fast as a full size keyboard, but very quickly and adequately for the light, quick notes and composing I am doing on it.) As I've played around, I have seen other features come up, asked myself \"what does that do?\" and figured those out as well. One day I'll go back and review the instruction manual.But, where the notebooks were designed to fill a niche of portability, lighter than a laptop, but still with internet access and some minimal functionality, I see the iPad coming from the other direction, filling that same market segment.It's an iPod on steroids!I do see it replacing a couple of my devices. My calendar and contacts are going on, and I can see myself retiring my PDA. The music and media features will replace my iPod. And, the 3G feature I activated and found to be very useful on a recent vacation trip to stay connected, so no lugging my laptop through security on business trips.Nope. No speaker phone. I'll still need to carry a cellular phone. Otherwise, this would be the one-stop shop. As it is, that is notable to me as a drawback and a slice where a blackberry or other access-enabled device might still be a viable alternative.Just downloaded my first movie. Maybe I'm premature in writing this review. But, I expect that to be impressive as well. So, overall I rate it positively.

And for reading, looking at pics, doing email, etc. this thing rocks.But it drives me crazy that Apple has waited so long to update this to iOS 4.  The iOS 4 features - which have been available for *months* on the iPhone - will finally bring multitasking, the ability to resume applications where you left off, and folders to the iPad.  These updates are merely small conveniences on the iPhone - which you use as a computer only for short periods when you're out running around or whatever.  They're extremely important to the iPad's credibility as a device which you'd like to use as much as possible instead of lugging around a laptop or being chained to a desk.  I still use the iPad a lot if I'm going to be focused on one application for a long time.  But life is often messier than that, so I actually end up switching to my much-too-teeny-tiny iPhone more than I'd like because it's got more flexible functionality.Devices like the iPad are definitely the way forward for light computing, and Apple has done a great job on developing this product.  But it's not quite done - it's pretty freakin' irritating that Apple has taken so long to meet this obvious need to update to the greater flexibility of iOS 4.2.p.s.  The only other thing I'd change is to up the resolution of the screen to iPhone 4 levels.  Don't get me wrong, the iPad's display is gorgeous.  But the nature of the device is that you hold it *closer* than a laptop.  Resolutions that would be really great at laptop screen distance are a bit grainy at handheld distance.  Which means that you feel like you're reading on a computer instead of looking at something that looks like a printed page.  I've noticed that although the iPhone 4 has too small a screen to read really long books comfortably, the crisp text resolution makes it more comfortable than you'd think for reading.p.p.s.  I couldn't give a bleep about a camera/facetime.  Kind of a cool concept, but until our nation has much faster broadband, it just isn't worth the aggravation.

I mainly got this because I can't wait another 2-? years for my job to decide how they're going to let us carry electronic publications. The iPad works great for that function, especially using GoodReader which I find to be superior to iBooks in a number of ways.So far I haven't been disappointed using it as an internet device in my home and offline in most other places. Overall it is basically what you expect: an oversized iPhone with similar features. Web pages look much better than they do on the iPhone, but there's still no built-in flash support. Angry Birds is a lot more fun on the iPad's big screen.One thing I don't like is the email presentation. It basically uses the same iPhone-sized strip overlayed on a full screen message display. There's no way to just be looking at your inbox or other folder; you have to always be looking at an email. It's a minor annoyance, but different than I have my email setup on every other system including the iPhone.I was also surprised to learn that the iPad is still on iOS 3 (so much for my research). I spent over an hour trying to create app folders on the device and in iTunes before I realized the iPad doesn't have that ability yet. I'm disappointed with the number of apps that expect you to re-buy just to increase the resolution enough that full screen looks good. Most apps like that I continue to use in the small, iPhone-size window that opens by default or I put up with pixellation and hit the 2x button. I didn't realize how quickly I'd gotten used to iOS4, but now it's annoying when I click a link on one website that opens a new window, and upon returning to the original site it has to completely reload instead of saving my previous position. Hopefully iOS4 will be out this month for the iPad and it will function more like my iPhone.If you're going to throw your iPad in a flight bag, I recommend the Otterbox Defender case. It was covered by the tax savings I enjoyed by purchasing from Amazon instead of Apple. The case offers a lot of protection, but like its iPhone cousin makes the ports less accessible. You have to remove the back panel to access the charging port, and not all headphones are able to reach into the headphone jack. My wife and I wanted to watch a movie together using a y-cord, but it wasn't able to fit without me removing the top half of the case.Overall I'm pleased with the unit so far. I could have waited for another solution (Google Pad, maybe?), but as Apple's already big in our lives and my work is likely moving to this unit, it was the best choice for me. If you're thinking of buying an iPad, I don't see why you'd buy anywhere but Amazon. Their list prices match the Apple store, but they add no tax or shipping charges.

So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There are no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily.I would strongly suggest you to take a look at the Acer aspire 1410-2497 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. An adequatley equiped netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. And also when in keypad mode the keypad takes up like half of the screen. With a netbook you have a dedicated screen. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now.Gripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this.If you want one to take on vacations and to be able to look up places to eat or just to take to the coffee shop and do some web browsing then just get an itouch. It will serve it's purpose less expensive and you can carry it in your pocket and have with you all the time. On vacation it can come in handy. Most places have free wifi now. And if you have kids, just whip it out when they drive you crazy. Sure it's smaller than an ipad but your not going to carry an ipad around with you everywhere on vacation.So great for lounging, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. It does have it's place in the world but unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. Unless you use the ipad apps. And I believe the apps are limited on what you can do. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?Everyone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying. Some may be fine for what it does, but some might expect more.

It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a \"giant iPod Touch,\" although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.Completely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for \"couchsurfing\" and \"bedsurfing\" (and, uh, \"poopsurfing\") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.Basically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.I see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing \"augmented-reality\" applications.Lastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware of Return policy", "Author": "David Rosenberg", "ReviewID": "REQ1ORNMNED5Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are used to dealing with Amazon, and then you start dealing with Apple, pray that you never have a problem with the product.

He had to give up his iPad 1 16GB WiFi-only giant iPod touch model to do it, and it floored me. I spent over 24 hours on it almost totally non-stop after I got it, and between our MC343LL/A Time Capsule providing stable, Apple branded wireless-N AirPort Extreme WiFi and the iOS 4.3.3 it came to me with smoothing early production software on it out, I feel just like I did when I bought my MB325LL/A iMac-I may have gotten the older model, but I got a more pleasing product than a camera crippled iPad 2, no dual-core A5 processor is worth suffering through a crippled rear camera. It pleased me enough that I upgraded my MB531LL/A 2G 16GB iPod touch to the last iOS version it supported, iOS 4.2.1-which previous to the iPad I was diametrically opposed to doing.The iPad \"just works\", mostly DESPITE but a tiny bit because of iOS 4. A bug fixed iOS 3.2 would have been much more pleasing to me, but I didn't get that opportunity. Plus Apple's decision to torpedo, obsolete, and deprecate the perfectly functioning MobileMe for some stupid as everything iCloud service just makes me fume and want to hold on to what works for personal life and school.Apple's background machinations excepted, the iPad is front and center the best device I have ever seen bar all but the Macintosh 128k, who is the second-most remote Apple ancestor of the paradigm OS X 10.7 and iOS 5 are replacing. The 128k is still tops in my book, but the iPad is second. It is just so amazing I can't get over it. How did Apple make something that, despite their terrible record as a company under the Jobs regime of 1998-present, so fulfills (like the MB325LL/A iMac, the MC374LL/A MacBook Pro, the MB531LL/A iPod touch, the MC343LL/A Time Capsule, and the MB404LL/A MacBook White while I had it) all the hype Apple puffs up for it? Now the other devices you could say Apple didn't have to puff up quite so much, as they were improvements on existing devices (the iPod touch is a PalmPilot that works how I always desired one to work) but the iPad it had to puff up extra big because the Windows XP, Vista, and 7 tablets nor the Modbook from Axiotron, great though the latter one especially supposedly is, were a totally different type of device. Totally different. The iPad therefore had to be convincing that people actually needed it and could have a use for it. Once I got the primary production Intel Macs and the chance came along, I got the iPad and it meets EVERY SINGLE FREAKING THING Apple puffed it up to be and do.Well, for as long as MobileMe is still on life support. Once it's off life support, iCloud will spell the doom of some of the iPad's most incredible features, but then again the loss of MobileMe is what pushed an iPad into my hands, so I can't complain much at all-because otherwise I couldn't write this review.Go iPad! Go iPad! Go iPad! Even though your name may sound like a feminine product, go iPad! Three cheers for iPad! Hurrah! Huzzah! Hurrah!An outstanding yes to the question of whether or not I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Apple as a company however, I am forever angry at now.But we're not reviewing Apple...Update Independence Day 2011 (also will go on my MacBook Pro MC374LL/A review):I just wanted to add that when the MacBook Pro and iPad are added to my iMac and iPod touch (even an old, not fully iOS 4 supported 2G 16GB iPod touch like mine) I have flexibility that was worth waiting for, and I will have a great deal of it still even after the iCloud transition. I find that, for my personal needs, the MacBook Pro plus iPad is a far more flexible solution than expecting either a MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, or iPad 1 or 2 either one to be your in between device by itself. No one computer, none that I have ever seen, could even remotely hope to do all the varied tasks I want a computer to do all by itself, although a MacBook Pro Spring 2010 like I have with some iPad like periodical apps from the Mac App Store that enable it to have the periodical reading capability of the iPad while still having the traditional computing capability of the same MacBook Pro the way I have it now, would come awfully close (especially with the one cable plus adapter HDMI output capability.) With that said, I prefer having multiple options even with such a scenario, because my parents need to use a computer too (and I want the MacBook Pro primarily to myself.)So, with those caveats dispensed with, I love having the flexibility of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard plus Windows 7 capable primary laptop-indeed, primary computer, as the MacBook Pro has almost totally taken over for the iMac in practice, freeing it up for Momma or Daddy, with both OS options currently coexisting through Boot Camp, and I love having the iPad for the fun stuff that it is perfect for. I can also supposedly use it to read my textbooks, and I am excited about that prospect.The MacBook Air, by contrast, seems like a super-upscale (in both features and quality) netbook, whether the Apple diehards want to admit that or not. The iPad and MacBook Pro on the other hand, are immensely capable when used as intended computing devices which just simply are the best in their classes. The MacBook Air is too, it's just in a class I don't need.Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Un producto que hay que tener para disfrutar", "Author": "Jose Velasco (venezuela)", "ReviewID": "RUQN9IF91PX0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "He sido usuario de un iphone 3G y actualmente dispongo de un iphone 4.

The New York Times free app has enough stories to get me to and from work, and the ebook reader is quite easy to use. There are a ton of free books out there, mostly books in the public domain, but that's fine with me since I like to read old literature. The music and game apps are numerous and very good. The web is extremely fast and the pad \"just works\".On the downside, the iPad doesn't come with a clock or alarm clock utility. You can buy apps written for this purpose, but, since there's no multitasking, you can't depend on them to work. For example, if you have a meeting scheduled, and your alarm clock app set, the meeting notice will pop up and prevent the alarm on the clock from ever going off.Magazines look awesome on the iPad, particularly Wired and Time. The downside is that you can't buy a subscription and have to pay a very inflated price. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. I wish more magazines were available, and I wish I could get the entire New York Times delivered to the iPad in one fell swoop since I don't have a wifi connection on the subway I ride (the workaround is to go to all the articles before leaving the house, which puts them in a cache for reading later).Another downside is that you still have to sync the pad to itunes to do any kind of backup or file transfers, and the sync HAS TO be done via cable. At this point, with such a poweful technology, I cannot believe Apple doesn't just automatically sync/backup the ipad wirelessly when it gets near its \"mother\" computer. Likewise, there should be some way to map the free space on the pad as a drive to transfer files to and from the device.The glare problem is bad if you're trying to read in bright sunlight, but I read mostly at night in bed and on the subway so it's not an issue for me. The backlighting is actually very nice for reading in bed.Overall, a very nice device. The screen size is just right to watch movies and TV on the go. Lots of apps are available. The word processor and spreadsheet app (sold separately) are very nice, even if syncing back to a PC or Mac is a bit of a pain.I've been taking my iPad on trips instead of my laptop PC--it is a good device for travelling and lets me get basic work done (e-mail, web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets).I'm sure the device will only get better over time.Please note that amazon's price for the 64-gig model is higher than buying it at the Apple store, even after tax.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it !", "Author": "Regina Maria", "ReviewID": "RIJCG0LXNA9W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no nerd, so something that's basically self-explanatory is great for me.

It is not going to replace my laptop (MacBook) in work related activities, but it is going to replace it in fun-related activities. After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5\" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it. A lot of critical things that were mentioned here are true: I wish the screen was not glossy, and I wish it was lighter (but lets be realistic - it is way lighter than all laptops and quite a bit lighter than most notebooks), and I wish it could play Adobe flash videos. This is pretty much it - I don't see anything else that bothered me about this device. And there are tons of things that make me happy about it: a beautiful screen, quick response, external speakers (I really missed them on m iPod Touch), and as mentioned before - instant on.Looking back, I really feel that a lot of negative reviews that I've read did not make much sense - this device should be judged for what it is, not for what it could have been..", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad is a paradigm shift", "Author": "Boom Box Hunter", "ReviewID": "R3FSZT65RUB470", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just putting in my two cents, but this thing is amazing.

Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Old Old Generation", "Author": "Eric Shepperd", "ReviewID": "R23FAGOQ9UIK8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product had dings on it and it was the very first apple IPad.

I thought it may of been a glitch such as it just freezing up while turning it on that one time. Just to test it out, I forced it off and did a cold boot and it stayed on the Apple logo for hours. I tried plugging it up to iTunes (which is awful too) and tried to restore it. I put it in recovery and attempted to restore it.

I was reading what the error means and it said to update iTunes (which I'm on the latest version). It also said it means it's not eligible for the update (which it is because iTunes downloaded it for me). At that, I was going to try and call support. I went through and was trying to get support and it would not give me support and kept on telling me to buy a support lane. Honestly, if Apple broke my iPad, I should get support free of charge.

If you download movies to watch at a later time you will need wireless again to sign in to watch. I got the iPad in March specifically to watch movies on the train. I downloaded 3 to watch. I was all comfy ready to watch one and it wanted a password. Well, the train doesn't have wireless so no movie(no stations have it either...believe me, my husband and I tried). So if you are planning on downloading your movies to watch later somewhere without wireless it will not play. I find the whole thing ridiculous, that you need 5 seconds of wireless to sign in again just to play them, but have been told \"sorry, that's just how it works\". I have had the iPad2 now for 3 months and tried again on Thursday but let the movie play a few minutes and then hit pause thinking that was all I needed to do. Went somewhere without wireless and sure enough they wanted me to sign in again to play it. Another 4.00 down the drain. Now iTunes won't return the money I have wasted on trying to get movies to play and Apple won't take the iPad back. So I am stuck with a 500.00 item I can't use and 40.00 in movies I never got to watch or had to cram in a short period. Once you start a movie it is gone in 24 hours so if you start it and plan to continue later in the day but can't find wireless it will drop off. Also, be aware that iTunes has no phone customer service so if you ever have any troubles you have to write them and then wait 24 hours(as your movie disappears) for a reply. The reply I got was to go to two links which had nothing to help me. I have an iMac, iPod and iPhone so really didn't need an iPad except for movies. Guess I will try and sell it on eBay. You know what Apple told me to do? Get a 3G network....haha. I already pay over 200.00 a month  for the two iPhones in our home. I don't want to spend all that money just to watch movies. I think Apple has lost this longtime customer over how this was all handled. I realized today that it is all about money and they don't care about customer service or loyalty.

In the store, it seemed so sleek and sexy that I didn't pay attention to its major downfall.  Namely its sleek and sexy without substance.  While you get 10 hours of battery life, you are stuck with the battery because it can not be replaced.  What happens in a year or two when it only gets 8 hours of life and then less and less.  Essentially you get a giant ipod touch that can not be taken apart, upgraded, or have any other modification done to it (not really a computer in my book).  No peripherals such as a USB input or any other way of connecting to anything other than another computer (which by the way you will need to sync or even start the thing initially) unless you want to fork over more money.  At first, the on screen keyboard was OK but progressively, I realized that it was next to impossible to write even moderate sized emails in any span of time consistent with a modern lifestyle.  Nor can you do any sort of actual work on the thing: no multitasking and when I attempted to work on a couple of google docs it toke me forever to make even small changes.  Some counter that you can just get the additional keyboard dock but that's another $80 and isn't practical for everybody to carry around.  While I very much enjoyed web browsing in the touch screen format, I must admit that it was a different web.

I am very satisfied, but have decided to attempt to return it. Ill explain that.For the stuff it does (apps, ebooks, games, music, pics, videos, etc) it does it all flawlessly and i couldnt possibly complain about any of it. Beyond expectations actually!The problem is it is BIG! I figured i would use it to watch movies or shows on my boring train ride every day. But what do i do with it when im not using it? If i carried a briefcase this wouldnt be an issue, but i dont. I can leave it on my lap, but then i risk either dropping it or being targeted by some thug who wants a new $700 toy for free.The other issue is that its DELICATE! Anyone with an iphone or ipod knows just how delicate these screens are ... and this one is even bigger than those! You can tell its made well, but a single drop will break the screen guaranteed.So while i do think its an amazing device, i think i can easily live without it. Maybe it would have been an easier decision to keep it if it hadn't cost me $700 ($499 + tax + replacement insurance which you MUST have!!)That's all. Good luck with yours, enjoy.PS, im not happy about spending $700 on something and it doesn't even come with a case or protective screen?? Common apple seriously!!! And then they boast the HD screen for movies ... but the movies cost $20 EACH!! They boast the ebook reader, but the good illustrated books are expensive!!

I didn't bother getting the 3G version because I am able to tether my Ipad wi-fi to my 3G phone. My 3G phone can act as a wi-fi hotspot which the Ipad can use to access the 3g connection; and with an unlimited plan on my 3G phone, I can surf 24/7 without worrying about usage.Although I am PC user, all my portable devices are Apple products, from the old first gen Ipod, first gen Itouch, to first gen Ipad- which isn't really portable. I like my Ipad. Interfact is very similar to the Itouch. The screen is HUGE, it's faster, the audio is much crispier and louder, a bit heavy but all in all, it's a very solid product. A lot of people say it's a big version of Itouch. In a way, I would say yes but performace wise, it's way way different. There's that sense of speed and stability that goes with the Ipad. It just runs so smoothly. Even downloading apps is just a two-click process.I have downloaded quite a few free and paid apps, mostly productivity apps. There's a new patch coming out soon for the Ipad OS so I'm holding off on getting all crazy with every apps the catches my eye.Together with the Ipad, I purchased a wireless Apple keyboard. It pairs with your Ipad in a snap. I suggest getting a keyboard if you're typing intensive. The virtual keyboard on the Ipad is responsive but I wouldn't use it so much. Sometimes I am heavy handed with my typing, I'm afraid I might crack the glass.I've noticed a lot of people giving Ipad low scores in Amazon review; and most of these low-scorers have never owned an Ipad.

It is nice for recreation, but that's about it. It in no way can replace a laptop or desktop. Also, as many people have mentioned, it really is just a larger version of the iPod Touch. I really expected more from this device, but what I got was less than I thought would be mandatory. There's a video editor for the iPad, but there's no camera? And then you have to be near a public wi-fi to surf the internet unless you want to shell out an extra couple hundred dollars for the 3G edition which you have to buy a 3G plan to use which means even more money.If all this wasn't bad enough, the iPad pretty much lost most of its portability. Sure it can fit in your backpack better than a laptop and can fit in a manila envolope (not sure why you'd want to put it in a manila folder, but you can), but if you don't have a backpack it's kind of a pain to lug it around. You can't put it in normal pockets and it's awkward to just hold all of the time. It can be used for all of your media, which is a plus, but why would you want it too? You might as well just get an iPhone (not an iPhone 4 though since they're still having issues with that, but that's for another review).I'm sure that there will be plenty of people who will love this device since it is an Apple product and it does have a few traditional dazzling Apple features, but I think that this device is a waste of money and you should only buy it if you have absolutely no need for several hundred dollars. If you buy this to replace an MP3 player or a laptop, then you're in for a sad surprise. Who knows though? Maybe I expected too much with thinking that the iPad would be technologically on par with other modern electronics and that Apple would have some better way of carrying it that a cheesy pouch or in a backpack. If my review were based on any of these I'd give one star, but the iPad does a good job with its interface and it still has the large app database that Apple fans love so I gave it one more star. I know Apple can do better and chances are that the iPad will probably be another Apple series where they make very small changes in between each product and make a fortune.

It started in NYC (as all great stories do) and I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say I was purusing Megan Fox pictures - the classy ones - on my new iPad and Tony Blair's PA who was in NYC visiting friends was on the subway sitting next to me. He happened to look over my shoulder - and well, thanks to my gleaming new iPad we hit it off! We went for drinks downtown, partied till the wee hours and 24 hours later voila I'm tumbling in Swiss down feather pillows with my iPad at Davos!Well with the iPad in hand (I leave the case off, it can get kind of smudgy but really a lot classier than those dull plastic looking covers) we dined with Tony (BTW Berlusconi's got nothing on the Tone) and really beat the bush about how to solve the whole getting broadband WiFi out to the poor. We were on to something but then Tony started getting antsy. His PA (BTW his name is Geoffery) leaned over and whispered in my ear that Tony was allergic to asparagus (huh). Well apparently the Tone likes his asparagus but it gives him the itchies in his buttocks (something about the antibodies attacking his hemorrhoids and inflaming them and then bam! he's scratching at 'em like the devil).Of course this was not good news as we had planned a \"party\" back at Tony's hotel suite with Berlusconi (aka Bert). The Bert was bringing the champagne (primo stuff) and Dmitri (some Russian dude) was going to bring his iPad and bunch of \"secret\" apps. Well, I'm not one to miss a party especially on someone else's buck and decided to take action. I took out my iPad cleanser (see above re smudges), sprayed it generously onto the $50 special cleaning cloth I had purchased (I tell you that cloth works magic - I once cleaned my laptop screen and it wiped out the entire drive!). With as much British decorum I could muster I discretely passed the sopping wet cloth across the table to Tony Blair. Not even a quizzical look - he knew instantly - grabbed the cloth and swiped away! There was that winning toothy smile and a couple of shots later we were back on track and solved the whole WiFi issue!Well as you probably figure the Party happened. Bert brought the champagne and his assistants (to - ahem - pop the corks), and a few choice cigars. Dmitri showed us his iPad apps (he's sooo much cooler in real life, though it was weird his secretary Vladimir kept calling him and telling him to get back to his hotel room...) Anyway, we partied all through the next day's sessions, pretty much trashed the room.  During a lull in the mayhem, Tony pulled the iPad cloth from his pocket (well it wasn't quite that elegant, he had to reach under the bed and pull his trousers out from underneath the bottles of booze, but you get the point, and yes I did see the 'rrhoids), handed it to me and said \"Davos 2012.\" Cool.

The fact of the matter is, Apple are selling defective products to whoever gets them at high prices, even my ipod classic has been acting funny, and the iphone 4 is a showcase of how they want to manipulate people and take peoples money, whilst they build their empire. The high reviews are most likely from people who's ipads are working, please take my advice and avoid apple, products, my brothers ipod touch also got returned to the apple store more than 3 times, from what I remember.Your risking your money, when you buy one of their products, will you get what works or not, that's what should be in your mind.
