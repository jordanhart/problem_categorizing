The only minor problem is that the Tablet is so new that Toshiba doesn't have all the gagets work out but supposedly there in the works. A real plus is I'm not lock in to the Apple Expense of buying just their equipment if I had bought an Apple.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Excite 10 LE is wonderful", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1JKN09J0DIN3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Excite 10 LE tablet daily since it first came out with Honeycomb. It had some issues with the Internet browser crashing and some other issues on the Honeycomb version of Android. However this tablet was designed specifically for Ice Cream Sandwich, which became available recently as an over-the-air update. The update was successful and installed without issues. Don't judge this device until you have the ICS update installed because the whole audio/visual experience has improved dramatically. The Internet browser is fast, stable and YouTube seems to work better too. The new hardware design is commendable with the magnesium alloy backing, super-light weight and a solid build. The gorilla glass is very smooth to touch and a pleasure to use. This is a tablet that I really enjoy and take with me everywhere I go.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0074WP2BE"}}
