I wanted to wait and get some good use time under my belt before writing a review; its been a little over a month now. This is an excellent tablet - after you download all the software and firmware updates.  But that is also one of the BEST features of the tablet - it's upgradable to either the Honeycomb 3.2 or ICS operating system.  Plus, the 32G it comes with is expandable with microSD AND USB connection - Awesome! iPad can't come close to the price/value; not to mention all the great FREE apps. And speed and performance have been stellar.  All things considered, this is the best VALUE tablet on the market.And the Seller is no slouch either. I got a World (UK) version cause I wanted it unlocked and the Seller even sent it with an electric US adapter (I guess due to the shipping address) with no extra charge. I was very grateful because I didn't anticipate that essential element.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pain to set up. Tablet seems nice enough", "Author": "rnetto", "ReviewID": "R1KBPMR0HTV1YC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bottomline: Don't be expecting to be using this right off the bat unless you already have a microSIM card available. A little heavy and some features aren't as nice as the Ipad, but it is much more customizable to fit your particular use for it and offers a lot of flexibility for those who like to tinker. Not for the Android-naive.When I received the tablet, it displayed an error message: Tablet is not provisoned; please insert a SIM card and reboot. There was no way to bypass this. I did not have a SIM card in the country I was at and did not wish to buy one as I would soon be leaving; however, I wanted to make sure that it worked before I left and couldn't return it anymore.An hour on the phone with Motorola was no help, as they just kept on repeating to me that there were not unlocked tablets in the US (Motorola has a deal with Verizon). So I was frustrated.Finally, I was able to get a SIM card (micro sim not mini sim) and use it to set up the device. After that, it no longer requires one to turn the tablet on and it seems to work relatively well.From what I've noticed so far, I like:1) Pretty intuitive to figure out how to install apps, download pictures, take pictures, e.g. the basic functions IF you are an Android user already. The setup menu was a little difficult to find.2) Nice graphics. Not that different than the Ipads I've seen.3) It has front and back cameras, making video chats possible.4) Adjustable language setting: whatever you pick when you first set-up the device can easily be changed; you aren't stuck with a particular geographic region/language.5) Doesn't have to be dead-on to see the screen. I haven't used it in daylight yet so I can't speak to this.6) Syncronization with google accounts is fast and efficient.7) Lots of screens and space to organize as you please. It's, in general, very customizable to your user interface needs/preferences.What I don't like:1) No user guide or real help manual was provided (other than a 3 leaflet brochure), so you're dead in the water if you can't figure something out. Motorola customer service leaves much to be desired. If you haven't used Android before, this might be a difficult device to start with.2) It would be nice if the setup menu had a physical button on the outside or pre-created link to access it, but once you create a shortcut to it, that's not too bad of a hassle.3) Webcams are about the same quality of a cellphone, so on a larger screen, the image is a bit grainy.4) It's pretty heavy for something so small. But maybe about the 3rd of the weight of a small 11\" notebook nevertheless", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "fast, open source software, bett\u00e1r res than ipad, amazing battery life", "Author": "Mr. Soupp", "ReviewID": "RLQVGD6REKANV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second xoom - they're exactly the same, apart from the 3G capabilities (my first didnt have it) - I got the thumb keyboard installed (free app) that alows me to customize the keyboard for a better typing experience.  The cameras are great (front and back) and I have my screen off setting for 30 min (I know, a lot - but I use the tablet for live music, where my lyrics and chords are, and sometimes I play a few songs by heart, and dont want the screen turning off during that time)  - I can go almost 10 hours straight without recharging it (two five hour shows, without a problem) with the 3g off. The 3g uses more battery, but I don't know how much - I turned it off pre-emptively, so no way of telling. Not a bjg gamer, but a few I added on it worked great.  I don't like apple's policy overall, and don't own any mac products - I do recognize they're great, but if you look closely, you will ALWAYS find alternatives that are as good, or better - the zoom is definitively one of those alternatives.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "3G doesn't work", "Author": "The third Chimp", "ReviewID": "R2FUGYU54LQYA8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know if this is a different version of what was advertised, but the 3G function does not work.I bought the item in the US and brought it to Brazil...

However, the set up requires you to have a SIM card for the initial set up. I dont know anyone with one, and couldn't find a prepaid one either. Verizon was more than happy to offer me a service plan instead of a prepaid card, but I have no intention of taking on another bill just to use a tablet at home. No where in the product description disclose that you need to take on another monthly expense just to operate this tablet. Also, the power cord does not appear to be designed for US outlets. There is a large, bulky adapter included, but I would just pass on this.

I am able to choose if I want to store in the SD card, some do not provide a choice. I was able to upgrade to ICS shortly after receiving it. this is better I believe. The a/c adapter is cumbersome so I ordered a new standard style. I ordered a leather cover for this and it protects it well but it is not a rubber protector for dropping it. I have not selected a 3g provider as of yet, I actually bought a hotspot that is 4g so I can also use it on my laptop, the apps available to store and sort documents are great. the Storage available is impressive and the battery life is more than I expected. this is my 1st one and really do not have much to compare it to. I would recommend this even if the size and weight is little more than the Ipad, or some others like the IPAD which I would not have bought anyway, I am not an apple fan. Cons are the proprietary charge, cannot charge with micro-usb only with the provided miniplug style. also the access areas are on the bottom of the unit, poor placement for when you wish to set it on the bottom.

I use it to display maintenance documents in areas where I don't have access to a computer where all the docs are stored. So I have them downloaded onto the Xoom. I had two main criteria when I went shopping for a 10 inch tablet. It had to take my Micro SD card that already had my documents on it. It also had to charge through a port that was NOT a micro or mini usb. The last tablet I had, a seven inch from another company, charge through a micro usb. When the plastic guide inside the port broke, the unit became useless, no charging. The company would only sell me a replacement motherboard, for the price of a new unit. This unit, like the Xoom had been dropped a number of times, but it showed the damage, so no warranty work allowed.The Xoom was the only tablet on the market that fit these two criteria. The case that it resides in protects it very well. Mine has been dropped from as high as 5 feet, and the case did very well protecting the Xoom. No damage at all. The camera works nicely, in either photo or video mode, so I can take photos of damaged equipment wherever I am.It has a very nice and long battery life. With the appropriate applications, it displays all the documents and spreadsheets that I need it to, regardless of document type. It's easy to hold, works very well in everything that I try to do with it. It also connects to my desktop flawlessly. If I trash this one, which will be a difficult thing to do, I'll certainly get another one, as no other tablet will match my selection criteria, plus be tough enough to handle the environment I use it in.

Theres also no way tocharge it because the power supply is for europe/asia, so you cant even plug it into the wall.  Even if you could,it still wouldent work because the voltage is different. You'd have to buy a plug adapter and power converter inorder to charge it, which is a ridiculous amout of equiptment to carry around considering it's susposto be a portabledevice.The xoom was also not the black regular xoom thats advertised in the picture, the xoom I recieved was a shiny silver.This model was discontinued within the first few days of the initial release because of major problems.  So i'm VERYdisappointed that they'd sell me a discontinued, non functioning in the USA model.  Last time I risk something likethis again.Because this is the asia model with the silver color, theres also big software issues too.

It took too long for Motorola to send the update but it is finally here. 4th star goes back.The other star has to do with a really bad design issue. The space for the SD card is next to the SIM card space. I had a micro SD card fall into the sim space and it is near to imposible to remove it (many have tried) without disassembling the machine.
