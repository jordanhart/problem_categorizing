{"Reviews": [{"Title": "KF HDX 8.9 is ok; do homework on Prime download before you buy", "Author": "B. Tarbuck", "ReviewID": "R3OSONR0PBKHU6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.  To Amazon's credit it arrived about 2 weeks earlier than originally claimed.I have a Galaxy S3 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing.  Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Cloud Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device.  Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion.  This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download to your HDX.  Caddyshack can be downloaded but not The Hunger Games.  You can download certain videos but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out.  There is no banner (like the Prime banner on the movie icon) to show that it's content you can download to the HDX.  You have to open the content to check.  *** Edited 12/21:  You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device.  That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content.  Nice job Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.  Also NOT the case.  So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption.  That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.  You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.  Many people will opt up for the 64 GB device like I did only to find that 16 GB would likely do fine since it would be hard to download enough content to fill 64 GB.  As another commenter pointed out if you downloaded long movies in full HD perhaps you'd really want the bigger device.  Which brings me to the final point.The final criticism is that once you start watching content you have to finish watching the content within 48 hours or you need to reconnect to the internet.  Again, I was surprised to find out that the content I downloaded expired.  Hopefully these criticisms lead to a more informed purchase decision on your part.Here is the official word from Amazon which is indeed on their site and the purpose for my edit.  I was unable to find this prior to my purchase and learned about it only after I acquired the device.*  Many (but not all as I note above) Prime Instant Video titles are also available for download on Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation and Kindle Fire HDX devices. The detail page for each Prime Instant Video title indicates whether the title is available for download. You can download available titles to only two separate devices at one time. If you have already downloaded a title to two devices, you need to delete it from one of them before downloading it to another device.*  You can have a maximum of 25 total Prime Instant Video titles downloaded at a time across all devices associated with your Amazon.com account. While not all Prime Instant Video titles are available for download, the same videos may be available for rental or purchase from Amazon Instant Video, and rented or purchased titles can be downloaded to compatible devices.*  Viewing Period: If you have a Prime membership or Prime free trial, you can stream any video that is currently designated as a Prime Instant Video title on its detail page. You can watch Prime Instant Video titles that you've downloaded within a limited viewing period, which varies by title. A typical viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the title or 15 or 30 days after the download, whichever is earlier. We'll typically notify you when the viewing period for a title is close to expiring. After your Prime membership or Prime free trial expires or is cancelled, you cannot watch any Prime Instant Video titles unless you've also rented or purchased that title.So my recommendations are this.  Amazon is a great company, one that I have committed to in a big way with Cloud Music, Prime and now the HDX.  They need to be more upfront about the download limitations and I'm very disappointed that I've had to discover these limitations on my own and feel it is important to convey that to others who may be considering this device over others based solely on the much touted video download feature.Also the rear facing camera in my particular device only works properly 30% of the time.  There is some weird RGB output happening.  It's not even close to the Galaxy S3 quality or acquisition speed so just don't expect that the camera will replace your SLR and you won't be disappointed.The rest of the device is great.  All my Cloud music magically appeared and it is very easy to operate. I can get on a primitive version of Gmail but it works fine.  Outlook Web Access for work is fine.  Yahoo! email works fine.  No Dropbox app yet and it won't work with Google Docs or Microsoft's online Excel / Word apps but that was known in advance and expected given the fact that Amazon isn't touting this as a work tool; it's for play.Amazon really owes it to their faithful customers who purchase these devices to improve the download / Prime experience and this will be a home run.  I'm looking forward to trying Mayday to help sort out the problems with the camera and inquire about the return policy as I felt very underinformed in advance on the downloaded video limitations.  I hope these comments help you ask good questions and help Amazon improve their product and content experience.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rocks!

The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning.  Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX.\u2714 BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9\" HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline. If you remove the videos from your Carousel then, from the video menu, you must go to the left side bar, and click *downloads* to see your videos.\u2714 PRIME DOWNLOAD ISSUES (free video download limitations)Prime members can download selected Prime Instant Videos to watch when not connected to the internet.  There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).---Videos you purchase do not have a viewing period.\u2714 GLITCHES---Verify your kindle is set for the correct TIME ZONE or you might have glitches.---If you cannot see your apps or any other items on the CLOUD then you probably need to RESET your device.---Filling the device to the max with videos then trying to delete a video might turn your kindle into a brick.\u2714 POWER ADAPTER INCLUDED---Yes, you get a  Kindle Power charger! Previously this had to be purchased separately ($19).\u2714 OFFICE SUITE MISSING---You can view an item with the integrated Office Suite but you cannot edit the item unless you upgrade to the professional version and paying $4.99.  That is, the HDX has a built in OfficeSuite shell, not the full functional program.  Hint: Use your 500 free coins to get the upgrade free.\u2714 No HDMI port (MIRACAST instead)---There is no HDMI port. To view kindle content on a television you need a Miracast enabled receiver (which can be your tv or a Dongle you connect to your tv). Although this is all done wirelessly, you are not using your local wi-fi connection, the receiver creates its own adhoc network.\u2714 PICTURE QUALITY---The picture quality on the HDX is stunning. It is noticeably better than the HD, there is no comparison between the two of them.\u2714 SOUND---The sound on this device is about the same as the Fire HD.\u2714 PROCESSOR---Faster. A lot faster than the HD!\u2714 VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS---The volume and power buttons are on the back of the device instead of the side. Fortunately the power button is on a different side than the volume buttons.\u2714 VIRTUAL KEYBOARD---There is white secondary text on the virtual keyboard buttons which makes information easier to read. On the HD, the secondary text is black which is difficult to read on dark gray keys.\u2714 KARAOKE (X-Ray)---You can now get x-ray on your music which shows the lyrics line-by-line. This feature is not available with all songs.\u2714 PRINTING---This new device will soon support printing documents straight from the kindle. Previously needed a .99 cents app.\u2714 STORAGE---This model can be purchased as 64GB without having 4G connectivity.\u2714 MAYDAY Customer support---Click the Mayday customer support button (in the Quick Settings) and you can see the rep but they cannot see you.  I have used Mayday about three times and it is wonderful.\u2714 REAR AND FRONT CAMERA (Important information)---The HDX includes a rear facing camera with an LED flash. There is also a front facing camera. On the HD there is only a front facing camera and no flash.\u2666Important:  once you take a photo it automatically goes to the CLOUD storage.  Please do not take any images that you do not want floating around in cyber space!\u2714 Special Offers---As before, Special Offers show up as screen savers. They are much better than the traditional screen savers. I recommend buying cheaper with the offers. If you do not want them then pay the extra to remove them. If you buy without the offers then change your mind and want them, you can't get the discount.\u2714 Amazon Coins---All new Kindle Fire owners receive 500 Amazon coins to spend in the app store. This equates to about $5. Plus there is always a free app of the day that can be downloaded. This is nothing new.\u2714 RETURN POLICY\u2666If you do not like the HDX (and you buy from now through the holidays) then you have until January 31, 2014 to return it.  In general there is a 30 day return policy.Cheers", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An enlarged version of the 7\" HDX - Same good internal components with a nicer screen- still a battery hog though", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer \"Reviewing is my greatest int...", "ReviewID": "R2GE0AJTQPLZ9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simply put, this is the Amazon\u2019s iPad Air Killer. The 7\u201d HDX is the iPad mini killer.  Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware.  This means the 8.9\u201d version is an enlarged version of the 7\u201d version.  For my 7\u201d version review, please search for my HDX 7\u201d review.My profile: I\u2019m a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) & use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.  It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7\u201d \u2013 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7\u201d as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7\u201d As I mentioned in the 7\u201d review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This screen is a much bigger step up from the original HD 8.9 1920x1200 screen to the Kindle Fire HDX screen at 2,560 x 1,600.  The screen is comparable to the iPad Air which I saw in Apple store and text is crystal clear now with such a high per pixel inch density.  The viewing angle is just as impressive as you can hang the kindle in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly. Last year's model was not as clear as this. The overall screen improvement for this year\u2019s Kindle lineup is just impressiveSound (8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound. Similar to the 7\u201d that gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):Like the 7\u201d HDX, this 8.9 HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device. It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.The biggest improvement is the weight for this HDX 8.9 compared to last year\u2019s HD 8.9, the device is noticeable lighter (567g for Kindle Fire HD vs 374g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue. It\u2019s also lighter than iPad Air and that\u2019s quite impressive.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting. It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view. However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful. Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it. Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):With higher resolution similar to the kindle fire hdx 7, the battery life is still the biggest drawback.  As mentioned in my HDX 7\u201d review, it takes more to power to drive the battery now thanks to the screen upgrade.  Anything on the screen requires higher resolution = more power draw.  The 2650x1600 screen pulls a lot of power still compare to last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  It maybe fine for casual use but for people who are more absent minded in charging or require this for business productivity purpose, it can be quite annoying when your batteryrunning out of power.  Regardless, how much power saving features you have, it seems that the screen resolution is still taking most of the power.  I'm able to pull 7 hours of moderately heavy usage vs 9.5 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time. Again, if something like a battery case is available, that will be great. Otherwise, it will be wise to find an external battery pack for this just in case.Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueLike the 7\u201d Silk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX. For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use). The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon. I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):Same problem here arises for the 8.9\" compare to 7\".  For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available. At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch. This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached. Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon. Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.  At the moment, will just have to go with the original origami case (which again can be pricey as you can see from my other review)Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use. The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and its does show relevant items I maywant. Compare to the iPad Air, this is a total steal.  At this screen range, you cannot find anything comparableConclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad Air killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade from HD 8.9, I say YES to that.  The overall lineup for Kindle Fire has vastly improved and that is great on Amazon\u2019s part.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade. The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It used to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag. It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case. You get great price, great screen and great performance that surpass iPad Air. To me, the HDX is Amazon\u2019s answer to an iPad killer. This tablet at the moment has the best performance/price ratio.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market with no only one device revamped, but an entire lineup of Kindle Fire HDX having such performance leap. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!With 7\" HDX, it is my e-reader device whereas my 8.9\" HDX, it will be my productivity deviceThis will be reviewed periodically throughout the year. A more comprehensive review on productivity will soon be available. [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ipad convert", "Author": "R. Kumar", "ReviewID": "RTVD01N5TDVFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an apple guy since 1994.  I learned how to program on the Iic and have been using just about every version of the macbook and iPhone since it's inception.  I've also been a very proud iPad owner since day 1.  I still have my original iPad and bought both the iPad 2 and most recently the iPad air.  The iPad air is a remarkable device, it is gorgeous, thin and light.  I realized quickly however that iOS 7 was not ready for primetime on the iPad air.  Not to mention that I was having memory crashes 5-6 times per day.  On mobile safari, I would have two web pages open and the device would slow down.  If I opened a third tab and went back to one of the original two, they would both need to reload.  On top of all that, even though I am fully vested in the apple ecosystem (I purchase all my apps, music and movies through iTunes), I was quickly realizing that the competition was catching up very quickly.That's what lead me to the 8.9 HDX, mind you, I tested out the Galaxy note 10\" as well as the Nexus 7 for a \"true\" android experience.  I found jelly bean to be no different than ice cream sandwich which was marginally better than the last version.  I know android purists will say there is a huge difference and jelly bean was designed for tablets, but in all honesty, android is just a boring experience.  Even with a gorgeous screen as there is on the nexus 7, it has the occasional stutter, and I don't find the operating system intuitive with the exception of google now, I swear they've got spies in my house.With all that said, the HDX is the first truly different tablet experience in almost four years.  You will be truly dumbfounded by how light this thing is.  I mean after holding an iPad air, you'll feel like this weighs nothing.  But even with the lightness there is a \"heft\" to the device, one that gives it a presence.  And 8.9\" is the perfect size.  I mean PERFECT.  You can hold it in one hand in landscape easily.  And the rubberized plastic feels phenomenal.  From an iPad guy, this thing is neck and neck when it comes to design.  Yes, it doesn't have an aluminum back, but the front screen feels so much better.  The iPad Air screen felt plasticky in comparison to previous versions.The OS on the HDX is good.  I like the launcher.  It doesn't give me the feeling of completeness that IOS does by allowing me to customize and launch different apps, but it does it's job well.  I've always wondered why Apple didn't just have a live screen that automatically selected the apps I use most often and put them on the front page.  That's where Mojito's (as an aside, dear Amazon and Android, stop. being. cute.  Just give me a OS Version number, I can't wait for Android \"lifesaver\" or \"mint julep\") carousel comes into play.  It updates as you use it.Oh, and I know some folks like to use tablets for productivity, but let's be honest, they are purely entertainment consumption devices.  I realized that quickly with my previous iPads.  As much as I liked having email, iMessage, FaceTime, office suites, etc, the reality was that I used my iPad to browse the web, shop, read, and watch movies.  Guess what, that's what the kindle fire focuses on.  This is not a laptop replacement, this is not a post-pc device, it's the dessert you know you shouldn't have but realize after eating that it was the best thing ever.Prime Content is not exactly amazon's strong suit unfortunately.  I love prime, I've been a prime user for a very long time.  The streaming features of prime are ok.  Decent shows (like the most recent daily show) and movies (most of Marvel's latest flicks) are available.  But I'm paying 7.99 for netflix and until Amazon shows me content like that, I'll stick with my buddy.  Prime again is ok, not bad, not great, it does the job, but don't buy this for prime.  You can obviously buy all the same shows and movies on amazon that you could on iTunes, but from a free content perspective, prime isn't the driving factor behind this device.So, should you get the HDX, here's a few questions for you:How vested are you in google's or apple's ecosystem?  Have you purchased dozens of apps, more importantly, do you use the dozens of apps you've purchased?How important is productivity software to you?  Do you have to check email constantly on your tablet, open attachments, edit documents?  Or do you find that using a laptop or other PC a better solution for that?Do you play lots of tablet games?Finally, where do you get most of your content and do you purchase, torrent, stream?  There are ways to get movies from both the play store and iTunes to the kindle fire legally and easily.I found for myself, that a laptop is the best solution, and with today's ultra books and the macbook air, you can get a small, light laptop for under $1000 that does exactly what you need.  But for content consumption, the kindle fire is very hard to beat.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW.  More than I expected!", "Author": "My $0.02", "ReviewID": "R2VTY8AFSMKDI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this delivered last week to an Amazon Locker so it wouldn't be sitting on my porch and so I could pick it up in the middle of a work day. The Amazon Locker experience was really cool and convenient.First impressions....fast, lightweight, thin, and super sharp picture.  How the heck are there so many enhancements stuffed in the Fire HDX without weighing it down or slowing the processor speed?Navigating through the apps is quick and smooth, very responsive to touch.  I had multiple apps (10-20) running at once and it didn't affect performance at all.The picture is amazing, the colors are vivid and the contrast and sharpness makes some content almost look 3D. It also handles glare pretty good. Best screen I've seen to date and I have an iPhone w/ retina.The speaker sound is really good, they actually put out some bass.The app selection in the AppStore is plentiful...once you have your top 50 apps you should be set and Amazon has all of the must-have apps (do you really need 500,000 apps?), every app I looked for/needed was found and downloaded quickly and painlessly (love the Yahoo fantasy football, Facebook, Pandora, TuneIn PRO, and Netflix apps).The video camera is crystal clear and the rear camera is a much welcomed addition.  Great pics and video! The built in Skype app works very well for free video calls with friends and family.  The good thing is, anyone with the Skype app can receive your video call on their device (unlike Facetime where both users must have an Apple device). This allows you to have free video calls with more of your contacts as long as they download Skype from their respective app store.The camera app is surprisingly useful considering it comes built in. It has a ton of photo editing capabilities including filters (way more than instagram), panorama shots, cropping, text, and funny stickers you can paste to pics. You would think this was a paid-for camera app.The email client was very easy to set up, I had my Gmail loaded in less than a minute.The overall build feels sturdy and just pure quality. Again, it is very thin and lightweight but feels like it was put together very well.The battery lasted for 10+ hours while I was hopping around fantasy football, Facebook, and email on Sunday during the games. This is very good for an HD tablet.  People must remember a tablet is more like a smartphone and needs to be charged when not using since apps and wifi are constantly running in the background. For being so thin and lightweight the battery is very impressive.The Silk browser is nice, although it defaults with Bing, so I changed it to Google (personal choice).I really like the icon with reading glasses that appears in the top right of the browser that let's you change to reading mode.  It converts the web page text into a book-like page, similar to the Kindle e-reader.  It really makes reading articles on various websites easy on the eyes.X-ray feature: Watching TV shows and movies is enhanced by x-ray.  Just tap on the screen and factoids about the actors in the scene (at that moment) pop up on the side of the screen without interrupting the play.  Just tap the screen again and the info disappears.  This also works when listening to music from the music tab; the lyrics of the song appear while the song is playing.  I've always had to interrupt myself and check my phone for movie info or song lyrics when I watched or listened on other devices, now it's all in one place and available with a tap of the finger.  No more asking \"what's that actor's name\", \"what other movie was she in\", or \"how does that song go\"!The keyboard is really accurate, no typos yet. I noticed there is an external keyboard by AmazonBasics, but I'm okay with the on-screen keyboard for now.The price was reasonable for what I got. It's good to know they're not making a profit on me before I even opened the box!Overall, I am very pleased with the appearance and performance after using it for 7 days.  I was really looking forward to this purchase and I must admit that I am more than satisfied. Amazon over-delivered on this. Well done Amazon.If you don't care about \"labels\", then this is the best tablet you can buy right now.  And if you ask me, Amazon is the best \"label\" when it comes to taking care of their customers.  You won't be sorry.  Enjoy!P.S. - You really should be an Amazon Prime member to get the most out of this tablet. The free Amazon Instant Videos for Prime Members are awesome!  I also opted for the Special Offers, which knocked $15 off the price of the tablet and does not bother me at all.  In fact, I am glad I got the special  offers version!  Since I've owned the tablet I have received offers that only Kindle Fire owners have access to.  I got a new Kindle Paperwhite for $20 ($100 off) and a Cuisinart Juicer for $20 ($100 off) - these 2 deals alone practically paid for my tablet purchase!  There was a deal for Madden 25 for $5 but I missed that one.  They are really awesome deals to take advantage of or you can just ignore them since the special offers only appear for a split second on your screen as you swipe to unlock the tablet from sleep mode. Definitely recommend the special offers, you can always opt to pay $15 later to have it deactivated but you'll find they are totally worth having.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Screen Display and All Around Nice Tablet", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R3L6RNVTOIVG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $379 you are getting a good deal on a large tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $399 for last year's base unit of the first-generation 8.9\u201d Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi base version of the iPad; if your pocketbook can afford it, I would recommend upgrading to the one with 64 GB of memory. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year\u2019s 8.9\u201d HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer looking for the larger screen size, or where price vs. value is a key consideration, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $269.  If you're comparing last year's 8.9\u201d model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one because other than screen size, for what I am using it for, I can only tell the difference between the video playback and playing a couple of games.I\u2019ve been playing with this for over a week now, and my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the 8.9\u201d Fire HDX to the original 8.9\u201d Fire HD as well as this year's model of the \u201cregular\u201d Fire HDX, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Initial setup of this year's model of the 8.9\u201dKindle Fire HDX was pretty easy \u2013 that\u2019s saying a lot as this year\u2019s versions of the various models had significant crashing issues due to operating software updates.  While this unit did update the operating software, it ran quietly in the background with no issues at all.Screen Display / Video Playback:If video is your thing, this version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date: I\u2019ve been comparing various episodes of the first season of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d TV show to each of the previous Fire models and I am very impressed at the picture quality. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp.  The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 2,560 x 1,600 (25% better than the HD version of the 8.9\u201d Fire) with 50% more pixels per inch at 339 ppi than the 8.9\u201d Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:It was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.  My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version sitting next to last year's HD version and this year's version of the 7\u201d HDX Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of CNN, FoxNews, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a slight difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My usual test of this feature is cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks and hear the bass), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  To have the sound throw back at you, you need to have a cover on it as the sound reverberates from the back of the Fire off of the cover back to you (hopefully, you followed that).One thing to point out is there is not a default equalizer with this Fire: everything sounds the same.  To get the most out of the bass and treble, as well as to turn down the mid-range, I highly recommend you downloading and installing one of the many free equalizer apps here from the Amazon app store as it makes a huge difference, especially if you are listening with headphones.The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account with the software came with the Fire.  Previously, I had to install and use an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store because like many of you I have more than one email account: Amazon eliminated the need for this aftermarket app because you can now switch back and forth between your various email accounts and it was very easy to setup my particulars.  The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.  The last tab on the top right contains a link to various deals on Amazon you can tap to open (or not) as you see fit.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app  here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There are two cameras on this model - one faces the front or toward the user / reader and one in the back.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.I really don\u2019t like the positioning of the back facing camera \u2013 primarily because if you use the Origami cover purchased here from Amazon (about the only one available as I type this review), the cover hides not only the camera but the LED flash.  That makes the back camera essentially worthless to me.Game Apps:Playing most of the games I play on my tablet is a much better visual experience than the 8.9\u201d HD model.  Now if this device would help me move up faster with Candy Crush I would be even happier!Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  Better yet, it is the \u201cpower fast\u201d charger that charges your Fire faster.  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.  Amazon touts it takes about 5 hours to charge this version of the Fire when the battery is completely empty.  I\u2019ve charged it several times when it was in the 20% - 22% remaining charge, and it took about six hours.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I pressed the button but felt pretty dumb: when the person who answered asked me how can they help, I basically said \"Hi, I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"  They laughed and I promptly let them get back to work answering other \u201cI just wanted to try this out\u201d queries.What I Wish it Had: a screen protector that was ready to go.  With all of the tapping, sliding, etc. on the screen, you can easily scratch the unit.  The screen protectors have been out of stock for a while now and I hope mine gets here soon.Overall, I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be.If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but I would recommend you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the 8.9\u201d Fire HD at $269.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Most Beautiful Screen I've Ever Seen", "Author": "Johnny Saigon\u00ae",

To see more videos on this Kindle Fire HDX, visit my YouTube channel:YouTube/JohnnySaigon2013You've already read a few detailed reviews from here, so I'll make this one simple to read: bullet points!PROS:*Beeee-ay-ew-tee-full screen: 8.9 inches at 2560x1600 resolution means the highest pixels per inch(339 PPI) for ANY tablet to date. Compare that with 299 PPI for the new iPad Air. This screen will literally blow you away. Apple is known to have the best phone and tablet screens on the market, and the new iPad Air is leaps and bounds better than the original iPad. However, compared to the Kindle HDX 8.9\", even it has to take a second seat.I read an article where DisplayMate compared this Kindle HDX's screen to that of the Nexus 10 and the new iPad Air:-100% color accuracy means whatever that is displayed is true to form. The best way to compare this is to pick up the Nexus 10(Samsung-made) and any Samsung AMOLED on Vivid settings.-This screen also has the brightest output - 527 cd/m2(or \"nits\"). This means that whether you're using it in pitch black, or on a sunny day in direct sunlight, this screen has enough brightness to excel in any situation. For a comparison, the best computer monitors output in the 400 nits range, and most TVs are in the 300 range.-Viewing angles are also top notch - you will not lose much quality even when you're not looking at it straight on.-Reflectivity is also minor. You bought this Kindle to see what's on the screen, not use it as a mirror. You don't know how important this becomes until you see a crappy screen such as cheap laptops.-Finally, it uses very little power, which means more battery life, and won't heat up and burn your hands.*Awesome stereo speakers. The virtual Dolby surround sound is really effective, and really immersive. You can crank the sound to 11 and it won't distort. By far the best speakers I've heard on any tablet or phone.*Truly lighter than \"Air.\" I hated holding the iPad 3(the most recent iPad I have). It was uncomfortable and wrist-breaking. Even with the iPad Air weight reductions, it still weighs about a pound(16 ounces). The Kindle HDX is 13.2 ounces. I can now finally read and watch videos in bed comfortably. Even holding it one-handed is now a comfortable reality.*Downloading movies, streaming videos, etc. through WiFi is super fast with the built in dual-band, dual-antenna.*This tablet is fast! Having a Snapdragon 800 processor means you'll never have to worry about apps and games slowing down on you. Having 2GB of RAM also means you can multi-task and run multiple apps to your heart's content.*It has never gotten hot or uncomfortable while holding/using it so far, so in totality the form factor and userability are excellent.*This is subjective, but I think at 8.9,\" this is the perfect screen size for a tablet. I have the old Nexus 7, and when compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3(5.5\"), or even my HTC One(4.7\"), there wasn't a big upgrade in screen size for me to use it more than my phones. The iPad, while having a nice screen size at 9.7,\" is too heavy and uncomfortable to use for a long session, even with the improved iPad Air. The Kindle HDX, at 8.9\" and 13.2 ounces, has the perfect combination. If you want something bigger, then just use your laptop!CONS:*There is no Micro-SD slot, so there is no potential of increasing your storage capacity. This is perhaps where the hardest decisions will be. The 16GB version has 10.9GB of useable space left, so it would not make sense if you want to download or store more than a handful of movies. Considering an HD movie can be anywhere from 2-10GB, make sure you select the right capacity for you.*There is no micro HDMI-out like on the older Kindle HD. The new HDX uses a wireless system called Miracast. This is all great, however, it is a new functionality that has not been widely implemented, meaning most likely that the TV you are using now isn't Miracast-enabled. So if you want to mirror your Kindle screen to your TV, you'll need to buy a new TV, or find an app or dongle that would provide an alternative.*The only other thing I can think of for the casual user on the fence is, because the ecosystem is not as robust as Apple iOS and pure Google Anroid, they won't have access to all those apps of the other two ecosystems. The Amazon App Store is growing rapidly, but it is climbing an uphill battle to reach the other two.CONCLUSION:The two most important factors I think people will have to decide from is:1) Do you love and live Amazon enough so that the lack of apps you would get from the iOS and Google app stores won't affect you?2) Are you one of those that uses your tablet as your universal multimedia hub, and want to store all your apps, games, music, photos/videos, and movies in there?I only play other media and games occasionally, so for me the lack of app quantity of Amazon from iOS and pure Android is not a deal breaker for me. It is for a lot of people, so in the end, it might come down to user preference and brand loyalty.Overall, for my needs, which is to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Videos, and surf the Net/read the news apps, this is the perfect tablet for me.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miracast and other misc.", "Author": "AMB", "ReviewID": "R3B8OZYWBFO34Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I love my new Fire HDX (64Gb, wifi only with ads), but all the positives have already been reviewed at length by others, so I will concentrate on what I have not yet seen discussed elsewhere in a lot of detail:1) Display mirroring (with Miracast).  I got the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and finally managed to make it work, no thanks to Netgear who have just lost a customer.  Well, not really since I never bought a Netgear product before and arguably I didn't this time either as I bought it refurbished, but still.  Installation issues notwithstanding, after it started working, it was pretty amazing.  I tested the Miracast functionality successfully with both my Win8 laptop and my Kindle Fire HDX.  Yes, there is a very slight lag, but nothing major and I suspect the technology will only get better what with the rate of the firmware updates being pushed out by Netgear for this product, trying to keep up with their competition which I think will be fierce now that Amazon has put its weight behind the Miracast technology by doing away with the HDMI output port entirely in the Fire HDX models.  Which means that if you are emotionally attached to using an HDMI cable to connect to your external screen or TV, or just do not want to put up with the potential pain in the neck the installation of the PTV3000 may turn out to be (though to be fair, some people had no trouble whatsoever?), you will want to stick with the HD models instead.  If you are excited about Miracast and want a WiDi adapter for your TV, use some caution, because as my review of said item demonstrates, it can be a hassle to setup.A cheaper alternative is the Tronsmart T1000 Mirror2TV Wireless Display HDMI Dongle Support Miracast DLNA EZCAST AirPlay Compatible with Android OS / Apple iOS / Samsung AllShare Cast S3 S4 Note2 Note3 Note10.1 / Google Nexus4 Nexus5 Nexus7 / Amazon Kindle Fire HDX / DELL VENUE 8 PRO which performance is unfortunately not as good as the PTV3000 (noticeable time delays and pixelation when mirroring and requires use of their free proprietary app, EZCast).2) Customer service.  I have never seen any company spend so much time and effort into ensuring customers were happy with their flagship product (the Kindles, I mean.  When it comes to every other product and services, they are just as impersonal and crushing as you would expect).  I have rarely -if ever- had to contact Amazon with any of my Kindle issues before, but I was forced to contact an Amazon representative three times since my HDX arrived and each rep was unbelievably polite, helpful (and downright nice! all three of them!  What?) and went to extraordinary lengths to resolve my issues (minor hardware problems - I'll update this review upon final resolution).[UPDATED:  my issues were resolved very satisfactorily, all it took was the guts to call Amazon support in the first place... All the customer service reps I spoke with -all 6 of them by now!- were helpful, patient, reasonable and even technically competent!?  I don't understand this minor miracle, but it's certainly no coincidence and I was very glad to be able to take advantage of it.  This great level of customer support is available for all your Kindle issues, not just HDX models, by the way].One of my calls was made while testing the Mayday feature and I was stunned by how amazingly good the concept and execution of this idea was!  Kudos to Jeff Bezos, this new feature is brilliant and will gain him major customer loyalty, especially among the older set (this is not meant to be insulting as I am no spring chicken myself).3) Accessories.  This tablet is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, granted, but it is also a fingerprint magnet -especially its display which is a touch screen, of course- and the rubberized back, which was so convenient and comfortable in the 7\" original Fire, seems to have become a sponge for natural skin oils with the 8.9\" HDX model?  Fingerprints are everywhere and stay obstinately attached to every surface, not just the display, and personally I never figured on wiping them off as a full-time occupation.My solution?  DecalGirl skins (check their website for a dazzling number of choices or why not, the original DIY look: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" DecalGirl Skin - 'Create Your Own'):  no, I do not work for them, I just spend a lot of time and as little money as possible trying to get the right accessories for my Kindles.  They are a tad expensive ($20), but they are unbelievably easy to apply, of superior quality, extremely durable, come in a huge variety of designs from colorfully eccentric to classically elegant and DecalGirl often offers up to 25% discounts on their website. They will keep your Kindle looking and feeling like new.Note that most cases easily fit over these skins but remember that if you also want a screen protector (I did!), it should be applied before the skin is applied to the body of the Kindle (front and back).  By the way, covering the front of the Kindle (the bezel around the screen) makes holding your Kindle a lot more comfortable... This is no ad for DecalGirl:  if you prefer one of their competitors (for instance:  Protective Skin Decal Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" Tablet (2013) Sticker Skins Books), do your research and go for it, I am merely pointing out that I believe getting a good quality skin for your HDX is more important than buying a case.  Also a lot cheaper than an Origami case, Amazon's preferred solution which at $50+ is just too rich for my tastes (sorry, this bon mot was just too easy)!Speaking of accessories, since I cannot recommend any one case wholeheartedly, I can at least recommend the Targus Mini Stand Designed for Apple iPad, iPad 2, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, Clear (AWE65US).  It's surprisingly practical and elegant for a simple block of acrylic!  Designed for any smartphone or tablet up to 10\", it's perfect if you like watching videos on your HDX from a desk or a table rather than balanced in your lap.4) Downloading videos.  The limitations mentioned in B. Tarbuck's review could be a problem for everyone who purchased the 64Gb model with the new downloading features in mind, which was my case... but a few months of heavy usage later, I can confirm that the points he raises are not necessarily a big deal.- First, you'll want to keep in mind that not all Prime videos are available for download as licensing rights limit what Amazon offers and which videos are Prime and downloadable is liable to change without notice.- Second, there is indeed a 25 downloaded videos maximum at any given time which personally I find is acceptable, even though I would have preferred to have heard about it beforehand rather than discover it afterwards.- Third, the Viewing Period limitation (48 hours or so depending on the video) is a lot easier to swallow when you realize it only starts applying to videos once you start watching them.So the Viewing Period limit is actually quite comparable to the Lending Library's limitations:  you just need to remember that Prime Videos are not available for streaming while you are traveling outside the US which is why you need to download them to your Fire HDX before leaving the US.  Or if you are an overseas customer:  yes, this IS discrimination!  Just kidding, it's due to the same licensing rights limits referred to above which Amazon negotiates with the content owners (Warner, Fox etc.) themselves, ie the same people who insist on different DVD regions etc.[IMPORTANT:  the 'Viewing period' limit actually applies only once you've STARTED watching a video.  As long as you simply keep your downloaded videos on your Kindle Fire for later viewing without starting the playback of the file, the Viewing Period limit is irrelevant.  Now, that's more like it!  :)  ]Personally I invested in the 64Gb model because I am often in the position of traveling overseas for months, with very little personal internet access.  Let's not get into a discussion of what most hotels overseas -ahem UK, I am looking at you here, not that Italy or Germany or Japan have a leg to stand on either- think is 'free internet access' or the availability of English-speaking entertainment media outside the US.  Can you believe that some countries expect you to understand their own non-English language to get your entertainment?!  Just joking:  English is not my native language...  My point stands, however.Therefore purchasing the 64Gb model may be worthwhile if you like to load up your Kindle with lots of videos in preparation for a long overseas trip:  just remember that once you start watching a video, a fairly short Viewing Period time limit starts running - about 48 hours (more or less depending on the movie/show in question).  This is similar to the time limit you run into when downloading Prime Videos to your PC or renting vs. purchasing movies from Amazon, by the way... Please also note that movies and TV shows take up a huge amount of space when downloaded from Amazon, even when you do not choose the HD version, compared to your own personal videos (ripped from your own DVDs, I mean) which usually take up no more than 1 or 2 Gb per movie. Plus, your own videos have no such intrinsic Viewing Period time limit and can be re-watched as often as you want, forever, just like the videos you actually purchase from Amazon.Remember, if you are willing to actually pay money to purchase a video from Amazon, you can then download it to your device at any time (while you are in the US), and keep it on the hard disk of your Kindle Fire -and any other Kindle Fire you own, past and future- forever (or you can re-download it repeatedly).  Which is what Amazon is hoping we'll do, in fact...  That's the whole point of selling the Kindles at near cost, after all.One more relevant item of information when it come to the HDX hard disk:  the micro USB port is not OTG compatible, so you cannot simply use an OTG USB key (like this little beauty for instance: Patriot Stellar Series 64GB USB 3.0 OTG With Up To 140MB/s Transfer For Android Base Tablet/ Smartphone- PSF64GSTROTG) to easily increase the size of your Fire hard disk. Oh well...5) non-Amazon content and apps:  let's just reiterate a few points which most official reviews I have seen rarely make.- you can totally get non-Amazon apps from the Google Play store.  Or any reputable website, as long as you are careful and do a bit/a lot of research first if you don't want to be sorry later.  Download the .apk file (all Android apps are really files with an apk extension), then transfer it to the appropriate folder on your Kindle.  Opening the apk file then installs the app on your Kindle Fire and the app will afterwards appear in your Fire's Apps section. It's that easy!  This simple process is called sideloading and no, it's not difficult or complicated and does not require rooting and does not invalidate your warranty or anything:  the internet is full of simple how-tos on the subject, just begging to be read.  And Amazon is perfectly fine with your sideloading non-Amazon apps, especially free apps.Obviously Amazon will not refer to it or explain how to do it and they will avoid even mentioning it, but Jeff Bezos is well aware that lack of flexibility on this issue would be a deal breaker, even if he'd rather not admit as much officially.  Which is why it's a fairly straightforward process, even though it would have been quite easy for Amazon to prevent us from sideloading non-Amazon apps.- you can easily get non-Amazon ebooks (pdf or epub or any other commonly used ebook format, free or otherwise - B&N; etc.) to your Kindle:  just install the Calibre software on your computer and it will handle all the format converting and transferring to your Kindles, from the oldest Kindle e-reader to the latest HDX.  Plus lots of other neat and amazing features, including tagging or helping with the rental of ebooks from your public library system.  Calibre is free, it's got heaps of documentation and technical help, it's regularly updated and it can and will handle your whole ebook collection beautifully while synchronizing all your e-Readers easily.  It's like iTunes for ebooks!  If iTunes was easy to use, efficient, inclusive of formats and platforms.  And came with helpful free add-ins like Firefox does.  And did not lose your full music library the way iTunes loses mine all the time.- comic books/graphic novels/mangas and magazines in pdf format. This is a seldom mentioned advantage of the 8.9\" HDX:  its larger screen size and higher resolution makes it a great way to read comics in pdf format with the built-in pdf reader!  It's a bit less practical in cbr or cbz format (as opposed to reading comics on a PC where using a free cbr/cbz reader is best), but easily doable and well worth it for facing the hours of tedium that travel often requires.  No need to use a comic book reader app, especially since the best such apps are not free, if your comics are in pdf format!  But if your non pdf comics library is too just too extensive to convert, then you can check out ComiCat which costs $2.99:  it handles most comic formats, organizes your collection nicely on your Kindle HDX and allows easy synchronization with cloud services like Dropbox, which is pretty nifty - compared to having to copy your comics files to your HDX yourself.- other external content (music, photos, audiobooks and videos):  nothing is to stop you from ripping your favorite DVDs and CDs (reliable free and paying tools are all around you) and transferring them to your Kindle Fire.  It's even easier with an HDX than ever before!I've been doing all of the above since the Kindle Fire 1st gen all the way to the HDX without any trouble via the USB port of my computer:  a simple USB to micro USB cable -the same type of cable you use to recharge your Kindle- and you're all set!  Or send your ebooks attached to an email to your Kindle's email address:  Amazon Help pages are full of detailed descriptions about it... this email method incidentally lets you share your non-DRM ebooks with your friends and family simply by emailing them with your ebook.  Assuming their own Kindles have been set up to accept documents from your email address - this last requirement is a security measure to avoid spam.  Personally, I use this nifty 'sending books via email to a Kindle device' functionality to guilt my relatives into reading edifying books I think they would benefit from (passive-aggressive stuff about healthy diet, exercise and the like... ) and it helps with their insomnia issues, if nothing else!Google will lead you to numerous helpful how-tos explaining which folder you should copy your video/audio files to on your Kindle Fire and which free apps to use if for some reason you do not want/cannot use the default app.  Videos and Photos will show up in your gallery under your Photos section and your uploaded music and audiobooks, naturally enough, in your Music section.  If your files are in a format your Kindle Fire cannot open and you don't want the headache of having to convert your files, just use one of several apps that open most files:  personally, I use ES File Explorer to navigate the hard disk of my Fire and open all my non-Amazon content.  You can also check out MoboPlayer which plays any video file format, not just only mp4 files like the Fire default video viewer app.  These two apps are both available free on the Amazon app store and are very popular for good reasons.Again:  all of the above in point 5 works for all Fire models, not just the HDX.6) On a different, UNRELATED topic:  if for some reason you want to root your Amazon Fire in order to run the non-Amazon version of Android and be able to control the look and feel and functionality of your tablet, please be aware that you will lose all Prime membership advantages on this Fire tablet (though not on your computer or any other Fire you may own).  Such as free Instant Prime Videos and the Lending Library. And Mayday functionality, also a bonus of the FireOS.I just want to emphasize the fact that sideloading has nothing to do with rooting:  the amount of ignorance and misinformation floating about this topic is simply astonishing.  And by the way, I really don't recommend rooting a Kindle Fire, though yes, technically speaking, it is doable.  By anyone with nerves of steel.  And at least several hours of free, preferably uninterrupted time for in-depth research beforehand...  Just be prepared to take responsibility for the waste of hundreds of your dollars if you do brick your Kindle device.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed in the 8.9\" HDX vs the 8.9\" HD", "Author": "Harold W. George", "ReviewID": "R1EQJON9NR9QR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD for a year, having gotten it last Christmas (2012).  I have also been an Amazon Prime customer for some time. So I was pretty excited when I saw the hype for the new HDX.  This seemed like it would be a great upgrade.  It seemed like it had several things I wanted in the HD, like all my icons on one page, a rear facing camera, and faster Wi-Fi and internet, and a lighter, thinner package.  Since I already had the HD, this should be a pretty seamless upgrade.Well that's not how things went for me.  First of all taking the HDX out of the box, it felt really cheap and flimsy compared to my HD.  Even though both tablets are 8.9\", the HDX has a slightly smaller display.  It actually seemed like a tablet you might buy your 10 year old.  I already was having my doubts, but let's fire it up and give it a try.I started it up and went through all the registration hoops, and then had to go to the cloud to get all of my apps loaded onto the HDX.  Well, immediately, I noticed that apps I had purchased were missing.  Most notably was Weatherbug, which is my main weather app on the HD.  I went to the app store, and it's not there, either.  Ditto a calendar, contact list and calculator I have on the HD.  Apparently these are not compatible with the HDX.There are some items on the HDX that are not on the HD, as well, but for someone that has already set up all their apps, this is disappointing.  Most of the games, candy crush, deer hunter, pipes, etc., that I play came over, but you lose the levels you have achieved playing them on the HD.  That was a big disappointment.The other thing missing from the HDX is an HDMI port to connect the tablet to your TV.  The HDX uses some kind of sync technology, but it would not work with any of the 4 TVs, two of which are HD flat screen, in my house.  So there is no way I can watch videos or movies on my TV.  That was the real deal breaker.In addition, Amazon touts a much better display, faster Wi-Fi and faster browsing.  I didn't see it.  comparing the 2 tablets side by side, I noticed no difference in speed, and couldn't discern a difference in the screen quality.  They are both very good.  When I turned both tablets on from a cold start, the HD actually booted up and was ready to go slightly faster than the HDX,  The browser interface is different and much less intuitive in the HDX than in the HD.If you like to read books, which my wife and I do a lot of, you will also be disappointed in the ability to control font size in the HDX.  In the HD I have the font set to 7.  There is no comparable setting in the HDX.  You get small, bigger, bigger yet, and HUGE.  None of those suited me like the settings on the HD, which are easily adjusted.If you already have an HD and are thinking about an upgrade, I would suggest you not waste the money.  You are not gaining much with the HDX (the rear camera, mostly), and are giving up a lot.  If you haven't purchased a tablet yet and are considering the Kindle Fire, I think I would still buy the HD, the prices have dropped to $229 for the 8.9\", which I feel is a great value.If you find you must buy the 8.9\" HDX, definitely stay away from the Origami cover.  It's expensive and it's a piece of junk.  I returned it along with the HDX, and would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE:I have since returned both the HDX and the Origami case.  Seeing how this was a Christmas present to me from my wife, we are both disappointed.  I certainly hope Amazon rethinks the HDX and it's marketing.  For now, my old 8.9\" HD workhorse is still going strong!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Display; Compares Favorably to Competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2YPITHVTYLCZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the top model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  (this tablet). This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an 8MP rear-facing camera, an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3 for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVHBC7NMNOGU for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I noticed with this tablet was how amazingly light it was. Not only is it 34% lighter than last year's 8.9\" tablet, it's even lighter than last year's 7\" tablet! This really is a one-handed tablet. Even better, they shaved the weight off without sacrificing build quality. The tablet looks and feels solid, stable, and secure.A fairly common complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet is that a slight blue glow is visible at the edges of the screen when there is a white background. I saw no such blue glow on my 8.9\" tablet. According to DisplayMate Technologies, the backlight on the HDX 8.9\" has white LEDs, so no blue glow source.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 2560x1600 (323 ppi) vs 1920x1200 (254 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement in sunlight, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby digital stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Amazingly light (13.2 oz vs. 20 oz) and noticeably smaller (9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" vs. 9.4\" x 6.4\" x 0.35\"). This is the first large tablet I've seen that is truly a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time. That was definitely not true of last year's model.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.5GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is smoother and faster, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations. The additional 1GB of RAM doesn't hurt (2GB vs. 1GB for last year's model).Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: Last year's HD had only a front-facing HD (720p) camera. This year's HDX has that front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing 8 MP camera, complete with LED flash and the ability to take a 1080p video.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you will need to purchase one of last year's models.Battery Life: The battery life has been increased, from 10 to 12 hours. Additionally, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 18 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is fine; I find that I'm charging it about twice a week with regular use.Price: It's more expensive ($379 vs. $299 (the price when last year's model launched; last year's model is currently $229)) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in the launch-day price is $60. That's a larger spread than the other tablets, where the difference between the 2013 HDX and 2012 HD is only $10, or the 2013 HD vs. the 2012 Kindle Fire, where the price has dropped by $20. This one isn't a slam-dunk, as the other two are. What you get for that price increase is pretty good, though, including the lighter weight, the added RAM, the longer battery life, the rear camera, the better display, the faster processor, and the updated software. Still, while I can definitely recommend this tablet, you might want to wait a couple of months for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price, which it likely will do next year. Or, if you want the larger size and don't need the latest and greatest, fastest and lightest, $229 for the regular Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a very good price.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 10 and the just-announced Apple iPad Air. This year's Google Nexus 10 has not yet been officially announced, although some details have leaked; I'll update when I have more information.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the HDX and the Nexus at 2560x1600 (323 ppi) and the iPad Air at 2048x1536 (264 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors. The HDX display is 8.9\" (measured diagonally), the iPad Air display is 9.7\", and the Nexus is 10\". In the recent DisplayMate Technologies Flagship Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet got the highest score they have ever given:\"Most impressive of all is the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, which has leapfrogged into the best performing Tablet display that we have ever tested, significantly out-performing the iPad Air in Brightness, Screen Reflectance, and high ambient light contrast, plus a first place finish in the very challenging category of Absolute Color Accuracy.\"It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Air is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Air has stereo sound. The iPad Air also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Air both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 9.1\" x 6.2\" x 0.31\" and 13.2 oz.Nexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 9.4\" x 6.6\" x 0.29\" and 16.8 oz.The HDX is definitely smaller and it's significantly lighter than is the iPad Air, although the iPad is a bit thinner. The size difference isn't too surprising when you consider that the iPad Air has a larger screen (with a lower resolution, though).Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: Not yet announcediPad Air: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Air have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX has a front 720p camera and an 8MP rear camera. Realistically, I doubt that the extra resolution on the HDX will make that much of a difference but if you take a lot of pictures, the HDX may be your best choice.Battery Life: HDX = 12 hours (18 hours when reading); Nexus = TBD; iPad Air = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, though, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the parental controls and options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its software update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real corporate productivity, though, I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this category. With the HDX at $379 and the Nexus at $399, both are priced significantly less than the iPad Air at $499. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.I don't think there is a single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 18-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is decent, particularly for what you get, and it's a light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.For a couple of reasons, I have all three of Amazon's 2013 tablets. So which one should you get?Kindle Fire HD - A good choice for a child or for a first tablet when you're not sure just how much you'll use a tablet. The price can't be beat and while it's clearly a budget tablet, it's not cheaply made. The only corner they cut is that they don't include a camera, so no Skype or self-portraits.Kindle Fire HDX - A good choice if you want the smallest lightest tablet of the bunch. If you'll be regularly on the go with your tablet and you want something you can easily slip into a purse or coat pocket, this is the tablet for you. You should also get this tablet over the Kindle Fire HD if you need a front-facing camera or you need the extra power. And you should get this over the larger version if price is an issue, since it's $150 cheaper.Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" - This is the one I use most around the house because I really like the large size and I love that I get that size with that amazingly low weight. If you need a rear camera, this is the tablet to get. And the one to get if price isn't an issue. I stick by my recommendation above, though, that you should probably wait for a sale or for Amazon to drop the price.This year, Amazon released three good, solid, highly competitive tablets. Personally, I think they got it right and I can recommend all three.Note: I check back here pretty regularly. If you have questions, I'll be happy to try to answer them.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, The best tablet in the market for readers", "Author": "Hussain Ahmadi", "ReviewID": "R1G4NZN44NTGCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the this new awesome device recently and its been more than a week that I used it so I\u2019d like to share with you all my thoughts about it. First have to say that I\u2019m an owner of Kindle Fire (1st generation), iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Air, Google Nexus 7 (2012), Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kobo Arc and few more tablets that I have used in the past but those mentioned are still being used. So in my review I will be comparing this tablet to the others that I have where necessary.HARDWARE:I have to say that Amazon nailed it when it comes to the hardware of the device. The tablet feels very comfortable in hand, with its rubbery back. but the main attraction here is the gorgeous display. It is so beautiful, very clear and crispy. Even though the Kindle shows a slightly more yellowish whites compared to the iPad Air whites but the colors look slightly better to the eyes on the Kindle than the iPad. at least to my eyes. Tested many pics on both and Kindle had that slight edge when it comes to how pleasant the colors look. I have even read that many professional sites have already declared the Kindle as the more accurate tablet when it comes to colors than the rest, not to forget also that the Kindle is lighter than iPad Air. Another advantage that goes to the Kindle over the rest tablets is the sound, with dual speakers placed at the right places it just gives a very strong and pleasant sound makes your music and videos sound a lot better. The placement of power and volume buttons are odd at first but you will get used to them fast. Cant say much about the camera because I do not use tablets for taking pictures.SOFTWARE:I will write more about the software as I have not seen this enough covered by other reviewers. I will write the things I like and dislike when it comes to the software:Things I like:1- Special offers: yes, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows. I just love it that whenever I want to unlock my Kindle there is something new rather than a boring wallpaper. I find the offers interesting and I hope Amazon show more book ads. they just look gorgeous on full screen.2- The Carousel: Big icons on a high resolution screen look really beautiful and you can remove whatever you don\u2019t want to be there. A nice thing Amazon implemented was the suggestions below the books and apps in the carousel. I find this extremely useful.3- Email: I find myself using this email more than the other tablets for the following reasons. The following points might be small bits but to me they make the Kindle Email superior than the rest:  a- Conversation Mode: Where you see the whole email conversation with a particular account. Yes the iPad also got this but in Kindle it is way more organised.  All the conversation are in one page and you don\u2019t need to click back and forth to read like the iPad, with just one click you can view one and hide rest. really cool.  b- Multiple Selection: Again this is available in all the tablets but it is superior in Kindle\u2019s email. you can select the emails and you can even open one while the the selection is made and all that without erasing your selection. Very very useful. Many times on iPad when I select multiple emails to delete then I decide to check one of them my selection just goes and I have to reselect again. With the Kindle this does not happen anymore.  c- Zooming: This applies to emails written  directly and not within HTML frame or CS. On the iPad when I zoom the text I have then to move the cursor left and right to read the zoomed text. annoying to do that. On Kindle\u2019s email when I zoom the text, the text just gets bigger and fits the page view nicely. No more do I need to go left and right.Really great job Amazon with the email.4- Implementation of Goodreads in the Kindle is the right direction towards making the Kindle tablet a true E-reading device. However, this implementation is not full and lots of things were left. For example you cannot update your reading status of a book. Amazon should address this along with goodreads to make this implementation fully functional so that I don\u2019t need to go to goodreads website from the browser.5- Text to Speech Voices: The text to speech voices on this tablet is the best ever in the market. period. Unlike Apple\u2019s dreadful robotic voice Siri or Samsung\u2019s scary Voice on the kindle provide the most natural human like voices. I love all the four UK and US voices. It is very nice of Amazon to provide different options for the user to choose according to his own likings unlike Apple which only gives us one horrendous voice on the iPad although on its mac OS Apple has so many great voices to choose from.7- Recently opened Apps menu: With the new OS Amazon has introduced the new history menu that could be pulled up from within any application. This makes the multitasking easier and at one finger point.Things I don\u2019t like:1- Book description: This was the major letdown for me with this Kindle. I had to dig and ask a lot to see how I could get to the book description of any book purchased from amazon. First you have to download the book. then open the book, then tab on the three lines on the upper left side to access the left side menu then click on the cover that appears there to see the description. phew!! Come on Amazon you have to do it better than this. on the Kindle Paperwhite you just tab and hold on a cover and the menu shows the book description whether the book is on your cloud or already downloaded to your device. I strongly feel this is a very important thing to us readers as it will make us decide which book to start reading. Amazon should really make the same kind of menu accessible on the carousel as well as in the device and cloud pages of books. THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. Have to mention that even Amazon\u2019s iOS app lacks this feature while both other e-reading apps like Nook and Kobo have their book description in a very easy and nice way.2- Silk: it is a functional browser with all the basics however what I don\u2019t like about it is that when you have more than two tabs opened the tabs keep reloading as if you were doing a page refresh! Why is that? maybe something need to be done in the settings? no idea but this tab loading is annoying and it prevents me from browsing the net specially when I want to open multiple tabs.3- Sometimes there is a slight lag when going through the carousel and this lag happens particularly when the device downloading something like a book or an app. It should be addressed.4- When I make multiple purchases on my computer and choose the HDX as the device for my books to be delivered to there is something wrong happens. I think sometimes the download in the device gets stuck and i have to remove all the queued book and redownload them again. This happens when I do that more than 10 books at a once. but when in batch it goes smoothly. So Amazon should address multiple book download pushes from other devices to the HDX.5- Text to Speech accessibility: I think all the books that support text to speech should have the play button within. Why do I need to enable accessibility in order for the kindle to read the book to me? This is annoying. I don\u2019t need accessibility enabled. I just need one play button in my book menu for the kindle to read it. Moreover, there is no short cut for accessibility. Not that I know. i have to go into settings and enable it there every time I want kindle to read to me. On iPad there is  the option to press the home button 3 times to enable it. Kindle should use a similar shortcut or even better make the play button available within the books without the need to enable text to speech from accessibility.6- Definition and Speak buttons: While kindle has the definition option within the book it lacks it in the other parts of the OS and apps. on the iPad you can highlight a word and get the option of the definition or the word to be read to you. unfortunately kindle does not offer this feature not even in its Silk browser.7- Sideloaded apps: This is not Amazon\u2019s fault but had to mention it. When you sideload an application the icon of the application looks blurry in the carousel. This has to do with the icon's resolution being not high enough as the apps we get from the Amazon store. Not a big deal but yea it is annoying.So as you can see the things I don\u2019t like are all software based and with the right update and tweaks Amazon can make this great tablet better. Among the things I don\u2019t like I specially find No.1 and No.5 the most that goes in my wish list of being addressed sooner than later.This device is really good. it has so many other good features like the Mayday, Freetime etc but I personally won\u2019t be using them.I also hope Amazon work with Google in future to offer Google apps like Youtube etc on their store. I know there are alternatives but to get the official app is always  better.I find the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX with its ultra HD resolution and great text to speech voices to be THE TABLET any reader should get. You cannot go wrong with it. I prefer it over the iPad Air or mini for reading books. The HDX along with the Paperwhite are winners all the way if reading is the main purpose. I would give The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 a 4 out of 5. with the right updates that rating should go up. I will update this review in the future the more I use the tablet.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "4G thru AT&T;?

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!HOW IT FARES WITH COMPETITION:The screen size is a bit odd at 8.9\". Every hardware manufacturer seems to have a pet with different sizes.  Three things about the Kindle HDX that are outstanding are  the screen resolution, resolution, and resolution. Stunning is the word to describe it.  HDX  is what Amazon calls beyond HD screen resolution. Sound is also awesome with Dolby Digital Plus audio+dual stereo speaker+microphone. I like the fact that Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" has a standing Leather Origami case aided with camera assist. Sliding the case triggers camera app.I have seen screens of all the tablets I have spec above and HDX 8.9\" color, contrast, vivid nature of screens definitely outperforms all. This is mainly because of the LCD technology used by Kindle surprisingly beating out  even iPAD air. This has been verified by lot of gadget blogs in gory technical details. Google Nexus model currently in the market is an aging technology (yes, 1 year lot of new things happen in technology).Fire OS 3.0 on Kindle HDX is tightly integrated with cloud, has enterprise software. Fire OS 3.0 is Amazon's forked Android operating system.  It is extremely media centric and cannot be compared to iOS and Android. I feel it is comparing apples and oranges. If you are a media hound, get Kindle HDX. You will not be disappointed. If you are someone who likes to root, hack the OS, develop apps, get the Android. If all you care if design and are immersed in iTunes you know what to get.GENERAL TAKEAWAY:Excellent for browsing/reading emails/reading books. Solid Amazon media devices, this is not a Android tablet. Lot of my friends are confused and have vastly different expectations of Fire HD or HDX.  One thing do bear is mind, Kindle Fire devices are NOT Android devices. Amazon has changed the core of Android front end so that it is significantly different. As long as you understand it and have that in mind, you are good to go. For a large number of people in the world, this does not matter. The UI for example is centered on Amazon experience - books/music/video you have purchased on Amazon. If you live breathe Amazon like me these days, Kindle Fire HDX is plain awesomeness.SCREEN RESOLUTION:Just awesome. Period.SPEED:No issues, I streamed a movie in HD, no stuttering, no stops. It was a smooth experience. The quad-core processor should definitely help. Played few video games, not much heat/issues noticed.MEMORY:On the RAM front 2GB is plenty, no complaints.  However, having no SD card is a bummer for many of the vendors. Apple/Amazon/Google all of them don't have microSD card slot. Can you see a trend. All of them are cloud providers (iTunes/Amazon ecosystem/Google ecosystem) and they will each benefit if you buy books/music/video from them and not bring your own collection onto an SD card. In this respect Samsung is great as you can have multiple microSD cards ($50 for 64 GB) and use it as you wish.EASE OF USE:Very easy to use. It's a Amazon media device. Some people call it a Sears catalog for 21st century. Whatever, the gorgeous hardware makes it easy to consume media. It is a media consumption device. For amazon lovers this is just breathtaking - the interface and the User Experience. Books/Music/Video/E-Commerce absolutely just suits.APPLICATION ECOSYSTEM:Again bear in mind, this has Amazon app store, not Google Play store. What this means to you. Most of Google services apps will be missing-- Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Google Earth, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Translate. Amazon has its own browser/email apps. For someone who has not purchased a tablet before, this is a great start. If you are used to an Android device for several years, this may send you a shock ripple through your spine. So beware of these limitations. Few other missing things obviously include Google Now and Google voice based Navigation (GPS is absent in wifi model, so this is obviously moot, but in cellular models this applies).  Amazon app store has most of prominent apps, so this is not a `big' concern.If you have bought apps in Google Play store, you have to buy them again in Amazon ecosystem - their appstore. All updates takes longer in Amazon to roll out than in Google playstore. Again these may not matter to a general public. People have debated if the absence of Google Playstore is due to Amazon's policy or google's policy of unbranded device. In either case, I feel customers are at a loss.BATTERY:I have not used extensively, so cannot comment. In my several hours of use, I did not find any major issue. Will report as I test for few weeks.USEFULNESS:Very useful if you are in the Amazon ecosystem. It is really lightweight and it is a great strength. Handholding books is not that painful anymore. Watching Prime videos on long road trips is a big plus. The resolution and text is awesome for reading books. It almost feels in a surreal way that the books are more real than a hardcover. X-Ray provides more detailed contextual information for books/music/video. I don't use it that much as I like not to be distracted. Mayday help is also something I have not needed yet. This is mainly meant for new people and it will be definitely a hit with first timers.  Overall I give the Kindle HDX a definite recommend if you are on the Amazon ecosystem.Do ask me questions, I love to answer questions from readers of the review.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Fire 8.9 HDX exceeded my expectations and equals or beats the Ipad Air in many respects at a cheaper price! Love it Amazon", "Author": "burghboy", "ReviewID": "R9C5FFLFAGFF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally do not post reviews as most of the time I am not that impressed with a product to take the time to write about it in detail.  This is the exception The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. I have had all of the previous versions of the kindle fires and thought they were good for movies, books, shopping at Amazon & music along with a few apps that were popular, but they lacked the hardware/spec/polish to be a great internet browser and tablet overall.  I have used the Ipad 1 & 2 in the past and even those older versions surfed the net better than the previous Kindle Fires most of the time.  With the addition of all the apps for Ipads and the straight android market it was tough for the older Fires to compete directly as a top quality tablet.  I never bothered in the past to side load apps as I figured it was difficult and a bother and back then I was just using all the apps I needed on my Samsung Galaxy 3 from the android market.  (More on Side loading apps later on the Fire)NOW...the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 changes everything that I did not like.  I was able to purchase it at Staples with a $50 off coupon and for $329 I received the 16 gb version that now  come with a charging kit.  The old ones did not.  That is a difference of $170 compared to an $499 Ipad Air 16GB.  Even at $379 it is still a saving of $120.First impression was WoW the amazing light weight of the new tablet...Awesome!  Next the screen is amazing.  When I say that, I mean the best I have ever seen on any tablet including the new IPAD Air (more on that direct comparison later).  I was hoping that these 2 improvements would not be the only thing that was upgraded as the software, apps and processor needed to be drastically improved to compete with the other new tablets coming out.The great news is that the silk browser is much improved as well as the whole operating system.Fire HDX 8.9 vs the Ipad Air I tested the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 against my friends new Ipad Air in surfing the internet 1st. Side by Side i would go to various sites on both tablets to see if there was a big difference in speed.  They were both going over wifi and to my surprise the speed was basically the same (really good). Sometimes the kindle was slightly faster and sometime the Ipad was, but it was so negligible in most cases that I would not even notice it if not comparing them side by side.  The great news to me was that the New Kindle was equal to the new Ipad Air in surfing the net which in the past it was not!My next comparison was to look at the screens while surfing and also watching movies.  The Kindle Fire screen was indeed brighter and clearer in both movies and web sites in almost all cases.  The Kindle Fire's screen is slightly smaller, but for watching movies in HD horizontally they were the same size on both devices because the Ipad has the black bars that limit it on I am assuming HD formatted movies. (I could be wrong in that maybe it is not always the case with the formatting).  The Kindle Fire's coloring, brightness and clarity in side by side streaming movies with the Air was just plain and simple better.  In darker scenes you could clearly make out details on the fire that I could not on the the Air. The Fire's screen looked brighter and clear with great colors that just stood out! I tried several scenes in 2 different movies and the result was always in favor of the Kindle Fire.  I was shocked at the advantage as it was quite a bit better. (the Air has a good screen, just not as good as the new fires!)  Also the Kindle with a Prime Membership lets you download some movies/tv shows for viewing offline later.  It is not all movies/tv shows but there is enough for now to keep you occupied for several trips and hopefully they will continue to add more in the future. They let you chose the standard size or 720 or 1080 but each step up takes up more room on your tablet and takes longer to download.  I have also heard that some have time limits as to how long you can have them downloaded but I have not yet experienced that with the shows I have downloads. (one negative is they do not tell you which movies are downloadable??? So you have no way of knowing until you click on it. Hopefully they will add that to the search option in the future in Prime)  I just also want to mention IMDb for movies is something I thought I wouldn't use much, but I am really starting to like it. It tells you all about any actors on screen and also add's trivia about the movie or scene.  It makes me want to rewatch older classic movies just to learn more about them!Ok, so far the Fire is lighter in weight, with a better screen and the speed when surfing the net was equal!  I am really impressed so far.  Now comes the area that bothered me in the past and almost had me going for an Ipad Air..lack of Apps in the closed off Amazon market.  Now do not get me wrong Amazon has a ton of popular Apps that I am guessing would satisfy 75% of the people who would consider buying a Kindle Fire in the 1st place.  They have all the popular games and apps that most people use.  But they also do not have some that Google and Apple do provide.  For example Amazon had my CBS sports fantasy Football app, but did not have ESPN's fantasy football app. along with Direct TV Sunday ticket! This drove me crazy as I wanted both on my new amazing Fire screen!  So I decided to try to side-load these into the Kindle and they worked! I will not go into that process, but It was relatively easy to do in just a few steps.  This process gives me access to most/all of the android apps!!!  This is a great way to get all the apps you might not find in the amazon Apps store.  I will always use Amazon apps 1st (since they approve them), but then sideload ones they do not have in their store.  This really solves one of the biggest complaints you will hear about the Kindle Fire from techie/experts!  It may take a little work at first to figure out how to sideload the apps, but once you do it is a pretty simple task.Lastly, I just received the OS update 3.1 for the fire and it added Goodreads and also Collections to the Fire.  It added more improvements but I did not have a chance to use the others to this point.  Goodreads is great if you like reading and seeing what others recommend or are reading!  Collections lets you add Books or Apps into Groups which makes it much easier to find things on your tablet.  The apps collections can go right on the Home Screen of the Kindle which is a nice touch that other tablets already maybe have (apple?).  There are other improvements that I will try to come back and update at a later time when I have a chance to use them.In summarizing the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9- It has surpassed my expectations period.  I find it can go side by side with the new Ipad Air in almost every respect and even beat it in screen quality, weight and price $170 less!!!!  You can almost buy the smaller HDX 7inch for that if you catch a sale.  I cannot recommend the 8.9 enough as I am for the 1st time really impressed with the whole package.  It can do everything well and has the screen, processor, OS and price that puts it ahead or at least equal to the new IPAD air.  Amazon with Prime & the HDX 8.9 is a killer combination of great Hardware/Software/2 day free shipping/Apps/Games and finally Great Amazon Support!  The Mayday Button (Help) is amazing. I am pretty good at using technology and I used it a few times to help change a few settings on the tablet instead of searching  for the settings.  The customer service rep. was online in a video box on my table in 20 seconds and help me find the settings quickly.  Another amazing aspect of this tablet is that it is great for novices as well as people who like technology and want to try to sideload apps for example.  I just do not see anything on the market at this price with this many great and unique features that comes close to comparing to the HDX 8.9 Fire.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade, Very Impressed", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R2YH4OGPQMVU3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon definitely seemed to try and exude a more premium vibe this year. I think they got a lot of feedback since last year's HD which came in a black box marked Kindle Fire with a pull tab. This time they actually delivered a retail box complete with charger so you got some amount of unboxing pleasure. It did appear as if the tablet was shipped in sleep mode since the first thing I did was attach an Origami case and it woke it up with 4% battery left. Like always it comes pre logged in with your account which is that nice little touch so you're almost able to just run with it. I say almost because you need to get software update first which is pretty par the course for electronics these days.The first thing that you notice when pulling it out of the box is how crazy light it is. Feels much closer in weight to a 7\" than to the 10\" tablets, in fact last year's iPad feels like a tank now. The next thing that was immediately noticeable was the touch response. Note I'm talking about that few millisecond lag between pressing the screen and something happening. Not everyone seems to notice but it's always been an issue with Android that this was a bit long, the HDX doesn't exhibit this and I'm fairly sure this is a software change not just the hardware but either way it just feels really good and really fast. The was especially noticeable on the keyboard. There are no hiccups with the way Fire OS and the SoC handle the UI which coming off N7, Fire HD and older iPads it feels good.The screen is obnoxious. It's probably the best screen on anything really. Realistically the resolution bump isn't noticeable but the color, contrast and brightness sure are. I'm very happy they put a lot of effort into those aspects because it makes it a very well rounded display, it excels at everything. The speakers seem to be the same as the ones in the HD, that is to say the best tablet speakers around. The main difference is they got moved to the top so you don't obstruct them with your grip. Which leads me to another point which is that this tablet really wants to be used in a specific orientation. The camera is the only real indicator so it's easy to mess up, but unlike the KFHD which could be held however the back buttons demand landscape or you can't find them. They are mighty comfortable because you don't have to change your grip to use them when you get there but if you use it in portrait like I like to the volume buttons can be hard to track down. Sleep/wake is solved by getting a case because I immediately attached one and never have had to physically press that button even once.The Fire OS UI has changed a little bit. It still looks the same but things have been tweaked. If you are one of those who hates the carousel you can swipe up to get a grid view (the most recent 10 items are always shown at the bottom). There are more categories of things across the top as games and apps got separated and the recommendations are much smaller (you can still turn those off in settings). There is also a multitasking view if you swipe up from the button bar that is smart enough to multitask between books and media in addition to apps. FireOS 2 had little things that were missing that could make navigation a pain but this version stands on it's own in terms of features and doesn't feel lacking compared to stock Android.I first downloaded all my previous apps from my old KFHD. These are easily accessible from the app menu, you don't even need to visit the store, just go the cloud tab and you have a list of everything you own and just tap on things to download. The rest of my media is mostly in the cloud to save space but the process to download is just as easy. The one thing I had to re-create was my browser settings, those don't seem to cloud-sync. My old HD had a few sideloaded apps that I needed, so the first step was to go to settings and allow installing of 3rd party apps. Then I could go to dropbox.com and get dropbox (because for whatever reason it's not in the store proper), and I also grabbed a few of the latest Google APKs off the web. Installing is simply a matter of downloading the APK and tapping it (no PC required). I couldn't get certain login features to work even with the GoogleLoginService APK but the apps work and I don't need to be logged into to Youtube/Google maps so I didn't bother trying to fix that.Last time I loaded Chrome and Gmail. FireOS 2 had a lousy mail app and the preinstalled Silk kinda sucked (it got an update later than vastly improved it). They've done a lot of work since then to the point where sideloading other things feels unnecessary (I still use Chrome for testing at work but I wouldn't have bothered otherwise). The mail app is basic but does everything I want (read threaded emails and write them). Silk especially has come a long way, this version is branched off Chromium version 25 so while it's missing a few experimental web APIs (Google's WebRTC work) it works with pretty all the latest standards (WebGL included). It also now tells you when it grabbed an accelerated version of a page. Latest Chrome benches better but Silk on an HDX is still faster than Chrome on pretty much any other device.This one also features a rear camera. It's an appreciable 8MP with flash, probably won't replace your smartphone but for a tablet it's actually pretty good. It does better than my 5th gen iPod Touch so if you really need a camera it'll do in a pinch. It has all the normal features you expect, touch-focus, HDR, panorama modes and 1080p video. The camera app is surprisingly good, it comes with a myriad of quick edit features, filters, touchups, stickers, drawing tools, and even a meme-maker. I was expecting a lot less but they put a surprising amount of work into this.Some may be annoyed to learn that this model doesn't feature HDMI out. I wish they kept it because it's cheap and works with everything but Miracast is certainly a better overall option. I got a Netgear push2TV which is the only device specifically cited to work with the HDX right this moment. It's a little box that plugs in to a display via HDMI and uses a USB power source. It's pretty simply but I needed to update the firmware first (otherwise the HDX wouldn't recognize it) which involves downloading firmware from the website, having it create a temporary network and then uploading the file to it. I did this all on the tablet just for proof that you could since that would be a no-no on iOS but Android is pretty flexible and FireOS doesn't take that away. Once that was done I needed to go into setting and set up display mirroring. It's strangely hidden but it was very easy to do once I had my box updated. The output was pretty high quality with about a half second of lag. Note that it seems to squish the 2560x1600 into a 1080p which pillar boxes it and scales it down (even on my 2560x1600 display). I think that's a Miracast limitation or a limitation of the box itself but I think it would probably do the same thing over HDMI. The box was a bit pricey, about $55 and it needs 2 cable but I think as long as Miracast gains traction these should become smaller cheaper dongles that are powered via HDMI. In any case that's what's available right now but it's much more convenient that cables it's just a pity your forced into it for video out. Apparently they'll also have a second-screen app for Playstation consoles that works like a Chromecast as part of Fire OS 3.1 but that's not available yet.The last interesting thing is the Origami case. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not at first but now I definitely do. To be perfectly honest, it has a learning curve. It's very cleverly designed, it can fold into 2 different positions to hold the tablet horizontal or vertical and attaches magnetically. The nice part is is also magnetizes to itself in the folded position which makes it extremely stable compared to other tablet cases but you need to practice a bit to get the folds right because it isn't obvious at first. The Kindle also attaches magnetically which makes detaching it really easy unlike the smart cover for the HDX. This is good because it's a bit heavy and you may not always want it on. Since it folds it's not rigid like the HD's cover so you have to peel it back instead of open it like a book. When you hold it, the magnetic cover swings around and attaches to the back of itself which helpful except one glaring design flaw: it covers the back buttons meaning you have to lift it up to use the volume buttons (sleep/wake is handled by the magnetic attach points so it doesn't matter). Also when vertical you can only use it rotated right as the USB cord will obstruct in left rotation position. The final nifty little thing is you can push the HDX up in the case. This is because the camera isn't exposed but when you push it up it clicks into a position and this automatically launches the camera app no matter what you where doing, though sometimes is can take a couple seconds depending on if the app was hibernated. I really like this feature and really wish more things incorporated a quick camera feature like it. It just makes it that much easier to capture something in the moment. So it has some highs and some lows but I definitely recommend it, it's just a lot to take in for what you'd expect was a simply case. It did set me back $55 for a black, polyurethane though with an even more expensive leather one above that.After messing around with it for a whole day I was barely breaking 80% on the battery meter. At the current rate it will likely fall around the 10-12 hours Amazon advertises. Apparently when reading that number can jump to 18 but I'm not much of a tablet reader so I probably won't test that. The initial charge took maybe 3-4 hours to go from 4% to 100%.If you thought Amazon was just putting out cheap tablets I'd encourage you to take another look as this is a whole different beast that the KFHD (which itself was a massive step from the original). If the Kindle was a cheap tablet and the HD was a budget tablet with nice hardware this is very premium hardware that happens to be cheap. I was disappointed that they raised the price $80 but they definitely made that $80 go a long way. Spec-wise it's an iPad killer but it's still a lot cheaper which is what I like about it. I'll admit I don't really care much about tablet apps and games, I use my tablet for looking things up, reading email/social media, music, videos, web-surfing and web development. I also use Amazon a lot so this was really a no-brainer and if you're anything like me (a tech-slobbering deal-hunter who realizes the futility of convergence) I'd say it's a must-have. So I'm very happy with what they put out this year, it feels like a big step up from the HD.I gave it 4 because Amazon still has some catch-up to work on with their app store and basic apps.  I'd really like to see speech-to-text options as well as better syncing of browser options . I'd really like to see better mapping software options since Amazon does have their own API but strangely don't use it themselves.  The HDX doesn't have a compass or GPS on the wifi version unlike the Nexus 7 and a myriad of other dirt cheap tablets which I think this is a huge oversight.  But the final thing is the lack of update support.  I was highly disappointed with the way the original and now HD have been treated as far as updates go.  If Bezos says we're not on the upgrade treadmill then please port some of those features back and give my old device new life.  At some point it's okay to move on but when your new HD has software features last-year's didn't and the internals on the 8.9 HD are still better that's highly problematic.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressed, and will probably only get better.", "Author": "Jeremy Roper \"perpetual student\"", "ReviewID": "R1TUUELO41U604", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've put about 12 hours of use into my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (with 64 GB and Wi-Fi only) at this point and am very satisfied. I've been interested in the Fire since launch but have held off because of lack of storage space (I want my music collection on it, which alone is over 30 gb, for one thing).I know there's been some irritation about it not being the same as Android. They never advertised it that way, and I think that shows a lack of effort to actually learn about the product before you spend hundreds of dollars on it. There are similarities to Android, but this OS is truly distinct. Amazon has always been geared toward media consumption, so it should come as no surprise that this is a media consumption device (I mean, really, that's what Kindles have been from the very beginning). It seems misguided to be bothered because of uninformed expectations. If you're looking for something other than media consumption, look elsewhere. But buying something like this without doing some research first? That doesn't make sense at all.I want to give this 4.5 stars, but that's unfortunately not an option, and it doesn't quite warrant 5 stars (yet, at least). I've used multiple Kindle devices and almost every Apple product, as well as Android phones and tablets and feel I have a pretty good foundation for comparison. The HDX 8.9 falls in a category of its own. Overall, I'm almost entirely pleased, and have only run into a few hiccups, mostly with the software. I'll explain the hiccups first to get those out of the way, then discuss what I love. Will update if necessary.***Not so great:- I got an error when it attempted to update during setup, and didn't think to do it right away (my fault). This may have prevented some of my problems, but not sure.- The software was a bit slow initially, which was disappointing because it's advertised as among the fastest of tablets (if not THE fastest). For example: App store, cloud music player (more on this later), adjusting settings, and viewing a PDF (the first I tried; the others were flawless). I was in the same room as my router, and I have reliably fast internet, so it's unlikely to be a Wi-Fi or connection issue.- The music player. I want all my music on the device, which is currently in the cloud so I tried downloading it. I couldn't find an apparent \"download all\" option, so I had to queue it artist by artist for about 10 GB before I went to bed. It was late and I didn't try Mayday, but I probably will when I get home. In addition, it was very slow and has frozen a couple of times when I try to load my music library, and ended up restarting. This may be an initial \"indexing\" thing, especially since I have a fairly large library. It took about 20 minutes to finally access what I had downloaded last night. Now, however, the problem is resolved. -- ***UPDATE on this in comments***- The App Store seems a bit cluttered.- The display flickered 3 times in the first 30 minutes, but never since.What I love:- The screen is phenomenal. It's fun to look at just because it's so pretty. No \"blue haze,\" so maybe they were able to address that before this model shipped. I've tried to see it but just can't. Touch response is excellent as well; sensitivity and accuracy are top-notch.- Processing speed is excellent, except for the few problems I initially experienced, which seem to be resolved.- The media bar along the top is great; unlike Android or iOS, I don't have to go search in the menu for the different content apps.- Sound is fantastic. I've never heard speakers on a tablet that even come close. It's better than a lot of laptops. Wired and bluetooth headphones have great sound as well.- Keyboard: this might be a weird one, but especially after discovering Swype I've been very disappointed with traditional touch keyboards. I was holding onto a faint hope that Swype would be available and am very pleased it is.- Wi-Fi speed is better than any mobile device I've used. Bluetooth seems to work without a hitch as well.- Cameras are clear and responsive. I hate the way my phones always take about 3 seconds to actually take the picture. Not an issue with the HDX 8.9.- Interface: I took a step back from what I was used to with Android, as I knew this wouldn't quite be the same. With that in mind, I am very pleased.- Prime Video works well and downloads relatively quickly. I'd like more selection but I also took the time to learn that they have a limited selection currently, which they're working on expanding.- Battery life appears to be as advertised. It's perfectly satisfactory, but after I run the battery down I'll update if necessary. Turn the Wi-Fi antenna off when you're not connected and it stretches a bit further. **UPDATE** - Finally ran the battery down from full charge to 15% after 12 hours of continuous use mixed between email, streaming video, web browsing, and LOTS of time downloading music from the cloud. Battery life impresses me well enough.- Integration with Prime features. I love that my Prime membership keeps going further and further beyond free 2-day shipping.- Little-to-no bloatware (depending on how you define it). I hate my android phones for this reason.- The price is incredible. I though a few times about an iPad Mini (w/ Retina) or iPad Air, but I could buy a decent new laptop for that price. Not looking to wipe out my savings for a tablet.Wish List/So-so features:- More customizability in settings. The collections option that they're supposed to roll out soon would be nice. I'd love an EQ adjustment in music and video as well - not all songs/videos/speakers/headphones are created equal.- Get rid of the matte finish on the back. Personal preference.- Not in love with the carousel home screen, though I may change my mind.- Smoother experience downloading music and videos - particularly music.- Better app selection. Most essentials are there, but hopefully this will expand.- I'm interested in the Second Screen feature. I can already play Amazon content on my TV, so hopefully this is something where I could send any content on the device to the screen. If not, I'll find it less than impressive.***I consider the iPad a media consumption device -- it grew out of the iPhone and iPod Touch, which sprang from the classic iPods, and they were all designed for media use. I think that's the HDX 8.9's closest competitor.  Aside from having more apps (not surprising if it was the first major device and has at least a three-year head start on the Fire) and being trendy from the start, I don't think the iPad has much of a leg up on the HDX. This device is faster and lighter, with an amazing display and a price substantially lower. Android was designed for more variable use, so go there if you want to do more work than play on your tablet. If I'm going to work much, I will do it on my laptop, which is really not much bigger.Altogether, I love my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It would be 5 stars if it weren't for a few bumps I've run into so far. But I expect it will only get better with a little time.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple Snob Converted: Great e-reader, battery life, audio, camera and more!", "Author": "Sherri Griffin", "ReviewID": "R2MSTFSL4HN2JS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a tech person so if you want a tech savvy review, just ignore me.Mission: I needed a good e-reader for textbooks and research, but I wanted more functions than just an e-reader could provide.Screen: I am an Apple Snob and I won't lie: I wanted an iPad mini. I'm heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, but I really needed a good e-reader and a good tablet for school. The iPad is a great tablet, but I kept seeing people saying that it wasn't a great e-reader. As an apple user, I can't deny that my eyes are always feeling strained while reading on my Macbook Air for long periods of time, so I started looking at other products. I'm really glad I went with the Kindle because is a big improvement for reading.Operating system: It is also extremely simple to operate and I haven't had any issues learning how to use the Kindle. In fact, it makes the apple IOS look extremely complicated-- which it isn't.Battery Life: It kills my Macbook Air. Destroys. Murders. Whatever adjective that means the Kindle's battery is way better. I can average 4-6 hours on my laptop off the charger, but the Kindle will last all day with mixed use.Size: I'm really glad that I went with the 8.9. It's bigger than the iPad mini, but I felt like the Kindle 7 would be too small. Even though I have small hands, the Kindle 8.9 is not too big and definitely not too heavy-- it's extremely light even with the (poetic) cover attached. I can easily hold it in one hand while reading. It's also a good size for watching movies and it's still perfect for playing games. The only downside is typing-- unless you have BIG hands or you like to peck--- use your computer!Reading: It has all the features of the Kindle e-books (highlighting, translation, search functionality, notes), but it is an LCD screen so it's not backlit like the paperwhite. However, my eyes seem to be fine with it especially with the abundant reading options. For instance, I was reading in the evening and as it got darker my eyes started to feel tired. I simply changed from a white to a black background and my eyes immediately felt better. Reading is SO MUCH BETTER than my Macbook Air. There are LOTS of books to choose from (including many free books)-- I've downloaded nearly two dozen books and I've only paid for 3 of them. Yay!Movies and Audio: No lag, excellent picture quality. Some people have said they haven't been able to get all the movies they've wanted to see, but I haven't ran into anything I can't watch... yet. There are a good selection of Prime videos you can watch for free and also cheap rentals. X-ray is pretty cool.The sound is EXCELLENT. Seriously, surprisingly good.Apps and Games: A lot of people seem to complain about the lack of apps, but everything I wanted was available and all but one of them were FREE. Granted, I do like a lot of the more popular apps (pinterest, facebook, evernote), so if you want something really specific then it may not be there. As for games, I got Angry Birds Rio for free and the response time is excellent. We also Real Racing 3 (Free) and the graphics were awesome and it was easy to play with no lag.Internet: The responsiveness to open pages is initially slower than my Macbook Air, but it isn't a huge difference. It seems to improve the more you visit the site. You have options to use different browsers: google, bing, and a few others. I'm a google addict so I didn't really look at anything else.Shopping: Strangely enough this is where I was disappointed. I was trying to find an e-book and I could get to the main shopping page which would show all the books in the series, but when I clicked on the book I wanted the page would just never load. The tablet did not freeze-- I could backspace out of the loading process. I restarted the Kindle, and I waited around, but this is still the case 24 hours later. I ended up buying the book on my computer and linked it to my kindle. This also happened when I was looking at movies-- it just kind of refuses to upload certain pages in the Kindle Store, but most have no problem.Camera: I never intend on using the camera, but I did just for you. It's surprisingly good. Definitely comparable to my iPhone with both the front and back cameras. It is no where near the level of my Lumix camera (thank good-- I spent too much money on it!), but it's definitely respectable.Mayday: Beats me. I haven't had to use it.I am really happy that I bough this instead of the iPad mini or Air and I saved myself a butt load of money.

What the heck is it? What's different between it and every other android-based tablet out there? Why should I buy it? Hopefully I can give you a less \u201ctechnical\u201d perspective on the differences between android tablets and the Kindle Fire HDX and why you would or wouldn\u2019t want to buy one! Let's cover the highlights:What is it?- It's a tablet...based off the android platform but running Amazon's proprietary firmware. What does that mean? It means you can run android apps but they have to be purchased through the amazon app store and not the Google play store (which isn't available on a Kindle Fire).Pros:- The screen is amazing, hands down the best I\u2019ve seen in a long time.- Battery life is decent, however standby time could be improved (a week at most).- Integration with the Amazon app store and Prime instant video was very seamless and easy to use.- The interface is surprisingly easy to navigate, although there are some inconsistencies (ie. the back button moving between apps) that could be improved with software updates.- Memory and CPU were actually quite spectacular and should provide enough horsepower to last you at least 4-5 years.- At 13.2oz it\u2019s incredibly light but yet still feels durable in your hands. The anti-slip coating on the back helps to ensure you don\u2019t accidentally drop it, although a protective case is still a good idea!- MAYDAY!!! Actually quite a cool feature. If you ever have trouble finding something, running something, or just need help using your HDX, Mayday connects you directly to an Amazon rep who can help.Cons:- No Google apps or Google features (only a problem if you\u2019re mobile world is heavily influenced by Google; pictures, contacts, etc)- Although very minor, the interface can provide some confusion on where things are located. Ie, \u201cHome\u201d, \u201cBack\u201d, \u201cSettings\u201d, etc.What's the difference between this and other android tablets?- The biggest thing...amazon controls the software, the updates, and the apps you can install. It's easiest to think of this as a tablet devoid of anything \"Google\" that loves to play in the realm of \u201cAmazon\u201d. This isn't really good or bad; it just depends on how you see it and what you're used to (keep reading).Google versus Amazon:- Originally when the Amazon app store launched you were hard-pressed to find all the apps found in the Google store. But, now that the Amazon app store has taken serious leaps forward you can pretty much find any app you\u2019re looking for. However, I strongly recommend that you look through the Amazon app store (Shop by Department -> Amazon App Store) FIRST to make sure any specific apps you\u2019re needing are there before you purchased a Kindle HD/HDX. You may have that one unique android app that\u2019s only available in the Google play store.- If you\u2019re use to the world of Google (Contacts, Apps, Photos, Syncing, etc) then a Kindle HDX may not be right for you\u2026if you want an Android tablet to complement your Android device collection (Phone, Tablet, etc). Having used Android phone since v1.1, I found that there were things I wasn\u2019t getting with the Kindle HDX that I would have wanted. Thing like \u201cAutomatic Contacts sync\u201d, \u201cPicture syncing\u201d, etc. Not that these are deal breakers, it just I would have preferred to have consistency between all my devices. However, Amazon does offer cloud backups for photos and contacts, however, if you have an Android phone before a kindle, you may find yourself frustrated with having to manage two separate contact lists and photo collections. All in all, if you\u2019re use to the Google way of handling things, using Amazon\u2019s apps may prove to be frustrating and monotonous.Summary:- All in all this is a beautiful tablet and completely different from the first Kindle Amazon created. While it harkens back to the Kindle days, it\u2019s best to look at this tablet as a complete redesign of the whole kindle \u201cexperience\u201d. While the lack of Google features (pictures, contacts, etc) can provide some headache, the seamless integration of Amazon\u2019s Video streaming, Lightning Deals, App Store, and Kindle apps makes it surprisingly simple and easy to use. At 13.2oz it\u2019s incredibly light but yet feels sturdy in your hands. Battery life is great considering the CPU and Video resolution and the quality and color of the screen certainly makes it one of the top \u201cMost Beautiful Screens to Look At\u201d. If you\u2019re use to Google\u2019s ways of handling things (pictures and contacts), the Kindle HDX will most likely be best suited as an E-book reader, occasional Prime Instant Video watcher, and large screen gaming device. If you\u2019re new to the Google world, making the transition to using Amazon\u2019s cloud-based apps probably won\u2019t be that difficult! Hands down, for a price tag of $379, the Kindle HDX 8.9\u201d is a beautiful tablet worth owning.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "updated -does not live up to the marketing hype.

I currently own 2 paperwhites (an original and the new one).I bought 2 Fire 8.9 HDXs, one 32 gig for my son, a 64 for me, ad free- wifi only and spent a small fortune to do so.The positives (5 star)- screen clarity is beyond awesome- responsiveness to touch excellent, weight non-existent, Mayday was very polite.The negatives- and they are big ones for me  (heavy digital user of magazines and newspapers)- so 1 star or less.1)  Amazon does not allow you to download ALL of your magazines to your device, only the current issue and ONE prior.  This is not disclosed, and in fact since an option in Manage Subscriptions is to download prior issues to any device on your account, NOT allowing it is highly misleading.  I spent an hour \"chatting\" with support and was told (basically) \"too bad\" then support from Mayday.  I have 27 subscriptions and have been purchasing digital content since the first Fire came out, then the iPad2 for the last two years (larger screen for older eyes).  Let me be clear- if anyone at Amazon is reading this-  I PURCHASED the content and it belongs to me.  I did not \"rent\" the right to view it at your convenience.  As far as I am concerned- digital issues are no different than paper issues which I would have kept on the bookshelf.  The nice lady at Mayday said that there is a \"server\" issue and that the cloud is always available.  Unfortunately, it is not always available for me (in Alaska), nor is it available in many rural places I travel.  Since I sold back my ipad 2 to amazon to defray the costs of this purchase, I now feel robbed of my content.2.  The lack of Google apps is a HUGE problem for my middle school son .  I thought I would be able to side-load the stuff he needs, but cannot.  His school requires access to google docs for collaborative projects, and we are frozen out.  Thank goodness we still have an old iPad 1.  If Amazon wants to push this as a student tablet, they need to find a way to play in the sandbox with google, period.The upshot-I am deeply frustrated with the potential of the Fire HDX, and HOPE Amazon fixes the issues so the ecosystem lives up to the hardware.  Until that happens, these are really just toys, and do not replace the iPad for functionality.So sad...UPDATE to 5 starsIn the month since my first post, I have Found work arounds for the google issue, not having my mags is still frustrating, but this tablet has become a go-to device for both work and home.

From a tech nerd.", "Author": "The King of Nothing", "ReviewID": "R1SYG9Y9PAZP76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, this isn't anywhere near my first tablet.  Nor, is it my first Fire.  I've modded, rooted, and sideloaded nearly every android thing I've owned, yet, I have no desire to do that with this iteration of the Fire.  There has been so much written about it, so a full review is excessive, but these are my quick thoughts.First, the hardware is as advertised.  Right now, it's simply the most powerful and beautiful tablet available.  It's fast and images are gorgeous.  Text has laser printer like clarity.  Movies look great, and the sound, wow.  The Dolby audio is something to hear.  No joke, on the first movie I watched on my new HDX, there was a bird in the background, and I honestly started looking around the room for it.  It is excellent.Seconds, the FireOS is actually pretty good!  I'm a fairly knowledgeable android ROM tinkerer, but I don't see any real problems with the FireOS, at least nothing that has me actively looking to fix it.  It's a pleasantly surprising modded Android experience.  Plus, there are some real benefits of keeping it stock and using your Prime membership.I owned the Fire 1.0 and sold it pretty quickly.  It felt weak and very restricted.  The HDX is the polar opposite, it's a beast, and I'm enjoying it very much.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful tablet!", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R23L7BXQOFIB6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my HDX 8.9\" on the day it was released and have been enjoying it since then. Here are some of my impressions that may help you decide whether or not to buy one for yourself.1. Very nice to hold. This tablet is amazingly lightweight and thin. The HDX weight is about 1/3 less than the iPad Air! It is quite thin, and in a very good way. The back is nicely rubberized for a good grip, unlike some cell phones that are too thin and slippery, so much so that they feel fragile and are difficult to manipulate without a good case. The HDX is very, very comfortable to hold and manage.2. AMAZING screen. The screen on the HDX is the best I've ever seen. \"Beyond HD\" is not an empty marketing phrase. This thing surprised me with its color, clarity, and brightness. It still reflects noticeably, though.3. Easy to navigate. I can quickly and easily switch among reading, watching videos, shopping, and more. I happen to like the carousel system, because it lets me return effortlessly to any of the last few things I looked at. With the instant response of the touchscreen of the HDX, I can find books faster than on my Paperwhite.4. App selection. Most of the apps I want are available for my HDX. Dropbox and almost anything Google, including YouTube, are what I miss the most. But YouTube works just fine on the Silk Browser. And there are plenty of news apps, games, alarm clocks, The most annoying aspect of apps for Fire is the prevalence of 3rd-party apps that do a poor imitation of the original. There are scads of apps that try to connect you with Google, YouTube, etc. but do so poorly.5. Seamlessly integrated with all things Amazon. I buy the vast majority of books and movies from Amazon, and my HDX provides an unbeatable way to enjoy them. I have come to prefer watching movies and reading books on my HDX over and above anything else I have, including a nice large HD television with sound bar and fancy ultrabook with >HD resolution. Plus, I can shop from my favorite retailer. The HDX makes it easy and enjoyable to watch movies and TV shows, read books, shop, listen to music, go through my email, catch up on the news, and more. Our family has owned the 1st and 3rd generation iPads and numerous smartphones including the latest iPhones. When you consider CONTENT, other tablets cannot match the ease and seamless integration of the HDX.6. Mayday. I've only used it once, but I was pleasantly surprised. I honestly was not expecting Mayday to live up to the hype Amazon is putting out there, but my experience was just like the commercials! Hardly any wait and a prompt answer to my question.  Amazing!You may have recognized in the past that great hardware is nothing without great software. Well, in 2013, you might say that great hardware and software are nothing without great content.

I am complexity immersed in the Amazon universe as a Prime member for the last 7-8 years (and customer long before that) all of my music is on the cloud player and a huge consumer of Kindle books and prime videos. Amazon makes it easy by offering more than competitive pricing including freebies and really low cost books, music and apps. You don't get that with iTunes and the App store.  I used to buy a lot from the Apple store but since I discovered how much more I always had to pay for everything I switched and haven't been back.This is my sixth Kindle starting with a Kindle 2, Kindle 3, original Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9. So the day the HDX's were announced I ordered the 8.9.  I am a gadget freak so in addition to the multiple computers I own, I also own a New Nexus 7, and an Asus Vivotab Smart. I have also played a bunch with various iPads.The good:I can honestly and truly say this is the fastest, smoothest most appealing tablet by far (in terms of hardware)that I have ever held in my had.  The screen is simply stunning, my Google Nexus 7 has a gorgeous screen and is the same resolution as the 7\" HDX.  but in spite of the similar dpi (326 vs 339) the screen on the HDX in my opinion is more vibrant, the colors just pop and at times it looks almost 3D.  One thing I haven't seen in any of the reviews is all that much about the sound. It is truly AMAZING sound for a tablet and frankly is better than my HP Envy with Beats Audio.  I watched Galaxy Quest on Thursday night.  It is one of my favorite movies is almost mesmerizing on this tablet.  I keep hearing about \"virtual surround\" on devices with two speakers.  I have never really experienced it.  But watching this movie I could hear Foley sound behind me!  Music is sharp and clear and not at all tinny like an iPad.  Web browsing is incredible, it is fast and smooth and easy to use. The enhancements to the interface and browser functionality work really well. I can honestly say this is the first tablet I have seen that I can really use as more than a casual browser.  I much prefer a PC most of the time but I am confident I can use this on the road.  With a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I have full function.  Screen sensitivity is excellent and the on board keyboard is terrific but for these older hands separate devices are needed for real work.  (which makes my \"ugly\" part even more frustrating.Mayday is as good as advertised.The Bad:I have found several apps that don't seem to work on this including Madden 2014 Football.  I am sure they will be fixed in a matter of days but it is an irritation because I want to play!Speaking of play, it is really irritating that Amazon and Google continue to have an impasse on allowing downloads from the Google Play store. It may be true that Android is so customized that many apps won't work properly.  But many do if you know how to side load which isn't true for most users.  But what it does do is give people a lot of ammunition to the \"The Kindle is just a machine for Amazon sales\" argument.  Virtually every review I see says the Kindle family is only useful for people that are married to Amazon already.  Virtually every time I am in a retail store like Best Buy that has Kindles and other tablets I hear the store personnel steering away from Kindle for that reason. It is a very short sided policy on the part of Amazon.  Yes you bind your already loyal customers more closely to you but a more open policy would sell far more tablets and bring in many more new customers. The relatively small amount of sales lost to Google Play would be way overcompensated by the number of new customers Amazon would gain.  And it would take away the biggest criticism of Kindle.  I know that Amazon is providing a lot of encouragement to developers to provide apps for the Kindle store. One of those developers should be Google!Make sure if you plan on using the new Amazon Prime movie download service that you get at least the 32 Gig. HDX and preferably the 64.  The average 2 hour movie in 1080p is almost 10 gig of space, which is roughly twice what it would be on a PC.The Ugly:Missing promised items like OfficeSuite? One of the reasons I was really excited was that an office suite was supposed to be available on this and available for the previous Kindle Fire devices I already own at a fee.  There are a number of \"Office\" apps in the store, most of which are mediocre at best.An \"office suite\"  includes at a minimum a word processor, some kind of spreadsheet and a presentation editor.  When I gave up searching and contacted Mayday I was told that no I wouldn't find an app but if I had a document on the device I could open it.  She couldn't tell me what file formats it would open, like if it would open spreadsheets or presentations.That is not considered an office suite, that is a document viewer.  I do not see any way to create documents or even edit existing documents. At this point all major tablet vendors bundle at least basic Office capability. MS Surface and other Windows tablets offer MS Office 2013,  Apple offers iWorks suite which appears to be really nice.  I am using QuickOffice on my Nexus 7 which is of course written by Google and free for Nexus devices and a part of Android 4.4 KitKat.  Not providing an office suite when everybody else is and then trying to promote your device as being work and business friendly is not a good thing.  Saying you have an office suite when all you have is a viewer is false advertising and frankly shakes my loyalty to Amazon badly.Update:Actually when I copy something over from my PC and open it there is an \"OfficeSuite\" that shows up long enough to view the item and now yes it does open docx, xlsx and pptx files in addition to pdf. And it does allow for at least some rudimentary editing.  From the icon and capabilities it appears to be OfficeSuite Viewer from Mobile Systems Inc. The same app is available for free on Google Play and the Amazon store for free.But there is NO ability to create new documents and the application does not appear as available anywhere on the Kindle.  The average user isn't going to know how to find the viewer the way you and I just did.  There is an OfficeSuite Pro that I was not prompted to download that costs $4.99.What is included does not in any way constitute an \"included Officesuite\" any way you would care to define it.I am not an average user.

Mayday is unbelievable!", "Author": "kdsm", "ReviewID": "RVW91PO437UBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for my wife. She already had a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD and was in love with it. She uses the oldone for reading books (works great),e-mail,and her jigsaw puzzles which she is fascinated with. She thought it couldn't get anybetter. I am a retired electronics guy and was blown away by the specifications of the new HDX with its fast quad core processorand its graphics coprocessor. I was particularly drawn to the MIRACAST capability that was mentioned. This is a wireless way tosend the screen content of the Kindle to a HDMI equipped T.V.There isn't much written about the MIRACAST feature, but I found out that NETGEAR makes a streaming video device called thePush2TV (PTV3000) which I also bought from Amazon at the same time. It arrived before the Kindle Fire HDX.I was so proud of myself for finding and downloading the \"firmware\" update for the Push2TV and I was ready for the Kindle to arrive. When the KIndle arrived it was cold from the outside and I decided to let it warm  to room temperature and wait for wifeyto come home from work.Wifey arrives and we began the process of trying to connect to the Push2TV device. I followed the directions to the letter that was a BIG mistake! I tapped the MAYDAY button (unbelievable genius that) and was connected to a very pleasant young ladywho knew less about \"mirroring\" than I did but she REALLY tried. Unfortunately that connection was cut off. I tapped the MAYDAYbutton again and was again connected to a pleasant lady who couldn't help me and was again disconnected. I think the disconnections were due to the fact that the MAYDAY operators took control of my Kindle and accidentally disconnected the WiFilink. I was getting frustrated at this point and I was also very disappointed, The mirroring was a big reason for my HDX purchase.I tapped the MAYDAY button for the third time (wifey says I'm stubborn, I prefer tenacious) and again spoke to a very pleasantyoung lady who could not have been any nicer. She and I could not resolve the problem either but she set me up to receive a call from an Amazon help operator. The call arrived within seconds and again I'm speaking to a really nice young lady (do you see a pattern here?). This lady's name was Charlie and she couldn't help me either but promised to research the problem andconnect me with an I.T. deity which I requested for after Thanksgiving because it was already after 10:00 p.m. my time.Here comes all the good stuff. Even though it was late, I was determined to make this thing work I'm retired and can work all night if I want to. I started at the beginning! This time I DIDN'T follow directions about pushing the button on the side of the Push2TV box! I did push the reset button with a paper clip on the Push2TV unit. I observed my T.V. screen and noticed that the versionnumber on my Push2TV was 2.4.3 this is really important! I did NOT need to upload new firmware.

Amazon's MAYDAY might kill Apple's IPad.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Admitted Technophile Reviews The HDX........Why You'll Love It.", "Author": "NicoleReviewsItAll \"I Heart Books\"", "ReviewID": "R28XH7WG103DXW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Revised **1/4/2014**(see below)First off in efforts of full disclosure, I own the previous generation of the Kindle Fire HD 7\" and I orginially purchased the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as well. I returned that one, because the bezel around the screen, invaded the screen to much to make the device prove useful when reading magazines, and for viewing some webpages.Also, I have owned pretty much every tablet made including, the ipad 1 & 2, Samsung Galaxy Tab (orginial), Kindle Fire HD 7\", Kindle Paperwhite, Microsoft Surface Pro, and most recently the Dell Venue Pro 8.I feel qualified to speak to the usability of this tablet in comparison to the others and in its own right. What I will not do in my review is review the technical aspects of the HDX, as you can read them on the product page.1. First Impressions:This device is solidly built, and it light as a feather. It is really a shame to put a case on this device as anything that makes this baby heavier is a shame. For the women out there that may be wondering, if you threw this in your handbag, your arm would not fall off, provided you have it stowed in a sleeve case or very light weight case. The speakers are placed at the top of the device and have a good output of sound at low and high volume. If you are using the device flat on a table it can muffle the sounds a bit.2. Screen:The screen is perfect. No blue haze, or abnoramalities whatsoever. The brightness of the screen is wonderful, and while I have not used the device outside, I have used it sitting near a window with the sun streaming in and I had no problems seeing the screen.3. Ecosystem (OS)It should not be a surprise to anyone that this device points to Amazon's ecosystem. People that knock this tablet for this seem to be off base. If you want a google tablet with no restictions, then buy a Nexus or some other type of tablet. Amazon is not going to build a table that points to another company ecosystem, anymore than Apple would allow you to interact with Google directly. Lowering the rating of the HDX for this reason is unwarranted.Using the Kindle OS is simple, and the onscreen hints help for first time users. If you are coming from a previous generation Kindle you should be able to navigate without much trouble with a few small differences. I also use Amazon's Cloud service for photos and docs, and you probably should also. Installing the Cloud Photo app on your cell phone will allow any picture you take to upload to the cloud and once you register your HDX, they will automatically populate. Such an awesome and thoughtful feature. The Cloud Doc feature works the same, install on your PC or Mac and any document you drag into the doc folder will automatically show up on your HDX4. Music Player:To my surprise, the HDX will show the lyrics to certain songs that have the Xray enabled. This is an awesome feature if you are someone that likes to know the words to songs, or if you are like me, a singer, and need to actually KNOW the lyrics to some songs. If you also have songs in Amazon's Cloud Music Player these will automatically populate on your Kindle when you register is, and if the lyrics are available they automatically show. You can also place your music directly on your Kindle via usb as well from your PC or MAC if you want.5. Kindle Book ReaderI read entire book on my HDX just to make sure that I did not have eye strain or any other issues before deciding to rate this tablet. Amazon for me has always been about books first and of course my HDX excels here as well. I read well into the night and all the next day with no eye fatigue, or issues.6. Video/Prime SubscriptionOk, people here are getting upset about the prime subscription. For the $79 bucks a year you get free 2 day shipping on most anything in the Amazon market place and a thousands of free movies, of which some are downloadable, 1 free book you can borrow each month, and now a free book that is new to the Kindle store to preview. That's a lot of stuff to consider, and yes there are improvements to be made, such as choosing a movie from the Prime Movies to Download category showed movies that I could not download along side the downloadable ones (so why the category?) but overall, its not a deal breaker. You have a month to decide either way.The videos are beautiful, with wonderful color and sound. Not much to say here. This was another expected point.7. ProductivityI wanted to see if the tablet could really function as quasi laptop for when I was out of the office and still needed to stay in touch with work. I added my Microsoft Exchange Account (along with my personal email accounts) and was surprised to see that my work email was able to sync easily along with my Exchange Calendar. All my contacts were added to the HDX as well. The true test came when I needed to open a spreadsheet emailed to me, which I was able to do. The HDX comes with a program that allows you to view office documents, to edit requires you to purchase the full version. I own my own business, so being out of the loop is never really an option, and I am always looking for devices to allow me some acces to work without carrying 3 or 4 different devices.8. PrintingI was able to print to my HP Laserjet printer, the HDX required me to download a HP Printer App, which allowed me to print an email just fine. You are supposed to be able to print emails and docs. I would like to be able to print from the Silk Browser as well, but I'm not sure that this device allows that. Maybe I'm wrong. Somebody please correct me if I am.9. Mayday Button:This may seem gimmicky, until you actually need help, which I did. I purchased another HDX for my husband, and while setting up his, all the books and music and newsstand items synced, but not the apps. Odd to say the least! I pushed the Mayday Button and within seconds I was connected to a nice lady who tried to help me, but was unable to fix my problem. She transfered me to another woman, who I could not see as she was with Kindle Second Level Support, but who I was able to speak to online. She needed to call me back becuause I had to reset the HDX, which she did right away, and helped me solve my issue. Which by the way was to deregister and then re-register the device and everything was able to sync perfectly.10. Magazine Reading:As I stated earlier reading a magazine on the 7\" HDX is just too small to see the pictures and text completely. The 8.9\" solves that problem, opening up a whole new world for me. I subscribe to several boating magazines, where there are a lot of pictures of beautiful boats that I want to see. Also, utilizing the 'reading view' allows you to pull the article you are reading into one cohesive reading screen. Great!11. BrowsingSilk is fast and easy to use. Not sure why people do not like it. Not much to say here.12. BluetoothI was able to pair the HDX to a Bose Speaker easily and an external keyboard within seconds. Again, not much to say here, bluetooth works as expected.In conclusion, I hoped I have answered any questions you may have from the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" I cannot really speak to gaming, as I do not use any gaming apps, but take it from somebody that loves trying out new tablet, this one is definately one I'd recommend to someone that loves to read, watch movies, read a few emails, and listen to their favorite music. This a consumption device, and all roads lead you to being able to read, watch, listen or browse easily and quickly.**Update 12/21/2013**I thought I'd update you on how my and my husband's experience has been with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.My husband has an Ipad2 which he uses daily. I have noticed that he uses the Kindle Fire a lot more everyday. I asked him about his experience and he told me that the Kindle Fire is much lighter and the screen resolution is better. The only thing that stops him for using it fully, it that he has some apps he paid for on the Ipad that he does not want to pay for again. He is a bit of a technophobe, and he has also found that navigating the Kindle is pretty easy.We also purchased the device with special offers and he really likes it. He likes getting the special deals on the lock screen, and even the recommendations from the Carousel.He is a big Netflix, Slingbox, HBOGO user, and he finds that the Kindle Fire handles all of these apps well.My experience is really surprising for me, as I find myself using my Kindle Fire HDX for work a lot more. I can easily look up information on our company website when I am away from my office, and even respond to emails easily. I am having a bit a trouble transferring documents to my Kindle via usb for some reason. PDFs and word docs transfer easily, but for some reason excel files will not. Not sure why I keep getting an error. Beware though, it does take a few minutes for docs transferred via usb to show up on the Kindle for some reason.Working with the docs with the Office Suite App is pretty easy too!Revision 1/4/2014There seems to be some problem with my Fire HDX hanging a lot. I am getting a message saying that I do not have a wireless connection, when clearly I have full bars. I have made sure there is no issue with my WI-FI - none of my other devices are losing a signal. The only fix is to disconnect from the network and reconnect and then I can continue with what I was doing.I also have had an issue playing videos. Both on Prime, and on the A&E; App. At first I thought it was the app, so I closed it an reopened, still was unable to play videos. Next I tried to watch a Amazon video and was unable to even pull up the first screen that pops up when you press video. I had to turn my Fire on and off before I was able to play any videos. I do not that sometimes these devices need to be turned off and on to 'clear' or reset them, but with these two issues, I'm getting a little concerned. The WI-FI issue is starting to be a hourly occurance. I am going to have to press Mayday to find out what is going on. I will have to lower my review by one star. This whole device is dependent on the wireless connection. If that does not work well, then it's just a nice looking paperweight.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Let's take a look....", "Author": "ND Mike \"rabid1\"", "ReviewID": "RB19URRPGZ104", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first. I have been one of the most outspoken people against Kindle tablets. The lack of hardware options and the proprietary interface always were a big minus to me. That is why writing this review is painful in soooo many ways.As a big supporter and developer for the lesser brand and generic tablets I have owned around 50 tablets in the last 3 years. I always look at hardware potential first, OS functionality second because that can be fixed. That is also why I decided to check out the Fire HDX 8.9. The hardware specs made it difficult to believe it can't deliver. It does indeed deliver.While benchmarks can often be misleading in real world application but they still give a good performance comparison and an idea of what to expect. In Quadrant it hits with a blazing 19,546 and in Antutu it jumps in at 31,765. To put this into perspective the Galaxy Note * get's about 18,000 in Antutu.The tablet is thin and light to the point of thinking I got an empty shell, but it still manages to feel solid. I have an Afunta 8 inch that while a little heavier still feels like it is going to break in your hands. As thin as the HDX is there is no flex to the case.When I booted the HDX the display is obviously the first thing I noticed. (OK the boot speed surprised me first) It is really crisp and bright and the colors are crisp. Even when set at the lowest brightness movies are still entirely watchable. The touchscreen itself is very responsive, a little sensitive so it took a a bit of getting used to. But having big fingers isn't the tablet fault.Both the N and A wifi are strong and solid. The 5GHZ connection is the best of the 3 tablets I have that use it. The 32GB HP Touchpad is the closest. I can hold -55dbm all the way out to the curb. With Netflix set to the highest quality it needs no refresh time when the movie starts.The speaker quality is easily the best I have experienced. Not just volume but actual sound quality.The rear camera with flash always sounds great. I have several tablets with this feature and up until I bought the Sero 7 Pro it has always been short of useless. The HDX exceeds the 7 Pro. The pictures taken with flash off the HDX look like they came off a camera, not a tablet with a camera on it.As for the things the HDX is missing. HDMI out, MicroSD, I can't knock off points for thing that you should know about before you buy. Lack of research on the part of the buyer isn't the manufacturers fault. Just like knocking a tablet for not having Google Play when it isn't a Google certified device.  You don't buy a chain saw to hammer nails do you?As for apps it is simple enough to side load apps onto the HDX.I really was planning on writing a scathing review thus justifying my dislike for proprietary tablets. But as a pure tablet the Kindle Fire HDX is amazing. There are tablets within the price point that may have more features, but none can do what the HDX does as well as the HDX. That goes for much more expensive tablets as well. Time will tell if there will be a lot of independent development on the HDX but I would guess the hardware will draw developers like candy draws a fat kid.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "one more", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "RLED3IV8E8HNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been buying kindles since the 1st generation, so I will leave the very wordy reviews to others and simply tell you, this is the fastest smoothest kindle so far.

The Kindle reset on it's own once or twice within a span of twenty minutes, but it eventually loaded after a few minutes. Then the device reset itself after I tried to start up a new app for my e-mail, it took 20 minutes with the Kindle resetting over and over before it came back on. I contacted customer service and I was told that my problem would have to be forwarded to the Kindle developers and I probably wouldn't hear back for a few business days.So far my Kindle is still running through the power cycle, over and over, but if I don't get this issue resolved and receive a new Kindle within the next week I will be demanding a refund.I did enjoy the high-def quality of the screen and how it played videos. I just wish Amazon got rid of all the bugs before putting stock into this new device. I also happened to order the Origami case and I am very happy with this accessory.I really hope this was a fluke and I happened to receive the one Kindle in the whole bunch that didn't work. I'll update my review if I happen to receive a new Kindle.UPDATE:Earlier this week I received a brand new replacement Kindle. Fortunately it seems that the first Kindle Fire HDX that I received just happened to be a, one in a million, defective device. I wanted to wait a few days before I reviewed this item for the second time. I did this so I could see if my new Kindle had the same problems as the old one and I wanted to be able to play with and try to experiment with all the bells and whistles.Display: The display is crisp and clear, with no blue bleeding around the border. This was a problem that some people reported, but that isn't the case with mine.Ease of Use: The Kindle Fire HDX is very simple and easy to use. I have yet to use the Mayday button, but the mere fact that it is there makes all the difference.Apps: There are a lot of apps available for the Kindle and I have downloaded most of the same games and apps that I use on my phone. There are a few apps that are not availble for the Kindle, but they are few and far between.Video: I have used my Amazon Prime membership to watch several free movies and tv shows on the Kindle and I am very impressed with the resolution and playback.Books: I really enjoy using the Kindle to read books. I was dead set against using an e-reader, but my growing hardback and paperback collection and the slowly dwindling space in which to put my books, has made me rethink purchasing a Kindle. I like how the kindle allows me to place bookmarks, toggle text size and most importantly the price of each Kindle version of books I read.The only real issue I had with Amazon, was how long it took them to send me a replacement.

Hohnstein \"Mugwump\"", "ReviewID": "R3EDRP3T5V2YXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lovely device! First thing I noticed was the weight -- rather, the \"lack of\" weight. I hoisted the HDX in one hand and my \"old\" Kindle Fire HD in the other, and it was the proverbial night-and-day moment. The fact it's slightly smaller and thinner as well is great, but holding it for a long time, say reading in bed, the older one made my arthritic hands carp and grumble every time. This one does not.Although I had specified the \"no-offers\" option in my order (which is what I got, let me add) all of a sudden last night at around 10:30 PM I suddenly started getting \"offers,\" much to my shock. However, that turned into an enjoyable experience: I got to test, firsthand, the new Mayday button. I spent perhaps five minutes chatting with a friendly girl named Deborah who, once she verified my claim, took over my Kindle and fixed my problem. This, admittedly, was not an earth-shaking concern, but I was very impressed with how easy it was to use this new service as well as its novelty. iPod, eat your heart out!Two small complaints, neither of which impel me to change my rating of the device from five to four stars: a few of the apps I BOUGHT for the Kindle Fire HD apparently will not work on the new one; and I miss the variety of \"wallpaper\" available on my earlier one, being left with this slightly odd copper and blue whatever-it-is that appears each time the Kindle opens. I would enjoy having the ability to change the wallpaper at will as I do other Android devices, such as my LG cell.Admittedly, I've used it for only a few days.

Made me feel good, barely a week after the order.I received the tablet, plugged it in, turned it on and it worked. A few things gave me a bit of a hard time to figure out, there was no written manual. But there is the 'mayday' button on the tablet. And it worked, just as promised.

I have installed and played a few games.I love the ability of the kindle to read books to me (even if I am not using an audiobook). I'm reading my favorite novel and I need to do dishes, so I can let the tablet read to me and do whatever it is I need to do. Also the instant lookup capabilities are wonderful. I'm bilingual German/English, I can have words (from my novel) translated into german or look the term up in a dictionary or even on Wikipedia - just by touching it on the screen.The cameras (front and back) are fun to play with and I managed to get a few pictures from my notoriously camera-shy dog - she didn't even realize that I was taking a pic of her. I have yet to play with the abilities of the machine to accept commands from the distance, haven't yet gotten around to it.I had no problems connecting Bluetooth devices or set it up for my home-wifi network. The machine doesn't lock up, it doesn't crash, the 2 or 3 things I had were my issues of not knowing and they were resolved by the help I received through the almost instant mayday button.The one thing that annoys me a bit (and I guess that's not the kindle but the amazon shopping page) is that I only can look for books by keywords, but not by let's say author and publishing years (or other more specific things). I receive too many results when I'm looking for something specific.

I received my tablet Thursday and finally have been able to play with it.  First off, this thing is light, very light, one hand light!.  I had the 1st and 2nd gen Kindle fires and this HDX is a delight to hold.  I have a Samsung 8.9 and is about the same size but the HDX still feels lighter.

And no stuttering when changing to different sites.  The sound is good, maybe not as loud as the hd, but I normally use earbuds anyway.  But even turned up all the way, there is no distortion.  I was able to down load drop box (able to access content), 1Mobile app, Hulu plus (plays fine), and some other favorites. I do find that their are some apps that have not been updated for the hdx but I assume all good things take time. So no worries. :-)I have opened books to read, NO blue or purple tint.

My first reaction when taking it out of the box was how light it is!  The next reaction is its thinness and form factor...you have to marvel at the feel of that thin body but it also seems sturdy (I did try to gently flex the body but it didn't flex).  Then I tried out the new power button which is a great improvement over the Kindle Fire HD 8.9...easy to locate (in spite of the fact it is on the back of the left side), in an intuitive location and easy to depress.  When the screen comes alive it is exceptionally sharp, colors are vibrant and even smaller text is easy to read.  After the set-up which was straight forward, I got to test the new faster processor and was pleasantly surprised...FAST and SMOOTH!  At this point I start rapidly going from one app to another app to calendar to email and the HDX stays with me without lag...this is the real deal!  Now to access the internet...very smooth.  Now I decide to stream a movie from my video library and again smooth and no lag, really good sound quality and...yes, that beautiful screen.  Ok, now for playing music from the cloud...I select a song, it starts playing and the words to the song are displayed as the song progresses which falls into the neat factor category.  I then had a question, looked at the built in manual which didn't provide the answer so I tried out Mayday.  Just as advertised I had tech support on the screen within 15 seconds and after a short explanation of my question the tech talked me through the solution...even taking over the screen for a moment to show me something.  Amazon is on to something with this Mayday...you do not have to experience frustration if you bump up against an issue you can't quickly resolve on your own.  The tech support is friendly, empathetic and anxious to solve your issue...and it happens almost instantly.  For non-technical people this is a particularly wonderful benefit of owning an HDX!!  Amazon's competition should be worried about this feature of customer service.I am not yet sure what to make of Amazon's decision to not include an HDMI out which I used on my HD 8.9 and enjoyed a lot.  I have ordered a miracast compatible device for my tv and will see if that provides the same quality of mirroring that I got with an HDMI cable linked between my HD 8.9 and the tv.  More to be revealed.UPDATE ON MIRACAST DEVICE:  I received the Netgear Push2TV miracast device and after hooking it up to the tv (without firmware update) and connecting the Kindle Fire HDX for mirroring mode, the mirroring was excellent!  Movies streamed from my Library on the Amazon cloud to the Kindle Fire mirrored to the tv without any latency.  Everything else including web surfing, display of photos (either on device or on the cloud), music, etc. mirrored flawlessly.  I attempted the firmware update but ultimately had to call Netgear tech support due to very poor instructions that come with that product(I will deal with that in a review of that product).  So, Amazon's decision to not include an HDMI out is justified based on my experience with mirroring.So, my early reaction to the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is that it is very light, thinnnn and very responsive.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broke after 48 hours", "Author": "Peter R. Forshay", "ReviewID": "R1U1KZ64TCAB2T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" became unresponsive while trying to delete videos.  It then shut itself off and won't turn back on.  Amazon support tried one restart cycle (hold the power button for 20 sec, then press once more to turn on) and gave up.  Of course it is out of stock at the moment, so the replacement won't get here before leaving for Thanksgiving travel, which I specifically ordered it for.  Time for a refund I guess.It also might be worth noting there is no gmail app.  It's not a deal-breaker, but surprised me.UPDATE (Nov 20)Amazon reported more 8.9\" HDX in stock shortly after my initial support call.  They are currently rushing me a replacement to get here before I leave for vacation.  I'll update my rating if the replacement works.  One of the support emails I received also indicated they have been able to recreate the issue with deleting Prime videos and are working on a fix, for what it's worth.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hardware is 5 star, lack of play store access continues to kill this great device", "Author": "Illusionofcntrl", "ReviewID": "R1BEZHU26JHTSU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The HDX hardware is great. It's amazing to me the advancements in 12 months (seems like Moore's law is 4 x's faster with tablet tech) when comparing the HDX against the HD. Not only is the HDX much faster and lighter, it just feels better. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the HD, but the HDX is just much more refined. The HD now feels clunky in my hand (if that makes sense). The HDX is feather light, and well trimmed it fits better than the previous generation. Peformance, it's running a snapdragon 800 quad core processor it's fast. Noticeably faster than the previous generation HD. Graphics are as advertised. The device is top notch from a hardware and look and feel. The 8.9\" form factor can't be beat it is the right size for a tablet.The addition of the volume and power button on the back is a step in the right direction. The addition of the rear facing camera another positive (it takes great pics and vids and includes panorama). The custom Android OS Mojito 3.0 is smooth and well thought out.Overall, everything Amazon advertises about the device seems accurate. In my summation  it's flawed in only one way. However, this flaw will keep me from purchasing future Kindle fire devices. I would recommend making sure you are OK with this flawed approach before deciding to purchase. Much like the original Fire, the HD, and now the HDX does not allow access to the Play store. At first that might not seem like a big deal. Amazon has a decent app store with a fair amount of applications to chose from. However, if you like Youtube, Chrome browser, Battlefield 4 Commander, Gmail, and a host of other apps that many folks use daily you won't be able to get them easily. The worst part is that Amazon doesn't even give you the option to have access to the Play store (other tablet manufacturers do - Samsung). I'd be willing to void my warranty, or lose support for my device if they'd just give us the option of having access to the play store.Your options for getting the apps you want on your Kindle HD/HDX? You can side load. Which means getting the .apk from another device and loading it onto the Kindle. Using a couple of programs you can mostly side load fairly easily once you know how. It works but any updates to the application and you will have to complete the process again (if you want the most current version) and application are updated often. Your second options is to load an alternate app store like 1mobile. The risk of this is that you will increase your chance of downloading an app that includes malicious software. This can happen on the play store as well, but it is more likely to occur on alternative app stores.Strongly consider this weakness before purchasing. If I had play store option, I'd give the Kindle Fire HDX 5 stars. Without it, I can only give 3. If you want the applications that everyone uses, you need to look elsewhere because the HDX might have great hardware but without the applications you will be limited. It's a shame that Amazon has taken this approach.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Invincible! - Kindle Fire HDX Kills Thrive in Cold Blood", "Author": "Kaio", "ReviewID": "R1WDBBPUA7MK42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an early adopter of the Toshiba Thrive tablet, and after only 2 years, it started getting wonky; (random screen flickers and CPU hiccups.)  So hubby and I decided to splurge and upgrade to the new Kindle Fire HDX.  This is the one and only Kindle Fire review I'll write, because it's the one and only Kindle Fire we plan to use until it bites the dust, which hopefully won't be for awhile.  I'm not just reviewing the HDX for self gratification and vote collecting; I'm writing this because it's finally in my hot little paws, and I genuinely love this tablet.There's an old Native tradition of extinguishing all campfires and going dark, prior to igniting the New Fire.  It's a time for reflection and rebirth, and very much how it felt rebooting our tablet experience; going dark until our new Fire HDX arrived.  So we extinguished our Thrive, offered it up to the Amazon Trade-In gods, and applied the gift card bestowed upon us to our HDX purchase.  Embracing the stillness of our techno-blackout, we postulated the coming spark of a New Fire and reflected on what we really wanted in a tablet.  We're avid Amazon customers, and figured it's time to make the most of it, so we upgraded to Amazon Prime ahead of our eminent Kindle experience.  There always seems to be perks for Kindle users, and we wanted in.  We came to realize that much had changed with tablets these past two years since we had our Thrive, and felt confident in our decision to take the leap with an HDX.  Amazon has a solid reputation for innovation, so when our trusty Thrive stopped being so trustworthy, Kindle Fire HDX was the first, and only, tablet we considered.When the brave delivery warrior pulled his steed up to the curb, my anticipation was palpable; my coveted precious had finally arrived!  I'd visualized this moment for weeks:  my new HDX cradled atop a velour and golden tussled pillow, shrouded by sunbeams and halos, angelic harps crescendo as trumpeters announce the entrance of my coveted new gizmo -- or perhaps it was just in a plain brown shipping box; I can't recall.  My heart was all aflutter, and I was effervescent with excitement, so I might be romanticizing the moment a tad.  Either way, all hail HDX!Is it just me? But whenever I open a new piece of tech, I get all tingly inside; cracking the outer seal, opening the box, getting a waft of that new toy smell -- a blend of fresh circuit boards, and static-free factory environments.  Not a spec of dust to be found as you peel back the protective stickies to reveal that glistening new gizmo. I see why they call it \"Fire\" because it feels smokin' hot in my grabby little paws.  In some ways, it feels like Amazon actually read my Thrive review and the exhaustive comment section, because I see many wish-list improvements implemented into this new Fire I'm anxious to ignite.> AmazoidAmazon's tablets are hybrid Android OS. Coming off my Thrive with Android ICS, this was the one area I was most concerned about. Would I like Amazon's hybrid; or would I miss my standard Android OS?  When I told a friend we were getting an HDX, she was surprised, \"you're both such avid techies, and Kindle Fire seems to be less than a full-fledged tablet.\"  Our friend wondered if we'd miss having a true Android experience.  We had the same concerns, at first, but then started to wonder, what is a \"true\" Android experience anyway?  Different menus and a home screen? Pffft!Sure, Amazoid is a bit of an adjustment; it's completely idiot-proof and more closely mimics what little exposure I've had to Apple iOS, with the addition of carousels.  I'm still a bit concerned that Amazon's hybrid will be overly restrictive, compared to my Android experience, but so far, I like it.  Not having access to Google Play Apps may be the biggest adjustment, but I'm confident that I'll figure out an acceptable workaround, or just learn to live without.  Truthfully, I rarely visit Google Play anyway, and don't need access to endless dreck and borderline malware apps.  I already rent and buy all my movies and books here on Amazon, so other than possibly a few specialty apps, Google Play won't be missed.As far as the OS and my \"true\" experience with it, Android hasn't been around long enough for this to be a huge change for me.  An OS is like a tablecloth -- you need it to dress and protect the table, but hardly notice it once the meal arrives.  In reality, I do far less geek stuff with my tablets than I do with my laptops, so I think I'm good with the lateral OS shift. Even Windows 8 has made the lateral shift to a more homogenized OS experience, (though I far prefer Win 7,) and iOS is literally giving away the latest iteration of their Mac operating system.  So like it or not, the trends are clear: the all-mighty OS isn't the crown jewel it used to be; sure, it matters to share holders, but doesn't add up to much for rest of us.  It's about the gizmo, not the set dressing.  Homogenized operating systems are here to stay, and ultimately, it's a good thing.  And you can bank that future iterations of Android will follow these same trends.I'd say the differences between Amazoid and Android are negligible from a technical perspective; each has its advantages.  The biggest difference comes in the presentation and general user experience.  Fire is activity based, so the standard Android desktop has been streamlined to favor a more inviting and user friendly interface; clearly marked menus, pictorial carousels, all easy to follow and beckoning to be touched and explored.  Fire feels more like a consumer based experience, rather than a technological one.  Sure, Android is simple, but it still felt like I had the ability to do some computing, on some level.  But it also had its share of hiccups.  Whereas, Fire HDX, is a more controlled environment, centered around activities and experiences, yet with the versatility for productivity and business, and enough horsepower to please the nerdiest of geeks (like me, and the Big Bang clan.)  Fire's copy line, \"Designed to do it all\" pretty much covers it.  And I have to say, I'm quite impressed.> They Listened!The 'Zon actually cracked open the Suggestion Box!  Amazon reviews are a bit like trial by fire (coincidence?) in that, every flaw is magnified, and products live and die by customer commentary. From what I've witnessed in the exhaustive comments in my Thrive review, and read elsewhere about other tabs, Amazon seems to have actually paid attention to what's being said in our complaints and wish lists, and tried to address the most common issues. Fire HDX has clearly built upon it's multi-generation iterations; it's refined, elegant, very well thought out, and precisely executed.  This is the tablet I wanted in the first place. The only thing missing, is a replaceable battery, which would have been cool (hint-hint, Amazon) but likely unachievable given the sleek design.> Second ScreenI got the Thrive primarily for 2 reasons - ports, and a replaceable battery.  Turns out, I didn't use the ports nearly as much as I thought I would; the full size HDMI was just a pain, because I'd rather have wireless.  Enter Fire HDX -- Amazon made the genius move of adding what essentially adds up to wireless HDMI -- wish granted; thanks Amazon!  Second Screen can play movies or content from your Fire, directly on your HDTV, freeing up your tablet's screen to check email, fling some Angry Birds, or just control the video on your HDTV with Fire's play, pause, etc. controls.  Sweet!  I have an HTPC setup, so not sure how meaningful Second Screen will be for me in the long run, but I can't wait to really delve into it!  Definitely a high-end, trend-setting feature; Gold Standard, for sure.> MiracastSimilar but different to Second Screen. This feature wirelessly mirrors your Fire's screen on your HDTV. I liked doing this with my Thrive, but came to hate the HDMI cable tying me down. You haven't really experienced Angry Birds until you play it on a 50\" screen! We definitely will be looking for Miracast accessories.  Just a natural addition to my HTPC setup, and sure to be another Gold Standard option others will copy. Yet another indication that Amazon went all out with Fire HDX, and this geek is impressed.> Anorexically ThinOnly, in this case, that's a good thing.  Fire HDX is literally half the thickness of my Thrive, and half the weight too.  I loved the grabby feel of my Thrive, but over time, I admit it was awkward due to the thickness and weight; especially inside the case.  It was like carrying a textbook.  Fire HDX is thin, but doesn't feel like I'm holding a metal tray, or a techno exoskeleton. It's comfortable in the hands and feels solidly built.  And it's svelte silhouette makes it super easy to tuck away and take on the go.> Screen of Tech GodsThe Fire HDX screen is a nerd guru's dream, and anyone possessing the gift of sight will appreciate it's beauty and clarity. Stunningly vibrant, excellent viewing angles, dripping with saturation; I wish my HDTV had pictures this good.  The screen on this HDX is clearly the crown jewel of all it's impressive specs; it's just that good. Words simply don't do it justice.***Hey Amazon*** - How about making a 60\" Kindle HDTV with a stunning screen to rival my new HDX?? Goosebuuumps!!> 10.1\" vs. 8.9\" vs. 7\"I thought I might miss my Thrive's 10.1\" screen.  Truthfully, I hardly notice the transition to 8.9\".  The slightly smaller size helps make HDX lighter, thinner and easier to handle.  Plus the difference in screen quality is so stark, that I could care less that HDX is 1.2\" smaller than my old Thrive.  The 7\" HDX is just downright cute!  Hubby really loves it because he thinks it'd be easy to slip into his cargo pants pockets and take on the go. He may get one, but for now, we settled on the 8.9\", which has proven to be the absolute perfect size.> No Screen Protector RequiredI'm usually a big fan of those military engineered, 'helicopter blade' screen protectors.  However, I have NO plans to dilute or mar the beauty of this gorgeous HDX screen!  Much as I believe in screen protectors, in this instance, I liken it to keeping a posh leather sofa in plastic. This screen is far too nice not to enjoy it as it was meant to be seen. No way, no how, am I covering this beauty with a ten buck screen protector.  Besides, I trust my Origami Case to protect my HDX in style.  If a worthy screen protector presents itself, I might consider it; but for now, it's 'au naturel,' baby.> 16gb vs. 32gb vs. 64gbIf you want to make a budget friendly decision, this is the place to make it. I'm glad Amazon didn't bother making an 8gb tablet; utterly useless.  16gb is decent, but you will definitely have to keep an eye on your storage.  And keep in mind, storage tends to get wonky the closer it gets to full capacity; so be sure to leave yourself some room to spare.  64gb was tempting, especially if I start getting into downloading movies.  But personally, I sprung for the 32gb as it fit my budget and needs best.  I was only using 14gb on my old 32gb Thrive, so I knew 64gb was an indulgence, not a necessity.  And I'm not exactly conservative with what I'll load up on my tablet.  I delete apps I don't use, simply because I no longer want them, not because I need to conserve space.  And I already loaded my HDX with 5gb of Michael Jackson MP3s alone, so I'm not shy about taking advantage of the storage I've got.  Yes, I do own a 5gb waft of Amazon's Cloud storage, but I'm the kinda guy who doesn't want to put their faith in a solid internet connection being available at all times.  Hiccups happen.  I do use the Cloud for some stuff, but local files can be played anywhere, at any time, no hiccups, no data fees. The Cloud is good for storage and convenience, but when it comes to my most important and frequently used files, I want them stored locally for guaranteed access and privacy.*Even Better: Seagate Central 2gb Personal Cloud - access your files from anywhere in the world.  Works great!***Cloud Tip*** - Sure, the cloud is great for storage and convenience, but just don't be surprised when that \"breaking news\" hits about how these tech companies are reading all your documents and looking at all your \"private\" files.  It's been happening since the McCarthy era, at least; now with modern tech.  If I can track my own GPS location and activate my tablet or cell phone's cameras remotely, then I expect others to be able to do the same.  As we know, Amazon 'targets' all of us quite effectively, so it's hardly a big shocker to think others can do the same.  I expect no less, and am somewhat ok with it when people I trust are in charge, and not so thrilled when it's the other guys. If you wanna keep something private, then keep it off the Cloud and keep it to yourself.  It's that simple.> Great Dual CamerasHere's another area where Thrive just sucked over time. I didn't mind the lack of a flash at first, but it soon proved to be a real pain.  Conversely, the dual cams on my HDX take excellent quality pictures. The focus is great, and doesn't take long to zero in on the target.  And the dreaded delay most gadgets have after taking a pic is miniscule to nonexistent.  The LED flash is a HUGE Bonus!  I really came to miss that on my Thrive.  The menus and pic galleries are well laid out, and renderings are fast; just a pleasure to work with all around.***Privacy Tip*** - Keep tabs on what your front facing camera is doing!  My Thrive's front cam used to kick in all on its own, and the little LED would come on, alerting me that the camera was active. Either this was a tech glitch, a rogue app, outright nut-job, or Big Brother was watching every once in a while.  I ended up placing a sticker over the lens since I rarely used the front cam anyway, and didn't like the idea of being spied on by Edward Snowden, or the like. Haven't noticed anything like that with HDX, but I got my eye on it.  So, look sharp, people; that front facing camera may not always be your friend.> Wifi vs. 4g vs. TetheringIt all depends on your needs. 4g will have ongoing fees, and arguably, isn't needed with all the WiFi Hotspots popping up.  (Google is literally launching WiFi balloons into the atmosphere!)  Plus, I'm not fond of Verizon or AT&T.;  (More of a Sprint fan, particularly their budget offshoot, Boost Mobile.)  But if your budget is ok with the data fees, and your needs require it, then go for the 4g model. Just be aware, there are alternatives.Personally, WiFi is all I need. And HDX's dual band antenna really does work quite well; connections are great, with excellent range. However, I do occasionally need the convenience of a 4g data connection, but I do it so infrequently, that an outright data plan is just indulgent.  Besides, I already have a cell phone with unlimited data, and don't feel I should have to pay for that feature twice.  My solution?  I just got the LauncherPro App for my cell phone, found the hidden menu that enables tethering without rooting, and voila -- I can tether my HDX to my cheapo LG Marquee Boost Mobile phone wherever I want; all with unlimited data for $40 bucks a month.  (If you're curious on how to do the same, just poke around a little with LauncherPro on your Android phone; you'll figure it out.  Google search is your friend.)  Truthfully, I rarely tethered my Thrive, but I like knowing I have the capability if needed with this new HDX.  It's more cost effective than being saddled with outright 4g, and I'm not stuck choosing between 2 cell companies I don't like much.***Dear Amazon Gods*** - I've been a very good boy this year.  And I need a good pay-as-you go cell phone.  Kindle Mobile please?  If it's as well thought out and constructed as HDX, I'm in! And pretty please - don't price gouge us by charging extra for tethering.  Tablets are just oversized cell phones when it comes to how they process data.  So just let us tether for free, will ya?  Thanks; cookies and milk are on the table. Love, Kaio> Rooting - Don't Do It!I used to be a fan of it, now I'm not. Frankly, you're putting a lot of faith in the people who created the hacks (yes, \"rooting\" is just a euphemism for \"hacking.\")  Personally, I'd rather not trust complete strangers to imbed whatever hacks they've created into a tablet I use for banking. I'm just funny that way.  And since I figured out how to tether with my cell phone via the hidden menus, rooting became obsolete in my world.  Plus, the ROMs never offer all that that much really, and certainly not all the hackers claim; like improved battery life. It's more about driving website traffic to the host sites, and entertaining clever ROM gurus, rather than any tangible benefit, IMO.These guys are smart, no doubt about it -- that's what scares me.  I'm not interested in being some tech genius' beta tester, nor do I care to unleash their rogue code into my devices and willingly breach its security.  Chances are, it's all good and harmless ...probably ..maybe.  But for me, the slim benefits hardly merit the lingering doubt.  The few ROMs and hacks I've tried literally needed me to turn off my firewalls and security software just to work with them, because by definition, they are Trojans.  Sorry, but I'm just not that trusting anymore.  So, ixnay on the rooting for me, thanks much. Proceed at your own risk.Having said that, I would consider rooting if I end up hating the more restrictive Amazoid experience, or decide I just can't live without Google Play Apps.  But at this point, I seriously doubt I'll do it.  I just don't trust it.  Plus, I already know how to get the apps I want onto the HDX directly, including Google play, all without rooting, so I'm not worried.***No-Root Tip*** - I'm not going to advise anyone on how to tweak their HDX, so there's no need to ask.  But I will point ya'll in the right direction -- Google \"how to side-load apk's\" and you'll figure out the rest pretty easily on your own.  If that doesn't work, I'm 100% confident there's another workaround that doesn't require rooting.> Amazon Fresh AppSpeaking of apps, I consider it a privilege to live in an area where Amazon Fresh is available.  Ordering groceries and electronics from my HDX for same day delivery is pretty dreamy; we just LOVE it!  We've been getting grocery delivery, on and off, for years now, so the switch to Amazon Fresh fits our lives perfectly.  The app works great, and we love seeing all the new green trucks humming around town; cannot recommend this service highly enough -- go Amazon Fresh!***Tip - Other Must-Have Apps***-- WiFi Analyzer App - use this to test the WiFi signals around any of your WiFi environments.  Find the best sweet-spots for optimal connections.  If you're super adventurous, get a couple of High Gain Antennas for your router and watch your signal spike!  Just be sure to enable MAC filtering to keep any pesky neighbors from slipstreaming your network.-- Kaspersky One - Antivirus and Internet Security for 5 devices under one low-cost license; any combo of PC, tablets and phones, up to 5 devices.  The app itself can be loaded via a direct link from Kaspersky or the included QR code.-- Team Viewer - remotely control your PC with your tablet while away from home!  Easily transfer files from PC to PC, or even PC to MAC.  Works great. I've tried them all, and this one is still my fave overall. Can't wait to see HDX's iteration of this feature (coming soon!)And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming...> HDX Ergonomic AppealI love the way the volume and power buttons are placed; very natural and comfy to use.  This tablet was clearly designed to be held.  A lot of thought went into form following function, and how this tab naturally rests in my paws.  The weight is distributed well, and it just feels right to hold it; be it 1 or 2 handed.> Additional 2 Year WarrantyThis Verified Purchase would be your clue that I'm not just fishing for votes to up my reviewer rank; I'm a real HDX user, and this is my new day-to-day tablet for the foreseeable future.  I rarely buy extended warranties. I consider tech toys to be somewhat disposable, hence why I traded-in my Thrive as soon as I saw signs of age.  But Fire's extended warranty is actually worthwhile.  It covers accidental damage, and has free replacements shipped out prior to sending the damaged tablet back; replacements are probably refurbs, but still a nice touch.  The warranty also includes battery failure, screen cracks, and zero deductable. For 90 bucks, I'd say that's a good deal, so I sprung for it. Though, given my Thrive started to getting goofy at just 2 years old, I wish this warranty was for 3 years instead.  But I'll take it for the klutz factor, just in case.  (Check my review on the warranty product page if you're interested!)> Origami Case - The Cherry On TopIngenious! A true 'must-have' accessory. Love how it folds to accommodate multiple viewing positions. Love how it turns the HDX on and off automatically.  Love the feel, magnetic fit, and how the camera turns on automatically when you slide the tablet up.  At first, I wanted the polyurethane version, cuz I like the feel and SciFi look.  But I ended up going for the Blue Leather Origami Case because it just seemed classy.  An HDX without this origami case would just be incomplete. I love everything about this case and can't imagine owning the HDX without it.  Perhaps a tad overpriced, but that'll likely drop as HDX settles in.  More colors, please!> Cool SpeakersThe sound from HDX is surprisingly awesome. This is one area Thrive just sucked at, even with the Volume+ app.  But HDX is fantastic.  The custom Dolby really does enhance the fidelity, and I don't feel the need for any audio booster apps.  Naturally, if I wanna shake the house's foundation, I'll be using my home stereo.  But for tiny little speakers, I'd say HDX is as good as it gets. Plus, it's very cool how the origami case reflects the sound. Genius design. Amazon's really just showing off how clever they are with that one.  Kudos!> Where's My Charging Dock?I really liked the convenience of the dock for my Thrive and really thought I'd miss it.  But I'm guessing there will be plenty of goodies and accessories to buy for HDX. The good thing about standardization, like iPad, is that accessories are easier to come by. Same is true for Kindle. But I like the origami case so much, that I really see no need for the dock anymore. So I splurged the extra dough for the case, and have all but forgotten about my old charging dock.> USB Charging PortA universal USB charging port that works with most any standard charger?!?! What the!?  Give that genius a raise and a corner office!  HDX charges faster with the included charger, but nice to know I can use any USB charger handy, wherever I may be.***File Transfer Tip*** - I made a big to-do about wanting the convenience of USB ports to connect my Thrive to my laptops so I could easily transfer and backup files (too bad you couldn't charge via those ports.)  Newsflash - there's a whole bunch of apps out there that help you do direct file transfers to computers wirelessly (Astro File Manager and AirDroid are personal faves.)  Then there's DropBox and Amazon Cloud, so options are plentiful.  I'm a bigger fan of wireless than I am of wired, and have come to realize ports aren't as important as I first thought. Wireless HDMI, wireless file transfers between tablet and PC; Fire HDX is where it's at and I'm good to go!> Battery LifeThe truth of this one will be told over time, but for right now, I'm quite happy with it.  I'd say the 12 hour estimate is pretty close for me, though probably a bit less.  Screen brightness and data intensive apps will hit the battery hardest.  So naturally, I expect my battery life to fluctuate, depending on what I'm doing and how much luminosity I'm dripping from this gorgeous screen.  I just wish the battery was user replicable, but that likely wasn't possible with the ultra-thin body design.  Battery failure is truly is the one area I'm concerned about most; hence why I sprung for the extended warranty.> BluetoothI rarely use it on any of my devices. Just not a fan cuz I think it's one of the top causes of battery drain and OS abnormalities; faulty technology in IMO. But the signal seems fine. My array of stereo headphones sound good, paired smoothly, and stay connected, even from across the room.  But I expect these connections to get choppier outdoors; that's just how bluetooth is.  I predict (fingers crossed) the technology with soon be obsolete, in favor of something more reliable, with less power consumption.***Headset Tip*** - My fave stereo headphones, by far, is the Sony XBA-BT75. Killer sound and rich fidelity for such tiny bluetooth headphones; though nothing beats a thumping subwoofer that shakes the furniture.> Bang For Your BuckFire HDX has many cutting edge features that another nameless tablet would dole out once a year, and expect everyone shell out extra cash for each nominal upgrade. (P.T. Barnum fondly referred to people like this as \"suckers.\")  HDX is a trend-setting tablet, not a clone or follower.  This is the new Gold Standard, not a money pit.  If you're interested in what a tablet Does in the here and now, then get Fire HDX. If you're interested in owning a status symbol and being accepted by the cool kids, then, that circus is waiting for you.  I already graduated from high school and don't care to revisit that mentality.  Personally, I prefer substance over superficiality; I'm just funny that way.> Business ReadyCompared to HDX, the other Kindle Fires seem like toys. HDX 8.9, specifically, was clearly built for work AND play.  It comes preloaded with my fave OfficeSuite app for Word docs and all that good stuff.  And the specs under the hood are just unmatched.  Miracast and Second Screen would be invaluable in a meeting or presentation. And don't forget TeamViewer for accessing your work computer from anywhere in the world.> Powerhouse IndeedyI've never heard anyone complain that their computer is too fast.  Why buy such a powerhouse tablet? Because everyone, and I mean everyone, wants smooth, snappy and fast tech.  Unless your budget truly does not permit it, don't talk yourself into believing \"I don't really need that for what I do.\"  Remember those words, and live by them, every time your computer or tablet hangs or hiccups.  Don't be the idiot who buys an $80 buck budget tab, and then complains that it doesn't work like iPad.  HDX is the perfect blend of budget and power.  There's just no reason to choose a sub-par gizmo.  The difference in price is nominal, the difference in performance is stark.  The quad core 2gb processor in HDX is an utter beast. It makes my dual core, 1gb Thrive seem like a sloth.  Remote Viewing apps are fast and smooth, as do games, videos, and all processor intensive apps I personally like.> External KeyboardsI'm really not a fan of them for tablets; probably because I hate glitchy bluetooth; invariably, keystrokes are frequently missed.  Besides, I like to touch my tab, even while typing. I do have a keyboard just in case though, and do use it once in awhile. But generally, I just don't see them as necessary for tablets. It just makes things awkward.  I've tried several, and this Logitech Tablet Keyboard is my fave.> MaydayA foolproof brain-fart button that connects you to Amazon Tech Support within 15 seconds. Yup, I tried it, and it works. So glad they couldn't see me in my undies ...I hope -- Eeek!  Another cutting edge, genius feature, sure to become a Gold Standard.> My Little, Preeeecioussssssss....Must have it, I did; love it, I do.  Oh, Kindle HDX; I'm so proud of what you've become. My every dream in a tablet come true; really and truly, that's not just gushing.  Oh ok, it is gushing, but I do mean it.  I just love my tech toys; especially this new HDX!> Accessibility FeaturesKudos, Amazon. As a disabled person myself, I am highly impressed by the screen reader and accessibility options, and your decision to feature them.  But you don't have to be disabled to benefit from them. Tired of squinting at tiny text? Try out one of these great accessibility features, like the screen reader or magnifier.> Read To Me BabyAbsolutely love the Immersive Reading feature and can't wait to really delve into it. Love that Kindle books now have a new way to be enjoyed. I have wanted this feature in a Kindle app since the day I got my Thrive, and so glad that Fire has it; HUGE bonus in my book.> Special Offers or No Special Offers?I debated over this one. It's only a 15 buck difference, and the feature can be turned off at any time by just paying the extra dough.  But I wanted to save a couple bucks, so I opted for the special offers.  Plus, I figure, I'm always shopping at Amazon, so a deal or two once in a while is probably a good thing. However, please keep the ads targeted, Amazon. Please don't start advertizing a bunch of crap to me that my purchase history does not justify. Keep it specific to my needs, and Never, Ever, automatically start playing movie trailers or outright commercials. If I wanna see them, I'll click on it; otherwise, silence is golden.  Last thing I want is my tablet berating me with blatant, noisy advertizing; making a big to-do about something I don't give a crap about. Otherwise, I'll just pay the 15 bucks and dump that feature in a blink.  Do, however, offer me coupons, promotions and deals for stuff you know I'm interested in.  Everyone loves a good coupon!> Holy TrollersYup, it's a real thing, and pretty much what it sounds like; a few highly motivated ones have been stalking me here on Amazon for years, and I'm bored of being 'effed with.  So I took a hiatus from comments a good while ago, and now just focus on trying to write good reviews.  Amazon's new question & answer format integrated into each product's page is a positive step in the right direction, and likely where I'd focus my time if I feel the urge. Perhaps this review will pull me out of my hiatus; so comment away!> Bottom LineThis review is my sizzle to Kindle's Fire; I hope I did this fantastic tab justice.  If you're still reading this, you deserve a prize; I have none for ya, but you deserve one all the same. Perhaps give yourself the prize of a Kindle Fire HDX; and don't forget to nab the Origami case! (Would you believe I even had to shorten this? Looks like I finally found Amazon's review limits.)Yes, I'm one of those nerds who gets excited by tech.  I'm not sure how valuable my skill set is in the real world, but I know gadgets, and HDX gives me goose bumps.  Stunning picture, fast processor and graphics, excellent sound, solidly constructed, superb design, ingenious origami case, and screen readers; plus, Gold Standard features like, Second Screen, Miracast and Mayday tech support -- this tablet is a dream.  Sunbeams, rainbows and angelic harps all over again.In a perfect world, I would have kept my old Thrive forever.  But I'm glad I traded it in while it could still be useful to someone, and was still worth a decent trade-in value to me.  (My gift card from Amazon Trade-In basically got me a free 2 year warranty and origami case for my new HDX.)  I'm thrilled to have made the leap to my new HDX, and absolutely love it!  Now, Amazon, please get busy on that Kindle TV and Kindle Mobile cell phone.  I want your iteration of those toys next!

I'm glad I did!First, delivery time was amazing. I ordered Friday night and to my surprise, it was delivered Saturday afternoon. This was my big gift to myself for this holiday season and I was expecting it to take a couple of weeks to get here like my previous Kindle orders. I'm still waiting on the cover as I decided not to go with the origami case after reading reviews of it being very heavy.As soon as I opened the box and had my precious in my hands, I knew I was right to wait for this version. It's exactly what I wanted. The weight is perfect, the rubber backing and beveling make it easy to hold at any angle.Turning it on with the new button in the back is a breeze. Once it was booted up I was ready to go. All of my apps were waiting to be downloaded from the cloud as well as all of my books and magazines. It took about 10 minutes to download all of them. Some apps aren't available yet for this model, like Draw Something but that's a developer issue, not a Kindle issue. The display is beautiful and crisp and the volume buttons are great. No more swiping down to adjust the volume while watching a video!I've synched two gmail accounts, one for work and one for personal use. I'm able to get notifications for both at the same time which is much easier than logging in and out or having to use two devices to get notifications for each. I've tested Picasso for drawing and the response to the stylus is incredible.I'm loving the side-bar swipe to access other apps while in use of another app instead of having to close out the current app to use another. If I'm watching a video on netflix or reading a book, I can quickly swipe to the side bar, check my email or look something up in wikipedia and then get back to my content.I love the rear camera, which was a big reason for holding out for this version. I've taken a few pictures, edited them on the tablet and shared with facebook from the editor with great ease. Videos are very nice and clear in HD and also very easily uploaded to facebook from the kindle. I would like to see some better video editors in the kindle apps but for now this is good.The processor is super fast, even with several apps open I've had no freeze ups or delays getting to content. Mostly, this is used for entertainment but now and then I need to do some work related stuff while I'm using it for entertainment. No problems at all with pausing a game, retrieving an email with a document, editing the doc, sending out and getting right back to my game.Lastly, battery life. I've been running Swagbucks videos on both the old Kindle Fire and the new one for the last 2.5 hours starting both with a full charge. The old Fire is at 70% now and the new one is at 80%. With the new one I've had it in constant use with games, videos and reading for more than 4 hours at a time without it getting below 56% charge. Including the PowerFast Charger with this Kindle was the cherry on top, it really does charge it fast!I have a lot of faith in Amazon as a company and was certain if I just waited it out another year they would have the tablet I wanted and I was right. Apple quality has been slipping in recent years as they seem more focused on new gimmicks to keep people lined up at their stores every year than quality. I think this tablet will hold it's value for a couple of years at least without feeling like I'm missing out if I don't upgrade it with each new version and that is also important to me.

Usually a one star product is clearly junk, but that is not the case here.If I were to rate the hardware only (I bought the HDX 8.9 w/o special offers), I would say it's a five star product. But we can't just rate this on hardware alone, we have to look at both the software and Amazon's walled garden policies.I read all the reviews from the gadget sites about how this was somewhat crippled by lack of access to google play, but that you could sideload apps, and that if you wanted to consume Amazon content that it was a good choice. As all I wanted it for was to read ebooks, I thought it would be perfect. It has probably the best screen I've seen on a tablet (compared to my new Galaxy Note 2014 and my wife's Ipad Retina, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the better screen). The problem was I have a lot of technical ebooks (I'm a software developer) from Oreilly press, and I prefer PDF format for these. I also have a few ePub books. I did some research and found moon+ reader pro in the Amazon store. I figured I was good to go, I could buy Moon Reader + pro and have a device that could read all my kindle books, watch amazon prime, and read my ePubs and PDFs. Then the tablet came and I logged in to the store, and Moon Reader + Pro was not listed. I followed a link from the web and lo-and-behold it says \"Not compatible with your device\"..which was interesting because the free version worked just fine. I wanted the pro because It supports PDFs and the ads are annoying. I then looked for other readers in the Amazon store that would support ePub or PDF and work on my device and guess what...there weren't any. Interestingly enough, there are other readers in the Amazon store such as Aldiko..they just say they aren't compatible with the HDX 8.9.. if you sideload them from the web they work fine though so it's not a compatibility issue. It's Amazon putting artificial limits on what content you can easily view on a kindle device. I don't mind the lack of Google Play because I can understand Amazon not wanting to pay to license from Google or follow Google's policies. But when they have apps that work for what I want in their App store but they intentionally limit access to them to Kindle Devices because they allow ePub and PDF content I have a problem with that.In closing, I would say that if you want to consume Amazon content, an Apple Ipad is currently the best choice. You have full access to a huge selection of apps, and you get the ability to view Amazon Instant Video and you get Text To Speech in the kindle reader. I absolutely despise Apple products so it pains me to recommend them, but for Amazon content the Ipad is the best choice. Android is purposefully crippled by Amazon. They do not have an Instant Video app for Android (other than for the Kindle Fire) and they don't support Text To Speech for Android (again other than the Kindle Fire). As for me I returned the Kindle and bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I don't get prime videos, but I do get Netflix if I want and I've started looking elsewhere for books and movies.I originally started buying from Amazon because I liked the choice, I liked the customer service, and they made things easy. With this tablet, they have taken away the choice of content and nothing was easy. Customer service is the only thing left. I'll still shop at Amazon for almost everything else I buy, but my great opinion of them was tarnished by the whole experience and I probably won't buy another Kindle device. At least they made it very easy to return the Kindle Fire.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "A huge improvement over the previous, outstanding version and (please don't hate me) preferred to our iPad5", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R31KWMHEUKN05B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick summary:Pros: - Price - The Mayday feature.  Not for \"us\", of course.  See the details below for the details. - There are (really useful) apps which you cannot get on an iPad - Price :)Cons: - Not an iPadQuick Bottom Line:  If you want a great, versatile tablet then get this and save some money.  If you need an iPad then get that.Now some details; let's start with a comparison...Size (and weight) (different and may now) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is much smaller, a tiny bit thicker, and a tad lighter than the iPad 5 Air. Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, about an inch.  Frankly, from using the previous versions of both  devices, which had similar physical dimensions, everything is close enough to not really matter a lot.Speed - About the same when doing similar activities side-by-side.  Same for wireless down/upload speeds.Available apps.  There are a lot more apps available of the iPad.  Again from personal experience, there are enough of any type available for the Kindle Fire that I can always find one (or more) that I like.  After that, how many note taking apps (for example) do I need?THERE ARE SOME apps available for the Kindle (and android in general) that are not available for the iPad.  One that I use, which for some IS REASON ENOUGH to choose a Kindle, is \"WiFi Analyzer\".Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire costs hundreds of dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.  This can matter a lot if none of the other differences do.The May Day Feature - I have friends who bought iPads for their technically challenged, typically older, relativeness.  The intent was to provide a foolproof platform for access to email and those internets.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't.  When it didn't getting problems resolved could be difficult since Grandma wasn't always willing to head out to the local Genus bar.  With this feature, the bar come to her.  Kidding aside, it positions this as the gift device of choice for anyone who might feel threatened with alternative tablets.Now for some specifics about this device: - The Ads supported version - They never get in the way.  As with previous versions, for me it is worth saving some money. - Display:  The display is outstanding!  Even better than the previous version, clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly). - Usability:  I've grown to prefer the Kindle interface, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets. The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\". Other apps are just a few taps away. That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter ssince there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around. - First use: First use was very straightforward. I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it. First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password. Once I logged it, it already knew about the apps, music, books, and videos I am using on my other Kindle devices.  I realize iPad does something similar. However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier. -On the business side, the built-in office software is handy and saves me from having to buy it outright.  I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems. Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems. - Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly. Pandora provides music without a hitch. It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily. - The Camera:  The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end. We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better. They've added a rear-facing camera which I probably won't use for taking snapshots (that's what an iPhone is for) and will for Skype sessions where I want to show my surrounds. - The Missing Charger: Isn't missing this time.  In the past Amazon didn't include on, probably figuring by this time most people already had *something* capable of charging their latest device and would prefer to save a couple bucks.  This time they tossed one in.  Still, if you haven't sprung for a Bolse\u00ae 4 Port High Output Charger buy now, you're missing out.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than any tablet on the market!", "Author": "Nigel", "ReviewID": "R2I2B6FNW7KXT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Kindle ever.

Precourt", "ReviewID": "R26X2B56V34235", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recommended the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to my uncle who wanted a tablet just for basic stuff like e-mail, web browsing, Skype, etc.  I thought this one may be the best fit for him because he is not very tech savy and always asking me for help with his computer.  The 'Mayday' feature was the tipping point over other tablets as he could get assistance right on the device.I ordered the device for him and had it shipped to myself for setup and planned to ship it out to him, along with a wi-fi router already configured to it.  While performing the initial setup I quickly realized that this was not going to be a good fit at all, dispite the Mayday feature.  Here are my observations.The first problem I ran into was that the Kindle OS is VERY limited on settings compared to any other Android device that I've used (and I've used many over many years.)  The first thing I wanted to change was font size as he is older and would have difficulty reading the extremely small print size and found that there are only two settings for font size (normal and large, which isn't much larger than normal.)  On some screens it's acceptable, but on others it's still SO small, like the registration page for example.  It does have a 'magnifier' setting, but that is a pain to use as you have to pan around the screen to see everything with two figner swipes.  All my other Android devices have five (5) different font size choices, allowing easy reading of the entire screen at one time.  I found the limitation of settings options to be the case throughout the device menus - very few customization settings options.The second big problem which was the deal breaker is that you MUST provide credit card information, address, etc in order to download FREE apps.  I confirmed this with a rep over the Mayday feature, which I must say does work flawlessly.  My uncle did not want to provide this information as he never plans on downloading anything that would cost him, as he will only be using this for basic things.No flash support at all, at least out of the box.  I know this can be an issue on other tablets, like iPad especially, however, I could not get any videos to play on the Kindle Fire at all, not even YouTube, which generally will work on any other tablet I've owned.  Couldn't try downloading any other browsers or apps due to the need for a credit card to download free apps.At this point I gave up and decided to return it and get him the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 instead, as it is a full featured Android tablet and won't require him to provide credit card information to download free apps from the Google play store.In all fairness, I realize this device might not be designed to be a full featured tablet, but I was hoping for more and did not expect it to be locked down so much.There are good things about it though, if you can deal with the other shortcomings.  The screen is amazing!  The sound quality is also very good.  It's lightweight and seems to run pretty fast (although I really couldn't do much with it to explore that.)  The Mayday feature is great also!  The camera takes good pictures, although it seems to take a long time to focus.If you are a Kindle user and want a device for that purpose this is a great product that goes beyond the basic Kindle experience.  If you're looking for a more robust Android tablet you may want to look at some of the other choices out there.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed...Read the return policy", "Author": "Rosalie Buck \"CHESSNUT\"", "ReviewID": "R292JAY86V1CII", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The device I purchased in January would not connect to wireless or update my email unless I powered down 2 to 3 times a day.

Finally I was told that Amazon was aware of this particular problem with other devices and a software update would fix the problem. It was not fixed. I was told a replacement would likely have the same problem, so I decided to return the Kindle as well as the case (which will only fit the Kindle).I paid $523.99 for the Kindle and case.

Nothing too in depth just some basic office apps. I also would like to have a tablet that I could sync with my Android phone but that wasn't a deal breaker, I could live without that option.I was contemplating this tablet or the Nexus 7, Asus Memo FHD 10\" tablet, or a Samsung one. Well the Nexus 7 screen was too small for me especially when watching Netflix or movies but was awesome for gaming. The Samsung tablets were surprisingly expensive when compared to other tablets that offered more in terms of screen display, speed, and functionality (I think my biggest dismay with Samsung is their Touchwhiz overlay. I mean it's good when it works but it sucks when it doesn't, I have a Galaxy S4.) I didn't like the size of the 10\" tablets, so I thought an 8-9\" tablet would be a good compromise and it turned out to be the perfect size range for me.Now I knew that the Kindles come with an Amazon skin, Mojito 3.0 OS as they like to call it, on all their hdx tablets and this works well....for the most part, depending on what type of person you are with a tablet. Now onto the positives and negatives.I'll touch first on the positives, IMHO.-The screen is fantastic. The colors \"pop\" out and really are vibrant. What's even better is the battery life paired with this is phenomenal, at least in my usage. (I'll touch on this a little later.) You can really tell that they had put some time and effort into making the screen one of the best. I think it really shows the ingenuity of how well they were able to push a wonderfully looking screen. The PPI is almost absurd, 339, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600. Incredible, especially when Apple's own Ipad Air has this; 2048 x 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Kudos to you Amazon for making such a wonderful and beautiful display. Oh, and having 100% sRGB color accuracy helps with making all the images and colors shine and pop out. All my movies and shows really looked astounding in low or high lighting. Touch reaction was spot on, no lag. Everything was very responsive and concise. Very impressive screen.-The speakers.....oh my the speakers. They too are awesome. When I had first turned on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", my gf almost didn't believe the sound was coming from a tablet! The sound is fantastic, not the absolute best, but close to it. You can really hear the Dolby Digital from within these speakers. The highs and mids are great while the lows are discernable enough to make them sound as they should, given what speakers they're coming from. Even on the highest volume setting, the sound was still clear and crisp. It didn't sound muffled or reduced as you would hear in some speakers. TBH, I never tried the listening through the headphones so I can't comment on that, sorry.-The battery. Very impressive, imo. I had used my tablet for an avg. day, 4-6 hrs with mostly gaming and watching videos, some light reading (Had the Amazon Prime Free trial membership while had my Kindle Fire hdx.) The brightness was always set to auto. I didn't have any email setup so never had to push notify there. So specifically speaking, I used this tablet strictly for watching videos and playing games, while doing some light reading. I would charge my tablet about once every 3-4 days. The charge time was always brief, never going over a few hours, charged just as fast if not faster than my Galaxy s4. Battery was impressive with my usage.-Speed. Not much to comment here other than it was super fast! It's the only tablet I've seen so far that changes orientation from landscape to portrait INSTANTLY. I mean instantly, no lag whatsoever. It was nice. With a quad core Snapdragon 800 on 2.2 GHz Krait 400, it flies. Add to boot it has an Andreno 330 GPU and 2gb of ram, it has the latest and greatest processing power at this time. It definitely showed when playing games or multitasking. Apps loaded with ease, everything was super responsive, no lag whatsoever that I had encountered.-Cameras. I opted for the 32g version as I wasn't sure how much of personal content I was going to add on here. I never used the camera other than for a test. I like the fact that the HDX 8.9\" version has a LED back flash and an overall better camera on it than the HDX 7\" but it's really not needed but nice to have, for me it wasn't necessary. To note, the HDX 8.9\" has both a front and rear facing camera with a LED flash on the back. I add this to my positives b.c even though it's not really necessary to have a camera on a tablet it's nice to have \"just in case\".-Size. The overall dimensions of this tablet are great. It's actually pretty light and not at all bulky or thick. The dimensions are what is expected in this day and age for top end tablets. Unless you tack on the Amazon made and endorsed Origami case onto it which adds almost double the weight. It surely protects but it adds a considerable amount of bulk.-Having Amazon Prime. If you're already a member or thinking of becoming one then an Amazon Kindle is the way to go if you want a tablet. It offers a bundle of advantages to Kindle Fire owners when they also have Prime, it's a great service. However, in recent days I've read and heard they are looking to increase the price of Amazon Prime because of shipping costs (2 day free shipping is included in Prime.) and the like but I guess that's still in the talks and perhaps their may not be a price hike after all? Hope not. :)  You get to borrow one book/mo from their extensive library, you have access to their Prime video library (I honestly think Netflix is better but to each their own.), and other nice features as well.Negatives-Tied exclusively to Amazon...Now before I say anything else, some people may view this as a positive but again, I said these were IMHO. I know you could root and flash to another ROM but outside the box you're stuck with just Amazon and their regulated ecosystem. (Some people don't want to take the risk of voiding their warranty or bricking their devices just to get it to run an Android rom or the like. I understand that it can be a simple process but sometimes the risk doesn't negate the end result for some.) I didn't think much of it initially but as the days went by I was becoming more envious of not having the Play store. I bought this tablet mainly for media consumption so I had hoped I would be set on what Amazon provided...I was. For a bit. I liked the idea that Amazon has \"coins\" you can purchase for a discounted price in which you can use anywhere in their mobile store. The Amazon store is good but if you're looking for game or other entertainment apps then the Play or App store is the way to go.-No external sd card port. I know that with the newer versions of Android most apps and games you can't transfer to the sd card but knowing it's there in case you want to save personal music, vids, or pics, is nice to know. I will say in the Kindle Fire HDX's defense it has a nice cloud based server to \"drop\" things into but at this moment I'm not completely sold on the \"cloud\" universe yet. Time will tell.-Read up on some current Fire HDX owners complaining about their power adapter plug-in port becoming loose or outright breaking. I don't want to scare anyone but please be forewarned that this is an issue, how big or small Idk but it was one of the top complaints when I did my research. I was leery myself b.c the way the charger adapter plugs in is very odd and can easily seeing it being broken or malfunctioning in the future and the incidents where people had notified Amazon about it, well that's another story. It plugs in at an angle slighted towards up. It's kind of odd that it would plug in at an angle and not level with the tablet. It looks very wonky, imo. With my luck, the charging port would break a day after the warranty, lol.OVERALLIf you shop Amazon frequently, or have Amazon Prime, plan on getting it, or want a tablet that's easy to use comparatively (Mayday button is a great feature for noobies and the like.) then this tablet is for you. If this tablet had the option to either have the Amazon store or the Play store downloaded right out of the box then I would've downloaded the Play Store and would have kept my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  I honestly couldn't take having a \"locked\" down app store but again to each their own. I like having Google Voice, Maps, Gmail, etc right out the box. So instead of keeping my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", I had replaced it with the LG G pad 8.3\" tablet and my the differences. It's almost night and day even though they are both running Android technically. I will be writing a review for that tablet once I get to know all the nuances with that one.But overall the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is an AWESOME tablet. It's just I, myself, didn't like having just the Amazon store and no direct access to the Play store especially when I had purchased some apps from there on my Galaxy s4. I would highly recommend this tablet it you're looking to use it to read, watch movies, and some other light entertainment activities.For gaming and productivity I would undoubtedly recommend an Android, Windows, or Apple tablet.Happy shopping and thanks for reading my take on the Amazon Kindle Fired HDX 8.(\"", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unbelieveable how much improved....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R25MMUS6XKDANU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am upgrading from my original 8.9\" fire.

It's been a good tablet, a workhorse for me, but it's past it's prime.  I initially balked at the Fire when it was first introduced.  Not enough apps, the presentation was so different, etc.  But a few months ago, I ran thru all the apps I use every day and they were all offered by Amazon's App Store.  Combine that with the fact that I'm an Amazon super-user, I decided to take the plunge and get the Kindle HDX 8.9.Well, I've been using it non-stop for about 6 hours and it's awesome.  Display is fantastic, very light, Everything loads fast, video streams well, and my books look great. (No blue tint on border that I can see.  I've read in different settings and lighting, and no color tinge of any kind.)As an Amazon Prime and Audible member, I was also looking forward to their integration into the Fire.  It is great!  Amazon Video is fully integrated and I can even download some shows, apparently.  Haven't tried it, but looking forward to it.  Great option for traveling, I think.  And with Audible integrated into the Fire, you can do immersion reading if you own both the Kindle and Audio versions of a book.  That sounded cool to me when I heard it . . . and it is!  I recommend it to all readers out there.  A lot of great deals to be had as well i.e. Many Kindle books have a deal that once you purchase the ebook, you can purchase the Audible version for $.99-3.99 Great deals.The only thing I'm working thru is getting used to the interface.  It's pretty, and it makes sense, but it's new to me so there's a bit of learning curve.  But I'm getting there.Lots of other bells and whistles, but that's my initial impressions.  I wholly recommend it to anyone looking for a high performance tablet at a reasonable price.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, but does lack a little.", "Author": "Jackie Gill", "ReviewID": "R3LUD8QO8WX33L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am giving this 5 stars because it really is beautiful, has an outstanding display, and is very light. However, it does have some limitations.What I like:The display! I have had an original iPad, a 4th generation iPad with Retina, and an iPad mini - this display blows them out of the water.The speed: This pad works flawlessly. There are no hangups, no freezes, and no stuttering during video playback.iCal CAN sync with this: Many will say that your iCal cannot sync with your Droid based devices. YES IT CAN. All of my computers are Macs and I love iCal. Furthermore, my Macs store all of my contacts and task lists. There are apps that will sync your contacts, calendar, and your tasks. I use CalDav-Sync available via Kindle store and Google play and everything I update on my Mac shows up on my Note 3 and Kindle HDX. I do not care for the included Kindle calendar (I am a big calendar person) so I also bought AwesomeCalendar and it is a great calendar app. CalDav also works to update this calendar with all of my information on my Mac and I never have to do a thing to make it happen.Reading Features: I considered the following before purchasing this Kindle: iPad mini with retina, Samsung Note 8.2\", and a Kindle HDX 7. I am pretty tired of Apple products. I am not saying they aren't great, and it is the only computer I will buy, but I like new things. Each time I purchased a new i-product it seemed so much like the previous that it just didn't feel new. Therefore, even though the new Mini with retina is beautiful, I ruled it out. I really like the size, shape, and feel of the new Samsung Note 8.2.\" Samsung went back to black and moved away from that strange brown decision and I love the ability to use the stylus. Plus, I also switched from an iPhone to a Note 3, so this means all of the Apps I have purchased in Google Play would be available for my pay as well. So, this being said, the Samsung Note 8.2\" was almost my new pad. However, it is very similar to my Note 3 and the the Kindle beats everyone in one area: READING. Yes, you can get the Kindle app on your other products, but you can't get immersion reading. I have not built my library via iBooks, luckily I have purchased all of my books via Kindle. So, when I opened my box and pulled out my new Kindle, they were all there. I am a PhD student in the dissertation phase, so I read A LOT. not all of my books have been available via Kindle, but when they are they are less expensive and I love the note taking features. I do think the note taking features and highlighting works better on the Kindle than it does through the Kindle app. You are allowed multiple highlighting colors to choose from, it keeps track of my notes and reading on all of my devices, and you can get the audio versions of the books (if available) for very good prices. I have been an Audible fan for a long time. I know many do not care for audio versions, they prefer to read. Immersion reading combines them! This is WONDERFUL for me because I like to accomplish tasks while listening to a book, but if I need to highlight something, the immersion reading will show me where I am and I don't have to hunt. This is a big upgrade and what tipped my decision to make this purchase. Now, at the time I was not thinking about actually carrying this thing around while I listened, and the 8.9 is a little large for that, perhaps the 7 would have been the better choice, but the 8.9 isn't too heavy and I can always listen on my sisters 7\", or i-product if I am moving around and it will sync with my 8.9\" to let me know exactly where I left off.The organization of the Home screen: I really like the carousel and the folders that you place apps in. Unlike Apple app folders, the Kindle allows you to place many apps in a folder (this may have changed in recent Apple IOS updates, not sure).Weight: Very light! I like the feel of this pad. It is lighter than the iPad air and does not feel cheap to me (the 7 inch does not feel substantial enough to me).Aesthetics: I love the all over black! I find this to be a beautiful pad. Comparing it to the iPads, I cannot say that one is better looking than the other because I think they are both beautiful in their different ways; however, this has a rubberized back that makes it MUCH easier to hold onto. I also prefer the shape. iPad is a little wider and I don't think it is necessary. I prefer the more 16:9 shape. I had a very difficult time deciding on whether to buy this because of size. I found that an 8\" display was perfect. The full size iPad was too large and too heavy. The iPad mini was just right, although I still prefer the more rectangular look of the Kindle 8.9\" and Samsung 8\". I felt the 7\" Kindle was just too small. The 7\" feel a little cheap to me and there just isn't enough screen for reading. Moving back up from the 8\" mini made me nervous. I will say that I do wish this Kindle was slightly smaller. Even moving down to an 8.3 - 8.5 would probably help, but it is not overwhelming. I am still happy that I chose the 8.9\" over the 7\" and I really do like the size and shape when viewing movies.Ability to download free content: One of the big pluses of a Kindle is Prime. I know you can download content from iTunes and get movies and such that way, but I have NO DESIRE to pay $20 for a download I will watch once. We take a road trip every summer and WiFi/4G is not always available. Plus, streaming via 4G eats up a lot of data. So, I wanted to be able to download movies and TV to watch on the road. You can do this with Prime and they do have free content (I'll also discuss this more under what I don't like). Amazon also gives away a free paid App a day. This is pretty cool. I log in every day and download most of them. Most are games, I would like more variety, but they are free :-).Origami Case: if you buy the Kindle HDX 8.9 or 7, I highly recommend the origami case. For my previous i-products I have purchased multiple cases and contraptions to hold them where and how I wanted them. Never has any case been as nice and met all of my needs like this one. I did and do not like the price of this case. It is about even with Apple brand leather iPad cases, but those are incredibly overpriced as well (and I do not like Apple smart covers, they are far inferior to this case). However, this case, at least, does a GREAT job. I did choose the leather and I am glad I did. It feels like a very nice quality leather, has not scuffed, smells good, and the Kindle fits it perfectly. The case also allows you to easily push the Kindle up to take photos, control power, and control volume. My sister bought one of the non-leather origami cases for her Kindle HDX 7, and while the case functions just the same and is a great color, I really prefer the leather - it just feels better, looks nice, and has a leather rather than chemical smell. The magnets in this case are great, holds very securely, and they turn the unit on and off. The case folds back flat, or holds the unit vertically or horizontally; and, if you like to read it bed, it does a great job of holding the Kindle up on your stomach or on a pillow. Again, while I agree this case is expensive, I do believe it is the only case I will need to buy for my Kindle.What I don't Like:Number one biggest complaint - DESKTOP BACKGROUND and Home screen images. You cannot change them! This is crazy to me. I did not expect this and I am disappointed. This in no way has anything to do with the function of the device, but I really like personalizing. I chose no advertising - there is enough of that in the world - and I removed the Amazon recommends section on the home-screen; but, that is where my choices ended. I cannot change the black background and I cannot choose what images greet me when I open my cover. I don't know if Amazon chose to do this because of their advertisers and/or for ease of help via MayDay (which I have never used, it isn't a complicated tablet), but I DO NOT LIKE IT. I want to open my pad and be greeted by my Boston Terrier, not a generic picture (although the lock screen images are pretty nice looking). I think this could be easily fixed via software update, but I also assume Amazon left this common feature out on purpose and doesn't plan to include it.Amazon Prime Free Content: I stream via Prime and Netflix and between the two I get most of what I want. However, I wanted to be able to download shows and movies and take them on the road with me. First, know that this EATS YOUR MEMORY. I chose the 64GB pad and it doesn't take much to fill it if you choose HD - a couple of movies and a few episodes of a show and you are full. You can choose lower quality, but it does look inferior on this exceptional screen. Downloading HD is also incredibly slow. I have pretty fast connection, but HD takes forever! That being said, the worst part is that there really isn't much to download. Sure, Prime offers a lot, however the majority of Prime cannot be downloaded. Hopefully this will change, but this is a feature that I was hoping to get a lot more out of.Size: The jump from a 7\" to an 8.9\" is pretty big. I wish they would offer an 8.2 - 8.5.\" It would be a little more slender, easier to fit in a large pocket and easier to hold with one hand. One thing I like about the 7\" is that I can hold and control it with one hand. The 8.9\" requires two hands. Still the size it much better than the full size iPad.App Store: I don't feel the app store is all that lacking. It is pretty extensive and serves most of my purposes. Unfortunately I have had to purchase duplicate apps because my iTunes purchases obviously don't transfer and Kindle does not use the Google Play store. The perfect device would allow purchases from all of them, but I get that this won't work. There are apps in all three app stores that are not available for one or the other. So, there are still apps on my i-products that I can't find for my Android devices and there are apps via Droid that I can't find for my i-products.Final thoughts: The perfect pad for me would be around 8.3 inches, include a Samsung-like stylus, have the power and performance of i-products, work with an app store that has all apps for all platforms, be very customizable, be very light, and include all of the reading features and Prime features of Kindle. It would also fit in an Origami case because it really is the best case I have used. That being said, at this point, Kindle simply offers more of what I am looking for in a tablet. I don't know if my perfect pad will ever exist, but, in the mean time, this one is pretty great!", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "HDX 8.9 is Fantastic and and the Installment Plan is Great!", "Author": "TLS", "ReviewID": "R9BJL8VK3HJ9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a Kindle from the 2nd generation through PaperWhite.  I have looked at the Fire for quite a while but was not sure how the reading experience would be.  Then I saw I could pay for a Fire on a no-interest installment plan - so I went for it.  The marketing beauty of the installment plan is that it lets you upgrade to the larger size Fire over five payments rather than one big lump.  Memo to Jeff Bezos: smart, very smart in coming out with the installment plan.Now about the Fire experience.  It is great on all fronts - I've watched a movie, read The Week magazine, and read a book.  Looked at YouTube videos using the free app.  Downloaded other apps.  The screen is so sharp, the 8.9 size is great and it's not too heavy, the battery life is pretty close to stated, and the interface is very easy to understand.  Since I have the PaperWhite, a lot of the learning curve was already taken care of.  However, even if you have never used a Kindle product, the interface is very intuitive.Of course, the breadth and depth of the Amazon ecosystem means just about any book, digital magazine, movie, or whatever is available with one click (maybe that's why Amazon calls it \"one click\").  And Prime means you can see a lot of movies and TV shows at no cost (think Downtown Abbey, Hunger Games and 007 Skyfall).  Getting Prime if all you are looking for is video content may not be the best deal at $99 (I paid $79 in the last few days before the rate went up).  However, if you do a lot of Amazon purchases, the 2nd day shipping is awesome and on top of that you get video content!The Fire 8.9 out of box experience was great.  No defects, no blue margin haze, started up and has run like a champ from the very first moment.So here is the bottom line from my perspective.  If all you are doing is reading long form text in books, the PaperWhite is the best solution.  However, if you have ever had the desire to watch a movie, read a digital magazine, check out what's happening on YouTube, etc. - buy, buy, buy the Kindle Fire.

Apple puts not effort into the audio experience of their tablets and laptops, assuming, I guess, that everyone will want to use those damned earbuds all the time.  I got really tired of plugging in an external Logitec stereo device into my iPad 3 whenever I wanted to watch a movie, really tired.  Make no mistake, the HDX's speakers don't generate a concert-like experience, but it's far better than the iPad Air.  I also found the reduction in size and better display resolution to be helpful for reading.  Easier to hold, and fonts are rendered far more smoothly on the HDX display than Apple's retinal screen.  Steve Jobs would have to agree.  I don't understand why buyers would rather put up with continuous advertising than paying the few extra bucks for the ad-free version of the Fire HDX.  The HDX's version of Android also is kind of annoying.  Transferring movies from computer to tablet requires third-party software to remove DRM coding, whereas with Apple and even the plain Kindle Fire, movies are a simple drag and drop task.  Android's a pretty decent OS, but you wouldn't know it by the HDX.  You also have to be careful with Amazon Prime video.  Amazon subtly combines rental/purchase movies & TV with it's free Prime content, and it's pretty easy to press 'Watch Instantly' and later find out you've paid $5.00 to rent a movie.  You also probably notice a yellow cast to the display, especially with skin tones.  This is likely intentional to make the display appear better than it is, but I don't know why the Kindle makers thought this necessary since it's already the best display out there.  OK, so most Kindle buyers will likely just read, watch video and surf the web.  The HDX is very light & handy for doing these things.  Look at the limited accessories & general apps available and you'll understand it's not good to overreach with this devise. You will look silly bringing a Kindle to that important conference. My only other suggestion is to go with a vinyl skin rather than a TPU cover or folding case to protect your Kindle HDX.  I tried a TPU cover and it just bugged me.

They will tell you that you are limited to Amazons selection of apps, which is insufficient.  That the Kindles are only good if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber.  Well, that is simply not true of these newest tablets.  While the Amazon app store is not complete, it does have a ton of the most popular apps.  If you can't find what you need there, you can do an internet search and find out how to load any Android app on your Kindle.  And it is not rocket science.  The interlinking of Amazons content to the Kindle can not be shortchanged.

Having owned both the original Kindle Fire and a Kindle Fire HD, I was unsure about the need to upgrade. I couldn't help myself, though. The ability to download Prime movies was exactly what I was waiting for, since I take the train downtown every day. I'm actually impressed with the availability of downloads. I've already downloaded a bunch of episodes of The Shield, Friday Night Lights, and Sherlock. The quantity of available Prime videos for download may seem like it's not enough, but I can only assume Amazon will be vastly expanding this as time goes on.The picture quality was the first thing I noticed. This thing is razor sharp. The video plays very, very well on it, and the sound is good as well. I typically only use my headphones. My only gripe is that changing the volume is a two-step process on the screen now. I'm not sure why they made that harder - you have to tape the screen, then tap the volume icon, then adjust the volume. Previously, the volume slider was available with a simple tap on the screen. I hope they change that with an upgrade. The volume +/- is also on the back of the HDX, which makes it harder to adjust while using a case.This thing is almost weightless. The oragami case more than doubles the weight of it. It is truly impressive how light they have made this while keeping the price down.There is, however, one bad thing, that I'm hoping is just a glitch. My HDX froze after connecting to a new wireless network. It was unable to turn back on. I contacted Amazon's technical support, which was awesome. They're shippng me a replacement, which will be here in two days. The customer service was outstanding, and while this was an unfortunate issue, I wouldn't dock the HDX a star for it (yet). If it happens more often or to other people, it would definitely be a detriment to the reputation of the product. I'm guessing it was an isolated incident, though. I've never had a problem with my other Amazon devices, so I have confidence the replacement HDX will do just fine. I will update the review if anything happens with that one.Overall, this thing is amazing. I do think it's worth the upgrade, especially if you have an original Kindle Fire.

At this time, I have only positive things to say about it, and I will highlight some points for those who are thinking about making the purchase- I know they are expensive.I purchased the 64 gb version because I have an external hard drive of movies that I will rotate on my kindle. At the beginning, I put 8 2-hour movies on it, and still had space. So if you don't plan to add external media, you will be fine with  smaller data size.The internet works fast. All of my amazon media content is stored in my cloud. Any games that you purchased for a previous kindle will not transfer, so be advised of that. The picture quality is awesome, the graphics jump out at you, I couldn't be more pleased.The battery lasts forever. I used the kindle constantly throughout my flight, switching between movies and games, and still had plenty of juice. The machine is very easy to operate, and was cheaper than the iPad.I also like the book display. This kindle has a built-in backlight and magazines display nicely- as do comic books. I highly recommend this kindle.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware of Many Issues", "Author": "Sharon", "ReviewID": "R1U8YJNYVW890V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own one of the older Kindle Fires and was excited to receive this as a gift from my husband.  It worked OK in the beginning but within a few months it began shutting itself down. It would not come back on unless you did the hard reset, which is holding the power button down for 30 seconds.  This issue continued along with the fact that it would drop your internet connection and it would not update your email unless you shut it completely off.  After a few months of this my husband convinced me to contact Amazon.  The tech I talked to told me that the covers that Amazon sold could be part of the problem and I removed it.  He also tried to get me to reset to factory defaults and I asked to wait and let me give the coverless Kindle a try.It was better but still not right.  Finally I had enough when it shut down on me over 12 times in a row.  Each time staying on less than 45 seconds and freezing.  I did a reset to factory defaults in one of my 45 second windows.  When I tried to set it up again, it froze up.  Needless to say, I once again contacted Amazon and once again, I had to speak with someone that I could not understand.  He tried to get me to reset again and would not listen when I told him it wouldn't stay on long enough for me to do anything.  I got frustrated and hung up on him.My next step was live chat.  I chatted with someone and explained my problem  He must have clocked out for the day because suddenly I was chatting with someone else and he wanted to know what the problem was again.  He was not helpful and if anything I found him to be defensive.  My only option he said was to return it and he had no idea about the covers being a problem.I asked if I was going to get another new one or a refurbished one and he couldn't tell me.  Although he did agree to replace my cover.  He is sending the cover with one day shipping and my Kindle with two day shipping.  What sense does that make?The only positive thing I can about it is the screen is nice when it does decide to work. If I had it to do over I would have asked for the iPad instead.  Live and Learn.  Don't waste your money.UPDATE 05/20/15:I wanted to let everyone know that I received my refurbished Kindle Fire HDX yesterday.  It was supposed to be here on Friday but even though I verified the correct address with the customer service rep twice, it was sent to another address that is not the main address on my account. I was able to contact another customer service rep and all they could say was that he made a mistake and then they had the Kindle re-routed to my home.  I am not happy that I received a used Kindle and the first customer service rep I spoke with told me he would make a note in my file that since mine wasn't used that often he would request a new one for me.  As I stated before the last rep I spoke with wasn't very nice and he couldn't tell me what they would send. I will update if this one gives me any problems.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!!! Almost perfect!", "Author": "James Duckett", "ReviewID": "R1R8S3BWNPAOSL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big movie buff, so I wanted 64GB so I'd never have to worry about not having enough video to keep me entertained when I'm away from WiFi for a long time. Also, it's hard to tell what I'll be in the mood for, so I'll often load it up with movies that I might want to catch later. Some have sit there for months, and I still haven't been in the mood for them, but some day I will be and having 64GB certainly helps with that. I don't have to live in fear that I'll get in the mood for a show I don't have.The screen is beautiful. This is my go-to 10\" tablet, mostly used for watching media and for playing a few games. I have a Kindle Paperwhite and I do all of my reading from that, so I don't use this for reading except in some rare situations. I love how this ties into my Audible account, so I always have my Audible books with me as well (again, thank you 64GB).Videos work awesome on this. The resolution is nice and crisp. The speakers are also awesome, though I do wish some tablet maker would have them facing the listener instead of going out the back. I feel like I'm missing a lot of sound with it shooting out its rear end. Sometimes I'll cup the speakers in a way that the sound is redirected back to me, but if I'm listening tot his device, I always do it from the back. Those speakers are awesome, Amazon, please, please, PLEASE figure out a way to move them up front.It says you should get 12 hours of battery life watching video. I've never experienced this. When it was new, maybe 7 hours of battery life. After a few months of using and charging, I can probably burn through a battery in 5 hours watching Hulu or streaming other media. I've seen worse (like Microsoft's Surface tablet and my Dell XPS tablet/laptop), but I expected better from Amazon, especially when it claims 12 hours while watching video and 18 hours while just reading. I'm not seeing it. Apple does tend to live up to their claims on battery life, in my opinion.Otherwise, I've got no regrets dropping $500 on this. I'm usually by a charging source, and since this uses standard USB and not some proprietary connector (*cough* *cough* APPLE *cough*), finding a charging source is easy. It doesn't seem to take long to fully charge this either... maybe an hour or so with a 2.1amp charger. $500 would get you the entry-level Apple iPad, which is only 16GB, which I can fill easily. I have a large-capacity iPad Mini, which is decent for watching shows on, but it seems to struggle with some video and games now and then. I find myself using my iPad Mini less and less and my HDX more and more.If I had to choose again, I'd pick up this HDX over the iPad in a heartbeat. When compared to some Android tablets, I'd have to do a lot more debating, but in that debate Apple would always take third place and, even then, would have to content with the Microsoft Surface.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "piece of crap", "Author": "Peter S Park", "ReviewID": "RXB488IMUL6JC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just spoke with kindle support and they just notified me that my WiFi dropping issue is a known issue and that they are working on a fix.

The Free Amazon App of the Day has only encouraged this situation. I find it strange that the younger ones rather watch Netflix on the tablet than on the television. I think it is because the image is actually bigger than the screen appears from the couch.The tablet works well as a chant/music e-reader. It is light enough to hold during an entire practice or Mass, and there is enough bezel to do so with one hand and not mistakenly 'flip' the page. The other hand is needed for my lame attempt at chironomy. The ability to digitally draw markings on the music is also a plus (use the free Adobe Reader). It also works well as a regular e-reader for the same reasons listed.I have yet to become that person that can \"do anything\" on a tablet and rarely uses the laptop. That day may never come. The keyboard and mouse have spoiled me, and the quick email-fb check is easier and more practical on the handy smartphone. I do, however, appreciate the occasional quicker web search when the two laptops are in use.I sideloaded Flash onto it and felt content. However, I have yet to use it for anything Flash related. Go figure.I have no iPad related regrets. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is most comparable to the iPad mini (same width in portrait mode), yet it is lighter (good for one hand e-reading), has a brighter screen for outdoor viewing, is less expensive (good for the wallet), and offers up great free apps of the day (some apps that normally retail for $7 at the Amazon and Apple App Stores).So if you are looking for an alternative to the iPad mini, take a hard look at the HDX 8.9.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "much improved", "Author": "Dana G.

That is no longer the case. I had constant issues with the iPad browser and it didn't work with my bank's advanced features that I use such as person to person payments. The Amazon browser is much more stable and the reading view is awesome.  I have always felt that my iPad was more suited for access to apps and my fire for all things content related.

Also the slide the tablet out of the Origami case to expose the camera thing is more cute than usefull.Second screen, only for Samsung tvs and PS/3s Not exactly a wide market.Miracast: The device they recommend for the kindle  has only a 3 out of 5 star rating and costs $59, and then you still have to have an hdmi cable from it to the TV. I haven't got up the guts to risk it yet. I would've rather they kept the hardware port.Display: Gorgeous.Processor: Fast. The tablet can navigate as fast as I can swipe.Some of the stuff that deserves the Hype:Mayday: its everything they say it is.64GB: I can watch all day and all night if I have the power for it.New Buttons: These are way better than the old especially using them through a case.text to speech:  you got like 6 different english voices to choose from with the HDX and they sound very realistic.Origami Case:  Thinnest Rotatable standing case you'll ever find. Holding the tablet in with magnets is strange, but you get used to it.Better wifi:  My HD8.9 had problems with my router, and I would have to recycle my router once every day or so to get it back on line.

I've owned many Ipads and Android tablets. I've read many helpful reviews here (thanks guys) before buying this tablet. Just few thoughts(i) It's lighter than the Ipad Air; ok, I never held the air but this tablet is not feathery light for me. My kindle reader ($69) I think is \"light\". Not that this is heavy but I was not comfortable holding it with one hand.(ii) apps; right. I use dropbox a lot. I know I can side-load those apps whatever but at this point, I don't care. I do all my works on windows laptop. If I need to read something then I will use web to access those files. I just don't care any more. I'm sure Apple has unique apps that you need for your work and school...so then buy ipad. Simple. But for me. I don't use those special apps. So This HDX works out fine for me(iii) in the end, question is, what do you do with your tablet. For me, I read Kindle books and watch Free Prime Videos. I know Ipad is able to watch Prime. But again, this tablet makes everything Amazon content related matter easier. When I went to 3 day trip, I downloaded 2 TV shows and 1 video. With many Kindle book loaded, I felt like I was ready. And my trip was fun and exciting. I know those limit (2 shows) sucks. But in the airplane, I switched to books and watched videos when I had spare time during the trip. So it worked out fine.Ask: what do I do with my tablet? If it's Prime contents and Kindle books, then, you need to get this. If your work requires those special apps for ipad, then, you should get that.Also ask: how long do you keep your gadget? If you spend $500 + tax + accessories on cheapest Ipad, then, you should make or generate more income than $500. But as for me, I never used a device more than 1 year. So if I'm gonna upgrade every 1.5 years, then, I would get by with perfectly fine HDX 8.9. When time comes, then, I will buy newer one.I'm very happy as I read, read, and read on this and watch many cool prime shows (I think they have better TV shows like \"Vikings\" or \"Tudors\" than the movies). And I think $500 + for consumption only is too much.Only thing that I wish for HDX is that other manufactures bring out folio keyboard cases.Buy this.

Startlingly light, fast and responsive. Sure, the Appstore is lacking, but side loading apps is super simple. Mayday works perfectly, just as advertised.You can't get a better tablet, this size with this kind of hardware, for the price. Definitely recommend!----------UPDATE------------This is just a personal opinion, and I'm not going to dock a star or anything. I just don't like how the charger fits into the device. It sits at a kind of cock-eyed angle, sort of pointed up. I feel like I'm breaking it every time I plug it in to charge. Not a big deal at all! Just be kind of careful.ALSO! I'd recommend getting rid of the special offers. (which you can do at anytime, for $15 plus tax) I felt like it really drained my battery very quickly. Again, just a personal opinion. My original opinion stands, that this is the best tablet you can get for the money, and really is the best tablet I have ever used.----------UPDATE #2----------Finally having issues at a little under three months, I knew such an amazing device has to have a flaw. Starting 3 days ago, my Kindle started spazzing out (the only way to describe it). It wouldn't select the book I requested, instead it opened Silk and navigated me through 2 yahoo pages and a Wikipedia entry, all by itself. It freaked out while scrolling, arbitrarily zooming in an out of pictures on twitter and Facebook. While reading, it would highlight words and navigate me all through the reading menus and stuff. It was exhausting. I did a factory reset last night, thinking it was something I downloaded. This did not resolve the issue. So I called Amazon Customer Service today for help. Within 5 minutes, after explaining my problem, they offered to replace my device, which will be here by Saturday, 03/15. I am docking one star, because Customer Service does not attest to the quality of the device. I haven't dropped my Kindle a single time in 3 months, it's barely even been out of my house. These issues were just out of the blue and random.Other than this issue, the device was great and I'm really looking forward to my replacement and jumping back into my books and tv shows :D", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "David N. Olson", "ReviewID": "R1OFMUFQEL9TF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In general, I'm a big fan of Kindle products and the concept behind them.  I buy a LOT of books, and buying as many of them as possible in Kindle form keeps my house from being completely overrun with them.  I started with the first generation Kindle Fire, and have since purchased a Kindle Paperwhite as well as this item, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  This is in many ways the best Kindle of all, and is superb for reading my many books on photography.  And on a related note, the Origami cover works very well, too.My only complaint about the entire Kindle experience is the way that mathematical expressions are treated.  Mathematical expressions display on the page much too small in comparison to the text.  In some books, the equations are so small that you can almost miss the fact that they are there at all.  It's true that in most cases, you can press on an equation and then select zoom to make it larger; however, that leaves you with just the equation isolated from the text that describes it.  I can understand that maybe it's cheaper to treat mathematical expressions like illustrations instead of putting them in MathML and displaying them that way.  What I don't understand is why the default size of the expressions has to be so small.  When I read a book on photography, the picture that is being described is displayed at an appropriate scale; if I want to zoom in, I can study it in more detail.  Why can't mathematical expressions display at an appropriate scale.  It really reduces the value of reading books on mathematics or physics on the Kindle.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "You don't have to be a reader to love the Kindle Fire", "Author": "PentwaterGma", "ReviewID": "R1BKOA0WEZ3O36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my DH for Christmas this year.

So as a Prime Member Amazon let me experience the AMAZING Kindle HDX Fire 8.9 for 30 days and I was very impressed.Prior to the offer I had been considering purchasing a laptop vs. a tablet. Well I bought the laptop and had to return it after 30-days because it crashed on me.So then I started exploring tablets. I just wanted something that was comparable to a laptop without all the bulk.The Kindle Fire HDX is light, easy hold, sleek and has a beautiful picture screen compared to both the Samsung and Apple tablets. And I love the MAYDAY feature! I wish ALL products had this feature especially for my PARENTS so they don't have to call me (I love my parents dearly but I'm not the tech person they think I am...lol)Movies look great on the HDX Fire, reading is easy. It's VERY FAST and responsive, no lagging. I downloaded an app so I could read and edit Word and Excel documents. And the PREDICTIVE TEXT is on point!If I had one complaint it would be the limited number of apps in the Amazon store compared to Apple and the Android market. And one major missing app for me (and the reason it has 4-stars and not 5) is no dedicated YouTube app! There is a 3rd party YouTube app in the Amazon store but it has ads (yes ads in addition to the ads you get prior to a video starting) and is not as fluid as the dedicated app. Amazon, work it out with Google and get a YouTube app!One other disappointment, which Amazon has no control over, is the lack of animated page turns when reading a book. I love to read, and I love even more the realism you get when turning the pages with an electronic device and it looks like a real book. Well apparently Apple bought the patent/rights to that animated feature (WTH?). At least that's my understanding. But outside of that, reading on the Kindle is a joy and fun with all the interactive features with the highlighting and comments from other users as you read.Overall if you can afford it, I highly recommend the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (the 7 is too small) over any other tablet out there including the Apple iPad Air!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does Everything", "Author": "Daniel A.

The interest-free installment plan makes it extremely affordable.  Having my Amazon Prime services at my fingertips is great.  If this were all that matters in a tablet, FIVE STARS!But, the Amazon app store and ecosystem is a sad and depressing state of affairs. Google has apparently boycotted Amazon's store, so any app you've purchased on Google Play Store will not be available. There's no Chrome browser, no YouTube app (OMG!), no Gmail app... what about the Google star map app?  Nope.  Google maps?  *sigh*  I'm usually aggravated that the normal, every day tasks that I take for granted on my Android phone are a P.I.T.A on this thing.  I rarely leave the house with it.Worse still, major publishers *might* have their Android apps on the Amazon store, but when you search for your favorite apps you're more than likely to find a ton of cunningly named applications from unknown publishers.  If you do find a major vendor's application from a (hopefully) legitimate publisher, you'll pay for it again and maybe they'll update the app as often as the Google Play store version.  Or maybe not.The Amazon Silk browser works well, but it's not what I want (privacy??) and good luck finding an alternative.  At least I could find proper versions of Spotify, Tumblr and Facebook.  Sketchbook Pro is nice.  I managed to find a PC tool to download apps from Google's store as .APK files and then sideload them into the Amazon Fire OS, but that's a lot of effort and the Google services are not available to keep that app updated or enable many of it's features.  You'll be tempted to download .APK files from forums and warez sites, but then you're guaranteed to become infected.Anyway, If you're an Android hacker with an Amazon Prime account and looking for great hardware at a very low price (all seven of you), you might have a few, warranty-voiding choices after buying this tablet: 1) find a way to root the device and install Google's Play services and applications.  Or, 2) root the device, flash it with a custom Android ROM, load Google's services and apps, and then install Amazon's applications from the Google Store (Kindle Reader, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Workspaces, etc).Or, rather, I'm still researching this.

It is quick and responds well.  The battery lasts a real long time.  My main disappointment is that the operating system is a modified version of Android.  As a result, many of the apps I am used to on my phone cannot be installed on the Kindle.  One of the main reasons I bought this Kindle was to read one of my magazines that is only digital now.  I downloaded the previous issue with no issues, but when I try to download the current version, I get an error claiming that I have to update some software.  Some of the apps not available are Google Now and Zinio,  I feel like I overpaid for this at $379.

I do have a business license for photography but do more free than for paid. My number one goal was to use this device for my photography to make it easier to view images then my excellent but small screen on the back of my Canon EOS 5D Mk-III. I wanted a very bright screen, highest resolution I could find, best color reproduction I could get, light and long lasting on batteries, and easy to use. I also wanted it to be easy to setup and fast for photography because, let\u2019s face it, if I have to wait to see my images on this I won\u2019t use it in the long run and it will become something to collect dust.So how do I feel about it so far? AWESOME! This device lives up to everything I had hoped. Even my wife enjoyed using it and wanted to learn more about the software (CamRanger). I do admit that in a very bright sunny outdoor area (used it yesterday in the mountains for a bridal shot) it is harder to see the screen. Now note I said \u201charder\u201d, not impossible. It was still much better than the screen on the camera and it allowed my beautiful wife to better assist me in my shoots. You can connect this with an Eye-fi card or with a CamRanger. I did both. (Go look up my name as a reviewer on the CamRanger). I do not recommend the Eye-fi for pros. It is too unreliable and to fussy.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this to others for photography. I will always have it in my bag wherever my camera goes. It is also very enjoyable to use for surfing the net and reading the latest eBooks (I read a lot of photo how-to books all the time). It is beautiful, light, fast, slick, easy to carry and fun. And did I mention that the screen is downright gorgeous?Enough said.May this review help those who are trying to decide.

I would like to have gmail, and chrome on it. I would not recommend the advertising one, it is worth the thirty dollars to not have it especially if you have kids.The battery life is great, lasts a long time. I get two days on one charge and that is with full use during the day. 17 hours is not a lie, this battery lasts 17 hours of use. The screen is great and is very better than my 42 hd tv with a blueray player, my son actually prefers to watch his shows on it. (16 months). He just got interested in educational shows and responds better to the Kindle than the TV.I like how easy it is to use your amazon products in kindle, I have prime so I download Barney videos and when out and about son can watch them. Makes for a nice dinner when he is watching his shows.Where would I go with this, well I would integrate Kindle fire OS with Ubuntu because of the close business relationship they have with Canonical also a tablet as powerful as the new kindle fire hdx would kill with Ubuntu. I have an old HP laptop with similar hardware specs and when I first was using it with Ubuntu I thought I had bought a new laptop. I am thinking of getting several more Kindle's for my wife and son, and maybe then one will convert into a Ubuntu tablet.I bought it because it was similar to or better than an Ipad or Ipad mini after owning one I know it is better than an Ipad even the latest ones on market right now, my friend just bough an Ipad and is thinking of returning it to get a KIndle HDX 8.9 because of price and well, he also has prime and likes he can rent/download videos with his prime. The kindle freetime is great too, although I have not set up an account for my son because he is just a bit too young.My only complaint is well Amazon is a bit like Apple with the apps and restrictions, let us use all the android apps, also allow for a dual boot Ubuntu :) tablet with an Amazon prime app that allows us to still take advantage of all the Amazon-Kindle environment.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful first tablet!", "Author": "shelby220", "ReviewID": "RYJ2SEHKKHK14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, great picture/camera!

I don't know why they tell us this if it isn't true! But oh well, it worked out because Kindle gave me a bunch of \"coins\" for downloading certain apps that they were advertising that I could use towards the already discounted price of the app. It's originally I think $10 but was on sale for $5 and I didn't have to pay for the app anyway which is good! But now I can do everything on my Kindle! Watch Netflix or Hulu or go on Facebook and create documents! Screen and display is perfect even if you download a Movie or Show in Standard instead of HD it still looks like HD!! I just wish downloading movies didn't take up SO much space on the Kindle but it does. Plus it sooo lightweight and pretty. It sucks though that it has no nice and normal screen savers and they're just AD's and if you want them gone you have to pay an extra $15 but some are helpful and they're not too annoying.

I did not know this feature was available when I purchased the tablet. Now I can most watch movies/TV shows offline when Wi-Fi is not available.*** No space problem for my 16GB - I downloaded a full length movie at 720 HD and the available space went from 7.1 to 5.3 for a decrease of about 2 GB. That makes 2 - 720 HD movies downloaded and with my other apps/books the device still has 5.3 GB available... so still plenty of space available. Due to download times I use 720 HD which is still an incredible picture quality due to the small size of tablets.  It's really is a waste of time and space to download 1080 HD... unless the 13\" table down the road is not a myth...*** I love the X-Ray feature showing the movie and TV shows' with the IMDB connection of cast biographies and other their titles, ratings and interesting general trivia...  the IMDB cast changes as the actors change from scene to scene...*** The Dolby sound is amazing.***  In my opinion, the KF may not have the quantity of apps, but does have a ton of 'useful' apps.  The KF and other android tablets have the best euchre app by far... compared to the other non-android tablet...  and I love playing euchre.  The other word and numbers (such as Sudoku) type apps are on par with any other tablet...***  Cannot comment on the camera - who uses a tablet to take pictures anyway?***  THE BEST WARRANTY even when out of the warranty period...  Amazon has replaced several our older KFs which were out of warranty since it was our first problem... that is incredible service.***  I used the Mayday feature and sure enough the response was just a few minutes... he corrected the audio problem quickly which I should have figured out myself in the first place.  He wrote on the screen since I could not hear him.  How cool was that...  and I believe there is no charge for online help even if it is out of the warranty period.Our family has the KF and the other top rated non-android tablet and love both...  one is just too costly for me, but apparently my wife can afford the more expensive one.Insert a product link[Cancel]", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "great tablet", "Author": "CMOR", "ReviewID": "R20QBM9IDEMVDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great for reading and surfing the internet, watching tv,  & playing games.

Live Tech support could only suggest locking in the desired orientation (Options menu).

I had previously purchased my wife a Nook since she is an avid Barnes and Noble shopper, but since I primarily shop for books at Amazon and have purchased quite a few music CDs from Amazon as well, I figured that I might as well go with the Fire HDX. Another factor in my decision was that I had already downloaded the Kindle reading app on my phone and computers and acquired quite a few free books for my library. I am a teacher and having these available on my classroom computer appealed to me.So that is \"why\" I went with the Fire HDX. I decided on the top of the line with everything except for 4G coverage because I figured that I would always have enough content to keep myself occupied between wifi hotspots and would never need the Kindle to download something urgently enough to require it right then when I was not in an area of coverage.I am totally impressed with the display on videos, the music sounds great when connected to quality headphones, and I already have enough books to keep me busy reading for quite a while. I need to remember to utilize my 64gb hard drive since so far everything that I need is sitting in the Amazon cloud. I never was a big gamer fan, but I've downloaded several free games and a few interesting apps and being a traditional guy, I will probably stay with a steady rotation of those when I feel like playing something instead of trying to improve my mind by reading.If I would have to give any negative comment to this device at all, it would have to be that it occasionally doesn't keep up with the buffer on streaming and doesn't play perfectly with a few online video apps like Watch ESPN or CBSSports. So far, I have had only one instance of it needing to catch up with an Amazon Prime video but it wasn't a huge problem and obviously could be remedied if you went ahead and downloaded the video before watching.Speaking of Amazon Prime, it seems many people are upset because all videos are not available with an Amazon Prime subscription. I just started my trial and will spending the next 30 days checking to see what is actually available with Prime. If I cannot find enough of the videos that I want to stream for free, then I will simply discontinue after the free trial. I did the same thing with Netflix because their selection did not have the newest or best videos available for streaming. The same seems to be true of Amazon Prime but I will give them the full trial period before passing judgement.  I suggest everyone check out the videos that are available through Prime before jumping on that wagon.Anyway, the Amazon Fire HDX is everything it says it is and apparently every bit the competitor for the Apple Ipad Air or the Nook, with a display that tips the scales in favor of the Fire HDX.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "kindle", "Author": "joshua diaz", "ReviewID": "R3DX474QQ7G6U0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet is just ok.

I have had a original Fire, and 2012 Fire HD 7\". I wasn't really sure I could justify the upgrade this time, but I had wanted a little larger screen for a long time and really wanted one. I am glad I did. I had a little problem with the first one I received, but called and Amazon got me a replacement on the way immediately. I was able to use the first one until the replacement arrived and then sent back. This one is great. I love the great display, and I really love how light it is! I got a semi hard plastic shell type back for mine so it added almost no weight, after trying some other cases. I just slide that into a sleeve to put in my purse. It is so light weight for the size and is really comfortable to hold for long periods. I am a huge reader and listener of my Amazon Ebooks, so I love how seamlessly it works and syncs with my Kindle Paperwhite and other Fire HD. I actually had tried a Samsung Note for a few days, thinking I would try something different, but I am too much of an Amazon gal, and my books not being available to listen to easily for my commutes just was not working for me. The new Fire HDX is noticeably faster than the HD. I also love that it is much faster and with no interruptions when viewing Prime videos. I have had almost no problems with that. It sounds great and the videos are crisp and clear. I got a Bluetooth speaker I use some when I am up doing stuff around the house, so I can listen to my books or music. It is quickly becoming my constant companion. I was concerned about the lack of the Google play store just like many others. That is the main reason I tried the Samsung first. I do believe however, that the Amazon app store is improving all the time and for what I do, I have adequate apps. I do have a Samsung phone, so I do have access on it for anything I would run across that I couldn't get on my Fire. I think most people will be pleased. Give it a try!

It works a treat for that.The text is clear, adjustable for size, spacing, and font, and easy to read. The \"brown text on cream background\" is nice for reducing glare when reading in a dark room (like in bed or on a plane). Syncing a book between devices is simple.I have a smartphone so didn't want the 3G/4G feature, and I use a PC for mail and word processing.

Am enjoying discovering the toys out there.My only complaint is that the \"auto brightness\" feature leaves the screen too bright.  You can manually set it, but it's fiddly if you have to do it often.  And it's a shame that you can't change the brightness while reading.

I bought it primarily to surf the internet and stream movies and TV on Amazon prime. I have been very happy with those features so far.Browser speed Some people have complained about the browser speed, but it has worked fine for me so far. I've used the HDX to stream a TV show off the internet, and there were no problems there. A screen did pop up saying I needed a flash player, but then another screen popped up saying I could use an experimental Amazon player, and that worked well enough.Screen fingerprintsSome people have complained about fingerprints on the screen, and this can be a problem in certain light. I may invest in a screen cleaning cloth.AppsThe app availability is not as good as the iPad, but I did not buy this to run a bunch of apps. I have an iPhone for that. I did download the Pinterest app and the Facebook app, and I have been satisfied with those so far.PrimeAnother complaint I have seen is the limitations of prime. I agree that there don't seem to be enough shows you can download to your device. Fortunately I have been binge watching The Good Wife, and it was available to download onto my device. It takes a while to download. I ended up letting the episodes download overnight. There are three different download qualities. At first I used the middle quality, but that took too long, so I started downloading with the lowest quality. I'm not really a picture quality snob, so the lowest quality was fine with me. I liked the shorter download time and less memory needed. I have the 16g and had no problems downloading 6 45 minute episodes. It's very easy to delete them as you go. I didn't mind the 48 hour watching window since I watched each episode is one sitting on an airplane.As an ereaderI have an earlier kindle that I use for reading, so I wasn't planning on using this as an eReader. My original kindle is not backlit, so I did end up using my HDX as an ereader while riding in a dark car. It was good for this purpose, but I prefer to read on my other kindle if I am reading for longer periods of time since it is not backlit. I like the dictionary function on the HDX better. It's easier to use since my other kindle is not a touchscreen. I liked how the two kindles synched via the internet, so I could keep my place in my book between devices.Button placementMany people have complained about the on/off switch and volume buttons being located on the back. I would prefer a home button on the front like an iPad, but I've gotten used to the back buttons.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I've had no problems with it whatsoever. I love how lightweight it is and how beautiful the screen resolution is. The battery life is great even when streaming. I also love how much cheaper it is than the iPad.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire", "Author": "S.

Unfortunately, they are still a little behind and need to rethink it a bit.It is great to be able to limit the time a kid spends playing apps when he/she could be reading and nice to be able to control the length of time using the tablet per day and control the hours of the day when it can be used. Bravo. Unfortunately, \"free time\" is designed for kids 8 and under and so much of the functionality of the device is eliminated by running free time. They assume a kid is never going to want to use the camera on the device or listen to music, for example. Access to the internet is blocked and so is access to calendar and address book tools. If a child is 9 and over, there is another level of parental control that allows parents to turn off certain features only--for instance, purchasing, internet browsing and social media. Unfortunately, Amazon fails to recognize that parents might want a means to regulate play time with OLDER kids as well. This method also means that if you are using your own account to provide content to more than one device that everyone will have access to everything on the cloud, whether or not something is age-appropriate.My wishlist of changes:(1) Make a level of \"Free Time\" for kids 9-14(2) Make it possible to play music from \"Free Time\" and give selective access to the music cloud.(3) Make it possible to turn on other functional aspects of the device, such as email capability for certain kids.(4) Make it possible to regulate time spent in certain types of apps or to simply lock some apps in favor of others--e.g. if there are educational apps that get the back-seat while game apps are active.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still considering a return", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Z1EFYLRWXYJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This purchase has been very frustrating.

This is a very powerful tablet with good cameras for a tablet, Includes a good decently loud stereo speakers. The lack of apps and some ui elements are the only thing holding this back, as well as ui customizations. But you are a huge amazon consumer and already part of the Amazon Ecosystem, i see no reason why you wouldn't fall in love with this tablet.Pros:-Thin and light but NOT cheap feeling (except on the first point made below)-Screen is not too small or too big, i really think they hit the sweet spot on this 8.9'' Display, not a huge reach when you want to reach something in the middle and it allows it to be light enough to hold with one hand for a long time.-Bright Gorgeous Screen with high pixel density and great color accuracy.-Stereo Speakers (although not the loudest but it is just a tablet)-Great specs and Graphics-Simplistic UI good for adults and kids Alike-Good Assortment of free apps and free app of the day is a great idea.-Clever UI additions like swiping out the on screen navigation to get to recent apps, as well as, getting new application suggestions based on what you have already below the app.-Great amazon services and quick customer service even on the mayday. Mayday took me all of 10 to 15 seconds to get a live person pretty much every time.-Probably the best reading experience ive ever had on any tablet, hands down. This integration of the tablet with the reading app is fantastic. Its fast fluid and a pleasure to read with, They really picked apart the experience to make it better in pretty much every way, looking up words,authors, more information on the book as well as text customization's that all actually had a function and weren't too complicated and convoluted.Cons:-Bezel Pressing on the short sides lead to discoloration-The back buttons are a great idea and are implemented well enough this time BUT, they are too recessed into the unit and are hard to find and feel for, I never got used to it.-when lightly pressing on the short sides, the screens light seems to bleed into the display discoloring it. It doesn't burn into the screen, its something i noticed with this unit. My other tablets and phones have never done this.-Lack of Customization's even if you want them or not-Notification bar is full screen and seems like a blown up phone UI- The Soft touch back is a finger print magnet making the device look cheap and requiring regular cleaning and wiping down to make it look good.-Taking apps off the recent Carousel is annoying and tedious requiring a long press and hold then a tap on \"Remove from carousel\". This needs a faster and more intuitive way of removing them, especially since it gets so populated quickly with nonsense.-Lack of google Apps, and people should be given to choice to download from either the Play store or the Amazon App Store, but having said that, there app store is respectable has come a long way since the original Kindle fire, by a lot. They should give users the choice but obviously giving them incentive to use and buy the apps from the amazon store when they can find it.Basically this Kindle fire tablet is easy to fall in love with when you first pick it up.Any basic computing tasks are completed without a hiccup. Advanced tasks and gaming are also completed without any hiccups and are absolutely gorgeous on this display. Its Simple yet sexy exterior makes you want to pick it up and get enveloped. Although it not perfect it would be a great choice for Adults and kids and Adults who own it and let they're kids play it. There's parental controls and locks making this convenient.I wouldn't have trouble recommending this tablet to anyone looking for a fast simple and intuitive tablet experience, especially for adults.

First of all, for a premium tablet, the Kindle Fire doesn't have GPS.  Secondly, you are SEVERELY limited in what you can do with this tablet.  Amazon really only wants you to use for reading their books and watching their movies.  They realized that they couldn't sell a tablet without games, so have a limited set of games available.  This is NOT an Android tablet.  Amazon took the Android operating system and seriously customized it, removing the ability to use any browser other than the one they wrote (at least one if not ore generations behind current Chrome, Firefox, or Opera), you can't use the Google Play Store, you have to use Amazon's store, which doesn't have near the variety of apps.All in all, it is disappointing that Amazon advertises this as an iPad competitor, when it is so ridiculously limited.**Update** based on a comment, I will be more accurate and say that you can't run a browser other than Silk without sideloading it...in other words, you cannot download another browser from the Amazon App Store, you have to change a setting to allow loading apps from unknown sources, then load the browser apk file from another website or device...something that many folks that aren't tech-savvy will not want to do.My assessment still stands as-is...great hw (except missing GPS) but overly restrictive, modified OS.**Update** after using it for several months now, I bumped it up to 4 stars because I find that I do very little with it outside of reading and watching videos of my granddaughter.  For that, it is performing admirably.

As when PPI gets above what Apple calls a retina screen, my peepers cannot tell the difference).  So don't worry about the screen, either tablet presents what is being displayed in a gloriously bright and clear manner.One item that I do wish Apple had included (In an aesthetically pleasant way, of course) is a microSD slot which would allow quick transfers of data without an additional dongle that plugs into the Lightning port.  The kindle provides this out of the box.The OS that is installed on the Kindle is what is irks me the most of all and is the reason I wouldn't suggest the purchase over an iPad Air.  The kindle has an obvious purpose here and it has become overtly advertised with the discounted kindles like the Fire HDX that ruins the feel that you are getting a premium product; \"Special Offers!\" Once you realize what Amazon's true goal of the Kindle Fire is; to try to sell you more products from Amazon based upon what you do with your tablet, or should I call it their tablet as you are losing your privacy from where you are when you do whatever it is that you do with that* kindle.This is a deal breaker to me as I know how iOS on the iPad Air was designed and who it was designed for; the business sector and Apple users that think like the designers.  The iOS operating system is very detailed about when it is going to provide personally identifiable information to an application regardless of developer (Apple or any other).  Apple also does not let out any applications that attempt to gain user information without absolute transparency and asking first.  This walled garden is something that cannot have a price attached to it.With the Kindle HDX, you are paying for a device that is letting a company know what you are doing with their tablet at all times. When you consider this factor in the pricing hype over the Kindle HDX you would not be alone to wonder what they are paying you to use their tablet over a protected Apple iPad Air. (I cannot stop thinking of this tablet like those free* internet providers that  were around a few years back as well as those companies that used to give you a free computer that used these same targeted advertising techniques Amazon has rediscovered and deployed with the Kindle HDX).I expect Amazon to keep information on what I search their site for and what I purchase from them.  But this is where I feel our relationship should stop.  If you are comfortable with this information keeping aspect of the Kindle Fire and the absence of a large, tested and safe marketplace of applications and add-ons from tripod mounts to microphones to lens attachments and more.  The Kindle Fire HDX might be good for you. Be sure to try one out first at a Best Buy where you can compare it to the iPad Air.I will continue to use my regular Paperwhite Kindle, to read eBooks.  This is one thing the Kindle Fire can't do, surprisingly.  But to get that paper-like look you need an eINK display not a high resolution one like the Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad Air have.For my peace of mind, I am going to return the one I purchased to the store and stomach the slightly higher price of the iPad Air.

I wouldn't consider that excellent but OK.The wireless connection on my HDX gave out several times. Uncertain as to why as my other wireless devices were working just fine from the same location and only a few feet from the wireless router. I've read other reviews where this was a problem. Perhaps a driver upgrade for the wireless would fix the issue at a later time.For the most part, my HDX lived up to the hype but at the end of the day, I just couldn't justify spending this money on an android device which won't play nice and allow downloading/installing Google apps.Amazon simply doesn't have enough apps to fit my needs and for this reason, I had to reluctantly return it.I've read about ways to circumvent this and get some Google apps installed but it's simply not worth the hassle for me.Seems Google, Apple and Amazon all want people feeding from their trough and their trough only.

However, most apps were available through the Amazon App store.  Other things, like Google Maps, was available in it's full version using the Silk browser, which is really fast as well.  And if you really need an app you can't find in the Amazon App store, there are simple ways to get your apps from Google without needing to root your device.  Just search online...it's really easy.The only thing this tablet is missing that I can find is the lack of a GPS.  But for $170 less than an iPad, and for a faster processor and better display than almost any other tablet on the market, I can live without a GPS.

When tying it onto the Prime membership, it makes it a winning combination. There are a few reasons why I can't give 5 stars to this Kindle:1. No Google integration - Yes, I know what everyone else will say. If you really want that you should've bought either Google hardware or go with Samsung, etc. Sure, you're right. But no, that doesn't mean Google integration should not be part of the package. What happened if Google decided not to support any Amazon app (and just removed them all from Play store)? I wish Amazon would just allow Google apps in and let the market decide who they want to go with. Again, this hardware is just plain beautiful.2. Problem with speakers - Within the first few weeks I had a problem with speakers where they just stopped working.After reaching out to Mayday (awesome service, Amazon!) the service person suggested that I would insert/remove headphone jack and see if that would fix the issue. It did immediately. The person went on to say that it was a known issue and product development was working on it. I just wish there was some communication/fix on the issue already.Overall this is a great device. I am still enjoying it very much and look forward to updates to the ecosystem.

Connecting to my WiFi was simple and without problems.  Adding the device to my existing Verizon account did require my calling Verizon's tech support, but that's probably because I live out from town and wasn't getting a strong enough signal.  However, Verizon tech support was very helpful and quickly resolved the problem.  There was also a glitch connecting to my email account on my ISP, but that seems to have been a problem at their end, and has been resolved.  Connecting to my Gmail account was seamless.I've found the frequent complaint of not enough apps (compared to as standard Android) to be a non issue for me.  I've had no problem finding the apps I need and want, or acceptable replacements in cases where the ones I'm use to aren't available.It would be nice if the HDX came with Google maps/navigator installed, but I have that on my phone, so it's not a big issue.  Besides Map Quest maps/navigation is free at the Kindle app store.  It may not be quite up to Google maps, but then again, maybe it is.  I really haven't an opportunity to try it yet.All in all, I'm pleased with my device, and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I've only had it for one day.=======================  Comments added on 2/27/2014 ==================================================I'm now two weeks into owning my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (Verizon), and I've added another star to my rating to make it a 5-star rating.  I stand by all my comments above, and would like to add that I find the management and use of my Kindle library so much easier with this tablet than with my old (Gen. 3, I think) Kindle.  With this device I get to see the cover of the book I'm reading each time I open it on the carrousel, so I can remember the name of the book I'm reading.  On my old Kindle, I usually only saw the title and author when I first started reading and quickly forgot both (hey, I'm 70 years old).I've installed Waze navigation app, and it works very well - not that I will use my tablet often for navigation, but it's nice to have.Like most, if not all, Android based tablets, it doesn't get as strong a 4G or 3G signal as my Android phone, but I'm usually connected to WiFi, so that's not particularly important to me, which I'm sure begs the question of why did I buy a 4G model to begin with.  The answer is simple - I wanted to.All in all I find the Kindle Fire HDX far superior to my wife's Android tablet, and I'm very pleased with it.  So far, I've found no down side.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent, fast with beautiful display", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R3NP8GGV0UQAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave the Kindle Fire HDX 4 stars because of not having access to Google Play Store for even more apps. The \"plus\" is you are allowed to install apps from 3rd parties via a selection in the setting menu. I sometimes have the need to remote in to our servers at work using RDP. I can do that with the Kindle Fire HDX. I tried several RDP apps available through Amazon and the results weren't satisfactory. I got an app from a 3rd party and now I seamlessly access the servers I need to get to and can even access my workstation desktop.
