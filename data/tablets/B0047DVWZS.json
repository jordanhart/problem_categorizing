{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Step Closer", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R3MU84B6T9NYD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "iPad pros and cons", "Author": "Larry J. Crockett", "ReviewID": "R4VCE1TBRME86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.October 18 2011 Update:I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.I just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.I guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's cool, but has its flaws - and do you really need one?", "Author": "J. Harvey", "ReviewID": "R1YNKZ8Y1IOMEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.If you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?This is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.Advantages:If you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.The iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.The only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.For me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.Wi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.If you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.Limitations:The iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.The screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.Although the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.If you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!A lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.Despite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).The thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparison of my IPad 2 with my Xoom", "Author": "A", "ReviewID": "R3RXN27YVJW4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.External appearance and feel:The iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.Both weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.Both have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.Hardware performance:The Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.User Interface:The iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.Operating System:The iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.Applications:iPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.Browsing:Because of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.Camera:I don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.Speakers:The Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.Battery life:Difficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.Internal storage:The Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.External storage:The Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.User Experience:The iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.The Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.Support:Apple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.Bottom line:I believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.If I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.Update 7/5/2011We have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.However, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.Another problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.The iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.For us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.Update 7/7/2011The Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Went from \"why do I need it\" to \"Can't live without it\"", "Author": "C. A. Sinclair \"doctorcreation\"", "ReviewID": "R1FENBQH0LHSET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-onlyA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.DELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)FORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.APP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.SLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.HDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.iOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.PROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.SATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)HOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.SCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.PRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptopAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.BATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)WIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.DISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)FILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?PRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!CAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.COST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.TOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.WISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)Touchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.USB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)Retina displayInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)GPSCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.Smartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A few things that haven't been covered...", "Author": "Expert Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1HDDISACYGGRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.I will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.In summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "honeymoon is over", "Author": "bkluvr", "ReviewID": "R35YBRP4F9OZZ8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i bought this from apple because amazon didn't have it yet.  I am middle- aged, love my nano, a kindle devotee from the first days, don't have a smart phone, and am a pc user.  at first i was awed by the touchscreen and the resolution quality.  images are gorgeous.  but now, it is really annoying.  too often the screen doesn't respond, and then reacts when you don't even know you're touching it.  the word processing function has been limited and limiting from the start, for someone accustomed to microsoft.if you think in buying the ipad you are getting a  compact, fast, light computer, you are not.  it IS fast.  a computer it is not.  no flash player is definitely a hinderance.  what it is great for is apps, games, (although the screen has been frustrating there too), watching movies and tv shows,  some browsing on the internet, and as a portable photo album, because images are truly fantastic on the ipad.  i find the screen very fatiguing on my eyes, and have the brightness level down almost as far as it can go.  i would never dream of reading a book on it.  kindle has nothing to worry about, as far as the ipad as a reading device.  the fact i can't see the ipad  screen outside, even in the shade, is also unfortunate, but i get it, that's a backlit screen.i am submitting this review not to bash apple, but to clarify a bit to people not familiar with macs and/or touchscreens what this device is about.  would i buy this device again? not unless it sold for maybe $300.  it is more a toy than a tool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "RFX4JZ7CUL8NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.The above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"Right now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.For those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.Also if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.There is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.These above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.I absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.I also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.

Lleras", "ReviewID": "R3SEXRV40Z31JD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.Why do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.Portability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.For those of you debating between the 3GAT&T;, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T; has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you dont need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.You will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.Overall my score goes as followsComfort and portability A+Battery Life A+App Diversity and usability A+Interface A+Expandibility C (I dont need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)TV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)Cammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)Other thoughts:Get a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.Get a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.Investigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.Be realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :To begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.You will be able to:-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around-Send and Receive Emails-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection-Watch Videos and Movies-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)-Download and Play Games-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)You will NOT be able to:-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :THE WIZARDSNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.The iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!Once the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!APPSThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.Apps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.LOADING PICTURESThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.THE PICTURE FRAMEWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.Tip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!PRINTINGPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.It is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.Finally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!If you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.The iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"Good luck!*** update 12th October 2011 ***Apple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)Amongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes.

It seemed as if the screen was a touch screen, and he was having what appeared to be a video chat with another law enforcement agent on the thing. This was an idea of a gadget that the creators of the story and movie thought they would see in the distant future, like 2020's or 2030's. An awesome portable, touch screen device that had most, if not all the functionality of a PC, but smaller than a book. It's not 2020 something, though, and I realized that I had a much better, sleeker, and if I might say more futuristic looking device that performed as described right next to me. It was the iPad2.Now, I'm no Apple fanboy. Not in the least. I grew up using Windows machines at home, and my only experience with Apple before buying my first ipod touch 4G was in the \"computer lab\" in elementary school. But, last June I picked up the iPod touch 4G like I said, and I was blown away. It was so easy to use. So portable, so fast. I didn't like one thing, though, and it was the fact that the damn screen was too small to really use it for all the things that you could use it for other than just music and videos, like surfing the net, or using any of the million apps available. My hands were just too big.This was a problem. I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and the next step up on the Apple mobile line was the iPad2, and the 32GB version that I wanted was around $600! Thats a lot of money. And I already had an iPod, and at least two other Windows based machines that are very fast and up to date. It just didn't make sense to really buy the thing.I just kept falling more and more in love with the iPod touch, though, and more particularly with iOS and how well it performed. Everything worked and made sense. You wanted music, you hit the music \"button\" on the screen. Email you say? After you set up your account you just press the mail button. Pretty simple. The touch gestures are amazing too. The responsiveness and speed at which the device reacts is amazing. And its so smooth, people. Seriously, if you haven't handled an iOS5(when I got the ipod touch it was iOS4 i think, but the update is awesome) device you owe it to yourself to try it. Its incredible.But, I was still using that super tiny screen, and I couldn't send an email because my fingers would hit like 3 keys at a time and it would take a year to type it all out correctly. Surfing the net, although super fast and smooth, was horrible because typing a web address took a long time. What was I to do? I just gave up on using the iPod for anything other than media, and the occasional youtube video. I still played games on it, but even with the games, I really wanted a bigger, brighter screen.I started to look for reasons to buy the iPad2, and I couldn't come up with any. Not for about two months, at least, until my girlfriend said she needed a laptop and didn't really have any money to buy one. Bingo. I would give her the laptop, and even though she lives with me and I can still use the thing, I'll be down a machine and it leaves an opening for me to replace it. Right? Right!Off to my local retailer(sorry amazon)I go. 30 minutes later(store is literally right down the street from me) and I'm at home, updating the operating system and transferring all of my previous purchases and then I'm up and running. I was blown away.I knew what I was getting, a much bigger version of the iPod touch 4G. And, I got exactly that, and a whole lot more. First, the screen size is a huge plus. Much bigger than the iPod touch of course, and more than big enough to handle any number of tasks or games, or whatever. The keys on the touch screen keyboard are a really good size. No missed keys here people. And my fingers aren't small. The screen is so bright, and it just begs you to touch it. Movies and videos look great, and the web and all the apps are very vivid. This thing just looked great.It was lightweight too, and very thin. Physically this thing is like a very thin composition pad. Actually, much thinner than a composition book. About the same weight, though. Overall, the dimensions and weight make this thing ultra portable.If you're at all familiar with iOS you know about the apps, and they're pretty much all great. There are quite a few that are free as well, so don't let that stop you. In fact, some of the best games and apps available are free, or are just a buck so its not that bad. They range from super useful to super fun. Everything from photo transferring(desktop/laptop to ipad without USB)to remote desktop connection, to Grand Theft Auto is available, and almost anything you can think of has an app. Need a level? You can get one on your ipad for free. Want to tweak a photo? Get photo toaster jr for free and get tweaking. The apps are a real strong point for this device, and they make up for some of short comings of the device(more on that later.The battery last forever. Ten hours is more than enough for me. Plus you get a wall charger and a usb style hook up that you can use to hook up to your car if you have the adapter. Sweet.Like I said, processing speed is very quick, and it handles everything I throw at it all day long with no problems. Videos run without clipping or lag time and apps load up and run perfectly. I never have any freezes or crashes. Awesome.I can't say enough good things about this thing. Really. I can say few bad things as well. I wouldn't say bad, but you know, not what I would want from a \"perfect\" device.First, there are no USB ports. This sucks. There are apps that like I said earlier will help you transfer photos and videos, and documents, but it would be better if you could just plug directly in to the device.Second, you can't charge this thing with your laptop. Or I can't. It has to be plugged into the wall. Not too bad, but it sucks if you need to charge and you have laptop full of juice but no outlet.The biggest problem I have is the price point. Honestly, this thing is worth double what they want for it in my opinion. It will redefine how you look at computing in general. It is so much more intimate. But, even with that said, I think I have the right after purchasing to complain about the price a little. Again, worth every penny, but really pricey and I had to save up for the thing, and that sucks sometimes.Other than that, go buy this thing. Seriously. And shame on you if you think you can get what this thing delivers from a Kindle. Those guys are playing a very bad game of catch up. And they're going to lose. Think Android to compete with the iphone. I've used both. Androids are horrible. Epic fail. Now Amazon wants to lose money trying to compete with a legend. Trust me, if you want mobile, go Apple.

These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.It should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.The virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.The battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.The charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life.

I tried the MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi) and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.Storage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T; or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T; or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T; and Verizon models allow for the same thing.This new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.For me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much More Than the Novelty I Thought I was Buying", "Author": "D. Reinstein \"marindavid\"", "ReviewID": "RQTYDX3UXR5S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "One Word:  Splashtop", "Author": "Mastodan \"Mastodan\"", "ReviewID": "RHCCZCFW5SYMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"This sunlight is OK, I guess, I mean it provides all my food I suppose, but I have to give it zero stars out of 5 because I danced naked outside one day and it totally gave me a sunburn.\"I swear, this is what it sounds like when people complain about new technology.  Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.Look, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.Gripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.

I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.You can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.The size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.These are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.In a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never thought I would actually use one--Now that I have it, I can't live without it", "Author": "Aerfally", "ReviewID": "R3574RJ9KZHVB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great gadget.

No, the iPad does not replace my macbook pro at all, and I do wish that the iPad had better graphics, but for what it is right now, the iPad is by far the best tablet out there (and I've played with a few Android tablets my co-workers have) and surprisingly (very, at first) useful, both personally and professionally. And no, I am not an Apple fanboy, as I do have an Android phone (need a keyboard).The selection of quality apps is also unparalleled.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I've Become A Believer", "Author": "Crabigail Cassidy \"Crabby Abby\"", "ReviewID": "R1NFS10I80MZDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was apprehensive re: dropping a nice piece of change on a tablet and wasn't really sure if I really needed a tablet. I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.Throwing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due tofaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ipad 2, nothing compares", "Author": "B. brown \"moemoe\"", "ReviewID": "R25RQT0IN6XCBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing I can say bad about the Ipad 2.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R19T31K0U5YVUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad2 64GB 3GS (\"iPad2\" in this review) really is a nice-to-have device.  For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.The iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.The iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.My main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.In the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money. Overrated and under delivers.", "Author": "Flux Capacitor", "ReviewID": "R1V7N5D7CU210G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to know what I was missing and apparently it was my money.You're dependent on iTunes and it's junk. Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?Apple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.Good for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.I had to try it and regret the purchase.Simple tasks could be A LOT easier.------------------------------------------------------------------After wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.The solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.The PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.I tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.Apple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.Very disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.------------------------------------------------------------------The more i use it, the more I hate it.  This weekend I received a message from iCloud Backup that has rendered my iPad completely useless.  When I tap OK to dismiss the message it keeps coming back.

Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.Here's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:OS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.Camera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.Video Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.Screen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.Browsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.Photos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.Video:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.Email: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.Downloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.Games:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.Bluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.Apps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.Viewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.In conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.Buying advice: If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet on the market for now... I'm looking at you google", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R1WA14IGR0EPJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never \"needed\" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I havent noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.December 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but dont work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.April 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.The iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "A warning about where to purchase an ipad 3G", "Author": "Denny", "ReviewID": "R3B4UDIYMEUZLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you buy from Apple, the 3G is either $15 or $25 per month as the SIM is included, but if you buy the ipad with 3G from anyone else, you must go get the microSIM card from either ATT or Verizon depending on what model ipad you purchased.

I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.Obviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N; nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.As for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.Printing from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.I also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.If you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.Overall very happy with my purchase!!!I wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.

I agree with most of the reviews stating \"If you own the first one, you can skip the 2nd\".  The iPad 2 is faster but the iPad 1 is still pretty darn fast.  The only only reason why I bought the iPad 2 was for the front facing camera which is pretty cool.For the gamers I downloaded Deadspace, which is designed to take advantage of the iPad 2's enhanced graphics.  I have to say it's a good looking game and should start to scare Microsoft and Playstation since Apple is starting to further encroach on the gaming market.  I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.  The only thing really holding the iPad back gaming wise is the lack of a bluetooth controller, I hate using the screen as a controller!If you don't own an iPad I definitely recommend you buy one, it's pretty amazing :P.

I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit.

One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).The camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.It is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.Yes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet.

I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't \"magic\" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever.

Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb.

I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend.

The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology.

It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.iPad vs Kindle.Initially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.***********************3G and GPS Chip.I am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.The GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.Waze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....Motion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.

I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.That aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.Lots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.Apple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.A word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.------Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.---------THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.

But here's why:1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.Overall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.).

When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.However, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.I had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returning Mine", "Author": "Steve Kraner", "ReviewID": "RPGXM1ILH327S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Christmas I got a Kindle Fire for my wife, thinking it was simple and easy to use for a non-techie.

It does a lot more than just eBooks.In turn, she got me an iPad, since I like tech toys and have been a long-time Apple and iTunes user. I worked for hours to get the iPad to do simple things like synch my music with no luck.Apple is now so intent on push marketing, like the Genius function in iTunes, that it interferes with basic functionality.I also couldn't get it to connect to my MobileMe account- apparently Apple sets up new iPads up so you cannot access MobileMe even if you have an account.The \"Genius Bar\" at the local Apple Store in Reston - which has traditionally been a good resource the few times I needed it - could not help and was manned by people who didn't care and who knew less about the software and devices than I did. They were also rude to my daughter on a visit. So I went with her the next time and got the same poor treatment and not a single problem on my list fixed.Apple is having a lot of success, but I'm concerned they may also be getting arrogant.If you are considering an iPad - beware it may be a time-sink.

So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldnt stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.So I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.If you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.For now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets.

VonCamper", "ReviewID": "R2LAI9RDEW7FTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)I've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).My history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.To recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.This second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.It's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.As far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.What makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.My iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T; smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).This tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.As for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.Importantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.As for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.I hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.

Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.PROs:It's amazingly fast.Amazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.It turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".Loads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.Tons of content available, much of it free or just $.99Built well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.It's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.CONs:Sadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.If you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.Lack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.Text ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.Safari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).If you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.The war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.SUMMARY:Despite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.However even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.Thanks for reading.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "thought I was buying new product", "Author": "edsnpw", "ReviewID": "R33LNBFFDXLG3Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was in the process of purchasing 26 iPad 2s over a period of 3 months for my employer when Apple switched to the new model and stopped selling the iPad 2 32GB that I need.

I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.Hardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.Cases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418). I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.iOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-Battery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+Speed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+Weight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. AOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.All in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the  Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you.

The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.

I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):Favorites:1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.Least Favorite:1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.Overall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.Advice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3).

Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.Anyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.Cameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.Then there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.For a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).If you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.There aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.There are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.This tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simplified Everything!", "Author": "LF2011", "ReviewID": "R52PF2HED3Y8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.I'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.The one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.Set up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...The Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.The battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.I very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.The Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.Overall, I couldn't be happier with it!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK gift", "Author": "A Scott", "ReviewID": "R3LDFTAAZWXXHU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift.

My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).The iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.My complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.I purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.

Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.The Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.And the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.Where the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).Other than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant.

The unit was described as having 3 scratches which upon arrival were very minimal and acceptable - especially after putting it in a case.  Seems brand new actually!

Instead I want to share my experiences living with the iPad 2 for about a year now.The main use for this device has been web surfing while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.  There's no doubt that we're moving to a multi-screen world and it's nice to be able to look something up on IMDB.com when watching something on TV or to check your email during a commercial break while watching a ballgame.  It is not my main web surfing machine, I don't have the best eyes and I'm addicted to my 24\" screen on my desktop, but the iPad does nicely for light web use.As an e-reader the iPad 2 isn't horrible, it's just nowhere near as good as a Kindle which means the only things that really get read on the iPad are books I have in PDF files, such as a Photoshop manual where having a nice color display really helps.  We've read some magazines on it, but the screen is really too small to make the a comfortable experience for me.  Your mileage may vary here as some people I know love reading magazines on an iPad.  For me, that experience will be better when there is an iPad that has about a 12\" screen size.One thing the iPad is really good at is playing videos.  With streaming apps getting better and better, like the HBO GO app, it's making the iPad more and more useful.  It's nice to be able to take your content anywhere you want in the house.  The screen is absolutely beautiful for playing video content, and once again for extended viewing I'd like a screen that's just a tad bigger than this current one.The performance of the iPad 2 is very nice, everything feels snappy and I've really never felt like the processor was being bogged down while using it.  It feels very nice in the hand and is very sturdy.There is no doubt about it, tablets are useful and they're entertaining but I don't see them ever replacing desktops or laptops for me.  I do a lot of design work though, so my needs are different than most people.  If you're looking for something to check email, surf the web and catch some video content then the iPad will be perfect for those needs.The bottom line is if you're going to get a tablet it's still hard to beat an iPad.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad 2 WiFi", "Author": "baydogs", "ReviewID": "RSDSQK2UZUWTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had Apple products except for an iPod.

In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.The cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.Overall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop.

I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.Ok, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android.

I held off on purchasing an iPad2 because of the cost and because I was fearful it would spend $730 for something I would later stash away nver to use again.

I listen to music, watch movies, and play with fun, educational apps.  I have work-related apps.  I use it for my local government role so I do not need to print paper forms and other official documents.  I buy apps but I love the free ones.  It is a challenge to find useful apps for free.  I can manage my investments with it.  I can use Google Earth and travel the world.I no longer consider my iPad2 just a toy.  It is an intregal part of my life as I can quickly check emails and get headline news.  I can follow sports teams and have my music collection.  It is awkward to bring along during hikes, but I do have it in my car for the music.  I have podcasts and iBooks.

Hui", "ReviewID": "R3HY8KYKA5S8WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was \"good enough\" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more \"future proof\" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.Though it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.Which leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :PMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h.264 as the go to streaming media format.The iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.I paired my iPad with the perfect;KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2(I found one \"used-like new\" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)Originally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.Very happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great information tool that is light weight and extremely mobile", "Author": "djrolandg", "ReviewID": "R37M46U7TN21KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking mobility?

I have even dropped it and it didn't shatter and it was fine.  It's pretty darn sturdy.  I love the fact the learning curve is so easy, and it's customizable.Okay this is an update - I have had my Ipad 2 now for six months and I still love it!  I order pretty much all my books for the Kindle application that's on the Ipad2, the games are amazing, I just ordered Bard's Tale and it's amazing!Will I buy an Ipad3, oh you bet I will, I can't wait to see what other products Apple comes out with.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Evolutionary, not revolutionary", "Author": "Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"", "ReviewID": "R1SQPSOQTNJLUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.As far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.It does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.There is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.The cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.There is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.Apple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.If you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad IOS 7", "Author": "Hong", "ReviewID": "R2O5VO42TUI06K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My IPAD2 was good when I used IOS6.

I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.BUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)The screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.- Personalization .1/5Apple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.- Size 2.3/5Frankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.- Battery Life 5/5...I sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.- Display ...The part we've all been waiting for...Honestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5I thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.If you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.- Versatility 5/5I use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it.

As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...- Great keyboard (virtual).- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )Could have been better:- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.I don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ?

A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this \"new and improved\" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.For starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the \"checkerboard effect.\"  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.The one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really \"smart\" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.If you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet. For now, my suggestion is save your money, cherish your original iPad, and wait until an \"upgraded\" product comes along that actually presents some significant improvements.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A new way of computing", "Author": "BobinmidMO", "ReviewID": "R2AEG670Y3HN9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a geek for friends and family I have already taken delivery of my IPad 2 32GB WI-FI + 3G with AT&T; even though they're still in short supply because of all the sadness that's hit Japan, even though 4 week delivery times are being promised, don't expect it this fast.

Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.Another surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.

About 2 weeks ago I had a heart attack and my Dr. Told me that I need to have a 1000 cal diet and work out a lot more.  Well I couldn't use my phone for the calory counting, too small.  Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.  I'm not going to talk about how cool it is to serf the web, and do business on it...  I have a 16 g white iPad.

Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Java!", "Author": "amikeliunas", "ReviewID": "R3E2COPAC0ZI3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Most people are aware that iPads don't run Flash based content.IPad has its own YouTube browser to compensate for this design flaw.However, no one mentions that you can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone!!!There are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.Java is still #1 or #2 language in the world for developing applications.Because Apple had an internal war with Adobe and Sun, the consumers suffer and received a product that has a limited feature set.Check with this url [...]Steve Jobs has been quoted as saying \"Java's not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore.

Well, I went looking for apps....and guess what, there arent any for those websites. UGH! No updates, apps, or workarounds. Im stuck using it for emails and some websites, and a few apps. My mistake as I should have known they used Flash. Im just glad I didnt buy a 3G model or I really would have tossed more cash in the fire. I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now. I would have been much better off with another of the competitors that used flash.Also there is very limited expandability. This is more of a gadget and not a computer or even a netbook. At least I can get on websites and use it with a netbook.It will allow me to stay connected through emails and some do some slow surfing, but thats really the extent of it.This is a very sad disappointment for business use....", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incorrect item", "Author": "Techie", "ReviewID": "RKSO53V0MQRGP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received an iPad but it was not the 64 GB AT&T; WiFi 3G white iPad I paid for.

Last year, I played around with a friends original iPad and decided to be patient and wait for the iPad 2.  So glad I did, the iPad 2 is FAST.  Apps open instantaneously and it is a sleek machine.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I realize that the iPad 3 will probably have some major upgrades but if you have waited for the iPad 2 just get one and enjoy it.

This Ipad 2 is very easy to use and can be used for almost anything. Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesn\u2019t own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don\u2019t have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it. This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. It\u2019s glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. There\u2019s no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don\u2019t have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didnt have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you havent seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action.I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it. It is very reliable for anything and the design of it makes it easy to use anywhere you go!", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great iPad, but not enough memory.", "Author": "GA506", "ReviewID": "R56IR6VZGKMXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this iPad for my son.

A good one, of course.PROS:Weight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.Design: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.Durability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.Display: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.Apps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.Camera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.Battery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.Performance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.Features: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.Overall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.Sent from my iPad", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product/Great seller", "Author": "dabrown", "ReviewID": "R3245CIL86TL5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an excellent package; iPad, cove and external keyboard.

After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i dont need active wifi for his apps to work. I wish that ipad existed with my other children. I like that he is learning on current to future technology that most daycares or preschools can not provide.  I recommend this to any parent.

An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy.

I love apple products but tablets pricing has gone down so much that IPad is just getting too expensive.  There are 10 inch tablet from Google Nexus 10 with better spec than latest Ipad and it's cheaper than Ipad 2 that I bought.  I see so many other companies such as Idolian with their Studio 10 that works better than IPad 2 and cost only $250.

It is so easy to use and so useful. I bought the one without the cellular data ability. I didn't want to have to pay for a data plan and saved money on the cost of the iPad. That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.If I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant.

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?There are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.The devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?Cons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:Lack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.Lack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.Faster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.Siri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad is like no other tablet on the market!", "Author": "Granna", "ReviewID": "R1O8TKOWQEI5E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple's reputation for quality is unsurpassed in thier tablet.

I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.I also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.Oh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.I have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad. I'm leaving a review for that next...but stop reading this! Get your iPad if you want one!", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Product, But A Few Flaws", "Author": "24_fan", "ReviewID": "R1YK6BNOGNV8SO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had won an iPad 2 a few months ago by filling out a survey. Overall, i am very happy with the iPad 2. It is the 32GB model, so i have the extra storage. I have at least 70 apps and 3 songs and no videos on it and i only use up about 10GB so far. The ability to back up all of your documents, apps, music, etc. ti iCloud is a great feature. You get 5GB of free storage but then you can buy additional storage if you need it.EmailThe ability to check email on it is a great feature. I use the Xfinity Mobile App instead of the mail app though so the emails will delete and be marked as read on my computer too, not just my iPad.WebThe ability to go on the web right from my iPad is also another great feature. If i need to look something up real quick i can just use the iPad instead of waiting for my computer to boot up.PrintingOne area that the iPad does need improvement in is the ability to print from it. We originally had a WiFi printer from Lexmark but did not have Airprint in it which is what you need to print from the iPad. So, i went to the store and bought a Kodak printer that says you can print from iPod, iPad, iPhone on it. I thought that that means that it has Airprint which is what you need to print from the iPad. Come to find out it doesn't have Airprint in it, BUT, you can download an app that lets you print from your iPad. So i get the printer all set up, connect it to my network, and try out the app. You need to save a screenshot of the screen you want to print from, the send it to the app which sends it to the printer, and it worked fine. Was just hoping i could use Airprint, but maybe next time.Flash PlayerI was a little dissapointed to find out that the iPad doesn't have a flash player built in. I can't open emails with videos in it or stuff on the web that requires flash player. I think apple should put built in flash player on the iPad, beacuse if they are going to compete against the Kindle Fire which has flash player, then they should seriously consider flash player.

It still isn't a full-fledged replacement for a computer, but it's close. iOS 5 is a great step toward that kind of functionality and further improves a product I already loved. I use it for classes, entertainment, work, and as an interactive toy for my 2 year-old son. He LOVES the Sandra Boynton apps and is confused by the physical book versions since the characters don't move like they do on the iPad 2.This was a great purchase for me and my family that we will enjoy for years to come.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "So much more than I hoped for!", "Author": "Mom of 6 \"Jess\"", "ReviewID": "R1VGVM0BT4THVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did my homework & spent months comparing tablets & laptops against the iPad2. Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.The iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, \"tiny nooooooo touchy TV\".I LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!I knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "IPad 2", "Author": "Cynthia Mcguffin", "ReviewID": "R257Y7YILAIZCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been VERY pleased with my purchase!

They provide you a very portable second screen. I happened to pick the iPad 2 after a lot of research with other tablets.I am away from home a lot during the day for work and class and also at night as I study. As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.iPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!The End*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory. I now own many Apple products. I am also a fan of Microsoft, work on Win XP and 7 at work everyday and have no issues with Windows. I also play pretty hard on the Xbox 360 in my down time.

One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.Software:iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.Overall:It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen.

I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).Granted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.I'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).

Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.In fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).Tablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h.264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!The really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.Like I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...Oh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...The Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...My Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.With the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.Apple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.To make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:1. Close all the apps on your iPad2. Shut down your iPad3. Restart Apple TV4. Start your iPad5. Turn on screen sharing6. Start HuluThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?That will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.I will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.That said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.I am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.If you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!See what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.I used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.I bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.But iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...I used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.Did I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!Apple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)You should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.Just like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry.

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:The IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get \"some\" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "very poor customer service", "Author": "angela scott", "ReviewID": "RNDLIK2AOFOX5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to return this item and company was giving me a hard time about it.

I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.Here it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.I don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.I have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.No, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time.

In fact, this product and its ancestors are completely disappointing in order to use the Internet due to the lack of abilities in installing a variety of softwares such as adobe flash player. According to a number of restrictions by apple, anyone has to use just what has been installed on this device and so its usage is absoloutely rigid. For instance, you are unable to watch showtimes on IMDB because of its weakness to install flash player. I dont like a company with business purposes enforce me to use just something particular even if its products are so attractive. Also, its transferring data, as a wifi device, is entirely disappointing since such products are new and their technologies haven't been improved as good as you might expect. Remember if you are fan of spending money for gaming go ahead and buy it because this device has been planned for gaming. While you are using free games on this device, some adds appears on the screen and will not let you to enjoy free games.
