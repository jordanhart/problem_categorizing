Except for a small capacity battery, it performs everything very well. If you plug in an Anker or New Trent USB battery into the mini USB port it will charge while it plays video or loads webpages. It also has a full size usb port which will play movies from a 128 GB USB drive.The other niceties include HDMI out, power adapter, external volume control and a single mono speaker on the back left corner.Note: Viewing angle is very limited. The screen loses its color and turns gray if tablet is tilted. Volume could be louder.Note: It took ten days to ship from New York to San Francisco via USPS.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F4MTU5A"}}
