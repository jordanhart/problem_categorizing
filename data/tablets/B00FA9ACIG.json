I love this tablet, my portable 13\" TV. I've got 3 10\" tablets, several 7\" tablets, a laptop, desktop and Windows phone. I wanted this tablet for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu plus. It's excellent for all that! I've had no problems connecting to wifi whatsoever.. Unlike my iPad, Win8 tablet & 10\" Android I can hear movies just fine on this 13.3\" Hannspree without ear phones or ear buds. The speakers are on the front and nice and loud. I've also got Bluetooth headphones I use in bed if my husband is asleep. The Bluetooth connects instantly and stays solid the entire time.Someone mentioned the viewing angles were really bad. For some reason if the tablet is turned with the speakers at the top you can see from every angle no matter how far you lay the tablet down. That's the way I happen to have it when watching a movie so the speakers are right there.It's not as portable as a 7-10\" tablet...but I didn't get it to carry it around when I'm out and about. I got it for movie/TV watching at home. The description about battery life said it only got about 4 hrs battery life. So NOT true! I'm getting between 9-10 hrs battery life while watching Netflix and Hulu Plus, playing Words With Friends and checking email. My eyes are 54 yrs old, the resolution looks as good to me as my iPad 4 resolution. And it's very nice to be able to use this tablet without having to put my reading glasses on. This is a wonderful tablet for someone in the over 50 age group. Or someone younger who just wants a screen bigger than 10\" to watch Netflix with.  Well worth the money and I have no doubt I'll get many years of use out of my \"portable 13\" TV\".", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing", "Author": "LORD OF THE FLIES", "ReviewID": "R3J85ED4A4PR3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I write this review to say that this is the best Amazon purchase I have ever done. This tablet is simply everything you want in a portable computer that will do it all. The screen is way bigger than than the 10.1 version. I have uploaded a picture for you to compare. Check it out in the \"Product Images from Customers\" section. The screen is big enough for me to read my comics and watch videos without damaging the eyes. The screen is crystal clear but if the screen is too bright for you, you can download an app that will let you dim the screen down.I can't stress enough for you to get this tablet at this screen size because you will not regret it. I'm so glad I bought it for $229 and free shipping with Amazon Prime.P.S. It can read a 64gb microsd card but you'll need to format it as a NTFS for it to read on your personal computer first before inserting it into the tablet.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you paid for", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3GPKB7XMVBUFJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a 13\" tablet primarily for sheet music.  This was the lowest cost option.  It does serve the purpose but the resolution could be better.  Also there is quite a bit of viewing angle degradation.  It cannot be looked at laying flat unless you are trying to view it from directly above. It is okay for the price and I can read my PDF sheet music from it as well as Fake Books, Kindle editions.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for the price", "Author": "Michele Ellingon \"Moondrake\"", "ReviewID": "R1INNQTPHLFPI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this an excellent tablet.  The sound is clear, the view screen nice and clear.  It doesn't have the reso of a more expensive device, but it's fine for my games and document viewing.  I don't notice the lower reso with videos as it is so large I put it on the coffee table for viewing.  The Android interface seems quite clean and not junked up by a lot of proprietary apps.  The most complex games I play are PvZ2 and Catan, and it plays them both flawlessly.  It runs videos with no problems, opens MS Office documents with the reader app I purchased, effortlessly accesses the micro SD card.  I haven't tried the USB yet.  No problem with the WiFi, web surfing, checking mail or running Netflix or You Tube.  My only negatives:  the charging cable is odd and might be hard to replace, the charging port is very close to and similar to the headphones port, and there don't appear to be any accessories (cases and stands) for this device.  I am worried about it falling over as I am propping it up against all sorts of stuff.  But overall I am very pleased to have a device that I can play games and watch videos on without having to wear my glasses!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value in its class of 13.3 inches!!!", "Author": "christopher lam", "ReviewID": "R1WHUIZOZAWY1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best value for the price and quality!

I share it with my kids for their homework and I use it for reading books, magazines and an occasional game (Plants vs Zombies).  The Internet provides full pages and not the mobile ones.CONSRAM - 16GB:  What I didn't realize was that the ram isn't what you think.  In normal tablets and smartphones, when you see the size description 16GB - 32GB - 64GB and so on, it usually means that's how much you have to install your programs.  With this tablet, you only get 1GB to install programs.  The rest is internal storage you use when you connect it to your PC.  This is where you store your pictures, movies, music, etc.  So the RAM can be very deceiving.  After installing several of my purchased programs, I started getting a memory full message and that the app could not be installed.WEIGHT - This bad boy is heavy.  I pretty much expected that.  It's an easy trade-off, considering... but after about 10 minutes of holding it, you'll find that the weight does play a role in this tablets portability.ACCESSORIES - There are so very few accessories for this unit.  It would be nice to have some kind of hard case, as it does seem rather fragile.SUMMARY - For the price, this is a very good tablet.  If you invest in a 16GB Micro SD Card, your space issues might get some reprieve.  I say some, because not all apps can be moved or transferred to NAND Memory (the 15GB that remain) or the SD Card.I'd recommend this tablet for someone who needs one that doesn't require portability.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "User Manual PDF", "Author": "John J.

Pai", "ReviewID": "R30E5LJI3MO4OX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using an iPad2 for a couple years and am very happy with the pad, except that the size of iPad is smaller than I like when I tried to use it to manage my music scores. 10\" is simply not big enough. Although I have been hoping, but I have finally given up the hope that Apple will start selling a 13\" or a larger pad.I bought this Hannspree tablet mainly for its size. It is almost the same size as the regular music scores and the screen is big enough to let me read the notes of the scores. I was planning to use it only for this purpose. When I first started it, I noticed a few problems. As mentioned by the other user, the mail and the calendar can't connect to my Google account. This was really a surprise, since this is an Android pad. However, I am ok with this. I am not going to use this for reading email or viewing calendars, though it would be real nice if this works.I installed MobileSheet which is the app of my choice to manage my music scores. The app installed smoothly and runs ok. Another problem all a sudden showed up and made me quite upset. The screen went crazy zooming in and out and moving back and forth between several screens, like it was controlled by an invisible hand or fingers. I had to shut it down and reboot the device.The \"crazy screen\" problem has been showing up randomly. Once it occurs, I have to shut it down and reboot. This is very annoying when I am practicing, and would be very scary if I am performing with it. I can't imaging how upset I would be if I need to stop playing on the stage because the tablet all a sudden goes crazy.This can be a good tablet if it doesn't have these problems. I am quite disappoint, although I still decide to keep it. I bought a protection plan for it. I will use it only for not-so-important occasions and will not trust it on the stage. I do NOT recommend it to any musician who wants a bigger tablet.

For that price it really is a great deal.  It is surprisingly fast with pretty smooth graphics. It isn't very high res but for the price it is more than acceptable.  It works very well in most all respects.  The only real disappointment is the small battery, wish they would have spent an additional $5 to put a longer lasting one in.  I keep it close to a plug by my bed.  Again for the price I can't complain.  I really like the large 13.3 inch screen.  It makes web browsing and videos so much more enjoyable than on my iPad (which I love as well).", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great toy for the price", "Author": "Luis Pinho", "ReviewID": "R1FA640F99I0BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it - we go to bed together almost every night.Great for my games and to watch tv & videos - I do not use for any work related stuff yetbut Iam really happy with it !!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Might be the perfect tablet for musicians", "Author": "jeffn1", "ReviewID": "R2Q168OXBIOHFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet as a backup for my (now discontinued) Toshiba Excite 13\" tablet.  I use it to read sheet music and charts (using Mobilesheets software to organize pdfs and a Billpro foot pedal to turn pages).  The size/dimensions make it far preferable to the i-pad (much less expensive too).  The dimensions seem perfect (better than that Toshiba Excite, which is too narrow and long).  The buttons and ports are situated well.  The only problem is there currently is not a good stand for it (or attachment to a mic stand), which, of course, is not Hannspree's fault (and you could use a music stand, but I prefer something less intrusive).  I expect the people who manufacture tablet holders will remedy this as more and more 13 inch tablets are coming out.  Anyway, 5 stars it is.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead from thre very beginning", "Author": "Jerzy Rogozinski", "ReviewID": "R14SXCQEUGT4T6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As others - did not start despite of charging 24 hrs.
