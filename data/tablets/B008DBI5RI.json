{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nabi 2 vs Leap Pad Explorer 2 vs Innotab 2", "Author": "Raivyn \"Raivyn\"", "ReviewID": "R1SQDWA9V48C2X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like I think a lot of parents, I was researching which of these tablets to give my child.  He turned 2 years old 3 months ago, so he's quite young.  But he is very tech savvy, and I wanted a tablet my son would enjoy for years to come which offered both educational and entertainment options, was an \"affordable\" price, and was very durable.  I read tons of reviews, went to the stores, watched YouTube videos, and ultimately selected the Nabi 2.  Everyone's criteria is different, but I thought I would share my reasons for choosing the Nabi 2, and my experiences now that we have it because I know other parents are trying to chose between these options.WHY I DID NOT CHOSE THE INNOTAB 2 OR THE LEAP PAD EXPLORER 2WIRELESS CAPABILITYBecause I have no prior experience with either Leap Frog or VTech, I was not predisposed to either platform.  I had nearly chosen the Innotab 2s (NOT the Innotab 2) because it has (limited) wireless capability to VTech's site.However, the Nabi 2 connects wirelessly via Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, so the connection is not only fast, but it won't slow down the rest of my wireless network (your entire wireless network will only go as fast as the slowest device connected to it).  In addition, the user interface (UI) is already set up to prevent my son from going to websites not appropriate for him, and is set up to go to sites with videos he would enjoy.  The Nabi 2's full wireless capabilities allows me to download apps and videos anywhere in the home, rather than having to connect the device to a computer first and load said items onto it.SCREEN SIZE AND QUALITYThe Nabi 2 has a 7\" capacitive screen with 1024x600 resolution.  The Leap Pad Explorer 2 features a 5\" resistive screen with 480x272 resolution.  I could not find any info on the Innotab 2 screen other than it is 5\".  If there are only four Atari 2600-esque things on the screen to tap at, then you don't need a particularly responsive or high resolution screen.  However, since I had planned on this purchase to last several years, I wanted the option of enjoying better graphics, and the ability to play games that require a more responsive screen.  I also wanted nice video quality for watching shows and movies on, and the Nabi 2 had the best screen for all of this.PROCESSING POWERThere are plenty of speed tests on YouTube for the Nabi 2, the Innotab 2, and the Leap Pad Explorer 2 (as well as the Tabeo, and I think the Meep).  These tests mainly focus on how quickly these devices turn on, but also include how quickly they switch from one application to another.  If you don't think that matters, turn on your phone and pretend you can't use it for a full minute.  Feel good?  Now pretend you have the patience of a 2 year old.  Especially after you've become accustomed to Mom's iPad.Processing power also affects how well the device responds to the child's input, and how it will run newer games/apps.  I'd rather pay $200 for the best tablet processor available (relatively speaking) vs. paying $100 for a processor that is obsolete.MULTIMEDIA OPTIONSThe Innotab 2 has the ability to play videos from a memory card, and the Leap Pad 2 does not.  This is an option valuable to me because I can use it to play videos without the need for a separate DVD player nor would I need to install a DVD player in my car.  For me this method of watching videos is also less cumbersome to use (i.e rather than a laptop) during long car rides/plane rides.Because the Nabi 2 is an Android tablet with wireless capability, it plays Netflix, Pandora, and I believe it will play Amazon Prime videos and Hulu Plus (with a the right work-arounds if you already have another Android device).  The \"pre-installed\" videos are actually preset links to child appropriate videos on YouTube, which include Mickey Mouse and Dora the Explorer.One VERY cool feature the Nabi 2 has is HDMI output, which not even the Nexus 7 has.  Why is this cool?  Because you can stream children's programs and watch them on a regular TV.  I just watched an episode of Dora the Explorer via the Nabi 2 on my 60\" plasma TV!  I simply connected the Nabi 2 to my TV via the HDMI output, went to Netflix (on the Nabi 2), and there you go!  This adds fantastic functionality if you don't already have a Roku, streaming blu-ray player, or a smart TV, or are on vacation and want to watch a movie in the hotel room.For those of you who are considering this Nabi 2 over the Kindle Fire HD and the Nexus 7, IMO the HDMI output w/o additional wireless equipment also puts the Nabi 2 ahead for MY purposes (YMMV).APPS VS CARTRIDGESThe ability to get free apps from the Amazon Store (and Google Play via another Android device) IMO adds a lot more value to the Nabi 2.As of now, my 2YO LOVES the free alphabet apps, and so far have kept him entertained for hours (I don't have a problem with him playing educational apps).  The Nabi 2's UI is very child friendly, and my 2YO has no problem swiping the screen to find the apps he wants to play with.  I don't anticipate having to spend any money on games/software for a very long time for the Nabi 2.That being said, the majority of the free games are trial versions or \"lite\" versions, or even worse, have ads, some of which are for products not necessarily geared towards children (i.e. one game had an ad for Hulu Plus).  Since my kid is only 2, he is perfectly fine with these trial/lite game versions.  My plan is to keep him on the free stuff for now.  When he outgrows them, I can just delete them and it won't have cost me anything.  If you want the full games, you'll have to pony up cash for them.DURABILITYUPDATE 11/9/12: While I think the design of included case (they call it a bumper) could be improved, it is VERY good at protecting the overall unit from drops (there are drop test videos on the Nabi website).  Just the other day my son was at the kitchen counter (on his Learning Tower) with his Nabi 2 and he dropped it onto my kitchen floor, so I know it will survive a 3ft fall first hand.  My 2YO will literally bang it on the kitchen countertop, and it still functions fine!I can't imagine purchasing any tablet like device for a child and not also purchasing a protective shell for it because it WILL be dropped.  Including this bumper adds considerable value to the Nabi 2 over not only the Innotab 2s and the Leap Pad Explorer 2, but ALSO over the Nexus 7 and the Amazon Fire HD (remember I purchased this for a child).  A comparable case for the Nexus 7 and the Amazon Fire HD would cost $50 or more(though they probably include screen protection).ISSUES WITH THE NABI 2While I believe the Nabi 2 was the best choice of a tablet for my child based on my personal criteria, it's not quite perfect.BUGGY PERFORMANCE - UPDATED 12/7/12Our Nabi will freeze, and the sound will stop working.  We have to turn it off and turn it on again.  Pretty annoying, especially since it has such a fast processor.LACK OF GOOGLE PLAY SUPPORT VERY LIMITINGThe Nabi folks highly promote adding the Amazon app store in order to access more free apps.  This does have its limitations.  For example, if you live in Canada, you can't get the Amazon app store, and since Google Play isn't available on the Nabi, it is extremely difficult to get basic apps like Netflix on the Nabi, unless you ALREADY own an android device.My son still plays with my rooted Nook Color simply because I found apps on Google Play he likes more than the apps available on the Nabi and from Amazon.PRE-LOADED CONTENT HAS NO REAL VALUEWhen I first posted this review, I had stated that I thought the Nabi 2 was a better investment than the Innotab 2s and the Leap Pad Explorer 2, and that was based in part due to its pre-loaded content.  There is a video on Youtube from Nabi spelling out the difference in cost between the Nabi 2 and I believe the Leap Pad Explorer 2.  However, I no longer believe that the Nabi 2's pre-loaded content is of much value.The Innotab 2s and the Leap Pad Explorer 2 (which will not play movies off your memory card and does not have WiFi) were both about $100 BEFORE adding any additional games/apps/accessories (as of the date of my review).  Granted, both of these units come with some games/books, and my understanding is that these devices are backwards compatible, so if I already had games/books, etc for these units, it would have influenced my decision.  With games/cartridges about $5-$25/ea, I think in the long run it would not be too hard to pick up a few hundred dollars worth of cartridges over the years as your child's abilities advance.The Nabi 2 comes preloaded with what they claim to be $200 worth of \"free\" stuff which includes: 25 free games, 50 free songs, 30 free books, a free trial of Spinlets TV featuring Cookie Jar TV, and a free trial to Fooz Kids.  However, I would not have actually paid for any of the items included.As I describe later in my review, a majority of the 25 free games are actually free, as in they can be downloaded from Google Play or Amazon for free, because they are lite or trial versions.  They cost nothing to download, and if you don't want them anyway, they aren't worth anything.All 50 of the free songs are from Laurie Berkner's various albums.  So unless your child is a HUGE Laurie Berkner fan, the free song selection is rather limited.The free books are interesting in that they are popular fairy tales and stories, but they are \"retold\" or \"adapted\" versions, which means that stories like The Jungle Book or Peter Pan are not the Disney versions.  I think some children would enjoy these books, especially since they are narrated, but I question if folks would actually buy these out right.  I would pay for the Disney name brand version of these stories, but I would not pay for the \"generic\" versions that come with the Nabi 2.The free trial for Spinlets TV is of absolutely no value to me.  Spinlets TV costs $2.99/month, which over a 5 year period totals about $180 (actually, it totals $177 with the free trial).  I have no intention of ever using it because my child has access to Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and Hulu/Hulu Plus, so frankly he doesn't need another subscription service.  If you did not have any of these services, I think any of them would be preferable to Spinlets TV because I think it is a poor value.  To my knowledge, Spinlets TV can only be viewed on the Nabi, unlike Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, which can be viewed on any smart TV, Roku, Blu-ray player, computer, or tablet with the program to run it.Fooz Kids is currently free, but as I understand it, Nabi plans to charge $9.99 annually to use it.  My understanding is the main benefit of Fooz Kids is the ability to track your child's progress.  Leap Pad and VTech offer this service, too, for their devices, and there is no charge for it.I think the Nabi 2 has definite benefits over a Leap Pad Explorer/Innotab 2s, but its preloaded content does not hold much value.  I would have much preferred it come with none of that preloaded content because it takes up space and I'll have to load in the content I want anyway.  If you plan on using the Spinlets TV service, add in about $180 to the cost of the Nabi.BEWARE OF INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT WITHIN SOME APPSClearly the Nabi 2 is a real tablet and not a toy like the Innotab 2s and the Leap Pad Explorer 2.  So there are many folks comparing it to Nexus 7 (they have the same processor) and the Kindle Fire HD.The main reason I chose the Nabi 2 over the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire HD was that the included software and UI were very kid friendly and already blocked inappropriate content and websites.  I did not want to spend time reworking an Android tablet to make it safe for my child to use, which is what drew me to the VTech/Leap Pad tablets to begin with.  As of the date of this review, I believe that the Nabi 2 is the best 7\" tablet that was child friendly/safe with the least amount of work of my part.However, the Nabi 2's parental controls don't transfer to games/apps that you get from the Amazon App store.  One item that was most alarming to me is that if you enable the Netflix app in Nabi mode (the kid screens), your child will have full access to ALL of the movies in Netflix.  I wasn't too thrilled to discover that my 2YO could have watched something like Sexual Chronicles of a French Family on his \"child friendly\" tablet.  Don't forget, the \"free\" games may have ads for products that are not child appropriate.Of course, any parent should be proactive in supervising and approving ANYTHING their child plays with.  With the apps on the Nabi 2, I basically have had to go through each and every one to examine the content and ads to determine which ones were best for my child - hence in some respects I might as well have gone with a Kindle Fire or a Nexus 7.  Regarding a Nabi 2 vs. the VTech/Leap Pad comparison, the Nabi 2 required more supervision than I anticipated.LACK OF REAR FACING CAMERA - UPDATE 12/9/12The Nabi 2 comes with a very poor front facing camera only.  There is no rear facing camera, though Nabi claims a rear facing camera will be an available accessory in the future.  This makes it difficult for a child to take photos or video of anyone but themselves.The front facing camera works very poorly indoors. The images turn out very dark.  This is very disappointing, considering that even cell phone cameras take decent photos these days.MAJORITY OF THE PRELOADED APPS ARE TRIAL/LITE VERSIONS OR REQUIRE PURCHASE TO USEThe following Nabi specific apps that are preloaded onto the Nabi 2 (right out of the box) require the user to make purchases in order to use them:Spinlets+ Music; Spinlets+ TV; Chore List (see critique below; Treasure Box (though I did find ONE free app)In addition, according to the Nabi folks, they plan on eventually charging for full access to Fooz Kids University.  It is currently free, and in the future only a limited version will be free once they start charging.Since these are Nabi 2 specific apps, you CANNOT delete them or hide them.  This set up basically tempts the children constantly as they have to browse by them to get to all of their other apps.Here are the preloaded games that are demos or lite versions, which means they include ads to purchase the full version or to unlock the next level:Bang Bang Racing, Big Top THD,Demolition Demo,Fruit Ninja HD,Hockey Nations Demo,Jett Tailfin Racers Demo,Riptide GP Demo,Bag It Lite,Burn the Rope Lite,Find the Differences Lite,Find the Differences: Pirates Lite,Hang Man LiteKids Animal Piano Lite,My First Puzzles Alphabet Lite,My First Puzzles Lite,My First Puzzles Numbers Lite,M-GO Teaser (WHY EVEN BOTHER INCLUDING THIS???), Veggie Tales Spotisodes Demo.I don't think my list is complete, and the included version of Angry Birds comes with a lot of ads  If you compare this list to all the apps the Nabi 2 comes with, you'll see that the only apps that don't have built in ads or are lite versions are ones like the calculator.I am tolerating this for now, but basically what this means is that the Nabi 2 experience is akin to being in Disneyland - lots of fun, but TONS of temptations to BUY BUY BUY! It is VERY easy to be nickled/dimed to death with the Nabi 2 - there are lots of $1.99, $0.99, and $3.99 purchases to be made with just the preloaded stuff.  I understand that children are bombarded with ads on TV all the time, but I find it annoying that the Nabi 2 is advertised as having all this great software only to discover it is fraught full of temptations that you really cannot protect your children from.At least with the Innotab 2 and the Leap Pad 2 those temptations are kept out of the device.NO STYLUS INCLUDED MAKES SOME EDUCATIONAL GAMES DIFFICULTSome of the drawing/writing games/apps are best suited for use with a stylus.  After all, in school your child is writing with a pen/marker/pencil/crayon, and unless he or she is finger painting, not with a finger.  Both the Innotab 2 and the Leap Pad Explorer 2 come with a stylus (the Innotab 2 has two of them).  However, the Nabi 2 does not come with a stylus, and there no way to attach one cleanly.  I think this exclusion is a big miss on Nabi's part, and makes the Nabi 2 less attractive from an educational standpoint.UPDATE 11/22/12: One of the Nabi accessories that will be available is a stylus.  It should have been originally included IMO since it is a child's tablet, so I recommend factoring the cost in.BATTERY LIFE NOT THE BESTI'm not enamored with the battery life.  If you didn't charge it the night before, you may have an unhappy child the next day.  Since my son doesn't play with this constantly, it's not the end of the world, but if you're watching a video, then playing some games, or going on a plane/long car ride, make sure you have something else to keep your little one occupied because the battery may not last.UPDATE 11/20/12: While the battery life is short, I like that the Nabi 2 charges like a regular tablet, and doesn't burn through AA batteries.  The Leap Pad Explorer 2 and the Innotab 2 both take regular batteries (the Innotab 2 also has a button cell battery).  On the other hand, it uses a proprietary plug to charge it, rather than the more common micro USB.  The only replacement is a very expensive $40 car charger set, which is not yet available in stores.  If your charger breaks or gets lost, you will need pony up an additional $40 and it may be awhile to obtain a replacement.  NOT GOOD!INCLUDED CASE (BUMPER)IS REALLY GOOD, BUT COULD BE BETTERThe bumper is basically designed to protect the Nabi 2 from drops.  Granted, this is probably the most likely way such devices are damaged/destroyed.  But there is no protection for the actual screen from scratches, and I think a screen protector should have been included considering this is designed for children.I also don't like how the port openings are exposed with this case.  The Otterbox case for my Nook Color covers up the ports, so it provides protection from dirt, grime, drool, etc.  I wish the Nabi 2 case also provided that kind of protection to be rugged enough for children.  As its designed, the Nabi 2 case allows dirt and grime in the ports and in the space between the ports and the case.My son tends to carry the Nabi 2 around by pulling one edge of bumper away from the tablet body and using it as a handle (like when he is carrying it from the living room up the stairs).  I actually wish the bumper had an integrated handle.  I realize that no other tablet has a handle.  But as of the date of this review, the Nabi folks do not offer any sort of carrying case/backpack accessory to help the child carry it,and even those choices are inconvenient because the child would have to take the tablet in and out of said case/backpack.  Integrating a handle into a bumper would make the Nabi 2 easier for small child to carry.The Nabi site does offer a screen protector as an accessory for $25.  That's kinda pricey IMO.SCREEN ANGLE VIEWING POORSeveral other reviews have stated that the screen is very difficult to see if you're viewing it at an angle, and they are quite correct.  When viewing the Nabi 2 at an angle, the screen becomes very dark and the colors are washed out.  It is most problematic if you are sitting at a table looking down at the screen when its lying flat - you have to hunch forward until you are practically on top of it to make the washed out effect go away.  Even sitting back 2-3 inches makes a difference in vibrancy and clarity of the screen.This is almost a deal breaker for me, but because my intended use is for one child using it exclusively, and not multiple people on it at the same time, the benefits outweigh this negative.  It can also be corrected by adding a stand (not letting it sit flat on a table when using it).  If Nabi were to offer their UI/software separately, I would be tempted to get a different device because the poor viewing angle issue is pretty significant.QUALITY CONTROL ISSUESI just spent the last 3 hours setting up and charging a new Nabi to give as a gift, and this new one has a very noticeable horizontal line that scrolls up on the page whenever I change screens.  My son has been playing with is for almost a month.  So I have one good one and one bad one, or a 50% failure rate.  The Nabi folks would prefer you deal with this as a warranty issue, but I'm taking it back to the store.  This is completely unacceptable and it should have been caught by Nabi's quality control.BACK PLATE FOR ACCESSORIES DIFFICULT TO CLEANThe back of the Nabi 2 is a raised grid with openings for attaching mystery accessories that have yet to become available.  I think it is going to get dirty, and it is very difficult to clean.  If your child has a cold and you want to disinfect it - good luck!  I don't see how to clean in those little nooks and crannies. I would like to see Nabi get rid of it altogether since the only use for them right now are these very expensive alphabet blocks, and it doesn't even have enough space for the whole alphabet.  There are plenty of easels and car mounts on the market for other tablets that don't require such a grid.LACK OF AFFORDABLE ACCESSORIESNabi just released some accessories for the Nabi 2.  but get ready to open your wallets!  The headphones are $100, the spare power cable set is $40, the screen protector is $25-$40, and blocks for the back grid cost $25 per set.  While I can appreciate a good set of headphones, I will likely buy a $10 set from Marshalls and put the $90 in my son's college fund.Nabi posted on its Facebook page that more accessories will be available for pre-order on 11/27/12.  No word on delivery, though.EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE AN UNKNOWN TO MEAs I stated previously, I don't have any prior experience with Leap Pad/VTech/Nabi, but I know there are parents who absolutely love Leap Pad and VTech's educational games/software. These companies have scores of parents who are very happy with their products.It is my understanding that the Nabi folks have been making their software for several years (Fooz Kids), but until I stumbled upon the Nabi 2 (which I did by researching the Innotab 2), I had never heard of them.  I feel like I am taking somewhat of a risk that the programs available on the Nabi 2 aren't as good as they seem to be on the Leap Frog and VTech products (though at the end of the day I am getting a cool Android tablet).  My opinion of their educational software may change if this product becomes more mainstream.The software will eventually be a subscription service (with a free limited version available).  Again, I don't know if this software is worth paying for.CHORE LIST ONLY GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO BUY MORE APPS FROM NABIIn the comments, someone had pointed out how much they enjoy the Treasure Box and Chore List.  I hadn't paid much attention to them because my 2YO isn't doing chores yet, so I decided to look into them (especially since you CAN'T DELETE or HIDE THEM).To my disappointment, the Treasure Box and Chore List, as wonderful as they sound initially, are actually just another avenue for parents to buy apps from Nabi.The ONLY reward available on the Chore List are coins. No big deal, right?  However, you have to actually BUY coins FIRST (with real money - get your credit card ready).  So the Chore List is basically an additional paid app.  You will have to continue to purchase coins to use the Chore List on-going.The current price for coins is $0.03 each. If you assign 5 chores to your child, and your child completes each of those chores 7 days a week, the Chore List will actually cost you $1/week in apps, $52/year in apps, or $260 over a 5 year period - all spent on apps.The only way to spend these coins is to purchase apps in the Treasure Box.  What this boils down to is that the only rewards available for using the Chore List are additional apps.  If your child wanted to stay up a half hour later, or go see a movie, or basically ANYTHING other than apps as a reward, your out of luck.  Heaven forbid your child actually want to save up for something really cool (ski lessons?).  Nope - not with the Chore List.I find this extremely limiting; I don't intend for additional Nabi apps to be the only reward my child eventually earns for fulfilling responsibilities, and would love to get rid of the app altogether and replace it with one that we will actually use.Update 11/25/12: You can now use the chore chart by setting the each chore to earn zero coins.  IMO its an aweful solution to not charging parents to use the chore chart because the kids see they get zero coins.  There is still no way to customize the rewards to anything other than apps from the Nabi store.INABILITY TO FULLY CUSTOMIZE THE HOME SCREENSThe Fooz Kids software and icons on the main screens cannot be removed, and cannot even be moved to another section or hidden.  This is quite annoying because my son has to pass by them every time he navigates to different apps, and this is a section he is not even using yet.  I wanted to organize the icons so his most favorite apps are closer to the window that appears when the device first starts up, but instead they are split up by the Fooz Kids screen.  I can see that they may not want the user to remove the programs altogether, but the parents should have the ability to completely control the icons shown on the screens the kids will see and use, and should not be forced to have icons that aren't being used shown on the screen.This is also a major problem because several of the icons that can't be hidden are for the services/apps that require an additional purchase/subscription to use.  If I don't want to use Spinlets TV (and pay $177 to use it), I should be able to delete it, and my child should not be tempted to subscribe to it constantly.UPDATE 11/9/12: WI-FI ABILITY A MIXED BAGWhile Wi-Fi was a main reason I chose the Nabi 2 over the Innotab 2s and the Leap Pad Explorer 2, for a child's tablet it does come with some drawbacks.  Since my son is 2, he doesn't understand while some apps that work at home don't work while we're in the car or at a restaurant, so he becomes very frustrated.  So unless you have a mobile hotspot, beware that this can be an issue.  This will hopefully change in the future as more places offer free Wi-Fi to their customers, and we may only chose to go to restaurants, etc. that have Wi-Fi.  As of the date of this review, Disneyland doesn't offer free Wi-Fi while you're waiting in line for a ride or for a parade.There is one screen in the Nabi home pages that has a Wi-Fi icon to let you know the apps on that page require Wi-Fi.  But as more apps are added, it may not be enough space.  And my son is 2, so he doesn't necessarily recognize that hey can't use the apps on those pages.  I thought I could save my son some frustration by creating a new user profile that does not include any of the apps that require Wi-Fi (i.e. Netflix).  Unfortunately this doesn't work because the Fooz Kids apps REQUIRE Wi-Fi and CANNOT be removed or hidden.  What this basically means is we'll have to deal with my son getting annoyed until he figures it out, which is totally unnecessary and takes the \"child friendly\" status down quite a big notch IMO.NABI'S RECOMMENDED AGE RANGE MAY NOT BE ACCURATEIn the comments, someone pointed out that the frustrations my son and I were having with the Nabi were due to the fact that the Nabi is not geared towards 2YO children.  At first I was surprised because on the Nabi Facebook page it states \"For Ages 2 - 12.\"  But upon reflection, this person's observation may be accurate.  My 2YO doesn't understand why some apps work in the home but not in the car, or why in-app purchases have been disabled, and why is it asking for Mommy's password.  This amounts to an unnecessary amount of frustration.If Nabi is correct that this device is age appropriate for a 2YO, then I believe it needs more work.  For this age range a regular tablet like a Nexus or a Kindle HD, or even the Leap Pad and the Innotab may be better because it may be easier to customize them to the specific abilities of YOUR child because you aren't stuck with Nabi bloatware you can't hide or delete.CONCLUSION - UPDATED 12/7/12If my son didn't love his Nabi so much, I would return it.  The lack of the Google Play store, inconsistent performance, very expensive accessories, and the various methods within the device that Nabi is using to take more of my money is a very big turn off.  But its high durability, child friendly UI, and fast processor, plus the BF price I paid, make it a keeper.  But if I was planning to pay full retail and didn't want the multimedia options, I would more likely lean towards a Nexus 7.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Premier kids tablet that even gives adult tablets a run for their money!", "Author": "L. Wallach", "ReviewID": "RMM739OT3DRCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd generation tablet from Fuhu, a company well-known for their educational online services such as Foozkids.  The original Nabi came out in November of last year and was really the first tablet geared specifically towards younger kids (age 4-10).  While revolutionary in that sense, it was not without a few hiccups as a first generation product often is.  However, realizing this, the company bent over backwards to make things right with its customers and fixed most of the issues in software updates as well as a charger replacement.  Learning a lot from that first tablet, they've come out with a new one that really blows the competition away.  Now that there is competition - many of whom copied the original Nabi in many ways.  But the Nabi 2 is so fast and responsive, comes with so much additional software, and is backed by such a customer-centric company, that really there's no REAL competition!Full disclosure: I am a Nabi Fan-a-tech.  When the initial Nabi came out, a lot of people started using it's Facebook page to trade information, ask questions, and get support.  Some of us who had purchased the tablet for our child and are a little more tech-savvy, decided to try to answer a lot of these questions, and Fuhu made us \"Fan-a-tech's.\" Which means we just keep helping the community by answering questions, providing tips, app ideas, etc.  We also test updates out before they go public, and in the case of the Nabi 2, we got a chance to try them out and find issues before they went on sale.  So I've been using one for a few weeks now and it is very fast and responsive with no freezes, crashes, etc.  It is truly one of the fastest Android devices I've used.Aside from speed, the other nice thing about this Nabi is that it is now able to do video chatting.  It comes with Skype, and my daughter has Skyped a bunch of times already with both grandmas.  In the next month or two Fuhu has said they will be coming out with an add-on rear-facing 8-megapixel camera (the included front-facing one is 2MP) that, among other things, will be used for an augmented reality game they will be putting out.In some of the reviews that have been published on other sites, it's been noted that the Nabi 2 does not have the Google Play store or Google apps.  This was true of the first Nabi, however someone was able to provide the Google Services Framework apk that would work with it and allow for the Android Market to work.  I've tried the Google Services Framework on the Nabi 2 and I'm able to get Gmail working, but so far not Google Play, however, one of the other Fan-a-tech's is working on a solution, so I have no doubt that within the next few weeks, there will be that support.  In the mean time there is of course the Amazon app store, and if you have an Android phone or tablet that DOES have access to Google Play, you can always transfer the apk's from that store via an app like Android Backup and Restore, which works really well for most apps.The other issue around the Nabi 1 was availability, but that's because there was only one partner for it, who did not order units based on the true demand for the product.  Thus many people waited months in vain.  With the Nabi 2, this is solved by the fact that Fuhu now has at least 5 different major retail partners in the US alone, and will also be partnering with retailers in Canada, the UK, and other countries starting in August.  They're committed to producing over a million tablets over the next few months, and more if necessary, so supply should be no issue this time around!Fuhu will be coming out with a bunch of accessories for the Nabi 2 starting in August, including a set of different colored bumper cases, (volume-limited) headphones, a Bluetooth keyboard, a car charger, the aforementioned rear-facing camera, and a lot more.As I've alluded to and what I'm sure you will see repeated in other reviews is that Fuhu is a unique company in how they treat their customers.  They are all about making a difference in the customer's life, and making sure the customer is not just satisfied but truly happy with their purchase.  They bend over backwards to make this happen.  They also have decided to put a lot of effort into the Special Needs community, since they have received many emails from parents of children with special needs who got so much out of the tablet.By the way, although the tablet is geared specifically towards the 4-10 age range, that doesn't mean it can't be used by those who are older.  The bumper comes off easily to reveal a sleek white tablet.  If you want you can even disable the Nabi Mode (kids interface/launcher) and stick to the stock ICS launcher - or load your favorite third-party launcher.  I can tell you that I use mine for normal day-to-day purposes without issue or feeling like I'm using a kid's tablet or a \"toy.\"As you can tell, I'm a big fan of Fuhu and the Nabi 2.  I may be slightly biased, but I'm also totally honest when I say that I've been nothing but impressed with both the Nabi 2 and Fuhu's commitment towards their products and their customers!", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Experience Ever", "Author": "pcort", "ReviewID": "R1BPPD54WLSB4V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first review I have written on Amazon.  I never write these but felt compelled to leave this review.  I purchased in mid-September and had a very positive impression from the start.  The tablet had great specs and I liked the UI to control the apps my daughter could access.  I thought the company was customer focused (boy was I wrong) and thought there was no better value around for a kids tablet.  My only gripe until 2 weeks ago was that it did not have access to the Google Play store.For the Christmas holidays I took my family to Florida.  My daughter loves her tablet and at times is a lifesaver when she is bored- especially on planes!  Well I saw there was an update to the operating system to download when I was at the airport so I did it there.  Seemed to be OK.  Got to Florida and the tablet would not charge back up.  Went out next day and bought x2 chargers- neither of them worked as well.  Tried to do a hard reboot on the tablet (power + vol up/down pressed at same time)- no avail.  The thing would not hold a charge.  Beyond my return period so I thought- Nabi seems to be a good customer focused company- I am sure they will do the right thing as the tablet is only 4.5 months old.  Wrong!First time I called the message stated the AVG. wait time was 45-60 minutes!  Really?!?  I tried for 30 and gave up- guess they were right....  Called the next day and message stated they were too busy and could not accept calls at this time.  Seriously.....a call center that is too busy to accept calls...here is a tip...hire more agents!Then I thought maybe I should send an email, maybe I will get a faster response.  Filled out their online form, got no confirmation it was received.  Then I sent an email to their general mailbox.  Again, no confirmation and no response for days.When I got back to NYC, I tried calling again from my car on my commute home- nothing better to do in the car right waiting on the West Side Highway :)  Well this time I got through in 15 minutes, I thought my luck had changed.  Again I was wrong.  Had to have been the most unprofessional rep I had ever dealt with.  Not his fault however- it was clear they did no customer service training for their agents.  After I told him my story, he started putting down the company, saying they were understaffed and their processes were awful. I asked for a replacement.  He had to take my name and number down as there was no one there who could resolve it at this time.  He also stated \"I need to mark this as urgent because if I don't people do not get calls returned by this supervisor\".  Wow...I knew this was doomed.  He said I would get a call back that day.  2 days later ans still no call.You should know I am NOT the type to moan and complain about customer service.  Either I have patience or low expectations:)  This one takes the cake.  I will not be getting another Nabi 2 tablet and thought you should know about my experiences as well so the same does not happen to you.

Under the hood it's a real Android tablet computer, not a toy, which was a major plus in our decision. Operation is flawless, fast, responsive. It comes with a decent handful of apps but we figured we would end up buying a lot more eventually.Pros: very nice hardware, feels more or less like a Kindle Fire, lightning fast, good selection of children's apps pre-installed, capability to run any Android app.Cons: at the end of the day it's a computer... it's the software running on it that will make or break the user experience. Decent reviews of ABC and 123 apps on the app stores are lacking. Given that half of children's software on any platform is junk, I'm finding myself frequently spending $1.99 here and there hoping that this or that \"learn to read\" or \"play with fruits\" app is worth the two bucks. Still--it does beat paying for cartridges, or $60 each for console games.Final note: negative reviews smell like mindless APPLE fanatics who criticize anything other than their precious iPad.EDIT AS OF 1 YEAR LATER, 8/23/2013:Update:  our daughter is now 3.5 years old and she still uses her Nabi 2 daily.  We have bought a TON of preschool apps over the past year but I think we're up to MAYBE $75 total cost in apps...  still nothing compared to an X-Box where each game costs $60!  The value for the money on the Nabi is excellent.The device has fared extremely well.  It has been dropped, thrown, had apple juice spilled on it, been hidden under couch cushions, etc. etc. without issue.  Now apparently Fuhu is trying to market the Nabi 2 as a device for children over 7 while marketing a smaller tablet for younger children, I think this is a mistake.  The Nabi 2 is perfectly fine for a 2-6 year old.On a related note:  I bought a Microsoft Surface RT a few months back and made the mistake of buying a few not-really-educational games on it  (Where's My Water, Disney Princess Dress Up, Tinker Bell Lost Treasures, etc.).  The quality of the games available in the Windows 8 Marketplace is vastly superior to what's designed for children on an Android tablet, but they are not educational in nature by any means.  SHE wants to play with \"daddy's computer\" any chance she gets to play mindless drivel on a very nice machine.  But that's special time with daddy around only.  She still uses her Nabi 2, unsupervised, without issue, just about every day.  There's no way I would trust her alone with my $500 Surface.So conclusion:  Surface and newer iPad's are superior technically, but you don't want a young child playing with these unsupervised.  A Nabi is a true child's tablet.  You can trust them with it while you run and take a shower, whatever, and know that they're actually learning something while playing what they think is a game.  The same can't be said for adult tablets.Money well-spent.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "An extremely good tablet", "Author": "M.

After reading a horde of articles on tech and autism, and then speaking with a family friend regarding this unit, we decided that at the price point it wouldn't hurt.We were immediately amazed. My wife loved how easy it was to use the device. I loved how simple it was for me to engage the \"mommy mode\" and set up the wireless settings and the security we wanted. And we both became instant Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja addicts. The real proof of our decision was the true and utter joy on our child's face that birthday morn; and every day thereafter for the next three or four months.Then we hit the first downside. Apps suddenly went missing. I couldn't figure out the problem, until our oldest proudly showed me how to bypass mommy mode. I still have a mixed sense of pride and shock at how simple a task the bypass was for my 6-year old.I don't know if this will work on every Nabi; but our child did a search (anything really). He would then keep tapping the find (or whatever it says) 3 or 4 times. The unit then flips from the child-safe mode into the black settings screen mode. That opened up the unit for our oldest to do everything from deleting apps to changing the mommy mode password, to turning on/off random settings.The second downside we have is the power cord. Our oldest can play rough with things. The unit has survived drops. But the weakpoint is the power cord. Where it plugs into the unit is very thin and, as we discovered, fragile. So we've not been able to charge up the Nabi for him in a bit.Other than these two issues, we were quite happy with the purchase.

East AZ", "ReviewID": "R2Z3M25V2XNQQ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Revised:  Fuhu has issued an update that includes Google Play - AFTER a frustrating year for my daughter.The accessories are still mostly overpriced, and their insistence that a different color bumper is worth $30 while similar tablets are being sold in arrays of different colors is just plain upsell.  The charger is still less than optimal, and tech support is still a poor joke.  My advice, shop around for a tablet from a company that doesn't wait for enough bad reviews to pile up before making corrections.Original:  I bought this tablet for my daughter.  The first one died after two months.  I contacted the company and they sent a new one (although the fact that a customer service rep for a tech company was unfamiliar with the term \"bricked\" unsettles me).  The second one is running fine, six months later.The real problem with this tablet is that the Google Play Store is not installed.  EVENTUALLY YOU WILL WANT THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE!  It's the most comprehensive app store for Android devices.  Fuhu will make excuses and refer you to the Amazon App Store (a good source, but NOWHERE NEAR as extensive as Google Play).  My daughter wanted the Furby app - not available through the Amazon App store.  They will refer you to some \"Fan-A-Tech\" work-around, but it isn't the Play store (\"Fan-A-Tech\" is a euphemism for \"customers compensating for Fuhu shortcomings\").Every cheap tablet on the market includes the Google Play Store.  Check all the cheap Chinese tablets on this site and others.  Plus, YouTube videos on how to root the Nabi 2 to install Google Play (but void the warranty) prove that it is not incompatible with the tablet.  Fuhu just doesn't want to put in the effort (or money) to make it available for the Nabi 2.  Why build a quality tablet and limit it to second-rate app sources?Aside from app availability, another problem I have with the tablet is the completely useless matrix on the back for \"Kinabis\" (they are like refrigerator magnet letters) that no one ever buys.  You can remove the Kinabi rack, but you have to possess just the right size Phillips screwdriver to fit the screws.  I found one in my eyeglass repair kit.One other downside is the stupid design of the charging port.  The tablet includes a micro-USB port for data that could easily be used for charging also, but instead Fuhu opted to used a bayonet-style charger that is thinner than pencil lead.  It will bend and snap.  You will end up buying another.  The use of something so fragile on a kid's tablet is an egregious example of engineering failure.Since the introduction of the Nabi 2, other kid-centric tablets have been introduced.

Keep an eye out for great Black Friday Deals, any bit of savings helps.  I'm first writing a review now because I was searching for deals on the new Special Edition Nickelodeon version of the Nabi 2 and noticed how poorly the Nabi was rated and thought I might add my 2 cents.Last year I did a lot of research on kids tablets.  A LOT.  At the time, my kids were 2, 4, 6 and all wanted a tablet.  In the end I'm extremely satisfied with my decisions.  We ended up with a Nabi 2, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10.  I wanted different tablets because I know how my kids play, and I knew they would all want what each other had, but not if they had it themselves ;)  This way they play on their own tablet for awhile, then trade off etc.  *My kids are not spoiled, the Nabi was a gift, the other two were saved up birthday\\christmas\\chore money*  Yes we are an Android household.  We are not opposed to Apple, however if you don't already have Apple products there is no reason to GO Apple.  Once you go Apple, I recommend you never go back... unfortunately...once you purchase the apps, you have to stick with an Apple product to keep your apps.  The GREAT thing about Android products is you can share them across any Android Device.  That means the Amazon App store that works on the Nabi, works on both of our Nexus' as well. So we only purchase an app one time, and can use it on 3 devices.  (caveat, you do have to create a login on each device that is the same to make this work - there are all sorts of online resources to explain it)I am tech savvy.  BUT I didn't feel I needed to be tech savvy to use the Nabi.  I was surprised that there were no \"paper instructions\" the first time I opened the box.  There's just a postcard with a website on it, and there you can download a pdf of the instruction manual.  If you're not familiar with tablets or Android devices, start there!  READ the instruction manual.  Watch the helpful videos on the website.  I saw a lot of complaints about customer service, but honestly a lot of the complaints (beyond physical damage to the tablet) were things that likely could have been resolved by looking at the website.  I know it's very forward of them to not have printed materials immediately available, but I would say it was very smart for a new start up company to keep things cost effective.  You will also benefit from \"liking\" the Nabi Facebook page.  They provide oodles of helpful information thru the Facebook page, have tons of giveaways including free apps and accessories, and have wonderful community support.  The only Customer Service I have needed to date I received thru the Facebook page.Yes, the storage space is limited.  Yes you can save some space using an SD card.  The SD card for us has been a saving grace.  I was able to download some movies to a card, I leave the card in the tablet, and then my kiddos can still watch movies when there is no wifi.  They do watch Netflix and YouTube quite a bit, so this gives me a quick work around.Pre-loaded apps \"eh\".  Yes the Nabi comes with preloaded apps... some are great, some we have never used.  As a parent I love Fooz Kids.  My kids will never \"choose\" to go to the Fooz Kids page.  Why, because it's educational.  Clearly educational.  In my Mom brain, it also looks like fun to me, but apparently it is not fooling the kids.  HOWEVER even tho she doesn't love it, my 2nd Grader is on Fooz Kids all the time.  WHY? because we're a busy family, and I don't always have time to do flash cards or spelling words in between activities.  So sometimes she gets a choice... 15 minutes on Fooz Kids, or get up an hour early... She almost always chooses Fooz Kids ;)  It's also great that I can create separate accounts for the kids within Fooz Kids... this way I can track each of the kids abilities, where they are at, where they left off, and foster a little healthy competition over high scores ;)You might say, just download an app for the other tablets... well.. easier said than done... for the educational value of Fooz kids I truly haven't found anything that was even close for the Nexus.Many of the preloaded apps can simply be deleted if you don't like them, to free up space for things you do want.  A few pages of preloaded icons are immobile, I wish those pages were at the end... they are in the middle... but you have 2 screen flips before which you can add up to 8 folders on each page, and in each folder up to 12 or 16 apps, so there's plenty of room for what your kids want to see first.So why did I choose the Nabi?For my 2 year old, I liked the sturdiness of the build.  I liked the large limited app icon display.  I liked that I could limit her choices and open them up as she grew.  I liked that I could add some pages of \"big kid stuff\" for when brother\\sister borrow the tablet.  I like that I can go into Mommy Mode and do whatever I want.  I like that I could install Netflix.  In the last year this tablet has seen as much use and abuse as the other two and holds up just fine.  LOVE the educational material.  I like that I will get my money's worth as it will grow with her.Cons* It's true, No Google Play store - but really we don't miss it that much.  Haven't found anything I couldn't substitute.* Viewing area is limited.  Compared to the Nexus, you do have to view this pretty much straight on.  Which was something I noticed... my kids have never mentioned it.* Wish internal storage was more - but only a slight inconvenience, we simply delete less played apps or use the back up\\cloud tools to move out games.If you're reading reviews you're doing the best you can and you will find what makes you happy.

It it a very durable tablet, a little on the thick side but i imagine my son will have no trouble keeping his little butter fingers from dropping it, the back piece is weird but has a purpose, i wish there were accessories available now but that will come as it is a new device. The upload download speeds surpassed my expectations and you can definetly tell there is a quad core in there, it did take a little while for the initial start up but once on and powered up it was ready to go. it was very easy to navigate through and in the mommy mode it is just like a standard android tablet which is a bonus as you can use it yourself while your child is not occupying it. I love that the tablet has its own streaming service for kids videos through spinlets, i flipped through some of the videos and i definetly approve of the content for my little guy. the tablet also comes with a couple laurie berkner albums preloaded which my son loves to listen to so that was a plus for us. Oh and the sound quality is great for such a small device, i had to keep it turned down a bit or it got a bit obnoxios (i have sensitive ears) ill probably will have to tell the boy to turn it down all the time. I love that it has an hdmi output on it, and it has expandable memory. We often times do not use our desktop computer and the added bonus and deciding factor between this and the leap frog was with this you have over the air updates, cloud storage and backups, the leap frog doesnt have its own operating system so you have to hook it up to a computer to get anything new on or off of it that is a big boo in my book. I also love that the tablet tracks your childs progress in math and other catagories and you can log in and see their progress or areas that may need improvement. over all this is a great learning tool.......if i had to come up with a down side it would be that the tablet doesnt have access to the play store but amazon app store and its own app store are great alternatives......only ive purchased so many apps directly through play store that it would be nice to be able to use those apps from this device as well.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great software, horrible screen", "Author": "Puddleglum", "ReviewID": "R1FJGGWCLV1OT0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After much research, considering a tablet for my 4yo boy, the decision came down to the Nexus 7 and the Nabi2. I opted for the Nabi2. The specs are pretty...spectacular, particularly for a $200 tablet. The added benefit of the ruggedness professed by other reviewers really sold me as did the \"child-specific environment easily exited to a full-blown ICS environment\". The best of both worlds it would seem.The Nabi2 has a solid kid-friendly environment. The chores tied to rewards and the treasure box are fantastic. The web browser with its kid-centric design is great. The fact that it blocks things that would get your kid (or wallet) into trouble is quite wonderful. A really, really nice piece of software. Unfortunately, all of those are worthless if you can't look at the screen for more than a few minutes w/out getting a headache.The screen. That is the sole reason I returned this device. The capacitive grid (or a portion thereof...or...) is visible. I thought, meh, to a young boy it won't be that big of a deal...minor annoyance. And it was just that, once I got used to it, a minor annoyance. Strike one. Strikes 2-theonethatendedthegame all had to do with off axis viewing. The off axis viewing on this screen is so bad that by looking at the screen dead on and closing one eye, half of the screen turns a severely gradiated black. Any slight movement of my head or the tablet would cause the screen to \"ripple\". I spent quite a bit of time with it, setting it up, trying to see if I could become accustomed to it but all the time spent only further contributed to the aggravation. Perhaps I got a defective unit (man, I really hope others who have kept this device aren't looking at a screen that horrid) but several of the reviews I've found on the Nabi2 list the screen and off-axis viewing as being its weak point.Now, I'm trying to mimic on my recently purchased Nexus 7 what the Nabi does out of the box.

Hall \"Electrical Engineer and Questioning ...", "ReviewID": "RTKMZU5KCJ8IX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Jan 21st, 2014 - I purchased this Nabi 2 over one year ago and have gradually grown to dislike it immensely.  After the latest software update around the beginning of January 2014, I found that while the developers tried to add in new features (like apparently the Wings Challenge - a set of scholastic lessons for children), they also made a number of annoying changes.  Here are just a few:Camera App - In Nabi mode (the side of the Android operating system the children see), the developers stuck in a camera app with an icon that cannot be removed.  That means if you have a little one (age 2 to 4), they will go crazy clicking that SOB until the memory of the Nabi 2 is filled up.Privacy Protection Policy - In the latest Nabi additions to Android, they added in a Privacy Policy that you must now go through if you click an icon like Fooz Kids.  They then want you the consumer to sign this and pay 50 cents from your credit card to have access to content you already previously owned.  There is an option down below for those without a credit card so you can get past it but it then freezes up certain features, like the new Wings Challenge.  To nickle and dime parents like this for 50 cents is absolutely the definition of a bottom feeder.Access Denied - It is infuriating to try and add a decent content blocking app or timer system to this Nabi 2.  You have to use a hodgepodge of other apps from Google Play or the Amazon App Store to do what should have been priority #1 in the first place.  Who in their right mind wants a four year old playing the Riptide game for three straight hours?  You can eventually lock down this tablet to small children but it is not easy.I could continue with many, many more gripes but what I suggest instead is sell it.  You can then use the proceeds to purchase a much better working Google Nexus 7 FHD for 2013 or the new Kindle Fire HDX, both of which run about $200 to $230.  They can both be setup for small children in about one afternoon and are faster, more responsive and do not continually try to get you to submit your credit card.  As you can read from my earlier review of the Nabi 2 below, I was initially a supporter of this product and originally gave it four stars.  However, as the months passed with no tech support, icons and apps that I could not remove (think Spinlets TV, ... come to think of it.....#$%! Spinlets TV !!!), basic glitches that should have been caught, etc.. I can honestly say this is truly a one star product.  I have written about a hundred reviews for Amazon purchases and I have only given out about three one star reviews, but unfortunately, that is where the Nabi 2 now ranks.  Educate yourself and caveat emptor.This is the original review below:May 28th, 2013 - I purchased this Nabi 2 tablet as an introduction to computers for my gifted three year old son.  I gave it to him as a 2012 Christmas gift and spent the weeks leading up to Christmas Day configuring and setting up this Nabi 2 in the evenings (once he was in bed) to personalize it for him. I want him to be introduced to the world of computers and tablets (and very soon, computer programming), but not gaming. With five months experience on the Nabi 2 so far, I can say it is a decent tablet and it means well, but there are plenty of rough edges.The positives are many:  The Nabi 2 (btw, Nabi means butterfly in Korean) tablet is fast and has a quad core Tegra 3 processor. Behind the kid friendly facade, this is not some weak watered down, beginner tablet. The Nabi 2 is essentially a rebadged Google Nexus 7 (with a few hardware tweaks, like the HDMI out port) but tailored for children and has almost identical hardware specs to the Nexus 7, which is just dandy since the Nexus is a very versatile and fast tablet platform. It is also faster than the iPad Mini and seems faster than the iPad 4. The manner in which the developers set up the Monarch Operating System (OS) is well thought out, as there is a Nabi mode for kids and a Mommy/Daddy mode for the parents.  This, for the most part, prevents the kids from viewing adult content or getting into trouble with the the parent's credit card.  When first turned on, the Nabi mode is what children see and it contains nine screens filled with various interesting apps and games (more on this in a minute).  The Nabi 2 can also be setup to be used with more than one child.  One of the best ideas within the Nabi Mode is the Chores List, which allows parents to set a series of daily goals for the child to remain reticent about (but not to check off). The apps are decent but not groundbreaking and contain a camera/video app for young film directors in training, a child proof browser that can be limited by the parents to the sites it can view, an app for e-books, an app for music, apps for Fooz Kids University, apps for Spinlets Music and TV and several child friendly games.  The add/delete app in Mommy/Daddy mode makes it very easy to switch or remove apps seen by the child in standard Nabi Mode, which is great.  Most of the paid apps if you go to the online AppZone are also reasonably priced at $1 to $5, with many that are completely free.  The end result is that you have a nice little sand box for kids to play around in, without getting into real trouble.  The parents can also use the Nabi Sync software on their desktop or laptop to load the Nabi 2 with music, family videos and photos. You have 8 GB total memory, of which about 4 GB is used up for the stock OS and programs, which is just fine for small children as long as you don't load too much family media. The Nabi 2 even includes interface methods not present on other tablets like mini USB, micro SDHC card (it will not accept a standard SDHC card) and even HDMI.  That allows the parent to easily hook the Nabi 2 up to the family flat screen to show off the child's work.The rough edges or the bad points would be the following:  The touch screen while interactive, feels slightly less sensitive than than the two on my Google Nexus 7 tablets.  Not sure if the software developers measured small children's ergonomic movements and finger forces and then tailored the code to represent this, but for me as an adult, I find it more frustrating to move, drop and shift icons or the keyboard letters on the Nabi 2.  When the Nabi 2 is first turned on, the child is presented with nine home screens filled with icons for various apps, but Fuhu does not allow the parent the choice of removing some of the apps, such as the Spinlets TV or Spinlets Music. These are subscription based apps that want money from Mom and Dad's bank account and the child is going to be moving across them every day, even if the parents want them removed.  Very poor choice on Fuhu's part. The Chores List app does not allow small children to try and check off their own completions (and at least compare this to the adult side evaluation).  The Chores List gives rewards based in Nabi Coins, which is a short way of saying, \"Let's continue to milk the parents for more money\".  (Nabi coins are purchased by the parent's credit card so the child can buy other apps as a reward, although with the latest software update, you can set the Nabi coins reward to zero, but this is still very poor) Not an idea that is going to go over well with educated parents looking for a good platform for their children.  The Chores List app should be set up to give rewards in stars and when for example, the child earns say, 75 stars, the family goes on a pick nick (or whatever the parents predefine the reward as).  Or, if the child earns 75 stars, they get X amount of time with the Kung Fu Panda game. Dump the Nabi coins idea ... it flat out sucks. Fuhu also advertises the Nabi 2 as having $200 worth of free software but some of it is either the downgraded free version of the app or done as shareware for commercialization (like the Spinlets stuff).  If parents want to purchase an app, they will in their own good time, and you dont need Nabi Coins or gimmicks to pester them. It will have the opposite effect most likely. The square blocks on the back of the tablet are plain silly.  Buying letters for $25 to customize the child's name is complete BS.  Just have a flat back with added rubber bumpers to add even more shock resistance to the Nabi 2.  If you want a different colored edge bumper, you have five other choices but you have to order it separately and it costs $29.99 per bumper.  ....sorry,...what ? .....$30?  No way in Fu Man Chu it costs $30 to make a rubberized bumper that entails all of 25 cents in raw materials cost, made by Chinese laborers getting paid $1.25 per hour.  Get serious.  Also, if you try to make a call into Fuhu to ask a more detailed question that is not covered in the rather short series of answers they have online, you have to wait 30 to 40 minutes.  Really ?!!!  If you charge $25 for a bunch of gimmicky letters for the back of the tablet, surely you can have a live human being pick up the phone within two or three minutes.  Reduction from four to three stars for cheapness there.  The Nabi 2 while good, is more ideal for the five to ten year old.  For smaller children age 2 to 5, especially those who cannot read yet, many of the activities or apps are lost on them because they require reading and response to be effective.  I would urge the developers in the future to branch the Nabi mode into three choices when initially setting up the Nabi, one Nabi mode for ages 2 to 4 (illiterate, except for some gifted children usually), one Nabi mode for ages 5 to 7 (semi-literate), and one for ages 8 to 10 (literate).  Fooz University needs to added on to as well for ages down to 1 1/2 years old.  Simple color and sound association apps could make a really nice and proficuous addition to the Fooz lessons for children aged 2 to 4.The neutral points of the Nabi 2 would be some of the choices of the developers.  For example, a Netflix app in Mommy/Daddy mode should be standard.  So should apps for the Amazon App store and Google Play.  The Nabi 2 is a full featured tablet, so why not allow it to reach the apps that can really define it on the Mommy/Daddy side of the interface?  Some excellent (and free) children's apps from Google Play are also missing on the Nabi 2.  Since they are free and open source, why not add a few of the most highly rated ones?  Several of the best Google Play child apps are better than the ones included. I would also mention that the Nabi 2's software suite is slightly heavy with games.  It is better than its competitors but not excellent. Which is fine, since for very small children, exploring a game is learning.  All the children's tablets and pads are heavy with games, but for more serious parents who want their children focused on learning and not gaming, the parents will have to head to Mommy/Daddy mode to remove some of the gaming options. I wish the developers who set up the OS choices, had done so with more support for parents who don't want their children playing games (like myself). For children this is extremely important as frontal and temporal lobe neural networks are gain shifted by continuous gaming at the cost of attention span, executive control functions, social interaction and vocabulary acquisition.  I would also say that two easy to implement ideas are missing; a timer for the parents so that the child is limited to the total time available each day with the Nabi, whereupon it then shuts down (or asks for a parental password prompt) and a tie in to the chores list, that makes sure certain fun options (like Kung Fu Panda) are not available until certain study tasks (pre-defined by the parent) have been completed for the day.Another point I see in the one star complaints and something I would add a note of caution about is the durability.  The Nabi 2, despite the bumper and child proof appearance is still a micro-electronics device with a motherboard, a processor, memory, etc...  It will not survive being dropped down stairs, in the bath tub or on cement. If you are purchasing the Nabi 2 to give to a anvil destroying child, ....reverse course. This is not a Tonka truck, it's a real deal tablet. If your child is required to have a quiet or study time each evening, and they (under your direct observation) go through the Fooz lessons to acquire rewards, the Nabi 2 will last for years.  If on the other hand, you expect the Nabi 2 to act in loco parentis, dont be surprised to find months later that the headphone jack does not work or the HDMI signal is scrambled after the fifteen drop on the sidewalk.After five months working with it so far, I like the Nabi 2, but much could be done (and done easily) to make it better.  I am sure Fuhu's software development team could recode some of the easier changes in under a month.  Before purchasing this, I looked into the Leap Frog LeapPad 2, the Toys R Us Tabeo, the V Tech InnoTab 2, a custom configured Nexus 7 or iPad Mini, or a regular desktop with a child specific version of Ubuntu.  All have good and bad points as relates to a small child using them and I still am inclined to believe the Nabi is the best, or at least, a better option.  Despite this endorsement, if Fuhu would remove a bit of the commercialization, and just refocus on the interface, OS and childhood experience, this Nabi 2 could be much nicer.  Overall, the Nabi 2 reminds me of a trip to Walt Disney World in Florida, where the experience is fairly nice but where Disney keeps trying to rape your bank account throughout the entire theme park experience.  Shame too, because with some small changes they could have a five star product.  And, a five star product will easily outsell a three star product, even when you try to earn money thru the app zone and connected commercial partners as backdoors.After doing a bit of investigation about posting jailbreaking information, I have found that unfortunately I cannot go into too much detail, but I recommend any interested parents to Google Nabi 2 jailbreaking and do some reading.  There are methods for improving the operating side of this tablet if you are willing to do a bit of research.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nabi will make your kid cry", "Author": "Eileen Long", "ReviewID": "R3D0V1WCTU47CO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these for my grandchildren last year as I like the idea of something that would give them something they wanted with protection and educational aspects I wanted.  The product worked great at first though I was disappointed to see that most of the loaded apps were bloatware or just advertisements for me to spend more money on their education software.A big issue for some is unavoidable because Google won't allow devices access to Google Play if it modifies the operating system in any way.  Since the Nabi uses a modified version of Android software that limits access and that is a big part of the selling point for Nabi, Fuhu's only option was essentially Amazon's app store.  After finding out the education software that came with the device was worthless it would have been nice to be able to be able to bypass 'Mommy mode' if we could get to the Google Store.  As it was adding software was much more difficult than it needed to be and I expect only the most computer literate ever would figure it out.The device itself was nice and despite some of the complaints I've seen, you really had to go out of your way to damage it with the bumpers.  The screen is tougher than most others I've seen on the market and if a kids breaks a Nabi their drop would break a Ipad/Nexus/Kindle.  In fact I'd bet a Nabi would be the toughest of them all.All of the above is meaningless when considering the last issue.  After a month my biggest concern after getting software set up was trying to get them to do other things than play with their Nabi (as I've said earlier the educational software was a bait and switch).  Then we started having issues with one of the units screen as lines appeared and the only thing that would fix it was a reboot.  Anyone that has kids knows how bad it can be when one kid's device works and theirs doesn't so I spent countless hours with support trying to figure out the issue.  They released a software update but within another month the other device started doing the same thing.  The kids didn't mind rebooting but a few weeks later I released the devices weren't holding a charge as they'd charge them all night and they'd be dead 30 minutes later.  We had them use the cord when they used them but after a while even that wouldn't work.  Within 4 months both were very expensive bricks.The manufacturer has given some lip service that a new cord would fix the issue but it didn't work for us.  We tried to call customer support but gave up when 1) we never got a response and 2) saw thousands of others complaining about the same thing.  They ignored further contact for months well within the warranty period but after a while we (like most people I'd expect) gave up as it wasn't worth the frustration.Ultimately I think the combination of cheap parts, poor quality control, and modified software were too much for the great chip inside to offset (it uses the same processor you will find in many other devices like the Kindle and Nexus).  I do think someone at Fuhu knew these devices were faulty when they sold them and criminal charges should be filed but it will never happen.  I've written off the $400 we spent on these devices as money lost and my only regret is not getting a Kindle Fire or Nexus for the same price.And I will never buy anything from Fuhu ever again (though I doubt they will be around in another year with their rep).", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "not for us", "Author": "jane jones \"nana\"", "ReviewID": "R18MQNAK40BH7I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this to help my grandson to learn who has cerebral palsy, but this proven too difficult and costly. would not buy this if knew that", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shortcomings", "Author": "CLC", "ReviewID": "R3FEZH5BU8ZZOM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Nabi 2 can not access the Google play store, nor does the software allow for applications to be stored to an external SD card, thus creating space management issues.

I have not gone through it thoroughly yet, however, the biggest glaring problem I have found so far, is a LACK of customer support.  There is no owner's manual unless you print the ~30 page document with your own ink and paper. Fuhu wants you to e-mail any problems, which I did. Among the issues I was concerned about were registration issues (the email address I registered with is not the email they responded with IE: my address is bradfnp@xxxx, I received an e-mail back from FUHU to my bradfnp address that said that the e-mail I registered with was tml5376@xxxx. Confused? me too.) additionally we have had problems with \"Mommy Mode\" passwords and a request for credit card information at start-up, which (I don' think) ever worked because of the number of error messages we recieved. Anyways, two days later I receive a generic e-mail response, none of which addressed my specific problems. I did call the listed phone number 20 minutes after the call center opened (0900, pacific) and waited 1.5 hours.  Of course the pre-recorded message says that there is a long wait for phone service but facebook page response times are \"typically\" 5 minutes, which I guess is wonderful, except I am one of the very small minority that does not use facebook.  I have an idea, why not take one person off facebook responses and put them on the phone instead? I'm sure a 7 minute facebook wait is not nearly as painful as a 1+ hour phonecall wait. Anyways, I was told that all of the problems I was experiencing were because of a \"server being down\" but the customer service Rep was unable to explain why we Nabi owners were asked to update our tablets if the problem is not with the tablets themselves, rather, the Nabi server.  In my experience, support for the Nabi is non-existent.The tablet itself seems O.K. not many \"free\" programs for the kids, and with the credit card function not working, impossible to buy more, I like the size and the bright colors work well for our son.At this point, unless there is an Epiphany, I will only give 1 starEpic Nabi FailureBradfnp**12/29/12 Update**After a profoundly long wait, the customer Service Rep was unable to fully explain the confusion with e-mail addresses and assured me that a \"Team Leader\" would call to address my concerns \"By the end of business today\" (Yesterday). No phonecall was received.If you are OK with an un-supported Android tablet for your children, I think this fits the bill. it does have some pretty cool features.

This wasn't exactly divine inspiration on my part though last year I bought her a Leap Frog tablet for her fifth birthday. I told my grandchild to make a list of things she wanted for her birthday and Christmas. She and her parents went to FAO Schwartz, American Girl Place, Best Buy, and a few other tech stores. Her parents and I looked at all the tablets currently available, and compared them and read the reviews. The Nabi was at the top of the list, but all adults involved had reservations regarding a movement away from traditional learning as well as questioning the versatility of this tablet. I ended up taking her to the store and watched her take this on a test ride. The image is crisp and bright; surprisingly so considering it's for kids. I've seen adult tablets that aren't all that great. It has plenty of add ons for learning modules that will help teach math skills, etc. that mimics and reinforces the skills she is learning in school, but it also has plenty of apps that come preloaded. It can be used as a ereader, is portable, and solid with a heavy rubberized case. While this isn't my iPad, this is a very nice tablet and extremely kid friendly. Ouite honestly, I'd rather that she have her own tablet instead of going after the adults tablets which really aren't appropriate for children.Of course, when my granddaughter opened her present she was in kid heaven. According to her parents, they now limit her time on the Nabi and she never uses it before she finishes her homework and practices her penmanship. They are already noticing an improvement in her math skills and notice that she is really enjoying the games and reading materials that are available as well as the educationally based apps.She is very careful when she handles this, but the power cord seems a little flimsy. That is about the only criticism that I have regarding this product. This is a great product that has seems to have solid educational value and offers a lot for the $150 I paid for it. It is cute and is a perfect entry level tablet that can sneakily educate while still being entertaining. Best yet, it can grow with the child and his/hers needs.If you are considering buying this for a kid, I suggest you read the specs and a couple of the top rated customer reviews here. They are detailed and technical and focus on the positives and possible negatives. Compare this with comparable products regarding the features and specs and most definitely check this out at a store. What surprised me when I took my grandkid to the store was how quickly she took to it. She's bright and definitely electronic savvy and very much into school, but she breezed through this at the store and told me what she liked about it. Ultimately, that's what sold us on this toy.

Two of my kids have Kindle Fires and for our youngest, we chose this. I so wish we hadn't chosen the Nabi2. She received it for Christmas, and out of the box, it was difficult to set up and learn, but we did it. She did enjoy using it, but only used one or 2 functions, because the others were difficult to figure out AND I didn't want to store a credit card number on the Nabi2, which immediately made several functions unavailable (am I the only one that doesn't want to load credit info on a child's device??). Even so, I was OK with what she was using because she enjoyed it.After 3 months, the screen had a series of obscuring grey lines that wouldn't clear. I called customer service and the phone experience was fine- relatively short wait time and they had me send it back for replacement. Crazy me, though, because I thought 'replacement' meant I would receive a new one in the box-- again, ours was only 3 months old and we didn't damage it. I sent ours back in the original box with all the parts, insured it, etc. What I received back 2 weeks later was a loose Nabi2 tablet, no consumer packaging, just a piece of Styrofoam on each end holding it in the brown cardboard box. Now, I don't have a charger, a box in case I want to store it, etc. Fine, I'm still willing to move forward if it works, so I order a new charger and luckily it is charged when I turn it on.Guess what?

This tablet got rave reviews and I was excited about my purchase.The tablet itself is cute looking.  However, it stops there.  The tablet is not user friendly.  I found going from the Kids Mode into the Mommy Mode most annoying.  I downloaded some free apps from Amazon and then struggled to move them into the Kids Mode.  Not sure how, but my daughter managed to purchase $15 in apps from Amazon on my account, when I thought she was playing in the safe Kids Mode.  Their big seller iare all the preloaded apps.  These are worthless.  They are mindless games, nothing educational.  You would not have paid anything for them if you had to buy them yourself.  Also, the camera only takes self pictures, so your child can not use it to take photos.Bottom line, if you are an Apple user, YOU will not be happy with this product.  If you can afford to spend the extra money, I would recommend purchasing the Mini IPad or IPod for your child.  There a tons of free educational apps through Apple.  With the restriction locks and passcode, you can turn off adding, deleting apps, Internet, etc.  I is safer than the Nabi.

The first one she left on the floor in my bedroom and I stepped on it in the middle of the night cracking the internal screen. We still had warranty but I would have to pay $80 +shipping to get it fixed. So we chose to just get her a new one.At first the Nabi 2 was awesome. She loved the games. As a parent I loved the parental controls. Then she found the loop hole into accessing the app stores. If a child clicks on in game ads it will take them to the app store. Nabi's app store sucks. It doesn't have any worthy apps on it. So we had to download Amazon and Google Play. A lot of the Google play store apps do not work properly on this tablet. I think I downloaded maybe 7 apps before the tablet started running out of memory. So we bought her a 8BG SD card. Which come to find out is useless because you can not transfer apps to it, only pictures and videos. The Nabi customer service told me that at this time its not possible.The whole comes with 8GB is a JOKE. Because thats what it has before Fuhu themselves put apps on it. So at the time of purchase it really only has 4GB.  My daughter was getting frustrated at not being able to have many games on it. So we decided to delete a good portion of the pre-installed crap that was on it.Now the BIGGEST problem we've had with this tablet and what makes me ever regret buying this piece of crap is the fact that I've had to do a hard master reset 3 times (looking at the 4th time now because the same problem happened again) is that it looses its WIFI ability. For some reason the wifi just stops working. We'll click the \"connect to wifi button\" and nothing happens. Theres no way to connect to one at all anymore. The only way to fix this (via the customer service agents and the FB page) is to do the reset. Which is just a HUUUUGE pain in the bum bum. After resetting you have to go through and delete all the apps you deleted to make more memory. Then go to all the app stores and redownload all the apps.I just really wish I would of researched this tablet beforehand. If you go to the Facebook page, switch the wall setting to \"posts by others\". You'll see the countless other people who are having problems repeatedly with this tablet.

Purchased it through another retail outlet. In concept, it's great, but in practice, it has numerous problems.First off in terms of durability, the battery and charging system is an Achilles heel. Instead of charging through the USB port, it charges through a dedicated plug that is incredibly fragile. Put in the hands of a youngster, it doesn't stand a chance. We've had to replace the charger/cable twice now.If that weren't bad enough, the battery on ours has ceased to accept a charge twice. The first time it was returned and replaced within the 1 year warranty period. I have now had to return it a second time and and still awaiting replacement. I can't get an update on the status from their customer service and it has been over a month.With regards to the operating system itself, it's very cumbersome. For web surfing it is incredibly restrictive with the included browser. A parent pretty much has to sign in and approve every URL. My oldest kid got so frustrated with it that she quit using it.The solution is to update to the latest available Android OS and install Google Chrome. Unfortunately, this leaves the browser wide open with no parental controls available (at last check anyway).I think the sweet spot for user age is from 4-7. My four year old got some use from it when he was three. My oldest old pretty much outgrew it before her 9th birthday, although she she likes it to play games from the Google Play store.Another source of irritation is if you want to set up multiple kid profiles. The kids can't switch between profiles themselves. You've got to log in with Mommy/Daddy password to switch it for them. And if you set a time limit, you can't switch kid profiles without resetting the time limit first.Finally, the customer service is pretty much awful. To get any response, you need to post on the Nabi Facebook page.Wish I could recommend a better option. Haven't tried very hard to find one though. My oldest is almost 10 and has pretty much out grown it. She has started using a hand me down Kindle Fire, but I've got to get some better parental controls in place. My youngest is four and was starting to use the Nabi before it crapped out this last time. Hoping to get it back so he can use it while we work on finding something better. In the meantime, he plays games on mom's iPad and his Leap Pad.Update 4/30/14: After this last battery issue, they sent us yet another replacement unit at no charge. It just showed up in the mail one day with no prior update on repair status. This was outside the original warranty period, so kudos to Nabi for that.

They both love it so much that the fighting over it was intense when they are here together.  We tried getting a second, cheaper product to have two devices and that failed miserably.  The cheap tablet we bought began failing to boot up less than a month after purchase.  We are buying a second Nabi for Christmas.  While it does have it's limitations we still feel that it's the best tablet for toddlers and younger kids.True, you are more or less locked into purchasing aps from the Nabi store, but the majority of them are cheap; and how much diversity does a toddler really need?  There are many great toddler aps from one to three dollars and we have over a dozen games on our nabi for a very low investment.  They can also watch Netflix, which my grandkids love.  Although the item is pricey, when you consider that it grows with the child and there are aps for kids up to age 8, it is a good investment if you teach the child to respect the item and not leave it laying around on the floor.It is an electronic item and in spite of the great rubber bumper it comes with, it will break if it's left on the floor and gets stepped on.  If you have a chaotic household and your kids like to leave things on the floor I wouldn't buy this unless you're willing to make the effort to have a special place for the Nabi and to stay on top of them in terms of putting it away when not in use. My two year old granddaughter knows how to put the Nabi on and off the charger by herself and is responsible about putting it away when she isn't using it; but it took some conditioning to get her to that point and I had to be the \"meanie\" and take it away for awhile when I found it abandoned on the floor.  She learned quickly to put it away.Your peace and quiet will increase with the Nabi and for that alone it's worth every penny I paid for it. I've seen our two year old grandkids play with the Nabi quietly, off and on, throughout most of the day--watching Goosebumps on Netflix, watching you tube videos of their sibling's gymnastics classes on youtube, playing games,  using the coloring aps and the puzzle aps.  The latter two are awesome--coloring and puzzles without crayons and puzzle pieces all over the floor  getting lost and stepped on.  A secondary boon to the Nabi is a reduction in messes and clean up.There are MANY activities in ONE item which means less clean up and less to keep track of---I love this product and highly recommend it!

Both of our boys LOVE their Nabi! They play with them several times a week (they'd spend more time on them but we limit it) and have not gotten bored. I do go through and change around/add/delete apps every couple of months to keep things interesting for them. We don't buy apps through their app center, instead I get everything through Amazon App Store. I love that the boys can't make purchases (even from the ads on free apps), get to websites that I haven't preloaded, or play apps that I haven't personally put on there and tried out first. You, as a parent, do have to put some time and effort into making this enjoyable. Since it's 100% parental controlled its not something you can just hand them out of the box and expect great results.As far as durability, I give it 5 stars! Ours have been dropped down a full flight of carpeted stairs, a half flight of concrete stairs outside, stepped on (our kids are both about 40lbs and I know have both been caught on several ocassions standing on them if they get layed on the floor next to the couch), dropped off our kitchen table and they both still work perfectly.As far as speed, I can't complain. Sometimes the downloading is slow and sluggish but I'm typically downloading while the kids are in bed and I'm in no big hurry, so that doesn't bother me much. The apps always work flawlessly unless they need to be updated. Again, you have to spend time as a parent making sure everything stays updated...just like any other tablet. Ocassionally one of them seems to have a delayed response to swiping the screen open, but not enough that its an issue for us.I have never had to call customer service, so I can't review that aspect of it. Although customer service levels have diminished greatly across the board so I wouldn't be surprised if it was inadequate here as well.My only real gripe is that accessories are expensive.

The glass and the LCD broke when my son was playing with the preloaded drum set app. He was hitting the screen with his fingers, having a crazy amount of fun... until it broke. He wasn't hitting it very hard, but apparently hard enough.  Nabi will replace the screen for around $80.00, if you don't have a warranty to cover the cost.I read rave reviews for this tablet before I purchased it, perhaps ours was just unlucky.***********************************************************EMATIC FUNTABI bought this tablet for my 2 year old daughter. I set it up prior to giving it to her. It was fairly simple. Switching screens is a little confusing at first. I found myself \" lost \" a few times. The preloaded apps are nice, and it was fairly simple to put everything else I wanted on it. The tablet is fast, but dropped wifi a few times. Over all I didn't have any problems with it.It doesn't come with a case, but it has grips on either side that are a nice addition.Kid safe? Nope. Screen broke in a couple of weeks. The glass and the LCD both shattered. The glass and the LCD broke from a 1 1/2 foot drop onto plush carpet. The point of impact was the upper right hand corner, it shattered clear across the screen.*******************************************************My children are obviously young, they are just starting out with electronics. They were supervised while playing with both the Nabi and funtab. There was no abuse, or rough play with them. They didn't have them long enough for rough play. They broke from pure accidents. An older child might not have the same issues we had with the screens at all. I waited for my son to get a little older and gave him my old Coby Kyros 9.7 inch to play with.  It's been six months and the screen is still intact.  It was fairly easy to child proof. We don't have a big problem with him clicking adds or buying anything. I simply blocked the Wifi and browsers. He hasn't found his way into the settings or anything like that. (yet) Its far to slow for me, but to use it for the things my son likes to do ( movies, learning apps, low graphic games) it's pretty great.Over all, no tablet is kid safe. No magic screen that won't break. Both kid tablets had in app purchases I couldn't hide.

Overall, we like the platform, and that we could set up Netflix for him to watch kids shows. It's easy to add apps from Amazon (although it was a great disappointment when we couldn't find a version of Star Wars Angry Birds that would work with the Nabi), and Amazon has some great free leaning apps.We've had a few problems with the Nabi freezing, but it's always fixed by powering it down and starting it back up. The real problems started when he'd had it a few months. It wasn't charging, and while we were on vacation it wouldn't power up at all. The charger is finicky and you have to play with it to get it to actually charge. About fifty percent of the time it has to be plugged in to turn on, which makes it useless for travel.

This is a wipe and reload process, meaning that everything you have on there, games, pictures, etc., will be deleted and the tablet will be back to the way it was when you first opened it!  Our kids have accumulated many games through the Amazon Appstore. The games are not lost, they just have to be downloaded again one by one, or a few at a time at best.  This is devastating to a child that has worked hard to earn his way up many levels only to have to start all over! Also, this process is extremely time consuming!

Nabi told me that it had been signed for, then on the next call they told me it had never been received even though FEDEX said it was signed for.  It sure seems like there is A LOT Of miscommunication in this company. All in all -there has been A LOT of problems, it never worked right from the beginning, It took over a month to get my son's nabi tab back, they told me they would ship it 1-2 day air and didn't, they told me they didn't get it and did.

Guess I got lucky since it sounds as if the Nabi servers crashed during Christmas.The set-up is relatively easy for those with basic computer skills.  Some things are not intuitive, but I have been able to google for answers on all questions - there is a ton of information out there.I also googled to find out how to get Netflix installed - which can be easily done by downloading the Amazon App store.  While I was there I also installed the Kindle App and synced our Kindle account - not sure if I will ever use it as an e-reader, but the app works fine.Overall 4 year old loves it, and his teenage siblings also swipe it to play games, watch videos etc.  Have not used much of the educational software yet, since it is mostly for Kindergarten aged kids, but I am sure he will grow into it.Also, I wound up ordering a \"stand\" that clips to the back, allowing the tablet to sit upright on a table / surface.  My son likes to watch videos while mom is prepping dinner in the kitchen, this looks like a neat add-on to make this more convenient.One gripe - it uses a special charger.

Previously she had been using a Leap Pad tablet, but had outgrown that and wanted something that could run actual apps and play all the games she likes to play on my full size Android Tablet.  This fits the bill perfectly.  It's a solid Android tablet in its own right.A couple of minor gripes, I don't think they were fully prepared to handle the support load after the holidays and combined with problems with their online services, the initial setup was troublesome.Furthermore, mine arrived with a bad charger.  Once I managed to get through to someone, I had a replacement at my door in 2 days.  But I had to try quite hard to actually reach someone.  Their phone support line just was flat out not taking any calls, you'd just get a recording that basically said they were too busy to help you, attempts to contact them through their website support link and Facebook page were also fruitless.  I finally resorted to combing through their Facebook feed to sending emails to specific people.  FINALLY someone got back to me and got me a replacement charger.  This experience left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, hopefully this was just a one off problem as a result of the extra influx of holiday purchase combined with their technical problems as I've heard they have a pretty good support reputation.I also don't care for the kiddie interface, but its easy enough to disable.  Ironically, my daughter is probably more used to the vanilla Android experience from playing with my own devices than this kid sandbox.Lastly, I really dislike the choice of a separate charging cable and separate power brick.  It uses a very thin barrel plug that is just begging to be broken off by a child.  Everything nowadays can charge off of USB, so why have it set up this way?  it's so fragile looking, that I decided to hang onto the charger, so she doesn't break it.  I just want one regular USB cable and the ability to charge it via my computers USB port with the option to use the power brick for faster charging.Despite the warts, it's still a nice, powerful tablet and most importantly, my daughter loves it.She's been using it for a few weeks now and it's holding up well so far and performing nicely.

My kids are 7 and 4 and I wanted to get them into the \"tablet\" technology so that they can learn to use it now and grow as it does.  My 7yr old uses iPad's in school, so she is at least familiar with the tech but my 4 yr old hadn't really used a tablet unless it was one of the \"kid\" ones in the Leapster aisle in TRU.  I didn't open and set these up prior to Christmas, so I got stuck trying to get them set up in the middle of the great Christmas 2012 Amazon datacenter outage that affected Nabi's servers (as well as other firms such as Netflix).  After hitting the Nabi Facebook page for help, I was able to get the Nabi's set up and UPDATED with NO issues.  The update to the latest version of the firmware solved about 90% of my issues.  The other minor lingering issues were solved by again reading the Facebook posts and finding out that I had to force close/clear data on several apps via Mommy/Daddy mode to get them operational again.  NONE of this was rocket science and I didn't have to make a single call to Nabi support.  They had staff and Nabi \"fan\" (volunteers) available on Facebook all week including Christmas day answering questions and helping out.  Yes, it took a little time to figure out and fix the issues with our new Nabi's but honestly, most of the time involved was spent scrolling through the Nabi Facebook page looking for my answers.The unit has a nice feel to it but I don't care for the \"bumpy\" plastic rear -- I understand it's for the kids to stick letters and shapes onto I just wish there was a cover for it if you aren't going to be adding letters/shapes.  The red bumper guard is supposed to help protect the Nabi in case of a drop but I've read on FB where users have broken screens from drops -- I suppose like anything else, it depends on how it lands.  There are newer Nabi bumpers available for $30 that are thicker than the stock one -- perhaps they would help protect from damage a little better.  I find the interface very easy to use.  The icons are large and easy for kids to use.  I appreciate the dual mode kid/parent interface.  On the kid side, things are big, bright and friendly.  The kids just can't go to any website that they want.  They can't install things on their own.  On the grown up side (mommy/daddy mode), things look a bit more like what you would expect to find on a tablet.  You can install apps and they won't show in kids mode unless you approve them to be moved over there so it's like having 2 tablets for the cost of one.I only had to give my 4yr old a 2 minute demo on how the tablet works and she was on her way (she uses my desktop PC and plays her sister's Nintendo DS, so she has been exposed to games and the like before -- she just needed to figure out the touch screen interface since she was used to using a joystick or keyboard to play games).  Since Nabi is still pending Google Play approval, you either have to use the Nabi built in App Zone portal or you can download and use Amazon's Android Store app.  The hardcore Android users can also backdoor Google Play apps into the Nabi from another Android device if there is some killer app that they absolutely just can't live without but the general public will probably trudge along just fine until Nabi gets a Google Play official seal of approval.  There are other sites out there like appszone.com you can use to get apps from as well, but Amazon's portal covers the bases well and is easy to use.  Just make sure you set up the parental controls on the Amazon app so that the kids can't buy things (intentionally or unintentionally) without your knowledge.My wife also likes the Nabi since it becomes a \"normal\" tablet when you are in Mommy/Daddy mode and you can access Facebook, Netflix, and all normal internet sites.  The only issue that we've had worth noting is with some of the Disney Junior games crashing and requiring a hard reboot to get out of.  I doubt that this is a Nabi issue and more than likely some quirk with the Disney game or the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS.  It's a really neat little tablet and my kids seem to like it a lot (I know I have been having a good time with it!).  It might need a little more \"tech\" attention paid to it initially than say an Apple product, but once it's set up and updated, it works just fine and definitely worth the $130 we paid.  My only suggestion to Nabi so far would be to use a fatter charger tip -- I've read quite a number of messages from users who have had the charger tip break off in the Nabi since the charger tip is so thin.UPDATE: 03/24/13 -- Both of our Nabi 2's have been working without any major issues since Christmas.  It should be noted that these are mini computers and not a Leapfrog toy.  I don't know how many Nabi's Fuhu went through to get a video of one being dropped 7ft without breaking, but don't let that video fool you into thinking these are indestructible -- they are not.  Broken screens posts abound on the Nabi Facebook page.  Also take into consideration that since you are installing 3rd party programs, don't expect 100% up time/compatibility with the Nabi like you would from something like a Leap Pad where the environment is locked out and you can only run their content.  The Nabi will require some working knowledge of how a computer works and it will require some of your time to properly maintain.  Your kids will also need to be taught that this is not a Nintendo DS and it can't be abused like they can -- the Nabi will not take the punishment.UPDATE: 04/02/13 -- Don't make too many waves on the Nabi Facebook page -- they will block you from posting.  Apparently they didn't appreciate being told that they need to release a firmware revision to allow moving apps to the SD card.  Thanks Nabi.UPDATE: 09/19/13 -- Still no issues to report other than being banned from Nabi's Facebook page (I no longer even look at their site or their FB page).  Both of our Nabi's are working fine and we've not found any apps that we can't install (other than Apple specific ones that aren't available on Android).  I got the latest update installed on both Nabi's over the weekend but haven't really messed with any of the new features.  Our 8 year old doesn't use her Nabi as much as she used to -- she prefers her Apple Touch but she does still play the odd game on it now and again.  Our 4 year old still plays her Nabi almost (if not) daily.  Still a great buy @ $130 and well worth the money we spent on them.UPDATE:  01/23/14 -- Still have both Nabi's.  Our oldest daughter is 8 and got an iPad2 for Christmas, so she has been spending most of her leisure time either on that, her iPod or the PC but she will on occasion pull out her Nabi and get some use out of it  (I find I use it more now than she does).  Our youngest daughter is 5 and still uses her Nabi almost every day.  I spent many hours rooting both units back in November and installed Google Play.  Of course a few weeks after I did that, Nabi released an OTA update that upgraded to Jellybean and officially added Google Play.  I've since run the OTA's on both units to keep them current.  I'll have to look into what I need to do to remove Wings as it's a storage pig at 100MB.  I still don't see what the big stink is with the Google Play store.  I've not found but a handful of apps that I could only get from there.  Amazon's App store is my first stop when looking for Apps.  No issues to report on either unit.  Personally, I think these are a great value and since I am the \"IT\" guy for all of our electronics, I prefer working on the Android OS MUCH more than the Apple OS (I loathe Apple's stuff -- sure, they look nice, but I hate the interface and OS).UPDATE:  02/11/14 -- I was finally able to remove Wings and University from both Nabi's.  I used a free app called File Explorer with the root add-on module to delete the files which were kinda tricky as some of them resided in read only folders.  I think I ended up freeing up ~120MB of internal storage by deleting Wings/University which we never used.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nabi is just OK for me.

My two year old couldn't even play it because there is only one actual game downloaded! The included apps are NOT games! You have to spend $25 just to put a game on the leappad and cannot download games from other sites.We took the leappad back and bought the NABI 2, I was really worried since the reviews aren't the greatest! As soon as I started it up my son took it and started playing games! I was amazed how much there was already pre loaded on this device! The nabi app zone has hundreds off free games, interactive story books, music and creation apps! This device is great for all ages! The nabi app zone also has where you can search apps by the child's age. Even if you want to actually buy an app its only $1.99 to $.99 as opposed to the $25 for the leapfrog games!  You can also download the amazon app store and 1Moble Market to get extra downloads. Through the amazon market you can get an app called (FREEdiYouTube) where you can search and add full length movies and shows! The nabi website shows you how to download the amazon app! There is no paper manual but there is a complete MANUAL that walks you though everything on the NABI WEBSITE! Once you download shows and movies you can find them on nabi mode/children's mode \"GALLARY\" folder! It took me a little bit to figure this out! I was able to Download sponge bob shows, Brother bear 2, the brave little toaster and tractor tom shows!There are also great learning apps to download that teach the alphabet, math, science, reading, shapes, colors and really endless opportunities! FOR FREE!!!! This is really two tablets in one, when in the child mode kids can push anything and play games you've loaded for them, then when you go into parent mode (password protected) you can check your mail, surf the web, get on facebook and pretty much do anything you do on a regular computer! It reminds me off how you can have different profiles through your windows computer, but the PARENT controls everything!It comes with the red rubber skin, I would recommend getting a memory card up to 32mb since there is so much you can download, you will fill the memory fast! You can buy these on amazon or Big Lots has the 32mb memory cards for $19... I would also recommend the clear screen covers (cheapest on amazon)(the kindle fire 7in screen cover should work.. A carrying case or just you a child size backpack and headphones/or speaker!Hope this helps! I usually don't review things but once I found this product and was so let down by the leappad ultra I thought I would leave feedback! Good luck!!!

Another tech said they would be helping and sending instructions; they did not send anything. The original tech posted on facebook that she was sorry that she found my email in her spam. She then emailed me with a number to call her. I called her and asked that they pay the postage. She emailed me instructions on how to mail back and a UPS prepaid label to mail the NABI in. I mailed it in and waited; I received no acknowldgement from them that they recieved my shipment and became concerned. Emailed, no reply. Posted on facebook; this time totally irritated and original tech said she emailed me about the Nabi being returned. I posted that she did not as I check my email and spam everyday and they have the most horrible customer service I have ever dealth with. Posted as a reply to me on the Nabi facebook and an email back to me stated Nabi was shipped. I got the new version of the Nabi via UPS and was excited.(This was 12/24/12) Charged it, registered it, and the screen went blank. It will not power on. I tried to contact Nabi via facebook; apparently they blocked me from posting on their wall! I emailed the original tech on 12/25 and waiting for a reply. I called their number, WHY?

I called the Nabi cares line & was on hold for 30 minutes until I spoke to someone.  Then on with the very nice & helpful supprt person.  She had me do a hard reset on the system & reboot the Nabi - which meant I lost all the info I already stored in the system - small price to pay if it was going to work. It seemed to be working ok, so I packed it up & wrapped it up for christmas.  My son opened it Christmas day & we tried to start it for him & guess what - totally glitched out & shut down AGAIN.  So I called customer support for the 2nd time & was on hold for an hour & a half - that's right 90 minutes - I finally hung-up having never spoken to anyone.  I then proceeded to send an email to the address that I heard every other minute on the automated message while on hold for 90 minutes.

I will admit I was a little ticked off when one month later they dropped from $200 to $175. I had three boys ranging between 5 to 9. At first I thought it was amazing, even an adult could enjoy it in parent mode.Apps-It is durable and has some fun apps. Ninja Fruit is absolutely addictive. Its educational apps are somewhat lacking. The subject apps by grade level have one major flaw. They do not read out the story or questions for lower grade levels.The apps in general are pretty basic and boring. My kids lost interest in most of them rather fast except for a few. I am happy they now have the Nook app, but you would think they would have a Kindle app. Beware if you use the amazon app store to not allow you kids access. My kids started d/ling games that cost money from the app store that I did not have. It isn't their fault per se due to all the freaking advertisement or free trial versions.Costumer Service-Costumer service in general is great. they did change how you can replace your nabi. You now have to call them, which can be an inconvenience when one parent is hearing impaired and the other has an accent.AttachmentsTheir attachments are really expensive and I wish they would allow you to chose your bumper color or maybe have an additional small fee instead when buying your nabi online. Another thing that would have been wonderful is a screen protector. The screen can become skittish and extra sensitive to touch.Camera-The camera is horrible. It is poor quality and only forward facing.Battery Life and Charger IssueBattery life and charging is another issue. I had to replace two nabi(s)n already because they would not charge. The chargers felt loose in the port. I have also requested more chargers. I found out Kmart, Walmart do not carry this charger on hand.  I am tempted to buy some nabi compatible chargers on amazon to compare the difference. When reviewing different chargers on Amazon, some parents noted the original nabi charger, charges slower then the off brand they purchased on here. I think they should have chosen a different charger type for the nabi.My other issue is battery life. I was playing Ninja Fruit and saw how quickly it will die. It went from a full charge to 2/3 charged in less than an hour.Summary-My kids love their nabi. They like to watch Netflix and play Angry Birds, Burn The Roap and Ninja Fruit on it. They don't like how long it takes to charge their nabi or the battery life. I like how it is durable from most falls, the costumer service and that my kids enjoy it. I also like being able to get online myself to check on certain things.I don't like how it isn't as educational as they advertised and the little things can add up.The nabi is fine if your child isn't use to Google Play or Iphone options and this is mostly for entertainment.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poorly put together", "Author": "Andrea Edwards", "ReviewID": "R30JKF24NX3J0D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Locks up too often.

Ofcourse I have the Netflix account already, so that is why he can watch it, however BEWARE if you install Netflix, because Netflix does not have a parental feature to stop your kid from watching ANYTHING on his Nabi, or any other tablet for that matter.I do love this and also downloaded the Amazon store app which helps when he wants to buy new video games. The ones preinstalled are not great, and in fact, many are downright confusing and dull to use. The music is ridiculous, and only features one artist who is kind of folksy so you really  have to love her to love the music.When my son goes to bed, I switch this into Mommy Mode and use it for myself.

Useless apps", "Author": "CrankyJinVT \"Cranky J\"", "ReviewID": "R3L69CV782D9TM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My 5yr old daughter received a Nabi 2 from her (extremely generous) uncle for Christmas this year (2 days ago).My wife has no capacity for handling anything electronic, and thus it's fallen to me to learn all about this device so I can help my daughter with it.Thus far, my impressions are pretty mixed.First, the good: - The Nabi 2 appears to be a solidly built device, and exudes quality. The kid-safe bumper that comes with the tablet is an excellent idea, and appears to be very useful. Videos online of drop tests conducted thus far indicate that the device is able to survive most 3ft drops. Considering my daughter is all of 4ft tall, that should be sufficient.The screen of the Nabi is nice too. Resolution looks good, it is bright and colorful, and seems to be very responsive to touch.The physical buttons and ports all appear to be positioned pretty well, and I've not encountered any problems with the ports. I will say that I've already encountered some slight issues with the volume up and down control buttons, as they just don't seem to be immediately responsive.I also like the fact that the system is setup to have both a Kids mode and a Parents mode, allowing me to determine what will be available for her to use and look at. Doing so in the parents mode is pretty straight forward, and the UI in Parents mode is much like you'd find on every other Android device. Pretty good.  The Kids mode is a greatly simplified UI, with large buttons for little fingers to hit - each button clearly marked with pictures of what the App is. It seems to work pretty well so far.Setup of the Nabi was pretty smooth too. No issues at all really.However, now for the bad: - The \"free\" software that comes pre-installed on the Nabi is, essentially, completely useless, and compared to nearly any app I've been letting my daughter use on my iPad2, those on the Nabi are garbage. Most are extremely poorly developed, with nearly ALL of those pre-installed being the \"Lite\" versions of games or apps. Meaning that a child can play through the app in under 5 minutes. As for the Fooz-Kids University apps...Nabi wants to charge you $9.99 per year for EACH of the Apps. Considering the very low quality of the other pre-loaded apps, I have no intention of spending $50-60 on these other apps.The good news is that because the device is running on a custom version of Android 4.0 (whatever odd name they have for this), the tablet \"should\" be able to run a lot of the other actual GOOD apps available through the Google Marketplace, or from Amazon. The BAD news is that every single time I've attempted to check out other apps through the Nabi App store... I'm constantly and consistently told that their servers are unavailable. Not very helpful.Which brings up the next less-than-impressive item. The Nabi Help Center. When I called to ask about the problems I was encountering trying to connect to their servers, I first got a busy signal, then disconnected...and when calling back, was placed on hold for 10 minutes...before I finally gave in and hung up. Needless to say, that wasn't impressive.Granted, it's Christmas time, and they were probably flooded with calls. I'll reserve final judgement on their Support until after I've actually been able to reach someone on the phone.Hopefully, they'll resolve their server issues soon as well, and perhaps I'll be able to actually load up some worth-while apps for my daughter to use on her new tablet.In Summary:  The Nabi 2 appears to be a very nice piece of hardware - though I still don't quite get the design of the back of this thing! If anyone can explain it, I'm all ears - and I think it's going to prove to be durable enough to last for a long time. However, the claims from Nabi about all the great free software is complete rubbish. The software is nearly useless, and in no time at all you'll be spending a lot of your time removing all the pre-installed crap, and trying to get more useful apps loaded on. Good luck. Hopefully the servers will be available when you try this.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nabi 2 how do you do", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3I8Y5UX2RFFEV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my Nabi 2 a little over a month now and my family really enjoys it. We do have a few issues with it.First the preloaded android keyboard SUCKS, it tells you that you are spelling Every word wrong (Every word, like It and at) And it auto-corrects to some really bad words (like Birthday corrected to A**hole) I asked the Fan-a-Techs what to do and their only advice was to shut it off. Like its normal for a keyboard not to work on a learning tablet.. One tech told me to download a new keyboard app. Not \"oh we know its an issue and are working to fix it in the next update\" Just \"shut it off\" I dont normally use auto-correct but I do like spell check..Next It doesnt come with the android market, but the nabi market. And it is a HUGE hassle to get the droid market on the NABI2. It can be done (unless your droid phone doesnt support the site after you spent an hour downloading) but it is a very huge pain in the neck. I resorted to just using the amazon market which is much easier to install, but doesnt have as many apps as the droid market.With in 2 weeks of me owning it the charge broke. Im not sure how it just stopped. I nor the kids play with it while its charging so it wasnt from abuse. But Nabi Cares sent me a new cable right away.And last Several of the apps dont work right. They either stop responding or wont load.But the good thing about the Nabi is, you just put on a different app and you are good to go.Now for the good, It is super easy to use. I have a 17 month old and a 6 year old and they both use it with ease. My 6 year old loves to watch movies and play the learning games, my 17 month old love to use the coloring books.I use it more then they do though. I actually bought it for myself to use because I wanted a tablet that if I let my kids play with it , it wasnt going to be murdered if they trip and fall with it or something like a Nook or an Ipad would.So far this Tablet has survived many accidents of being dropped, and even sat on once by my 17 month old thinking the car game was a ride on game lol.I highly suggest a screen protector , I got one that fits the Kindle Fire and it works great.The learning apps are great, though I would say a little old for a Kindergartner even though the setting on it is for grade K..I love the Chore list. you can use their preloaded chores or add your own. And your kiddo doesnt even have to be able to read to use it, It tells them the chores if they press on the speaker.So all in all , with a few annoyances I say the Nabi 2 is a great buy!", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for my boys", "Author": "FloridaQueen \"Luvmyboys\"", "ReviewID": "R2DA5U9RZXVMV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great functional tablet for children.

I do, and of course, no replies.  Then I send an email to another Nabi address I found on the web and phoned again - again,no reply.

Worked great in the beginning, son loved it. All was good until 4 months into having it, the screen began to go fuzzy and the images were broken in appearance.  My husband began trouble shooting, as well as looking at blogs to see what others had tried doing as a fix.  No better, so next he contacted Nabi.  He went through all trouble shooting with the tech on the phone, still nothing.  So being that it was a weekend day, the tech said to call back on Monday to get in touch with a Nabi Corporate person, who will then give us a RMA #.  Did that, sent it back via USPS, insured and with tracking.  Nabi received it in two days and we then had our second Nabi one day later.  Wow, we both thought that was great.  So now we have our second Nabi.  It does not come updated with the latest updates, so my husband began to do the update process on this Nabi for Android.  More problems, couldn't get past the first step of the update...called Nabi tech support again.  Went through trouble shooting and when all failed, the tech said to call Nabi Corporate for a prepaid shipping label.  Phoned Nabi on a Monday as it was the weekend when we had the trouble.  Corporate apologized for the trouble, sent us a prepaid shipping label via email for FedEx.  Also offered a free gift...I chose a camera.  So I wrapped up the Nabi with the label and headed to FedEx.  They took the package and that was that....two weeks now.  Nabi still has not received the second Nabi.  I did not get a tracking number from FedEx as I felt confident it would get to Nabi with no issues.  Well now we have issues.  I have tried to get a tracking number via FedEx and via Nabi...nothing.  FedEx said that Nabi should have received it within two days of me shipping it.  She also did not like the fact that the FedEx store didn't give me a receipt  for the package. Realistically, Nabi should be able to look up that information for the shipping label. I can't because once you ship using the prepaid label, it expires itself out after 5 days.  So basically, I have phoned FedEx twice, Nabi 3 times, this last one with me getting testy with the Nabi Corporate gal because she wouldn't transfer me to a supervisor....not cool. But we just got a second camera in the mail as a free gift.  Yes, now we have two cameras, a single worth more than the Nabi itself, yet no 3rd Nabi in our possession yet. Yes I read all of the reviews before purchasing this tablet for my son, but saw through the bad ones because the tablet itself had everything we wanted for him.  Other friends had also highly recommended it as well.

You have no ability to delete the pre-loaded content, or any of the free downloads. I switched the settings on Fooz kids because I did not want him watching videos, and the settings didn't change! Best of all there is no actual number to contact those people at. Also there is no way to prevent your child from accessing the internet (unless you make it forget the password to the internet) which is just irritating. Its also important to bear in mind that your child has complete access on the home screen to look at apps they don't already have, which is really annoying when you do not want to buy said apps, or hear complaining.

I really wish I would have just bought him the Kindle and password protected it for internet safety. I do not like to write negative reviews but I was so disappointed in this product. First let me say that while I am no means a technology expert I do know my way around computers and electronics very well. We have had problems with the chargers (break easily), the screen crackled and buzzed and died, very difficult to download most of the games my son wanted because it does not fully support google play and other popular game sites (you have to work your way around this). I have purchased the Nabi coins and redeeming them is an issue. However, the LCD screened has now cracked even though it wasn't dropped and you have to pay $75 for replacement. The worst complaint I have is the customer service. Just wow. I have never been able to reach them by phone and when I sent an email to customer service their response was for me to visit their Facebook page to get help from other users!On a positive note: The screen resolution is bright and clear, volume is good and clear. It is child safe in regards to the internet which is very important to me. Kids cannot download games without parental approval. All of these positives are important but can also be found in other products so the bad outweighed the good for our family for this product. I highly recommend considering other products before purchasing.

The marketing pitch: The \"kid\" (or regular) mode displays items in a very straightforward and clickable manner making it very easy to select programs or functions - quite similar to an iPhone or iPad. There are many pre-loaded apps and games so it's easy to become familiar with the Nabi's capabilities. The \"mommy\" (or advanced) mode turns the Nabi into a sophisticated computer. In this mode you can pretty much do anything a regular tablet can do. Mommy mode determines the apps and functionality allowed in kid mode. Mommy mode also let's mom or dad use nabi as their personal tablet. My personal disappointment with Nabi is how advanced kid mode actually is. I assumed it would be very basic and easy-to-use for kids, but it's really not. Even just the clicking between screens is difficult and not very logical. For example, I would assume that a back button would be big and easy to use, especially for little kids' awkward inaccurate fingers, but this is not the case. The area to click the back button is in a tiny clickable area on the lower left hand side which is hard to see, illogically placed, and difficult for even an adult to accurately click. The camera function isn't very easy to use, the apps require much \"clicking-through\", and everything just seems very tiny and hard to click. For something that is supposed to be kid-friendly, I am surprised at how kid un-friendly it is. I would even call this mommy-unfriendly as it definitely takes some practice to figure out the mommy-mode or even how to use the kid-mode. So far, this has been a lot of mommy having to click through the kid mode, find the video that the kid wants, turn it on, and hand it to the kid. Also, it is very annoying that the battery doesn't seem to last that long, and even more annoying that the Nabi doesn't come with a simple stand. I would say most people probably buy this as a graduation from their kid constantly using their parents' iPad, to finally having a version of their own. But I think it can become more of a burden than a solution.

Compared to the Google Nexus 7 (which we have), the Nabi is as slow and awkward as Jabba the Hut trying to jog.I can appreciate the parental controls, but they are difficult to navigate for parents. It's like trying to get into Fort Knox. Plus you're limited to Amazon's app store which is not as complete as Google Play's. My child still uses my Nexus 7 to play some games that we can't get for her Nabi tablet.As for downloading movies and other media to the device...I still haven't figured that out. By comparison...it takes a minute to figure out how to download media on the Nexus 7.Worse, the unit is glitching and we've only had it a week. We turn off apps but they keep playing. We couldn't get the music to stop the other day even though we powered off the device. I can see from other reviews, that I have lots of glitches like this to look forward to. I'm concerned that eventually the tablet won't work unless it's fully charged as some other reviewers have encountered.Further, my kid has dropped my Nexus 7 down the stairs in such a manner that it came out of the protective case and it still works fine. So the protective case aspect of Nabi is not necessarily a competitive advantage. We were able to buy a protection plan for the Nexus too so it can be replaced if it's damaged. We didn't have that option with the Nabi tablet. (By the way I'm not shilling for the Nexus 7, it just happens to be the only other tablet I own. I have issues with the Nexus 7--like the time its map feature took us on a 100 mile detour-- but it is a better product than Nabi in my opinion.)If tablet navigation was just a pain, that wouldn't be such a big deal breaker for me, but the glitches make the Nabi tablet a DO NOT BUY for me.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my Nabi 2 but not the person I bought it from", "Author": "kattie higuera", "ReviewID": "R3TH6ZZ8761KN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This would have been my 3rd Nabi 2.

The rugged rubber bumper cover is great for kids with slippery hands, it has experienced some minor drops and being tossed around with absolutely no ill effects.My only qualm is the 8gb of on board memory. which gets filled up fast if you load a few apps, record some videos and upload a movie or two, having a micro SD slot helps although it doesn't appear you can run apps from the external memory.in comparison to competing products on the market it has a better processor than the toys r us knock off, performs as well as the kindle fire but is preloaded and set up for kid use and content", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great first electronic device for a small child.", "Author": "Mildred Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2J9FB79WF70CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This can access the internet but can be set with parental controls.

Welcome to the 21st century, I guess) and wanted to give it to him for Christmas. But because I needed my iphone back, I gave it to him earlier. Of course, he loves it!I did some basic research before getting it and although I am not the most tech savvy and wasn't looking for the top of the technical range, this seemed the best suited to our needs.A couple things I wish were better:- The weight. It is kind of heavy, especially for a young child. But it doesn't seem to bother him as much as me. If anything, it is indeed solid. He's thrown it on the floor a couple times (at that age, it's easier to drop things on the floor when done than put things on the table) and I am not worried about it. But if you are looking for something light weight, then the Nabi might not be the best choice.-  The camera. It is a front camera, which doesn't make much sense to me. And the quality isn't that great. It's dark. We used it to Skype his grand-parents and unless it's day time, they can barely see you (but you can see the person on the other end fairly well). Daytime was fine. So if the camera feature is an important one for you, again, the Nabi wouldn't be the best choice.Not particularly a con but I couldn't care less about the back. I didn't bother getting the Alpha pack that goes in the back. $25 is a little steep for it.On the bright side:- It is very easy to use. It is fast and you can easily access Android apps. I downloaded several apps and the 7 inch screen makes it more fun for him to use than my little iphone screen. We did have to compromise on some of his favorite apps on the iphone that are not available on the Nabi.But when he desperately wants to play a particular game only available on my iphone, I can use the Nabi myself for simple things, like my emails, skype, browsing the web, or even play games (when time allows).- I love the Mommy feature. Which is what sold me in the 1st place. It gives you great parental control on what he can access, and I don't have to look over his shoulder to see what he is doing. I would recommend you set it up before your child sees it or it'll take you for ever to get it back to set up.- The screen resolution is great, but, as other reviews say, it loses its quality and brightness if you look at it from the side.- I've had zero issues setting it up, moving the apps around (except for the few that can't be removed), or had any problems getting it started. You do have to press the start button at the beginning for a few seconds (which they tell you to do).This is a tablet I anticipate will last him a while and grow with him, or will be passed on to his little brother when old enough. So although the price is a little high, it is a decent investment for a kids friendly tablet.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Kerri-Ann Phipps", "ReviewID": "R1V4PHXMHXG473", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The item never charged at all.

The screen freezes, it constantly shuts off, Apps that were supposed to be only on Mommy/Daddy mode would show up on the Kids screen, wouldn't charge, passwords wouldnt work, 1/5 of the screen didnt respond to touch, device would log us out and errors would CONSTANTLY come up saying our account was invalid.....and if that's not bad enough....the reason we bought it ~ safety for little eyes.....could easily be disarmed as soon as the Low Battery warning would come on.  The warning gives you an option to click OK, or CHECK SETTINGS.  Well guess what, Check Settings brings you right into Mommy/Daddy modes without needing a password and then you child has complete access to adult apps, the Internet, settings, everything.  It took my son exactly 2 days to figure this out.The other major problem with this product is that the customer service is pitiful.  You can't reach anyone by phone, emails never get responded to, and their website directs you to their Facebook Page.  They have a handful of techs that try to help people, but they are so overwhelmed with the sheer numbers of people that need help, they never go back to check if their quick reply actually resolved the issue.After 3 frustrating weeks I returned my sons Nabi to Best Buy.  The employee was not at all surprised and pointed to the loaded shelf of other returned Nabis.  We decided to get a 4th generation iPod for the same amount of money as the Nabi, and my son LOVES it.

We're not exactly up-to-date with technology on our house and this was a big deal for us to be able to get this for our son. After doing all the research we thought that this was the best choice for sure...maybe it was, but that doesn't say much for the rest of the competition.Set-up isn't too bad, but trying to figure anything out afterwards is a lot of trial and error, and looking things up on the internet. (By the way, make sure you keep the box that it comes with because that's the only way to get a phone number for customer service. There is no number online. Everything is done by e-mail.) We were disappointed by the amount of trial/demo apps that came with it. Not exactly as advertised. You can't use Google Play unless you somehow hack the device, so you're stuck with Amazon Appstore or the Nabi appstore. And be prepared for bugs and issues. Every problem we have that I look up online has been reported by many others. For instance, there was an adaptor issue that left us unable to charge the device. They did send out a free replacement, but it was annoying to have to deal with it. The wi-fi wasn't connecting, so we had to do a hard reset and our son lost every accomplishment he had achieved in 6 months. Which also brings me to my latest gripe. We had installed Angry Birds Star Wars on the Nabi, and it was our son's favorite game. It is no longer compatible with the Nabi since we did the reset. It's not just the Star Wars version, it's all of them except for Bad Piggies, now.The Nabi does have some cool features, I'm not denying that. But it is far from the dream device that is advertised. When it's working, it's awesome. But there in lies the crux - WHEN it is working. Not sure I'd go this route again without some reassurance from Fuhu that they've cleaned up their act.Update:It's now been 6 months since we've had the Nabi and after several occasions of it freezing and screeching, it has not apparently stopped working completely.

The sound clarity is great on both ends and best of all its FREE!!!! I am porting my landline and saying goodby to the local ma bell!!!.

The build quality is actually very nice. The bumper guard does come off which is a neat feature. The speed of the tablet is very impressive, even compared to my retail $600 10 inch tablet.Cons:So far the only negative is the odd backing tabs?

We came across the Nabi 2 and were impressed with the features.  When walmart advertised it for $129 on black friday we jumped at the opportunity to purchase two of them.  I'm so not disappointed! We took them out of the box to customize for each child.  Set up was super easy. The screen was very responsive and we were up and running within minutes.I've read previous reviews where consumers were complaining they didn't have full access to the app store. I followed a couple of tutorial videos available on the Nabi website that walked us through the steps to download the full android market.  We downloaded both the amazon app store and the 1mobile market.  Both were very simple to download and had no problems.  Once downloaded we had FULL access to all apps available in android market including minecraft, netflix and youtube.  So don't believe the other reviewers when they say it's limited... that's called user error.My kids are very tech savvy.  My hubby and I have ipads and I use an android based cell phone and my kids have no problem navigating through both operating systems.I work in a cell phone store that carries many tablets and after much research believe this one is the best for younger kids. The price point is great, ease of use and durability all were factors in our decision to purchase this tablet over the rest.

It is a horrible product and the company has unbelievably bad customer service.Long story: After a lot of research I decided to buy the first generation nabi right when it came out in December, 2011, for my son's 3rd birthday in January. What appealed to me was the parental control, because I'd had issues on my Kindle Fire with him buying things without me knowing because I couldn't block him from doing so. I should have waited (Kindle has since resolved this issue), because after having the product for less than 3 months, the charging port stopped working. After spending THREE MONTHS emailing back and forth with nabi, I finally got a replacement for the broken one. They \"upgraded\" the replacement to the nabi2, but an upgrade it is not. The nabi marketplace is terrible, you can't even get Netflix on the \"upgrade.\" After using this one (very carefully) for less than 2 weeks, the exact thing happened, the charging port stopped working. I have been emailing nabi and posting on their Facebook page for the last 3 weeks and have not heard anything from them at all.My advice: Get the Kindle with new parental controls and individual profiles for each kid.

We purchased our first paperweight for our 12 year old, autistic, son for Christmas 2012.  Boy, the sparkle in his eyes on Christmas morning was one I will never forget!  He tore into that package and couldn't wait to begin playing with his new paperweight!  But there was one small problem.  The folks at Fuhu were so focused on making money that they spent their time and resources marketing their paperweight and comparing (inaccurately, even) to an iPad, that they never considered that the child may actually want to PLAY with it on Christmas morning.  Their servers were overloaded so very few were able to register or update the software so this rendered the tablets (aka: paperweights) useless.  It's okay though, because in a time when kids are so demanding, it's great for us to break their hearts on Christmas morning by teaching them a lesson in patience!!  A few weeks later, to make up for ruining the Christmas surprise of thousands of children, they did offer a few free apps..for those who were able to connect to their server to download them.Our first unit lasted TWO months before the charger went out.  At that time, there was no way to purchase a replacement charger (why on earth would a company think replacement chargers may be needed??!).  We stuck it in a drawer and tried to ignore that burning sensation in our pockets and told our son to stop his whining, that a $200+ tablet couldn't be expected to last longer than two months!  Nabi's awesome customer service reps told us to be patient, they were working on a replacement program.  In the meantime, around May,  I ran across a universal charger online and purchased it.  I charged that baby up and couldn't wait to see those cute little icons flash on the screen.  Except they didn't.  It was black.  Nabi refused any service.  They were in the process of developing a screen replacement program, \"Just be patient.\"  Around August, I noticed on facebook that they were now replacing screens, so I contacted them again.  This time, they had me send the unit to them and they sent me a refurbished unit.  Cool, they are finally getting it together!  Not.  ONE charge was all we got out out of this unit (two weeks of intermittent play) and the LCD unit went out on it again.  Never fear, though...those awesome folks at Nabi offered to replace the screen for me for ONLY $59.The above describes MY experience.  Others have had problems with the Nabi allowing their child to make in-app purchases (one case over $300) although the tablet is not supposed to allow the child to do this.  Refund was promised but never delivered.  Nabi may or may not answer emails.  Nabi reps will lie to the customer (told me a week ago they were sending me a shipping label to return the unit and it never arrived), they will ignore emails and many of them speak very poor English so even if they do call you, you're lucky to understand them.Before you purchase this expensive paperweight (if you dare), read the reviews on their facebook page.  Scroll through them because Nabi works hard to cover up the negative posts.  Look back at December/January of last year, but also read recent comments.  This thing is a disaster.

This allows you to free up space and install a fully functional Google Play. So, if your kid is super careful and you don't mind spending more on a tablet, yes there are better options (ipad, asus, etc..)...but they are pricey and I can assure you they are much more easily broken.

We bought this particular tablet because of the parental controls. However, while switching screens on my son's nabi, it would go into Daddy mode WITHOUT the usage of a password, which was strange as Daddy mode is supposed to be password protected. Well, we didn't know this until we saw 3 times our son charged 99.00 for coins (this we found while checking our bank balances online) and were in shock! We immediately contacted Nabi thru Facebook and their customer service number. We were promised by Kevin Johnson that we would be refunded 276.00 as our son had added and deleted several games. Well it has been a week and no refund. Just a bunch of empty promises. I had planned on getting two of our other children a Nabi, but forget it. Too much headache and lackluster customer service, polite promises and then holding our money hostage. This  is not the work of a trustworthy company.11/17-Yesterday afternoon my husband called Nabi again to see why we haven't been refunded, especially since we were assured we would be.

Lies lies lies. What is so infuriating is that these charges were due to the malfunction of their product! It should have never went into parent mode without a password! And there is no way my very autistic 10 year old son would know the password! Another thing I don't understand is they will not let us use Paypal to purchase coins, it has to be a credit card on file...but they can use Paypal to issue refunds (that they never give, obviously). This is a company of crooks. They should be ashamed. The purchases were UNAUTHORIZED and should have been reversed, but no, they quickly got the money out of our account...but now are dragging their feet about putting it back, saying sweetly oh, yes we will refund...then refusing to do it.

We could not figure if the $1 was what was temporary, or if it was the usage access that we would have that is temporary, but either way, an hour later we could not sign on unless we paid that $1 again!If I had to guess what this problem is, I'd say that the manufacturers released a buggy piece of crap that was not yet market ready, just like the Obamacare website.  They just released their buggy garbage because it was time to compete for those Christmas dollars.  Children are a blessing, and I am tired of these people marketing junk to kids.  God above sees their corruption.  If this is the best these idiots can do, I'll just remember to make sure everyone I know has better sense than to make the mistake we made, and steer them away from these NABI junk toys.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Serious Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R3B25GNRXSEQIX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After reading all the reviews I decided to buy this for my 5 years old.He used few times and did not like it.

It's $199 but unlike the other $199 tablets out there like the Kindle or Nook, you also get $200 of apps and games preloaded with it. These apps and games are NOT the free versions either! The company did a great job making sure kids are able to start playing on their nabi right out of the box... immediate gratification, which is important for kids.

If I were to do anything I'd buy the new kindle fire for myself and give my kid my old kindle she'd be happy and I'd get the new fire!
