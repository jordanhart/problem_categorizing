After connecting the USB charger, the insides of the USB plug came out when I removed the charger cord.  Digital 2 was nice enough to replace it with a new tablet.  However, after 1 month it stopped working.  I contacted Digital 2 again and was told to download 3 different programs to my PC in order to reset the tablet.  After hours of downloading time (one of the programs took 3 hrs to download) it didn't work.  I contacted D2 once again and they told me I need to download a zip program in order to open the links they gave me.  Well, it still didn't work.  I am at the point now where I am requesting them to give me return authorization either for repair or replacement.  I do not recommend this tablet.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice for the price I payed couldn't ask for more", "Author": "mercedes decarmine", "ReviewID": "R215VLLW0QKM3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great slow but great the first one came broke so I re order n got it the next day great", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GNJCTW4"}}
