When it came, it had someone else's Google account logged in! I can understand why they returned it.  It's twitchy.  Sometimes when I press on the screen, it does not register, then it will spazz out when I barely graze it.Tablet 2:Without a pre-existing account, I was hopeful this tablet would be better. Boy was I wrong!  Just a couple of days after we received it, when the battery ran low, it never charged again.  All I see is a low battery warning.Needless to say, I am returning them.I am Sooo disappointed.
