Fairly speedy, and has a great display. Also like the fact it uses micro SD card slots. Makes it quick and easy for me to set up all my accompaniment playback tracks when I do live theremin performances with the device mounted on my theremin's stand.The keyboard case is a great accessory. Unlike Bluetooth, it just simply uses a usb adaptor to connect to the device. I like the keys on this keyboard too. For it's size, they're fairly easy to access, and are well marked.This device works well with games like Minecraft, Doom, racing games, ect. Also great for web browsing too. Again, the keyboard case, protects the device, and makes for easy typing when sending emails, and entering web urls, and passwords. Not as difficult has having to use the on-screen keyboards.A great little tablet for the price. :)", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tagital Tablet", "Author": "Don Prell", "ReviewID": "R1P7BVS8QMILZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like it a lot because  it is just the right size for me and was easy to learn how to operate.However, I found the accompanying brochure completely useless--print way too small and infonegligible.

It has 512 MB RAM and also has a GPU. This runs Android 4.2.2 Android. I will go into the specifications and review based on my user experience.  The dimensions are 9.4\"x 5.8\" x 0.51\" and weighs 17.36 oz.Most of tablets have ARM based processors.  This makes sure all of the Apps in Google Play ecosystem available.  If you look at my video review, I have screenshots showing the CPU speed and other kernel details.  The screen is 800 x 480 Pixels. This supports a wireless with Wi-Fi (802.11 BGN). Tablet has 2 cameras - front and back.  This has 8 GB storage and you can use an extensible SD card slot as well as cloud storage.  Though not built in, the tablet supports external 3G/WCDMA dongle.  Battery came for a good 8 hours with moderate usage. Battery usage really depends on how heavy you use the system. Overnight it drained very less. Mobile Networking was on by default. I switched off as I was using only Wi-Fi mode.  I suggest you go to Settings and tweak things which are not required. Developer Mode was enabled by default. I turned it off. The capacitive touch screen was really good, some occasions I had to press little harder and at right locations, but pinch-zoom, highlight, Copy-Paste all worked very well.It is great the tablet has micro USB Port, 3.5-mm stereo Headphone Jack, built-in speaker, microphone, micro SD card slot and a DC Input Jack. Note that for powering through wall adapter you need to use the provided DC input jack. Speaker was loud enough. In a room, once I keep the tablet in a stand it was good. Speaker is on the backside, so you don't want to lie this down on back as it will hamper the audio coming out. This is a design I hope changes in Android manufacturers in future. Android tablets are really customizable to your heart's content. It is here where Tagital shines. Using a native Android 4.2.2, they have achieved something at a low cost. This can have a very wide reaching audience. In many countries, where affordability is key, having a tablet like this with Wi-Fi is a big boon. Imagine having entire Wikipedia at your fingertips for a child. I tried few educational applications on this. I consider this as a big hit with educators than gamers.I tried Google Voice Search and asked \"what is capital of United States\". The voice recognition part was great and it was able to recognize and dictate the answer. I also tried Wolfram Alpha and asked bunch of questions. E.g., what is world population, what is population of China etc? The microphone picked up correctly and answered through Wolfram Alpha.  Apps like Calculator, Gmail performed flawlessly. I watched multiple video through few applications. Obvious first choice was YouTube. Was able to search and watch videos. I used TwIT.TV app and watched some segments of a podcast (video streaming through Wi-Fi). Again smooth playback. Handholding is really easy given the weight of it. It was a colorful blue; no heat observed handholding the tablet. It is plastic, and buttons are made of plastic. For a kid, this is perfect also though the feature set is equally appealing to an adult. I was so enamored with low cost computers in late 90s and it seems I am reliving them with tablet. If you want to listen to podcasts/watch video then this is perfect. Just keep it in a stand and connect to power. See my video review to get an idea of what I am referring to.The keyboard dock makes it very easy to type documents in Google Drive or other note taking apps like Evernote. The USB attached keyboard is rugged and keys are smooth to type. This is an excellent innovation and dual serves as a case + keyboard combo. It also serves as a stand for watching playback videos.For a computer geek, it is a challenge to design something with minimal resources - screen resolution, RAM, storage, chipset. Tagital has designed a tablet with budget conscious customer in mind. Out of the box, it worked to my satisfaction given the specification and price. Once powered on, it directly came to a working condition. No need to setup account prior to using. I signed with Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi router was in one bedroom. I configured in another room separated by two rooms. There was no issue with Wi-Fi signal. Once connected, I created a Google account as well. I generated a Application Specific password as I had 2 factor authentication. Once signed on, I updated applications like YouTube, Google Keyboard etc. I also downloaded few applications like TwitT.TV, Tetris from EA, etc. I downloaded Chrome and browsed few websites. Listened to Audio / Watched Video. Out of the box battery needed a full charge. Initially without charge, I did a video stream and wanted to see how device shutdown. Sure enough it shut down as battery drained. Powered on after charging and everything was fine.I have read from AllWinner's press release that A23 chip clocks in at 1.5GHz and delivers unparalleled low power consumption. Allwinner's newly designed ultra-standby mode enables over 60 days of device standby time and an advanced Talking Standby mode for low power voice talk. The A23's high level of integration also makes it an extremely compelling platform choice for OEMs and ODMs. With features like integrated MIPI DSI, the A23 platform requires a market leading less-than-260 components on board, reducing system cost and design complexity for manufacturers. I am impressed enough at the engineering for the price/value/budget it delivers. Cortex-A8 Processor is an ARM Cortex(tm)-A8 processor, based on the ARMv7 architecture, has the ability to scale in speed from 600MHz to greater than 1GHz. The Cortex-A8 processor can meet the requirements for power-optimized mobile devices needing operation in less than 300mW; and performance-optimized consumer applications requiring 2000 Dhrystone MIPS. This is from ARM specification. Tagital has pulled in many off the shelf components and assembled at a terrific value. I was particularly interested how it performs to streaming video. That is the golden test and it performed beautifully!I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm jealous of my 10yr old", "Author": "Shelley D", "ReviewID": "RH9KLNSGS0JGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a 2nd bday receiving an off brand tablet.

The keyboard worked at first but now does not respond, even though it is plugged in and connected via the USB port as it should be.
