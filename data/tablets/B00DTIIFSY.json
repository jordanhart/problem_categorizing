I have it plugged into my TV watching TV from France while i write this.  I decided to get a tablet and went with WolVol again.  I love it.  I love the USB port.  I can plug in a thumb drive and watch movies.  I love the micro SD card slot.  I can use those old micro SD cards from old phones and load audio books.  I love the mini HDMI port.  i can hook this to my TV.  Yes, the battery only lasts 2 or 3 hours in use, but when not in use it lasts a long time.  I use this at home, where I can plug it in.  I use it as a mini TV and watch foreign TV.  I hook it to speakers and watch training videos from YouTube on the treadmill.  $95.  It is great!", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Christmas gift", "Author": "Jim York", "ReviewID": "R3BX830730GQKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased as a gift because he could only get his email on his office computer.

Every program was failing upon system power on. There was no online troubleshooting, and I would be the last person to pick up a phone for help with gadgets. Thankfully, the play store lasted long enough for me to search for a launcher in the apps section, and once I did that then it was good.I've only had it for a day and I'm still working on how to get all apps to work under the new launcher. Otherwise it works decently. The time zone needs to be manually set. And the battery life is pretty bad, but its to be expected of a cheap tablet that can't even run by itself.On the positive side, once I installed the new launcher everything is good. Kingsoft Office Word is great, file manager is standard android, touchscreen is well calibrated. Camera works, but I haven't tried the back one with the flash yet. Plastic is cheap though, so be careful. Oh, and it took a little while for my eyes to get used to the screen even though I look at screens all dayfor work and school.I give wolvol 3 stars for decent but not perfect or beginner friendly programming. Shipping was perfect though.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Angelina Pereira", "ReviewID": "R96M4A0DPZENL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is compact, and does everything I expected to be able to do with it and more.
