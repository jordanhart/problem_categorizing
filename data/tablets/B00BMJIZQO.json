I use to have a Ematic 10inch pad but its resolution is not good as this one,It's CPU speed is 1.6G which I think is okay but nor that fast as I expected.The shape is neat and handy, which I think should be ranked as Good!Its battery can sustain for 6+ hours which should be fine for not intensive use.In sum, it is a good pad if you want to it as an e-reader, HDMI TV plug in video player , standby android panel and play other android apps.It is not suggest to put too much work load on this pad due to performance and battery concern.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great table for every day!", "Author": "Sergio Coello", "ReviewID": "RLX0AEB26SYE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this or my wife, for a few reasons, to quick access and power up speed, I really like itbecause it's always ready, also the response speed is good,  I've tested this tablet on facebook, chrome, netflix, youtube, pandora, and other utilities apps and it's really good, another good, another feature that I love it's play magazines apps, really love it, has a micro sd card port that allows to increase the storage memory up to 32 GB, brightness control,front and rear camera, that actually takes really good pictures, also has a panoramic feature that we found very handy, mini HDMI port that allows you to connect this tablet to a TV, also I install a cloud drive app, (the one that I use for my pc cloud backup) and allows me to access all my documents on this tablet, we love it!, only one weakness: speaker volume (depending on the website and app) because the speaker it's located on the back of the tablet the sound could be a little bit low, but on headphones sounds great!!! my overall rating 8/10", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much better than previous tablet purchases", "Author": "Steve Cook \"sixtycg\"", "ReviewID": "R2XEJLJJ06GVNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd bought an 8\" tablet from another site recently, which died after a couple of weeks. Rather than deal with a replacement of the same model, I opted for this tablet. I'm glad I did.Tablet WiFi antennas can be problematic, but this one appears to be good quality. It's fast and I've had no issues with video play back. The screen resolution is not quite as sharp as I'd like it, but it's still good.The only real complaint is it doesn't appear to charge through the USB port, so the provided charger is the only way to go.Overall, though, this is a good buy.Also, their customer support is EXCELLENT. Prompt, courteous, and every answer is helpful. I'd recommend purchasing just for this aspect.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ematic Product Review", "Author": "Kim P Goode", "ReviewID": "R24S0ZMBGHRID7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would definitely recommend this tablet.  I love it, and it comes with all the features, I was looking for.  I love the size as it compares to a 7 inch.  The 8 is just right for taking pictures and playing games; 9s and 10s don't handle as easily.  The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is not the unit but the fact that there is no case or sleeve specifically for an 8\" by the company (that I can find).  Universals will do if I find one but I'd like the company to consider one.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32TT3HLZFBXWT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am giving the EGP008BL (BL is just for black) tablet 1 star because the company, Ematic, has truly horrific customer service.  I wanted to love this tablet, but had two significant problems;1) clicking on links in emails did not open a browser, but opened an \"add contact telephone number\" dialog instead2) the \"Auto Rotate Screen on/off\" setting WAS NOT in the Display menu (as per the Users Manual).I found a work around to #2 (if you press the time display in the lower right corner, a quick access dialog opens. Press the Settings icon in that dialog and Auto Rotate options are displayed).But for issue #1, I wasn't able to figure out a fix (tried new updating apps, switching to a different browser app, setting default apps, etc. So I submitted a technical support request (DO NOT the form at ematic.us/support, create an account at [...] so at least you'll have a support ticket number - for all the good it did me).  After 24 hours with no response other than the auto reply with my ticket number, I posted a comment on the Ematic Facebook page asking how long typical support response times are. After 48 hours with no response, I called their customer support number 888-968-1985 and was given the very confusing instruction to \"wait to hear from the Shipping department\" regarding my technical support question. I felt like the person (Tony) was not understanding the problem I was having with the tablet.  I asked Tony if I could speak to someone else, and she stopped talking to me, left the line open (I could still hear back ground noise) but would not respond to me at all so eventually I just hung up.  Today, after 72 hours with no response to a problem that is a MAJOR glitch in a tablet, I'm returning the tablet.  FYI, according to the Better Business Bureau website, in the past 12 months Ematic has had over 80 complaints closed (not filed, just closed) and yet there is no rating at all for Ematic on the BBB website...If you like to gamble, this could be a great sub $100 tablet, but be diligent about testing out all the features & apps you typically use so you can decide whether to keep it or not within the seller's return window (my seller offered 30 days).", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great tablet.", "Author": "Capital One \"tommychick\"", "ReviewID": "R36VO0PYWAPKLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is great. it's fast, reliable, easy to use and cheap. I liked it so much that I bought two 7\" ematic tablets for my 9 and 10 year old grandsons. I got the 8\" EGPOO8RD PRO Series tablet for myself because it's better for viewing movies, has both front and back cameras, a micro SD slot-expandable to 32 GB memory and lots more. Although it can'ttake the place of my laptop, with all the apps available, it can take care of most of the day to day tasks I used to use my laptop for like banking, messaging and web browsing. Do I dare say it does all my expensive Apple iPod does?", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet!", "Author": "Randy Crawford", "ReviewID": "R9G4ZOUII2YYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing some extensive research on a tablet to fit my budget it came down to the Dell Venue 7 and the Ematic Pro EGP008BL.I settled on the Ematic primarily because of the HDMI port. Nearly all the sites I researched including the site I bought the Ematic Pro from stated the tablet did not have Bluetooth and I was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived to discover it does indeed have Bluetooth and it works great as does the Wi-Fi which gets a 90 to 100% signal. Has Ethernet capability also. Battery life is close to 6 hours when surfing the web viewing email and such. The Ematic Pro 8 also doesn't overdo it with preloaded apps and though I haven't tried it yet I believe they can be uninstalled. The tablet is fast with great picture quality and good screen touch response. The only con is the sound which is poor but I would still highly recommend this tablet.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy for my wife to use.", "Author": "Tommy Squitieri", "ReviewID": "R2GT9QVQKEVCLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to use, self explanatory.

I used to have a fairly expensive tablet that was wonderful but my son dropped it on the floor and it broke. I couldn't afford a pricey replacement so I bought this tablet because it was an  8 inch screen and it was around $100. It does everything I would expect but there are some things about it that I just don't like. First of all, the camera isn't very good. It doesn't take pictures well at all.. as in poor picture quality. Also, it doesn't vibrate like my other android tablet did. I also don't like how the screen doesn't flip when you turn the tablet around. Lastly, the battery doesn't last for very long. Fully charged, the battery for me lasts around 4 hrs before I have to recharge it. On good notes, the screen is big, it connects to WiFi fairly easily and it loads apps well. I think it is a good buy for an inexpensive tablet, but if youre looking for great camera quality, vibrating buttons, flip screens and long lasting battery, I would invest in a more expensive tablet. :)", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value .", "Author": "Fred.S", "ReviewID": "R14AWOG53TYVEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet performed as advertised .A good platform for those wanting to transition from PC to tablet.Should have had at least 8GB though.
