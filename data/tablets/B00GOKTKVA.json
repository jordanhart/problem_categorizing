Browsing stalls, orientation is not recognized even after calibrating, the touch on screen is unresponsive, the camera is grainy and worst of all the AC adapter will not charge the device! Battery life was maybe 2 hours tops. The Android marketplace/1Market program pre-installed to get apps is horrible to use and Google Play wouldn't recognize my device. Don't buy this model, it is a waste of money.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "its cool", "Author": "tamara", "ReviewID": "RRR3RECX85M5M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love it since I only play games,listen to music,an facebookon it, its a bit grainy but Hey its not an ipad,I am having trouble setting up the wifi it gives me a different code to use each time I try too, so I haven't used it much...can't find any help on the web for it so I gave three stars but will give 5 when i get a fix...any help is accepted tamhow1@gmail.com thanks.

Hyman", "ReviewID": "R3SEU8V8ZDS88I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got mine as a Christmas present and so far I love it!  I to \"work it\" a bit to get all of the connections right as I had to run the wifi through my computer that didn't have wifi capability so I had to get an adapter and a router, but after I got it set up the rest has been very easy to use.  I can be on it for about 4 hours before I have to charge the battery, which I thought would be longer, but it is my first tablet and I didn't pay $300.00 for it!!!  You get what you pay for!  I paid for a cheaper version and so far I'm very happy!  I've been on Facebook, sent emails and set up some of the aps.  I accidentally deleted one ap store but I think I can easily restore it.  So for what I paid for a tablet and with all the aps it has, I have no complaints!  It was well worth it.  If you are a Grandmom, like me, it is a great way to keep up with the grandchildren!  If you are thinking of getting a tablet for your child, why not get this!  It has parental controls too!  I would definately recommend this to anyone beginning the Android world!", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "AGGRAVATING PRODUCT", "Author": "Liz Wannop", "ReviewID": "R7XA3GBKFC8RG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A very poor product! Internet connection is very poor, needs recharging after 2 hours of use.  The touch screen works intermittently at best.  The charger worked for the initial charge but wouldn't recharge a second time, I contacted the company they recommended I purchase a new charger locally as theirs were on back order.
