The screen size of this 9\" tablet is HUGE.  The 9\" screen enables movies to look great like a widescreen TV.  I constantly get reminded from my Dad about how he enjoys the tablet.  He uses it for surfing the internet, taking pictures, playing games, and even creating word documents.  He loves the ability to be able to print directly to his printer from the device.  Overall, this is a great product at an unbelievable price! Definitely recommended.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice tablet for price", "Author": "Robbert Williams", "ReviewID": "R12KILJT8K77QV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this tablet on not expecting much considering my experience with no name brands tablets is not that good. well its only been a few days and i have fully customized it to like an ipad using differenct apps from the play store. I had a 7\" tablet i got from Fry's a while back and it was unstable that is would frequently force close apps. This one has been rock solid. Its runs ICS and its hasn't crashed once yet. Very impressive. The ony bad thing is the resolution is not that good but i don't mind afterall. And when I show it to my kids they love it. Its plays all the games no problem. Its play temple run and angry birds. allo them. Very happy camper so far. So for an extra $25 but you can get a 9\" tablet that is much more stable than the cheaper 7\" tablets out there.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tablet for the price", "Author": "Thomas Moore", "ReviewID": "R3QD6PSTIHH64V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this tablet cause i wanted something very basic that i can give to my son. He constantly battles for the galaxy tab that we have and I just wanted something that he could use as secondary machine. Im very familiar with the Android on my Galxay tab and thought this woudn't be much different. So after using this for some time, I can safetly say without a doubt this tablet gives 90% of the same experience at the galaxy tab minus some resolution at 800x480. Its sounds bad but actually its works on this 9\" tablet. But more important is that fact that is hasn't force closed once yet. So its very stable and for that alone I give it 5 stars", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Somewhat slow and poor resolution", "Author": "Taylor Eichelberger", "ReviewID": "R2IE748HOCDC01", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would give this a rating of somewhere between a 3 and a 4.

It's not an iPad, but with the price that I paid, it is definitely worth every penny. It is fast, great size screen, touch is excellent on it. The only complaint (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), is that it doesn't stay connected all the time to my WiFi. Sometimes, when powering off, I have to manually connect again, even though I have opted to have the system save my connection. Other than this, I love it!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great tablet at an affordable price....quick web surfing", "Author": "Chandler", "ReviewID": "ROAGHV88VYF7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been playing with this tablet on and off for a few months and have to admit it is very impressive.  It's as fast as my mac or kindle fire or ipad.I find the keyboard easy to work with and it is intuitive to use....to get on the internet just find your network and go.One glitch which is the only one  I have found is that as I type this it has underlined almost all words in red as being misspelled.  I will look on the settings and ensure I have the right language set. What is great though is that I can keep typing without capitalzing and it does that for me automatically, as well as adding apostrophes to abbreviated words.It turns off power automatically if you stop using it but saves what you are working on.Easy to stash in your purse, use for travel or use for reading. Also an affordable option for kids to use for homework research.It works fantastic and I appreciate getting to try it out in order to provide this feedback", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "Ibrahim \"Ibrahim\"", "ReviewID": "R192CQZ76KKFHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased three iBelite for my kids and another one for my niece.
