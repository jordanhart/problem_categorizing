{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is one of the best tablets made, but 3D gaming performance isn't stellar", "Author": "M. McMillan", "ReviewID": "RXT4108ZKOYJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "About me: I am a techy 30-something that loves Android, though I own an iPad4 and keep an open mind to all things, including operating systems. My reviews are usually long-winded and sometimes opinionated. I have experience with the new Samsung Note 10.1 (2014), the ASUS TF701 & TF700 tablets, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Nexus, iPad4, Nook Color, Droid RAZR, and a bunch of other random devices that I've rooted for my friends and co-workers. My wife got the new Note 10.1 to replace her old Note 10.1, so \"we\" decided I can get a new tablet, too, since my iPad4 was part of a hostile-takeover by my 6 year old daughter. I basically could not stand iOS, even with jailbreak and $50 worth of Cydia apps to tweak the OS. Android is the OS for me, or even Windows 8.1. iOS is just too locked down, dumbed down, lowest-common-denominator, made for kids and the elderly (no offense).Now that you know where I'm coming from......There are quite a few good tablets to choose from. What makes a high-end tablet worth purchasing? To me, it's the features that make one tablet stand out from the crowd while also being fast for its era. The weight you give each of those various features depends on you and what's important to you. I'll talk about some things that are important to me:1) The screen is extremely important. You look at it and touch it the whole time you interact with the tablet. This screen is really good, especially for fans of IPS LCDs. Fans of Samsung AMOLED or SuperLCD screens might find the blacks a bit bright, but the contrast levels are still good. The fact that it's IGZO makes it extra sweet (IGZO is supposed to use a lot less battery). The screen appears to be pretty bright, though not anywhere near the 755 nits like I read about (at gsmarena.com I think). There appears to be no one that knows if the glass is Gorilla Glass 2, 3, or Corning-brand at all. No oleophobic coating, meh who cares? My skin is usually so dry that I don't leave fingerprints and smudges on my screen like my wife's constantly-lotioned and extremely soft hands do on her devices. Sharpness: 2560x1600 = 4mp. iPad's 2048x1536 = 3mp. New Surface 2's 1080p = 2mp. Basically 33% sharper than iPad3/4/Air and twice as sharp as 10\" 1080p tablets. Same resolution as the Note 10.1 & Nexus 10 with the differences including IGZO technology for the Asus but better color saturation & accuracy and black-levels from the Samsung SuperLCD. And we all know the iPad's screen is still pretty good.2) Possibly more important is the operating system. For anyone that wants to tweak things or not be overly and unjustly limited by a higher power (Apple), Android is a good choice. Sure, there are limitations in Android and you have to get root access to do things, but at least you can if you want to. And at least the Play Store doesn't censor stuff too much. I like having a choice of launchers that can change the entire look and feel of the device. I like the great keyboard selection and widgets and live wallpaper and a hundred other things about Android. There are advantages and disadvantages to each operating system. Hopefully you can be happy with the one you choose. Or just choose them all if you can afford it, haha.3) Another item of importance to me is the app selection. The biggest gripe I hear about Android tablets vs iPad is the superior app selection offered by Apple's app store. They say there aren't many apps designed for tablets in Android-land. I think most people that say these things haven't experienced both tablets, though they are still correct for the most part. But they fail to mention how with the iPad, you NEED the app to be made for iPad because the iPhone versions look like absolute garbage on iPad. Most apps on Android are just as good or close enough to the iOS counterpart, but the apps selection for iPads is still superior overall. Some iPhone apps that don't have iPad versions will look better on Android tablets if there is an Android version of that app. There are lots of devs that really fail at making Android apps, so you end up with forced-orientation (usually portrait) with text or buttons that are too small (ESPN I'm looking at you). It's pretty much a toss-up for me - I like both app selections. Sorry Windows RT, but I'm pretty sure your app selection bites. I am curious about Windows8.1 & BayTrail though.4) Also important to me are accessories and compatibility/flexibility. The killer accessory for the Transformers is, of course, the keyboard dock. Most other tablets can't really compare (see Dell Venue Pro 11 and Asus T100). Sure, there are decent cases with built-in bluetooth keyboards of varying quality, but even the $100 ones don't compare to the ASUS keyboard, and that's not even taking into consideration the extra battery, SD slot, USB 3.0 port, touchpad, and sturdiness of the ASUS keyboard, although this new dock is plastic so it's not as good as previous Asus docks.The popularity of the iPad results in tons of accessories for it. However, they aren't really accessories I want as much as the ASUS keyboard. For general compatibility, the TF701 is great, especially with the dock. Full size SD card from your digital camera? Pop it in the dock. USB keyboard? Plug it in! USB 3.0 external hard drive? Plug it in already! Wanna play some emulator games with a PS3 gamepad? No problem with the $3 SixAxis app. Good luck doing these things on an iPad. With Jailbreak and BluTrol, you CAN use a PS3 gamepad, but it was a little buggy like a lot of Cydia apps were for me.5) Price is important, right? The 32GB TF701 is 25% cheaper than 32GB iPad Air & Note 10.1. That's a pretty big difference. That $150 difference is enough to pay for the $140 dock and a 6-pack of your favorite beer (or 12-pack if you like that domestic stuff).Tweakability is another area of importance for me. This tablet is probably the most tweakable, geek-friendly of them all. It can dual-boot with Ubuntu for crying out loud. I can spend $700 and get a 224GB (32GB internal + 64GB microSD + 128GB SD) tablet-ultrabook hybrid. Or I could get a 64GB iPad with 1/3rd the memory, no dock with keyboard, usb port, sd slot, etc. For those of us that like to have lots of data locally, it's hard to beat this combo. Though for $700, you could get an ultrabook with 256GB SSD or 1TB SATA, but that's a totally different category of machine.Basically, it came down to the (vaporware?) Nexus 10 (2013), Note 10.1 (2014), and this TF701 if you settle on Android as the OS. OK let's not forget about the Sony tablet too, with its dust-proof water-proof spin on things. But the Sony is half the resolution and much less powerful. The N10-2 isn't even official yet, so I can't really consider it yet. Some people think it will not be created. Other people think Google is going to put out an 8\" Nexus instead of the 10\" since the first N10 didn't sell very well. So you have to be patient and wait for Nexus news. The Note 10.1 excels in the areas that the TF701 fails in, like 3D performance, trendy design, weight, size, speakers, popularity...but the price is a bit steep. Then there's the iPad Air - it's a nice piece of hardware, that's for sure, but the OS just ruins it for me. The Kindle HDX 8.9\" is enticing because I'd love to hold it in one hand in portrait mode, and the HDX has some killer hardware (2560x1600, S800 SoC, nice stereo speakers, etc), but again the OS ruins it and it doesn't appear to be very rootable or ROM-able and no expandable storage. Windows 8 tablets with the BayTrail chip could be pretty cool. I wouldn't mind playing Half-Life 2 and whatnot on a tablet. However, there doesn't appear to be a BayTrail tablet with a 2560x1600 screen, along with other specs they lack. I could handle 1080p on a 10\" screen probably if I decide to try a BayTrail machine.In my mind, the TF701 is a decent choice. Sure, it's not perfect, but none of them are. It all depends on your wants and needs. My need for faster 3D performance caused me to return the TF701 in favor of the Note. But for people that don't care about games or 3D content and find the Note features to be gimmicks, the TF701 might fit the bill.-----------------------------------Summary of PRO's and CON's:-----------------------------------PROS:----------------Specs - Not class-leading in all areas, but overall a great spec list that translates into great performance (sans 3D content) and flexibilityTEGRA4 - It is on par with the other fast SoC's right now except in 3D performance, especially @ WQXGA. The lack of Open GL ES 3.0 compliance is a little pathetic, too, considering the SnapDragon600 is compliant.Screen - 2560x1600 (WQXGA) is glorious. Hopefully the IGZO technology will provide some good power-savings, but I didn't see any good battery life results in my use of this tablet (from 100% charge to 40% with less than 3 hours of screen-on time on the first full charge, and the screen accounted for 70% of the battery usage). IPS usually translates to very accurate colors, I thought, but the reds especially annoyed me because they were pale and a little orange when using the VIVID setting, and obviously more pale prior to setting it to vivid. Meanwhile the Note's screen seems spot-on for colors (I am used to a very accurate pair of Dell IPS monitors) and is more saturated with better black levels, so be aware that IGZO + IPS might not equal success or good brightness levels or extreme battery savings or perfect colors or dark blacks.Keyboard dock - This accessory is a selling point for many Transformer customers because it is just a great piece of hardware. Too bad they skimped on it again this year, like last year when they made the battery smaller, causing TF700 users to purchase the TF201 dock since it was compatible with a bigger battery.Bezel - Still big enough to grip on all 4 sides and no buttons on the face. The Note bezel on the other hand is a lot smaller and has 3 buttons on it, making for awkward positioning of your hands/fingers. I like the bigger TF701 bezel and tapered edges.Price - 25% cheaper than iPad Air & Note 10.1 @ 32GB, $50 cheaper than the year-old Nexus 10, only $5 more than the Kindle HDX 8.9\".Built-in launcher - It doesn't have a billion gimmicky features like TouchWiz. It doesn't change much, really. I haven't ever used a manufacturer's launcher and actually been satisfied with it, but this one might be okay. I probably will want to change the grid size of the desktop & app drawer, though, so I will probably use Nova. However, those people that never change anything on their devices will get a close-to-Android experience, unlike Samsung TouchWiz & HTC Sense & Motorola Blur (speaking of Motorola, where is their 10\" tablet at? Why didn't I even research a single Moto tablet?).CONS:---------------3D Performance - There are many games that perform well and look awesome, but there are also many that hit low FPS levels, like IronMan3 & FIFA14Size - I don't mind the size, but recent trends will show that the TF701 is dated in its design and retains the design of 2 generations (of Transformers) ago.Weight - Again, it's not bad. Much easier to handle than the iPad4. However, it's still over 100g heavier than the iPad Air, and 200g heavier than the Kindle HDX 8.9\" (unfair comparison perhaps), so it feels like they could have cut some weight somewhere. I am glad they didn't cut down the battery to try and save weight and thickness, though, so this is personal preference I guess.Speaker - I haven't really tested it out too extensively yet, but it's rear-facing and lonely. It sounds overly bright to me, but not too shrill-like, just lots of high treble and not much bass. I would say not as pleasant as the single iPad4 speaker. What happened to the TF100 front-facing stereo speakers? I want those back, or rather the side-edge mounted stereo speakers like the new Note 10.1 has.Proprietary port / no microUSB: Cuts down on the convenience factor a little. Even Samsung ditched their proprietary port on the Note 10.1 and uses microUSB. I realize the TF701 needs the docking port for the docking station. However, they could have included a microUSB port somewhere so I could charge it in the dozen places I have microUSB chargers already set up.Camera - I probably wouldn't use it even if it was good, but ya...it's pretty bad. My Galaxy Nexus took better pics and it's 2 years old. This may need further investigation to prove my initial evaluation, but man these indoor pics I took are grainy and smudgey. The turbo mode is pretty quick and allows 100 pics. I'll definitely take out my Galaxy S4 for those moments where I want to take a pic or movie and don't have a true camera with me.Boot-loader policy - ASUS provides you with the tool to unlock your bootloader. However, when you do this, it voids your warranty. Even if you get your bootloader back to locked (not sure if you can, maybe with the use of blob files?), your warranty is still void. This actually came in to play with my TF700 after I sold it on eBay. The new owner had the touchscreen go out, so they sent it to ASUS for repair. They got a bill for $280 because I had unlocked the bootloader the day I bought the tablet. I felt bad for the new owner, but that was a risk they were taking when they got a pre-rooted & rommed device. I don't agree with the policy because there is no proof that custom ROMs can damage the device. You could overclock it to a degree where it could harm the hardware, I suppose, but I still doubt that it would cause permanent damage. Either way, I bet 98% of the repairs that aren't covered due to voided warranties were repairs that would have been needed regardless of the bootloader being locked or unlocked.No Android 4.3 yet - Still at version 4.2.2, which is okay, but it would have been nice to see it launch with 4.3. I hope I don't end up unlocking the bootloader to get a custom 4.3 ROM, then have my screen die and need a $300 repair.------------------------UPDATE FROM DAY 2:Sorry to add to my already absurdly long review, but I felt the need to. I also reduced it, cut some of the fat.Now that some of the \"new toy nirvana\" has worn off, I am seeing a little more clearly now. What I've discovered is unnerving for me. Basically, 3D performance is just a tad too slow for a lot of games to be playable. I am on the latest official firmware (build 47). For me, I need to get 30 fps in most games, more for some types of games like driving sims. So I did a comparison of various 3D games, checking framerates on my Galaxy S4 versus the TF701. The screen on the TF701 has twice the pixels of the GS4, so that difference is playing a big role here. However, the GS4 is faster in every single game I tried. Out of the 7 games I tried today, 5 of them were below 30 fps: Asphalt 8 gets maybe 25 fps but is shaky like it needs a gyro deadzone setting, Dead On Arrival 2 (Tegra-optimized) gets a paltry 15 to 20 fps with graphic settings on LOW, FIFA14 is like 20 - 25 fps, IronMan3 was awful, like 10 fps during gameplay, and finally Minion Rush was maybe 20 fps. I haven't rooted my TF701 so I can't install the lone on-screen FPS display app (FPS Meter), but my estimations are pretty accurate (from years of being an FPS-fiend and watching my framerate in most games ever since Duke Nukem 3D in 1995). My Galaxy S4 is about 20% - 40% faster in each of these games, and every other game I tried. I also tried DoA2 on my wife's Note 10.1 and it ran at max settings pretty smoothly, definitely over 30 fps, almost twice the fps of the TF701. I'm sad because I bought this thing for gaming but I can't get over 30 fps in apparently a lot of games. I don't think this is something that software can solve. Sure, the graphics drivers might be optimized or apps might adjust their settings to account for the Tegra4 @ 2560x1600, but for now it's not looking good and might make me return this thing for a refund, which really breaks my geeky heart.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good tablet", "Author": "Gadgetgeek", "ReviewID": "R231DEJ78TPJXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this having had a tf201t, the gps was useless, the wifi weak and eventually after two years the rear camera stopped working (pressure on the rear cover temporarily fixes it so I think its a dry joint).  Despite this I liked my prime, fast,flexible and works great with dock. Got the TF701T today - 5 Nov 13 and first impressions are:1/ very good improved screen,2/very fast ,3/nicer keyboard app,4/ the gps is superb accurate and fast,5/wifi seems so much faster and signal much improved.BUT1/ The tablet doesn't fit my old dock which is a pain and shame on Asus,2/ The rear camera doesn't have the led flash the prime had.3/ some of the widgets are much bigger on the tf701 than the tf201 but maybe I just need a setting change4/ different power adapter to tablet plug ( see 1/ above)5/ No screen cloth this time which seems a bit cheapSo thats first impressions, it would have been 5 stars but for the dock and flash. I'll update this review after some more use.Update 8/11Had the tablet a few days now, new comments :1/ Still seems fast no lag apparent at all.2/ GPS lock on - less than ten seconds3/ Tablet gets little warm top left corner at rear when used for long time.4/ My prime screen could get a little strange when using it while charging, the touch screen wasn't accurate and jumped about a bit but this only happened occasionally. Been using the infinity plugged in no problems apparent at all.5/ Battery life appears better than my prime on tablet alone but my prime battery was 2+ yrs old and maybe not as good as new.6/ Miss my keyboard dock, screen keyboard is good but I like a physical keyboard. Will order a dock soon!.7/ Can't seem to find a car charger....another Asus consequence of changing the connector probably.8/ Keyboard needs movement keys \u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192 on stock screen keyboard.9/ Like the top info bar not sure if this is android or Asus setup and the new button bottom left which shows last apps opened.Update 29/11/13 just bought the dockI had the tf201 dock and the build quality was better. The rear cover now feels plasticky but the dock seems lighter but more importantly the dock docked with the pad much better, they both have a certain amount of movement at the hinge BUT it is considerably more on the tf701 dock. Asus eliminated the front lip/overlap at the junction of the pad and dock and this makes it very loose. Good one Asus you changed the design and made it worse not better !!!!. To be fair I haven't had any connection problems but it doesn't auger well for the future. The keyboard itself is good with imho a nice positive feel to the keys. Battery performance seems to be not as good as the tf201 dock but time will tell....the dock is a great addition to the pad BUT Asus you really need to fire your design management / test team they let the tf201 out with bad WiFi and GPS performance and then ruined a perfectly good design by 'updating' the tf701 dockOverall I'd still rather have this than an IPad but Asus need to get a grip of their product testing and stop making silly mistakes it might also be good if they actually followed the sentiment in their logo.......", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet... when it works", "Author": "GS4", "ReviewID": "R1Q514M9L65ERB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In concept this tablet seemed perfect but Asus just couldn't deliver on this one. I got the tablet, dock, and SD cards to fill out the two ports which I immediately filled with movies to try out the tablet. Everything was going great and the screen was amazingly sharp but when I moved the tablet and dock from my lap to the coffee table the movie stopped playing. I didn't think too much of it thinking maybe i hadn't connected the tablet to the dock very well so I made sure it was nice and secure. I started the movie back up and picked up the tablet and... freeze, the movie stops again. I noticed it was remounting the SD card from the dock every time it froze and tried moving the screen back and forth and sure enough, every time i moved the screen it disconnected. I did some researching online and saw people were having this problem so I figured i had a received a faulty one and sent the tablet and dock back for replacement. Amazon came through with amazing speed on the replacement and i had a new tablet in just 2 days of filing for return. I took out the new tablet and went through the setup and installed my apps onto it and within the first hour i got a random reset. Again I didn't think too much of it but it happened at least 5 more times that day with regular use. It seemed weird to me since the first one i had sent back never reset once and the final straw was when I noticed it resetting when i wasnt even using it... it was just sitting on the table. I am sending this one back and going back to researching a new tablet to buy which is disappointing since i thought i found the perfect tablet for me.Now for the Pro's and Con'sPro'sAmazing screenvery fluid with minimal lagExpandable memory with SD and Micro SD (I had 32GB on the tablet and 2 64GB cards going)Nice long battery life (especially with dock)HDMI mini output (for $6 you can buy an HDMI to micro HDMI and mirror directly to your tv for Netflix ect)almost no bloatwareCon'sOnly one speaker and its averagebuild quality is iffy (the screen has a gap between it and the body by the volume rocker.

Unlike the Transformer Pad Infinity, the plastic actually looks like it's a conscious design decision, rather than a hastily cobbled-together fix for the Transformer Prime's issues.\u00a0Round the front, its 10.1 display is surrounded by a rather chunky bezel \u2013 especially when compared to the iPad Air's slender effort \u2013 and that makes the Transformer Pad look a little dated.Once again, Asus has shuffled the arrangement of the physical controls. The volume controls now sit on the back top-left and it's a more natural-feeling position for them.\u00a0The array of micro-HDMI, microSD and 3.5mm headphone ports sit on the left hand side of the tablet - in the same location as on the Infinity, though the microphone has moved to the top left of the tablet. That's probably a good thing too as you're less likely to cover it up with your palm and muffle your words.\u00a0Irritatingly, Asus has changed the proprietary charging port on the Transformer Pad \u2013 meaning you won\u2019t be able to use the same cable if you\u2019re an existing Transformer Infinity owner.\u00a0The Transformer Pad sports a whopping 10.1in, 2560 x 1600 display, yielding up 299 ppi \u2013 that\u2019s a higher pixel count and on a bigger screen size than the new iPad Air's 2048 x 1536 Retina display. Clever stuff.\u00a0It\u2019s impressive given that it packs the same amount of pixels as a high-end 30in montitor into a far smaller space \u2013 and next to the Transformer Pad Infinity, the Pad\u2019s display veritably massages your peepers with scented oils.Text appears much sharper, while colour reproduction is close to that of the Infinity. As with the Prime and the Infinity, the display also has a super-bright mode for outdoor use, which is very handy for rendering text readable in direct sunlight.What you choose to view on the Transformer Pad's super hi-res screen is up to you. Low-res, non-optimised apps won't exactly benefit but Full HD movies and hi-res images will look beautiful as will e-books, though be warned the 16:9 screen is a bit awkward in portrait.\u00a0The Transformer Pad has received a substantial, not to mention very welcome spec boost over its predecessors.\u00a0It crams in a quad-core Tegra 4 processor along with 2GB RAM, and although that's less than the 3GB found in the Galaxy Note 10.1, Nvidia's silicon keeps Android whizzing along with ease.This performance boost is a huge relief. The Transformer Prime and Infinity\u2019s Tegra 3 processor always stumbled when dealing with processor-intensive tasks or even relatively simple ones like opening web pages.\u00a0The Transformer Pad, by contrast, is a breeze to use, zipping through web pages, graphically-intensive games like Real Racing 3 and word processor apps without a hitch. This is the way it was meant to be and we\u2019re glad that the Transformer series finally has the power it deserves.\u00a0Previous generations of Asus Transformer tablets felt like beta versions of a brilliant concept \u2013 the Prime\u2019s connectivity issues and the Infinity\u2019s slightly underpowered Tegra 3 processor left them struggling to realise the potential of the tabbook form factor.\u00a0With the Tab\u2019s ferociously powerful Tegra 4 chipset, it finally seems like that potential has been realised \u2013 this is a device that you can work, play and browse content on without feeling like it\u2019s going to hang at any moment.\u00a0In terms of raw specs, the Tab is bested by Samsung\u2019s 2014 Galaxy Tab 10.1, but of course, Asus has a very specific customer in mind: people who want to use a tablet with the option of an integrated physical keyboard dock.\u00a0Apple\u2019s Tim Cook may rail against competitors \u201ctrying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs,\u201d but it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a place in the tablet ecosystem for devices with physical keyboards. If you want a device for work as well as media consumption, the Transformer Pad can\u2019t be beat; with USB 3.0, an array of productivity apps, full Word compatibility, a physical keyboard and a proper file and folder system, it\u2019s a genuine laptop replacement.

If you're open minded about the two, then read his review! If you're a close-minded Android user like me or a close-minded Apple user then your mind is already made up so it doesn't matter.Now then, on to the tablet itself. This is a great, powerful, well featured tablet.Some Pros:The display is beautiful. Bright, clean, crisp, with good contrast. The 2560 x 1600 resolution is just outright ludicrus, in a good way.The quad 1.9 Ghz processor makes this a very responsive tablet, previously I was used to a dual 1.2Ghz Android smartphone and the speed difference is like night and day and the 2GB of memory is likely more than you'll ever need.Front and back cameras, external micro SD slot, and a micro HDMI connection add to the versatility of this device.Battery life is better than I expected for a device this powerful (I'm not saying it's great). In my admittedly limited experience it can handle a whole day of frequent but casual usage (web browsing, eReading, music, simple games) without needing to be plugged in.Some Cons:It does come with a bit of ASUS bloatware and some other preinstalled applications. Some people may not care but I personally hate this. I'd rather take the time to install what I want than have a bunch of stuff I don't. The upside is, most of it can be disabled so it's at least out of your way. And it's not near as bad as some other devices I've seen.The data/charging connector is proprietary. <Supposition>I don't think that it's compatible with previous ASUS cables. I'm basing this off of the fact that people say previous ASUS keyboards don't work, so I may be incorrect.</Supposition>Anyway, it's a great tablet and you won't be disappointed if you get it.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for the price", "Author": "Thomas F. Hayden", "ReviewID": "R2069R60GUMMYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was searching for a replacement for my aging ASUS TF700T. All my devices are Android so it came down to 3: Sony Xpedia Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) and the ASUS TF701T. I eliminated the Sony due to the high number of complaints about its WIFI performance. The Samsung appears to be a fantastic tablet but one of my TVs is an older HD which does not support Miracast and the Samsung has no HDMI out. The TF701T was simply the last man standing.Pros:\u2022 The quality and build was rock solid.\u2022 The screen is simply gorgeous. Definitely better than the iPad4. I haven\u2019t compared it to the iPad Air.\u2022 Touch screen is fast, accurate and responsive.\u2022 It does ship with just Android 4.2.2 but the OTA update to 4.3 when smoothly. I have KitKat (4.4) on my Nexus 7 (2013) and there isn\u2019t much difference.\u2022 Battery life is very good (much better than my TF700) even with screen brightness turned way up.\u2022 Charging time is pretty quick.\u2022 WIFI performance is very good especially with 5 GHZ.  My old 700 had only 2.4 GHZ and its range was somewhat limited. This is as good as or better than the Nexus 7.\u2022 Netflix streams at HD with no stuttering or skips.\u2022 AnTuTu benchmark right out of the box was quite good \u2013 over 33000. Results: \u201cCPU: Good, Supports large apps and multitasking. RAM: excellent, 2D graphics: Good, 3D Graphics: Excellent, Fluently support large mobile games.\u201d\u2022 Micro SD storage. A great way to supplement the tablet\u2019s internal storage. $22 for a Class 10 32GB card is dirt cheap. I also found that the fastest way to load video is to simply \u201cUnmount\u201d the card, place it into a card reader attached to my PC and then copy. Much quicker and pretty painless.Cons:\u2022 Proprietary charging cable. It doesn\u2019t use a Micro-USB to USB cable and the included charging cable seems to be unique to the TF701. If you want to be able to charge in more than one place you\u2019ll have to buy additional cables. On the positive side the proprietary cable may be why it charges so quickly.\u2022 The single speaker is poorly place in the back so the sound is not too good. However, I use headphones when listening to media so it isn\u2019t an issue. Stereo, front speakers would be a great enhancement \u2013 like the Galaxy Note 10.1.\u2022 ASUS pre-loaded software, which due to the nature of the Android OS, eats up a lot of RAM. The Clean Master app sometimes reported over 70% of RAM used. In Settings I disabled the apps that I don\u2019t use and that reduced RAM usage dramatically.Other:\u2022 Bezel. It is larger than some competitors but I found the size comfortable for my thumbs. I always use a case so I think it is much ado about nothing.\u2022 Weight. It\u2019s about 100g (3.8 oz.) more than the iPad Air or about 22% heavier. Keep in mind that the TF701 is a 16x9 tablet where the iPad Air is a 4x3. In other words the iPad Air is about 63 sq. inches and the TF701 is about 74 sq. inches.\u2022 Camera. I don\u2019t use the cameras on my tablets. Independent reviews do say that the TF701T\u2019s cameras aren\u2019t too good.\u2022 Dock. I am holding off on this right now. The complaints about the dock are continuing and it seems hit or miss on the quality. I don\u2019t feel like gambling $125. I have the dock for my TF700 and it has never had a problem. If I feel the need for a dock I\u2019ll take the 700 out of mothballs at least until the 701 dock\u2019s build quality is fixed.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great experience on an almost flawless tablet...", "Author": "Brian Davis", "ReviewID": "R2SQPGPNP9HBMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Asus TF701 tablet after doing a ton of research online. To be honest, the Asus has not fared well in reviews and I almost did not buy it myself. I have learned to take reviews with a grain of salt and discard the highest and lowest scores as not really honest or maybe they have a agenda. Also, I am not a techie or a computer wiz and I wouldn't know the first thing about rooting a device.This is my third android tablet. I bought an Acer Iconia tab over a year ago and it was time to move on. I purchased a Kindle Fire HD but returned it as I could not get past the lack of support for Google Play and that it had no expandable storage capability. I also have had a 2nd generation iPad which I gave to my mom for the same reasons as the Kindle Fire HD.I love the openness of the Android experience and that is why I have stuck with Android devices.When I received the Asus, I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging and how simple the setup was (after charging the device for eight hours per the instructions). One cool side effect of keeping up to date with Google Play was that after I put in my default Gmail account, my device set itself up. It even remembered all the different wi-fi locations and passwords from the old tablet and my phone. After that, I simply set-up my business emails that are not web based and I was in business.The pros:-Incredible picture quality! Better than my partner's iPad Air.-Expandable storage. Doubled the storage by inserting a 32gb micro SDHC card.-Crisp and fast performance. Compared to my old Iconia this thing is blazing fast!-The built in Asus overlay is helpful and easy to understand. It is a nice addition to the stock Android experience and not bloaty.-The build quality feels rugged and durable, not cheap and plastic-y (if that is a word).-Very capable wi-fi reception. My Iconia did not do well in that department. The Tf701 has good reception and it doesn't drop the network like I have read about in other tablets.-The docking keyboard! I broke down and traded in my Acer Iconia and used the gift card to buy the keyboard dock. OMG! I love the flexibility and speed it adds to my tablet experience. For the price of a Samsung Note 10.1 I got the tablet AND the keyboard!Cons:-Cameras. No flash and not stellar picture quality. Let's face it, do we really use our tablet to take pictures or video? Phones are so much easier to handle for a picture or two.-Sometimes, (not very often) when I am in Dolphin Browser, I have to touch the screen twice to get a response on a 'button' push. Not sure if this is the tablet, the browser or the two not playing well together.-Having to charge the battery 8 hours before using the first time. Really? So many other items and devices come fully charged now.-Sound quality. The Iconia had great speakers, I miss them. This one sounds fine but I do miss those Acer speakers. But, I rarely use any tablet without headphones. so that isn't important to me.-Proprietary charger. Hate the fact I can't connect it to my phone's mini usb to charge.-Hard to find cases made specifically for the TF701. I did purchase a great Caseen leather folio case made for it but it took some research.Is this table perfect? No. Is any tablet perfect? no. In fact I went through a lot of buyer's anxiety after I bought it. Did I make the right decision? Should I have spent more and gotten the Sony or Samsung? Should I have spent less and gotten who knows what? After almost a month of use, I know I bought the right tablet. Because I have been using it. Something I rarely did with the Acer Iconia. I used it as a reader. I have used the Asus TF701 for so much more... movies, web browsing, and even order entry for work when I am away from the office.

I already owned the TF700T + dock and loved the form factor. The TF700T was slow as molasses though (leading hypothesis I've seen is that Asus cheapened out on the RAM and only included 1GB). So when the TF701T was announced I was excited because it would be just like my existing tablet, but faster!The TF701T is definitely faster than it's predecessor but also feels like a downgrade in a couple of different ways:1. It's actually fatter than the TF700T! Everything in consumer electronics is supposed to get faster, cheaper, slimmer with time. This tablet got heavier and thicker.2. They took away vibrate. No more vibration for notifications or feedback in games.3. The camera went from 8MP to 5MP and it is noticeably inferior. I have both the TF700T and the TF701T and took side by side photos.Most importantly of all this tablet has been an absolute nightmare to own with it's accompanying dock (which I'm rating 1 star). I've had it RMA'd by Asus twice (!) and still the same issues persist. So even though I suspect it's a hardware issue with the dock it makes for a terrible user experience on the tablet. I get constant notifications for a MobileDock firmware update and it tries to install every time I reboot the tablet. It takes a few minutes before the update attempt fails out which makes booting the tablet slow. I guess I could avoid the issue by not using the dock but that defeats the purpose of why I bought it. If i just wanted a tablet I would have bought a Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 instead.Word of advice about dealing with Asus support: don't bother with email, just call them up. My first RMA took over a week to set up just because of 1-2 day lags between emails where they'd ask one question at a time. Second RMA was easier with a <10 minute phone call. I just called them up for the third time and they're going to \"investigate\" my situation. I wish all this happened in the first 30 days, I would have returned the thing where I bought it. Now the best I can hope for is a replacement unit.Asus is usually known for having some of the highest quality hardware. They make the Nexus 7 which I also own and bought for a couple family members and we all love it. But something about these Transformer Pads....

The lagginess and input delay made it unpleasant to use. So I bought this tablet to replace it, since it has better hardware specs. And much like the TF700, at first I really liked the TF701. It's fast, fun to use, and the screen is great. It's also heavy, uncomfortable to hold, and it's awkwardly built with ugly seams around the screen. But I thought those were a small price to pay.Then I went on vacation and took the tablet with me as my main internet source. A few days in the tablet stopped charging, leaving it slowly turning into a $400 brick. I thought I'd been hit by the infamous problem with the loose hinge between tablet and keyboard dock breaking the connector. Just in case I looked for a replacement cable. Turns out the only store anywhere that seems to sell such a cable is amazon, and it cost $30. A week later when I got home I was greeted by that cable, plugged it in and the tablet started charging. How nice, the tablet is fine, it's just the cable!Then I sent the tablet, keyboard dock, and replacement cable back to amazon. Why? Because $600 of electronics (with the dock), is dependent on a cheap, proprietary, overpriced, almost impossible to replace cable that broke in under 3 weeks of nightly charging. And this isn't the first time, the TF700 I had did the same thing one trip leaving me with no tablet. And btw, the TF700 and TF701 use different cables.So to ASUS, put a Micro USB charging port on the next tablet and get the weight down to competitive levels, you'd have a great tablet. To anyone else, it's a nice tablet but you're gambling on that cable.

The hardware decoder plays back every MP4 I throw at it without any hiccups.  This tablet properly supports exFAT on SD Cards which makes large video files manageable.  This tablet is also surprisingly light and thin.  It is much easier to hold up than my Xoom was and my arms don't get tired holding it up in front of me where my Xoom had to stay on my lap a lot of the time.There are only a few minor downsides to this tablet.  One is that there is only one speaker in the back on the right side, so audio isn't all that great.  You turn up the volume a bit and cup your hand behind it and it's passable, but I'd recommend headphones.  The headphone jack is on the left side towards the bottom which is problematic if you're playing games.  I flip the whole thing upside down so the jack is on the top right instead for games that let me do that.  One other small issue is that the power button and volume rocker are on the back of the tablet in the top left corner.  It's easy to get confused as to which is which when fumbling around blind with your fingers, but it's not hard to get used to.  It can get a little warm towards the top left corner when you're playing games, but it's not uncomfortably hot.The cameras and battery life are mediocre.

Asus not only makes their own tablets but Google and Windows tablets as well...of the millions of devices they make, you got a bad one...even Apple sends out a few lemons here and there.  As advertised, the screen is beautiful and I love the 32GB memory.  For an extra $10, I easily expanded the memory to 64GB...now, for you naysayers...find a good quality tablet with 64GB of storage for $400.  Speed is great, the op system is stable and because Android is making leaps and bounds to compete with iOS, most bugs (if any) are usually fixed at the next update.  The micro HDMI port is great for watching on your big screen but with compatible devices, you can use Miracast and share your experience wirelessly!  I love the weight...people always complain about 1 or 2 grams heavier as being a con...are you kidding me!?  This tablet is nice and thin but a little heft makes it feel like good quality and built strong.  Anyone who felt fatigue over a few grams difference in weight is someone who doesn't get out enough...seriously people, a couple of grams!?  Asus has also proven its reliability over the years in their quality...this is NOT a $99 grocery store tablet, so don't expect it.  For $400, you just cant go wrong.  However, my cons are 1. No auto-sleep mode with the closing of the cover 2. Don't like the 30 pin connector instead of the microUSB (although this is minor in terms of transferring data), and because Asus is NOT an Apple product, finding accessories is pretty much limited to online.

After resetting the tablet back to factory spec and removing the previously downloaded games along with disabling some of Googles bloatware, I have since reloaded games my wife enjoys and some just to test run on the tablet. Granted these are not huge files but for example Sonic Dash has beautiful graphics and definitely uses a lot of power while playing. Any way our small list of games include Candy Crush, Tetris, Jewel Mania along with the aforementioned Sonic Dash. The good news is we love how the tablet looks and performs under these conditions. No problems with the screen not responding YET, and no other issues to right about now for the last 6 days. Our browsing experience is totally dependent on how many computers or devices are using the WiFi signal so for the most part pages loaded pretty good although there have been a few times I felt pages lagged more then I would expect, but again this may be due to mother-in-law using up bandwidth for internet tv? I really like the screens ability to respond to touch very accurately. I have fairly large fingers and I rarely miss the letter I intended to hit. The bad news is I think the battery runs down to easily. After playing an hour of Sonic this morning to test run how it would act I began with 96% battery and ended with 52% battery. I have now been on line updating and browsing for just over an hour and I am at 32% battery power. I left the battery connected over night last night and I believe this battery can be damaged by doing this. It is advised to charge battery and disconnect after full charge. I haven't decided if this needs to go back because of this battery issue but I really don't want a Samsung which is so loaded up with bloatware and all kinds of things going on in the background when this tablet is relatively free of some of that. I will update in a few more days but so far besides the battery we really love this tablet.I ordered this for my wife as a replacement to an Apple iPad 2.  She was not interested in another pricey iPad.  I l:-)like the android system and looked at varies offerings fromSamsung to Toshiba etc. After reading about Asus products and also their somewhat disappointed tablet.users I decided after seeing complaints in every tablet manufactured category I was giving the Transformer TF701T a chance since I love what the offer on paper. Our needs are fairly basic as we are not major gamers but enjoy occasional rounds of Candycrush (wife's favorite) or air hockey (2 player) or hill climber.Anyway you get the idea. Then of course we use it for all the other typical functions, web browsing , GPS, weather, editing xls files she brings home from work, and a few other assorted items Asus offers. Day one loved the look and feel and the touch screen was very good in its responses, typing accurately and web pages loaded beautifully in both the on board browser and chrome. Getting used to Polaris might take a bit of time but we think the program will do what we need for editing xls files. Second day I noticed the system updated and installed program updates to Google Play Services, actually all things Google, music, play store, Google+, etc, along with Flipboard, AOLink, AmazonKindle, Facebook, Hangouts, Zinio ,  and a couple others. I then down loaded Candy Crush so my wife could enjoy abit of that and the following day downloaded Hockey2 . At some point later on or about the fourth day I experienced a bizarre screen episode. While browsing on line the screen stopped being responsive to touch. I simply could not get the page to move or recognize any of my input gestures. Then the screen went to sleep and I could not wake it. So I forced the tablet to turn off by pressing and holding the power button for a few seconds. Truth is I don't know if it turned off or not since the customary prompt did not show on screen asking if I want to cancel or continue. Anyway after a few minutes I plugged in the power adapter to charge and attempted to turn it on still with no luck. Then as I removed the power adaptor from the tablet it woke up and it continued to function fine from that point forward through the night. Now two days later while browsing on line the drop down menu would activate and prevent me from manipulating the web page ie. Move the page up or down. With each attempt to move the web page the drop down menu would move up or down even though I had never cued this menu. Weird is all I can say. Eventually it corrected itself and allowed me to continue but this and the other touch screen foibles has me concerned where this is leading. So today I reset the tablet back to factory specs with out allowing any updates to many of the Google apps that are on the tablet. I have disabled things like the Kindle app which is fine science if I wanted the Kindle I would have gotten one, many of the Google apps such as Services, Play Books, Play Magazines, disabled AOLink, Flipboard, Facebook, Gmail... my access is straight through Google on my browser (works fine for us), Hangouts, and youTube, all of which I can access in traditional ways so I feel no issue in these apps. So far I have not experienced any screen issues and will update in a week or so. If by disabling these prevents the weirdness I think we will really enjoy the TF701T. There are really  plenty of good things to say about this tablet, the Tegra4 really speeds things along,  the screen is really nice andwhen you turn on day light mode the screen is plenty bright. The screen also turns a slight yellow color for reading such as books and this helps with eye strain and makes it a more comfortable experience when you activate the reading mode.

I really don't have anything negative to say about it, although the dock is a different story because the dock hinge mechanism is poorly designed and results in frequent disconnects [I'm on my second dock now and I'm going to return it for a third to see if ASUS finally got it right].Back to the tablet, I really wouldn't change a thing. There is no stutter lag like the 700 was plagued with, and for anything I do including an occasional game, it has plenty of performance for a great user experience. I use it mostly indoors but I set the display to low brightness and vivid mode for the best display experience I've ever seen on any kind of personal computer.With a few add on video apps it streams 720p hd video off my lan NAS server perfectly without even utilizing 3 of the 4 processor cores.I believe this general form factor/design is the future because it offers the best features of a laptop and a tablet all in one. Now sometimes I go for days without even turning my laptop on.Finally, I have read criticism in the tech magazines about the wide bezel. I would respectfully say they don't know what they're talking about.

I was extremely disappointed in what would have been a descent tablet.The problem is hardware related and it might have something to do with the new audio chip they claim is so great.The problem is when audio is initiated, there is a very low slight hissing sound that continues until audio is paused or stopped where the hissing sound then stutters and concludes with a slight pop as it shuts off. Its very faint but if you listen to some quiet music, you will hear it. It also starts up as you type on the Google keyboard and it makes a sound after each letter is typed. The same hissing pattern initiates.Now before you start to saying it is just one defective tablet or my headphones, let me assure you I received a second of the same tablet and heard the same thing. I also heard this on multiple headphones, one of which are monster turbine copper professional ear buds, one set of BOSE around the ear and a third was a cheaper over ear headphones.Using the same headphones, I do not hear this problem on my phone, my previous tablet, or my sons tablet which is a different ASUS. This is specific to this model.ASUS quality is just awful. They release the TF201 that has GPS and wi-fi issues. The 300 series had slow RAM. Now this tablet has awful audio and who knows what else is hiding in the shadows. Yet their marketing just goes crazy over their new audio design. LOLI'm completely surprised some reviewers didn't pick this up but you really do need to be in a quiet environment with soft music to hear it, such as going to sleep with headphones on like I do every night. I also listen to hi-def music at times so this kind of stuff is important to me. If its important to you too.

DeRoller", "ReviewID": "RAW9PF2PZ0TNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am 5 days into owning the TF701T which I ordered with the optional the dock/keyboard.  I owned the TF700T for little over a year.  The TF701T is much faster than the TF700T with very little latency.  Evidently the TF700T suffers from slow memory which Android 4.3 attempts to address, however it's not officially released yet on the TF700T.Things I like about the TF701T- The display is awesome.  Very high resolution, bright and clear.- The relocation of the power button (farther back), and volume (on the left back now), different from the TF700T, makes them easier to use than on the TF700T.- The price for the TF701T with the keyboard dock is competitive and I don't see any other manufacturers selling a hard dock like Asus.  I would consider a Samsung tablet with a bluetooth keyboard in a case but that would be at least $100 more.Things I don't like about the TF701T and keyboard dock.- Intermittent loss of keyboard dock connection. During use the keyboard will suddenly stop working.  I did not have this problem with the TF700T.  The only way I've found to resolve it is to physically disconnect and connect the tablet to the dock. There is a bit of play in the physical connection between the tablet and the keyboard dock.  I tested rocking the tablet back and forth and seeing if that caused a disconnect and could not reproduce it.  It seemed to happen suddenly while the tablet and keyboard dock were stationary, so perhaps it's a software problem.- Rear camera doesn't have a flash.  Now granted I didn't use the rear camera that much on the TF700T but I did like having a flash with which to light dark scenes.- The keyboard dock uses more plastic than the TF700T version.

I turned off the automatic brightness and power saving modes and the problem persisted. Even another factory reset did not solve the problem. I posted a query on an online forum and some users had no such problems, some had the same problems. One user even said this is intentional and that the ambient light sensor cannot be turned off.Whether it is by design or a defect, it was terribly distracting and annoying.

Seriously, how can they take a pretty good idea and find so many ways to mess it up.The TF701T is what, the 4th generation Android Transformer?  The Transformer line been plagued throughout its life with unacceptable, stupid mistakes.As for ASUS itself.  The dock disconnects from the tablet very easily and inconveniently.  I wrote to ASUS about this design flaw.  They wrote back to tell me that I could send it in for \u201crepair\u201d if I sent my serial number.  I sent my serial number.  Was told that the warranty expired like 4 months ago (even though I just bought the thing about a month ago); but they would magnanimously extend the warranty for me.  How nice of them.I was dubious as to what \u201crepairs\u201d could be done as the thing wasn\u2019t broken; the problem is in the design.  But I sent in the keyboard anyway.  Received it back very quickly.  The repair:  two strips of felt badly glued to the inside of the docking guide to fill space.  It didn\u2019t work.  Thing still disconnects.  As a matter of fact, I actually think it\u2019s a little worse now.This experience, the obvious and STUPID cons I\u2019ve listed below and the problems that have plagued the Transformer line in the past is what leads to believe that ASUS is an almost unacceptably bad company.Here are my observations concerning the TF701T.Pros:Has a keyboard dock and the keyboard is pretty nice.  It functions well and has several useful dedicated \u201candroid\u201d keys.  The \u201cpinch zoom\u201d and \u201c2-finger swipe\u201d can be a bit touchy at times, but it works pretty darned good; when it doesn\u2019t disconnect from the tablet.I like the large bevel as it gives my hands plenty of room to hold the tabletI love that it doesn\u2019t have a stupid physical \u201chome\u201d button.  I know this is more of a preference thing, but I, personally like it.  The \u201cHome\u201d key follows the orientation of the tablet and there is little chance of accidentally pushing it while you are holding the tablet.  On most applications, it \u201cauto-hides\u201d so it doesn\u2019t really even take up screen space.As far as I\u2019ve noticed, except for the cons I\u2019m going to mention below, the thing works great.  It boots fine and I\u2019ve never had crash caused by the system; yet.Bottom line, the tablet seems to work really well.However, I swear that ASUS set out to take a really good idea, a \u201cTransformer\u201d and make a bunch of stupid decisions that will make it a frustrating mess and kill it.Cons:First, foremost and completely unacceptable.  This one con almost makes this thing not worth buying.  The stupid dock disconnects sometimes when the screen is moved or the unit is moved.  This is an annoyance at best.  I can not express how annoying it is to be sitting in bed, typing, surfing or watching a video and move the unit to better position and the stupid dock disconnects.  I have to fiddle with the dumb thing and sometimes the only way to fix it is to undock the tablet and redock it.  Aside from this annoyance factor (which in itself would make the thing almost not worth buying), this makes the USB port almost useless.  You can not be sure of a connection so if you want to transfer files from a flash drive or other USB data storage, you take a risk of a disconnect mid-transfer and a corruption of all your data on said storage deviceSecond, the WIFI is extremely touchy.  I have a not so great router, I admit.  However, even though it isn\u2019t stellar, no other device in our house (P.C.\u2019s, Mac\u2019s, I-pads, I-touches, and my Android phone) have problems connecting and maintaining connection.  Not so with the Transformer.  It works, for the most part, but at times it goes through a whole, connect, disconnect, connect, disconnect cycle.  It even doesn\u2019t see all WIFI networks around until I turn off WIFI and turn it back on.Third, there is no cover on the MicroSD slot on the tablet.  REALLY?!  This is a tablet.  We are going to be HOLDING the stupid thing.  It is possible that the MicroSD card could maybe be pushed and ejected without even knowing it.  I know because this happened to me.  I still haven\u2019t found the thing and probably never will.No \u201cescape\u201d key on the keyboard, but it does have TWO back keys\u2026.that\u2019s niceProprietary charger on an ANDROID device.  Supposedly this is so that it can be used with a dock.  Um, hello, the dock STILL doesn\u2019t connect well even with your proprietary charging port.
