{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, if you are looking for the right things.", "Author": "reese", "ReviewID": "R1ZY0PH8FQDU2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, a nice tablet. Unfortunately for me, it was not what I was looking for. After owning it for 8 mo., I understand what it is capable of and not capable of.PROS-1. lightweight- I can almost not feel it in my hands.2. fast- both while operating and while booting up.3. keyboard- as most tablets do not have this, it is a plus, even if it is reduced in size.4. physical quality- overall, very sturdy.5. graphics- Amazing quality graphics, can play many games with ease.6. camera- though I never used it much, the camera looked pretty good.CONS-1. OS- I personally do not like the Android OS, especially on a tablet that feels like a real laptop.2.  screen- fingerprints and scratches show up very easily.3. No DVD Drive- I thought there would be one, but I was mistaken.So if you are looking for something more like a laptop, please do go and buy a cheaper laptop- it will save you the trouble I had. But if you are actually looking for a tablet, then this would be a very good choice.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "awsome", "Author": "Tamara", "ReviewID": "R115DSWQOFZG1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use.fast.plenty of storage.I have to get one for my kids so they will leave mine alone !!love it,love it !!", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "ASUS 10.1\" 16GB Android 3.2 Tablet PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YNOO5ITQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0090OQIP8"}}
