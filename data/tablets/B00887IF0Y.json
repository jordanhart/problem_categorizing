{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought four of these for Christmas 2013", "Author": "Kristy Hodge", "ReviewID": "RDOK5QKYYXFKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought four of these from Target for our kids for Christmas so we have had them for 2 weeks. Kids ages are 15, 12, 10, and 7. I myself own an iPod Touch 4.What I like about the Kurio Touch 4s are the parental controls. I can limit the amount of time each day (eg 60 min). I can also limit the hours (eg 3pm-8pm). When it gets close to their time limit, they get a warning. When their time is up, they are locked out. However, they can still listen to music even if their time is up (love this!). Also, if I want to override their time for a snow day, I can easily do that and they can have more play time.We don't buy apps from the Kurio App Store. We only get free apps from the Amazon App Store. I have restricted my 7 and 10 year olds so that only I can download apps for them by logging into the parental account. The 15 and 12 year olds can download their own.My daughter bought a micro SD card and loaded music on it using our home PC. She put the SD card in the Kurio Touch and has listened to many hours of music with no trouble.There are a few quirks with the Kurio Touch 4s, (restricted from searching for harmless words when using the Genius Filtering System internet profile) but overall, we couldn't be more pleased. I like my iPod Touch, but for the price and added bonus of good parental controls, the Kurio Touch 4s is a quality product and I highly recommend it.I will try to remember to come back and update at 3 months. :)UPDATE: 01/18/2014 - Today the kids got an update on their Kurio Touch 4S.  Google Play has been added!  They now have access to Gmail, Play, Maps, etc.  Good news for all of you that were discouraged by the limitation of apps!UPDATE: 03/31/2014 - All 4 Kurio Touch 4S devices are still going strong! It seems that the kids get all of their apps from Google Play instead of Amazon App Store since Google Play was made available. The boys play Clash of Clans daily. Every once in a while a device will freeze and we have to do a reset by holding the volume up button and the power button until it powers off. That seems to resolve any issues.Two complaints: #1 - The charging port on the device and the charging cord have to be connected \"just so\" in order to charge the device. Sometimes they don't get connected just right and the device won't charge. #2 - My daughter can't get the free Instagram app. The Instafire app is available, which is an instagram client designed for the KindleFire. The only downside? Cost is $2.99 through Amazon App Store. We just can't bring ourselves to spend any money. :)Overall, we are still very pleased with these devices and they are well worth the price we paid in December 2013 ($99 each).  They are primarily used in our house to play games, access Facebook and listen to music.  There are many eReader apps available, so you could use this device to read as well.  We also own Kindles and use those for reading.  There isn't any web browsing done on our devices.  We restrict that to computers.  Great device at a reasonable price for all ages.UPDATE 05/30/2014: My 15 year old daughter dropped her Kurio, which DID NOT have the rubber case on it.  She dropped it on concrete and the screen cracked very badly, rendering the device useless.  This is not a flaw in the product.  The boys keep their rubber cases on and have dropped the Kurio 4s countless times.  Lesson:  Keep the rubber case on these!My 7 year old son's Kurio 4s can no longer be charged.  :(  One of the prongs on the charging port inside the Kurio got bent/damaged and it will no longer connect completely to the cord.  This IS a flaw in the product, in my opinion.  My iPod Touch 4 has been charged countless times in 2 years with no problems in the charging port.  The Kurio 4s charging port is definitely inferior to Apple's product.Out of 4 devices purchased for Christmas 2013, 2 are still working (the ones that belong to my 12 year old and 10 year old boys) great after 6 months.  The good news?  The Kurio 4s is about $61 on Amazon if we want to replace them.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Kurio - great tablet that has encouraged our son to read more!", "Author": "BC_TX", "ReviewID": "R1D2CW97CYYJ7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kurio was a gift from my parents to our 10 year old son - who thinks they are the coolest people in the planet! He absolutely loves it - and so do we. From our point of view, we love the fact that we can control what content he sees, when he sees it and for how long (that is a GREAT feature!). The initial set up was pretty straight forward (once connected to WiFi - things just `flow'), it took about 10 minutes for my husband (he is an engineer) to get the tablet up and running for him. We did go back at it later and tweak some of the configuration to make sure we had all our bases covered in terms of what he has access to. Again - this secondary set up was pretty straight forward. Once we gave him to him - it took him a little while to figure out the controls/hand gestures - and well - he has been loving it since. The preloaded apps/games have kept him entertained from the beginning, and then we looked for new ones (we wanted a few educational games on there). He has enjoyed those as well, and now he is able to search and download what he wants (within the limits we stipulated). We purchased an external memory card - and have uploaded a couple of his favorite movies and songs. He has taken to photograph the world around him and show us what things look like from his perspective (which is fun).  Something that caught us by surprise (and we are very thankful for) is that he loves reading books in his tablet. This is an unexpected bonus, and we will continue to encourage him to read more. We have looked at the non-child interface (we followed the instructions to activate the full Android interface - and we can see that it is useful for adults too. Basically it seems to operate in the same way as a normal Android tablet. That is a great option too!) The tablet itself seems to be well constructed, and we have spoken to him about taking care of it (don't drop it, clean your hands before use, etc.) so that it lasts long. We were a little bit disappointed that we could not find the Google Play store on it, but this was easily remedied by installing the Amazon app store instead (Little Piano is a huge hit!). So really - this is a minor point. Our son loves his Kurio and we are very happy with the level of control that we have over what content he can access. We cannot really ask for more!", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointing", "Author": "edequimm", "ReviewID": "R1E6G6SNUGOBHO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We looked long and hard at tablets that we could use as a family - narrowing it down to the Kindle Fire and Kurio 7, both $199. Both have pros and cons for what we wanted - an educational tool for our young children, something to keep them entertained on trips as well as some functionality for us. We finally chose the Kurio 7 - the deciding factors being it has a camera and 4.0 OS. However, neither of these features make up for the fact that it does not give access to the full android market which has a much larger selection of apps, especially free apps. Kurio have their own market but it has very limited offerings (particularly in free apps for kids - when searching it said no free educational apps for kids and no free ebooks for young children!) Why would I pay for apps via Kurio market when I know I can get similar/better ones for free and a much greater range of paid ones elsewhere? I understand this is a tablet for kids and there are restrictions on the content they should have access to. But why not allow full access to android market in the parental section? Not having access to the apps I want drastically limits the functionality of this tablet for what we want. This may not be an issue for others buyers of this product but for us it is a deal-breaker and we will be returning this for the Kindle Fire.Since writing the review above a couple of days ago, I have had a chance to play with the Kurio tablet more. The camera/video recorder should not be a deciding factor in buying this tablet (which is was for us) as the quality is very poor (but in fairness it probably has similar megapixels to other cameras on tablets.) Also, some of the 'kid friendly' apps/games available on the curated Kurio market are not what I'd call (young) kid friendly (for example, a game where you stop zombies from eating farm animals and another game with explicit graphics on having your choice of saw 'cut' your fingers.) In addition, some inappropriate ads pop up \"get a free gun\", \"3 babes want to connect with you\" on some of the free games we downloaded which was surprising as the content is curated to be family appropriate and is the reason Kurio does not give access to the full android market. Perhaps these pop-up ads are outside of Kurio's control or maybe slipped under their radar? Again, these points may not be an issue for all parents, especially those with older children (ours are 4-5 yrs), but are further reasons why this is not the right tablet for us.

I could not be happier. He adores it and cannot put it down. I simply don't understand the negative reviews. There is nothing wrong with its wifi and the amazon app store as well as the kurio store work just fine. There are an infinite number of free apps between the two of them. I'm glad I also bough him a micro SD card because it's clear he's going to need it. He has used the Netflix app repeatedly and without any issue with the wifi streaming capability and has downloaded ebooks too. True, the interface graphics are geared towards younger kids and it contains more parental controls than say, the Kindle Fire. But, that's why I bought it. He's only 10. Our 14 year old has a Kindle Fire, given to him a year ago, and I have been beyond frustrated constantly trying to filter the hard core (and I mean really hard core) porn that gets through on it - there are no parental controls on the Kindle Fire besides all-or-nothing internet access. The Kurio does everything I hoped it would and more. I think the negative reviewers either didn't bother to read the directions on how to set up the amazon app store, or expected it to be an iPad, which it is not. It is a superb product for kids ready for their first tablet.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lasted barely over a month, no phone support from company", "Author": "Tobyus", "ReviewID": "R213KHV30B4KM4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had very high hopes for this tablet when my son received it for Christmas from his Grandfather.  It was designed for kids, and the big rubber bumper that comes with it looked like it would just about make it indestructible.  It had all of the features that I would look for in a tablet for myself (besides the weaker processor, lower resolution screen, and only 4 GB of internal storage).  But those could be overlooked because it was aimed at kids and it had an SD card slot for expanding the storage.The Good:1) The Kurio interface is a little sluggish, but I have to admit that I was impressed with the amount of control it gives you over the device as a parent.  And I never once had an issue with the Kurio software itself.2) The device has an SD Card slot, USB port, HDMI out, forward and rear facing cameras, and it comes with a big rubber bumper protective case (that apparently won't protect the screen from a 2 foot drop onto carpet, read on for details).3) It comes with several popular games that my son loved.4) You can install the Amazon App store, and barely install apps with it...The Bad:1) It is slow, especially if you try to run more advanced games on it or try to use the Amazon App store.2) The screen resolution is ok, but side by side with a Kindle Fire (not the HD version), there is no comparison.3) Every time my son wanted to install an app from the Amazon App store, I had to go into the Android interface and clear all of the data for the Amazon App store application, otherwise the App just would not run on the device.  This meant I had to login again and reset all of the parental controls on the Amazon App store, and it also meant that I have about 15 copies of this device in my \"Devices\" list on Amazon.com...4) Lastly, and worst of all...it is not durable enough for kids.  Even with the protective cover on and a $25 screen protector on it, a single drop onto carpet from about 2 feet off the ground destroyed the screen.  The screen is splintered from the bottom to the top and it no longer responds to touch at all.  So, you can't even unlock the device upon boot.  It still turns on, and you can see the \"2 circles\" on the lock screen, but that's as far as you can go.5) No phone support from KD Interactive (the company who makes the Kurio), only online support.6) The online support person told me that I would have to send the device to them first before they would even tell me how much it would cost to repair, and they are in another country, so who knows how much it would cost or whether we would ever see it again.In closing, I highly recommend looking elsewhere for the time being.  The device showed a lot of promise at first and the software, with better hardware could be a winner for sure.  But I have to say that for around the same price a Kindle Fire 2nd Gen is a better bet and it has sufficient Parental Controls, and with a decent case should be much more durable and I would guarantee that Amazon has phone support.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon app store", "Author": "Jaysay", "ReviewID": "R2VYSRMN2A4O8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also was upset about the google play market, but you can download the Amazon app store and it has all the latest apps.

My boys are 5 and 7 and get so much enjoyment out of these tablets. The parental controls are great, and there is a setting that kicks off the kiddos after a set time period so they are not on this all day. Link it to you amazon account and you can stream your digital content on long car rides. We bought an over the head rest tablet holder, gave them wireless headphones and they did not ask \"are we there yet\" one time! I have a tabeo too and this runs circles around that, unlike the tabeo it is not a huge memory hog and it doesn't freeze. Will buy a third if they are still around when my toddler gets a little older. Hopefully they remain in business and keep improving. I will say that it is cheaper to buy them from Toys-R-Us, I paid $149.99 each there and for a for about $30 total got an awesome anti spill/drop/ Etc 2 year warranty!

He's getting it for Christmas but i figured id open it and set everything up and make sure everything works. There are not a lot of reviews on this product yet mainly because all these kids tablets just came out this year. At first glance this Tablet is really cool and good value for the money. We paid $149 for it in the US. The set up took about 30 minutes for all the profile settings for me and to set all the parental controls for my 7 year old. There are many different features that i saw right up front that i really like. Such as you can set how long and what time of day they can play. You can set up if you want to view certain websites or games. I also liked that you can really personalize everything about it. It was easy to set up and the functions are clear. There are a lot of Free games already installed and at first glance at the Kurio store there are 100s of free games on there. I havent figured out how to add another store yet but i saw somehting about adding an amazon store so maybe you can get more games and stuff on there. The touch screan is OK this is why i gave it at this time only 4 stars. The screan responds well but when i went to put in the detailed things like changing the time there was a bit of a delay or the censor was off a little. Over all i really like it so far. I will update this review once my son plays with it for a few weeks to give you an updated opinion. Hope this helps.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible product.  If you're going to pay this kind of money, get a Kindle Fire", "Author": "Vanessa", "ReviewID": "R2DCC8QCGHCRPP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased 2 of these items for my boys, ages 5 and 7.  I did a lot of research beforehand and I found several mixed reviews.  So I took a risk at buying these at $150 EACH.  The reason I bought the Kurio Kids tablet instead of Kindle Fire is because I liked the pre-downloaded kid apps, and I liked that the parent can regulate what sites the kids can go on.  Well, these tablets worked for about a month before crashing.  There was an update that I did on both tablets, but they were never the same.  My older son's tablet will say it's fully charged and then 5 minutes later shut off because of low battery.  My younger son's tablet doesn't even turn on anymore.  As far as the regulating what sites they can go on, it doesn't work.  If you try to put a block on certain sites, they can't go on ANY sites.  It blocks the entire internet.  It took forever to download any other apps other than the pre-downloaded ones.  And once they are downloaded, most of them didn't even work.  As far as Netflix, Facebook or similar apps to be downloaded?  Forget it.  Doesn't work.  So here goes:  If you are going to spend this kind of money on tablets, get the Kindle Fire.  Period.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.  Now I'm out $300 and all I have to show for it is one Kurio tablet that doesn't turn on, and one Kurio tablet that works for 5 minutes.

From Christmas day, my 3 year daughter was in love with this product, especially having her own tablet that she didn't have to share with her older brother or use our cell phones. I was even amazed at all the specs (except the camera)and apps that she was able to play/run.  And we were even able to connect our Amazon market to get other apps we've already purchased for my sons Kindle Fire.  After the first week I realized the battery was losing its life span, and by the beginning of the 3rd week the system reset itself.  When I turned it on for my daughter, the screen was set to Android (which is only an option through parental controls after a password).  It looked like a cell phone - tech'y and ALL of the apps were gone.  So I went through the entire process of trying to get back to the mode when I purchased it, and redid the initial set up, started re-installing the apps.  I put it on the charger (which is always out of her reach, especially this time because I was monitoring the behavior of the tablet) the next day, I attempted to turn it on to continue setting it up so my daughter could begin using it again, AND IT NEVER CAME BACK ON!!  I even tried to charge it through the computer with the other cord it came with, nothing!!  I just returned it, to get a Lexibook.  But before I even opened it, I'm online getting more reviews because the sales associate could only tell me what was on the box.  It looks like I will be exchanging that tomorrow for the Nabi 2!  This was a Great product, if you only want it to work 100% for a week.  Oh, did I mention that my daughter had a little trouble with the touchscreen. At first I thought it was because we left the screen protector on, but even I had to press hard to get some games to react to me.  It would be nice if they put the some energy into the kids tablets as our adult ones.  Especially for kids that are use to our specs.  It should be easier for them to use, not get the old recycled software.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed!", "Author": "Sl Judge \"gatormomz\"", "ReviewID": "RHSPM55TMTM2U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am tech friendly and own several tablets.  I really searched and searched to try and find a kid friendly tablet that would allow parental controls.  I wanted them to enjoy learning, have some fun and most of all, have the safety of them not being on the internet.  The Kurio 7s did just that. It gave a parent account and then accounts for the kids. That part was definitely 5 stars.  However, the Kurio store is pretty worthless. You cannot download many of the apps from their own store without it crashing. That was a bummer because it came with a 3 month trial to a kids cartoon app.  Nope, that wouldn't even run.  I finally got the Amazon App Store loaded on and that was GREAT. It was slow when you compare it to other tablets on the market of equal cost.  It had a poor response time. The kids are use to using iPads, Kindle Fire and even the Samsung Galaxy tablet.  They found this \"slow and boring\" and I'm sorry, but all I heard was \"it's doing it again! Help!\" as it spun itself crazy in a frozen state.  You CANNOT download Google Play store to it. I was very disappointed and began my online search for other opinions and sure enough, you cannot download Google Play and everyone says the same thing.  I am debating on 1 or 2 stars...giving it two because I really do think they can make this a better tablet. They have a great idea, but they need to execute!

Sometimes it is successful but most often not. I usually disable the wifi when the kids are playing because of the numerous pop ups and virus alerts we kept getting. I also did not want my kids to access the mobil 1 market themselves because there seems to be alot of inappropriate content, very x rated content. I have not been able to purchase any apps from the kurio store because it keeps telling me my password is invalid. I did not get much help from customer service.

My two year old simply had to swipe the apps off the page.  I was able to recover some of them as they showed up in a \"recently used apps\" page.  However, he eventually was able to swipe all the apps away, and they no longer show up anywhere.  There is no recycle bin to retrieve them.  I have been trying to use the recovery process on the Kurio website for three days now.  The files are encrypted, so they will not simply open after the hour long download of them (x4 because there are two different recovery files, and I tried them two times each, thinking they must not have downloaded properly).  I had to download WinZip in order to get the files to open.  I then copied them to the device and restarted the tablet.  Although a bar comes up indicating that the apps are being installed, they still did not show up after numerous 30 minute installation attempts.As for the apps (when they were there) many of the games' instructions were in various foreign languages, even though you do select a language preference for the device.  Other negative features of the Kurio include: long startup time, poor camera quality, somewhat short battery life, very long recharge time (overnight for a full charge), and very loose USB/recharge connection.It's just not worth the time and frustration.

I am also part of the publishing field, and will be writing an product review in the same light.I purchased a Kurio 10 for my children in the fall of 2013. The original product purchased was flawed. None of the preloaded applications worked properly \u2013 those that would actually open would end up closing unexpectedly moments later. I contacted Kurio support and was given the run around. It was suggested I download and then upload certain programs, which took a total of 24 hours and was unsuccessful. As a result, I took the tablet back to the store it was purchased from and made an exchange.The second Kurio tablet worked much better \u2013 the applications worked properly, and we had some success using it. However, shortly after it was purchased, one of my children tapped the tablet a little too hard, and the glass cracked. For a product that was specifically designed for use by children and families, it sure hasn't held up to that promise.We immediately contacted Kurio and were given the run around a second time in their customer service department. We did not receive any response to our e-mails, either. We tried to replace the tablet a second time unsuccessfully, and have consequently decided that it was not worth replacing. One of the features that sold us on this particular tablet was that children could not purchase any apps on their own and that parents could control the time that their children could spend on the tablet. Ultimately, this can be done on any tablet. As a result, we have decided to purchase a tablet that works better, runs faster, and was only a fraction of the price of the Kurio tablet.

You'll gain space and a faster working machine.  2) Download the \"updates\" for google.  After doing that, if you want to be able to download apps from google play, you MUST give teach \"kid profile\" that you've created access to google play also (to do this, when on the \"owner\" page, click \"Kurio parental area\", then click \"profile,\" then click each kids' profile one at a time, then click \"app management,\"  Then make sure the box by \"google play store\" is clicked.  After you do that, you will notice the google play icon will be on each kids' profile page under their app list.  If you don't do this, google won't let you download apps to the device (it will say they're not supported). 3) Once you give each kids' profile access to google play, you can then log onto google play from each of the kid profiles (you can sign into google play on each profile page using the same user name/password that you used for the owner), and under \"setting\" on google play, you can restrict what kind of apps that child will be able to download.  4) You must do the same if you want downloads from the amazon app store to work properly.  Give each profile access to amazon apps by doing the same thing as above that you did for google play.  You'll then have to log onto amazon apps from each kids' page just as you did with google play.  However,, once I did that, the kurio blocking system blocked each kid from actually accessing the app page.  So the amazon app icon shows up on each kids profile, but if one of my kids clicks on it, it says automatically that it is blocked by kurios genius filtering system.  But as long as the icon is on their page and you've signed in, apps downloaded from amazon app store should work fine.  Hope this helps--it tooks me hours of trial and error to figure this out. But now that I have, the device is working wonderfully!  So far...so good!

I wasn't keen on putting my credit card number in for their app store and since I'd already purchased Minecraft through the Amazon App Store I could easily download it to his Kurio.  Since that has worked and is the game of choice for my 8 year old he loves the thing.

I really searched and searched to try and find a kid friendly tablet that would allow parental controls. I wanted them to enjoy learning, have some fun and most of all, have the safety of them not being on the internet. The Kurio 7s did just that. It gave a parent account and then accounts for the kids. That part was definitely 5 stars. However, the Kurio store is pretty worthless. You cannot download many of the apps from their own store without it crashing. That was a bummer because it came with a 3 month trial to a kids cartoon app. Nope, that wouldn't even run. I finally got the Amazon App Store loaded on and that was GREAT. It was slow when you compare it to other tablets on the market of equal cost. It had a poor response time. The kids are use to using iPads, Kindle Fire and even the Samsung Galaxy tablet. They found this \"slow and boring\" and I'm sorry, but all I heard was \"it's doing it again! Help!\" as it spun itself crazy in a frozen state. You CANNOT download Google Play store to it. I was very disappointed and began my online search for other opinions and sure enough, you cannot download Google Play and everyone says the same thing. I am debating on 1 or 2 stars...giving it two because I really do think they can make this a better tablet. They have a great idea, but they need to execute!

I purchased for Christmas for my 8 yr old son to use for homework, games, etc.  I gave it to him a week early because I was excited.

We fully charged it for two days only to have the KD Interactive logo stay on for more than 8 hours; even after five attempts to hit the reset button.  The screen went blank for a second and came back on.  FINALLY went off but won't come on again.  Read the manual that directed me online where I sat for over 5 mins chatting with myself because the system kept timing me out and resetting.  No one ever acknowledged my presence.  I finally gave up and located a number for Kurio 4S model.  Called and the loop kept telling me to hold on before it finally directed me to \"leave a message.\"  They had better be glad I don't curse but I left a scathing voicemail that they are probably just laughing at because they don't care.  Who sells a product without providing a phone number for customer support.  Better yet, who BUYS a product without fully researching this?  I honestly didn't think I would need customer support and surely not within one week of buying the product.

It was the same with almost any other site on the net.Playing the games worked fine but after awhile our son wanted new games and so we tried to download the app that is needed to download more games (whether free or paid) and again, after 25 minutes couldn't get it done. There's no real instructions on how to do that and none to poor customer support. So we looked online for fixes that people post on youtube and other sites and tried them to no avail.

But, i hate the fact that it does not use google play store, so you can forget about finding any games you've ever gotten there. it only comes with the \"kurio store\" on which EVERYTHING costs $ there are NO free apps. then  they offer you to add other app stores ( not google play) but they offer them at your own risk, if anything goes wrong with your tablet from using the 3rd party stores, they will not be responsible. well, thats just crap. the other stores they offer, two of which i have never even heard of, one of them though, is amazon app. they do have free apps, but still not every available app you can get on google play. you cannot get the real Youtube app, no matter which of the 4 stores you choose. only one had the netflix app, and when i got it logged in and picked a movie, only the audio was working and not the video, so i tried another movie to make sure it wasnt just that movie, but no, still no video. contacted kurio. they will NOT help you, because netflix is a 3rd party app. so they had me called netflix. i called netflix and they were glad to try and help so they sent me an email with complicated instructions that i still havent figured out, i am SERIOUSLY considering returning the damn things ( i bought two) but i dont know what kids tablet i can get that uses google play, because im told nabi2 and kindle fire also use amazon app store. im SO disapointed because my kids and myself were looking forward to these tablets being great, and its the biggest let down ever. also, my kids' favorite game is Hayday, and it is NOT available in any of the 4 stores. what a disaster.I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND TO ANYONE TO BUY THIS TABLET!!!!!!!!!!!!and if you do, i hope you have no problems with it because kurios customer service really STINKS!Bad job Kurio, bad job :(UPDATE:After owning the tablet for about 2 weeks, a system update became available, and upon installing it, Google Play store is now available, which I am glad about. Also, after the update, Netflix began to work. Im glad Kurio did resolve these issues, as they were my main two concerns. Im still not happy with the fact I had to go through the hassle to begin with, and the fact they initially misrepresented the fact you could get netflix.However, now that the two main issues have been resolved, I would rate it 3 stars instead of one, for future buyers, assuming that when they get theirs, it will have the current update, and they wont have to go through the hassle that I did.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "Melissa R.

I was able to get 3 apps out of 10 because the Amazon app itself took 30 mins to download, WITH the help of Chat support!After all this, i noticed the 10 apps I chose didn't all go through because the system kept kicking off the Wi-fi signal. I've never had a problem with the Wi-fi in my house with ANY device, but the tablet keeps kicking it out.I went in the next day to re-install the Free kids apps from Amazon and the downloader tool wasn't working anymore. I have them in my Amazon purchase history but the downloader has completely stopped and to re-install is AGAIN a pain in the butt.Third, the tablet turns off even before the 2 minute \"no activity\" rule. it just plain turns off.I am really about to return this as I might as well get a Kindle or an iPad mini.

And in order to get into the bookmark options your child will have to search so this is not exactly \"Free Reign\" by themselves playing with Parental Control. It will be you being handed the devices every 10 minute to figure out where to go! The games that are on there didnt really fit a 3-5 year old unless they know high math facts.
