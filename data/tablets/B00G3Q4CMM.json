But I will show you how the sound on this time and I will do it later on for right now I am trying to figure out how to make a video to show you what I am referring to and also the tablet works very fast which I am very happy with.  I was talking to Amazon.com they were very nice to help me to figure out what the problem is I explained to them what the problem is and they already tell me what to do to send it back to give me a replacement and they were very understandable people her name was \"Jessica \"and I'm very happy with the she saw the problem right away.

My son's screen broke within 3 days. Granted, he probably threw it or something, but he's played with my Kindle Fire for over a year without damaging it in any way. Within another couple of weeks, the power button on the pink one got stuck and the tablet cannot be turned on at all. We thought maybe she had done something wrong because she is young. But like my son, she has played with my Kindle for some time without ever causing any damage. Within a month after that, the purple one did the same thing. This happening made it clear to me that the product is the problem. My oldest child is 8 and knows how to handle and take care of tablets. She has been playing with my Kindle since I bought it 2 or 3 years ago. So now I have three useless tablets that I paid almost $80 a piece for. I am also giving 1 star for customer service. We contacted Amazon about returning the tablets (pink and purple only because we aren't 100% sure that our son didn't do the damage). They authorized a return for one, but not the other claiming it was out of the 30 day return period. Well, duh. Of course it is. We bought these for Christmas presents and did not wait until the last minute to buy so 30 days pretty much passed before my kids laid hands on the things. Frankly, if you're going to sell crap, you should be prepared to refund money for crap. I don't want to replace crap with more crap. I want my money back so I can buy something worth my money. I will never buy from this seller again.

I've read mixed reviews on this and was very concerned about a lot of the negative reviews but decided to give the product a chance.As always Amazon has amazing fast delivery, product came within 2 days.When opening the packaging the first thing I noticed were a few scratches on the cameras. It appears as if this may have been either poorly put together or simply refurbished and sold as new. Knowing that this device wasn't the top of the line android I fully expected the performance to not be amazing. The casing seems to be very cheap plastic and the screen is flimsy and weak feeling. The size of the device was perfect and the carrying case that we purchased with it looked great initially. After charging the device for a full 10 hours the battery life seemed to die pretty quickly with no apps running while navigating through the menus. During usage I began to smell burning plastic possibly internally of the device. After powering off the device because of this, the device turned on its own with no user interaction, possibly a bad chip set or power button? After shutting it down again and letting it cool off I turned it back on and tried to connect to my wireless network. This device was unable to connect to my home WIFI and my Galaxy S4 in tethering mode. I tried to connect also to an open network in my neighborhood but the device was unable to pull an IP address. To me that immediately indicated this device has a faulty wireless chip. I decided to turn to the web to see others reviews on this product which were also very similar in negative feedback. One major red flag I saw after looking through the included documentation it states on a few small cut sheets of paper. \"Please follow the steps if you have any difficulty of powering on your tablet for the first time\" and has instructions on how to perform this. On a yellow sheet of paper with big bold red letters \"CALL US BEFORE YOU CONSIDER RETURNING THIS PRODUCT\", that pretty much tells me they've had issues with their devices and have included this in the documents. Not a good sign for a consumer on unboxing. The last piece of instructions \" How to make tablet run faster and last longer?\", instructs the user to search app killer in the play store to save on battery life and cpu usage, almost as if they advertise a fast processor but have doubts on its performance.Overall I understand that this was a cheap product, you basically get what you pay for but I at least hoped it would work out of the box from the start. I'll probably never buy a product from this company again.

It turns out, they're not bad.  This is the second one we've given our son as the first one was damaged by his sister (4 at the time).  These do have a HD screen but the camera is pretty lame, so picures taken in bright sunshine are the only ones that look any good.  The ones we got say 4GB on the back of them but when you look in the system settings, it says 2.8GB.  I'd say that's pretty far off the mark for the storage rating.  As it turns out they are pretty durable as our daugher has dropped hers several times, and it still works well.  I guess that's one advantage of not having a glass front.  Loading apps is easy enough, we've even gotten a few educational games in under the radar.  All in all, it's a good tablet for kids.

Like many of you, I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my son.  And also, like many of you, the price was so great that I was able to purchase another one for my daughter.  At first, both tablets were awesome and I was impressed by their speed.  While my daughter's continues to work well, my son's has become little more than an error message display board.  After a week or so his Google Play suddenly disappeared from his tablet, and some of the games he had already downloaded would no longer function.  An error message appeared: \"UID systems are inconsistent, etc.\"  every time he tried to click on something.  I looked this error message up online and saw that the basic answer was to do a factory reset of your tablet for the message to disappear.  I did so, and now a new error message appears whenever my son tries to use his camera: \"External Storage needed...\" although, as many of you have stated, there is no spot to add external storage on this device.I looked up this second error message online and there was no real solution to it either, though it stated that this is sometimes a side effect of a factory reset on your tablet.  So basically, remove one error for another one to pop up.  I received NO manufacturer information with my tablet, so I contacted the seller through Amazon for a hopeful QUICK replacement.  I did not receive any feedback from the seller, who obviously have no intentions of making my replacement fast and simple.  Had I received two tablets that work, I would be among those of you on here who are praising this tablet and feel it is such a great deal.

I've only had it since Valentines day and I am already having problems with it. Upon receiving it I was so excited, and couldn't wait to turn it on the play on it, but was a good girl and followed the instructions to let it completely charge. I noticed about 15 mins of playing time, the back started to get really HOT! So hot it was stinging my hand. I thought that I will just let it rest and come back to it. Same thing the next day and every time I turned it on. First of all, if it is getting that hot it obviously needs a vent to allow air to get to it. I understand it is no PC or laptop. However, the heat is ridiculous. Today 2/24/2014 (10 days after I received it) It will only work while it is on the charger!! As soon as you disconnect it, the device turns off. While it is on it states it is 99% full on the battery. However, when you disconnect the charger and try to turn it on, it shows a red fully drained battery!! *******************I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS TABLET 10 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To replace the screen it's going to cost me about $40 - half the price I paid for the entire tablet.  The colors and background on the tablet were nice and easy to use, but the download capacity was poor.  Most of the games available for this device require wireless connection to play, causing me to have to tether my phone to the device and use up my data while we are anywhere but home (ie: in the car, etc.)  I struggled with purchasing this tablet because of the mixed reviews, but thought I would go ahead and take my chances.  I am sorry I did.  I wish I would have spent the extra money and gotten him a better tablet from the beginning, but you live and learn.

Performing a system reset was a useless exercise.  Also, I'm sure not every router in my area is defective or locked up. That being said, the product description said that Google Play was pre-installed. It was not, But, I guess that didn't matter so much since I was unable to get online with the tablet anyway.
