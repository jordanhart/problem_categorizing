Overall I found that it is really just for a basic user wanting to surf the Web or for your kids or something. I wouldn't take this tablet on a road trip because you would be needing to charge it every hour if you use it continously.I do find that it can do what it's suppose to do. The quality of the camera was low - I wouldn't send these pictures to print be any means. But it definitely can preform the basic functions and even the ones I threw at it.  I just really didn't like the battery life of it.  I felt like I had to charge it every other hour.

less than positive experiences some of the other reviews have mentioned. I've had really bad tablets before, and this is not one of them. Please note that in my attached video, the lines on the screen are the effect of my camera trying to film a screen. They are not lines on the tablet's screen. The screen on the tablet is clear and colorful.Pros:- Touch screen works REALLY well. Very responsive.- Screen is bright and clear.- Sounds is adequate. Very clear, not muddy. But don't expect a lot of base.- Buttons are all easy to access and push. Volume rocker built in, so no need to rely only on the on-screen functions.- Charges really fast (however this is because of a smaller battery, so it also discharges fast)- Built in camera- Wifi works well- Apps work fine. I haven't run into any crashes yet. Small/simple game apps run okay. But don't try and play anything apps that require a super powerful processor. You'll get some lag. Angry Birds type app games are fine. But racing simulator games and such are probably too much for it.- It works! I'm amazed they can make a tablet that works this well for this price.Cons:- Screen is not glass and if you press too hard, you can damage it. Fortunately the tablet has such high touch screen sensitivity, I haven't need to press hard on it.- As mentioned before, it has small battery. So while it does charge up quickly, is also discharges quickly.Other notes:Keep in mind this is not a $300+ tablet, and doesn't have the same kinds of hardware inside. So browsing the internet and launching application is a bit slower. You have to wait a few seconds for each action.I did not run into the problem of the charger breaking. I've plugged mine in and out of the wall and tablet several times and it's still in one piece. It looks and feels just like any other power adapter and seems to work in the same way.The red color of this tablet has orange undertones to it. So if you have your heart set on an exact cherry red color, this isn't that. Personally I like the reddish-orange color even better.Conclusion:This tablet is good for someone who needs something very basic. You're not going to replace your computer with this. It's a good little device for reading emails, playing Angry Birds or doing crossword puzzles, using as an eReader or doing some browsing online. I wouldn't suggest it for some one looking for a tablet just to watch Netflix, because of the short battery life. You won't make it though a whole movie.Because of it's price point, it does make a good tablet for kids (who can play without damaging the screen), adults who need something for basic uses and even grandma and grandpa who just want something to read emails on and play some Sudoku. It's a good little device, just keep in mind the short battery life.Sample provided for review", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy it For the Right Reasons", "Author": "K. Groh", "ReviewID": "R2QROU1ISR0PQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Kindle as well as a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. There is not a lot of comparison but there is also not the same price tag. But I mention it because this tablet lacks in some areas but definitely comes through in others.This is a $60 tablet so you should not expect it to function the same as a $300 one.After using this for a few weeks, here are my thoughts:* The tablet burns through battery usage when connected to the internet. If you want to have it last while you are using apps, turn off wi-fi* Wi-fi works fine for me. I had no trouble connecting and reconnecting.* While you can use it plugged in and charging, it does do some funny things at times especially with the onscreen keypad.* I was able to download apps from Google and Amazon Appstore. But it does have memory limits so you will not be playing it for big games or using it with complex apps.* The screen is adequate. The colors are off - a little big of a blue tint but again, clear enough for basic use and after awhile, you don't notice it.* Battery life is adequate. It does wear down quicker than my other tablets but it certainly lasts enough for a couple of hours before recharging.* It comes with a few widgets and basic apps and if you are used to an android system, it will look familiar. You can easily download some additional free apps.* It does have a camera which takes adequate pictures. Again, nothing like a high end camera or more expensive tablet.* The power button is in an awkward position so it is easy to tap it off while using the tablet. After awhile, you get used to its position and try to adapt how you hold it.* It is a basic 7\" tablet so it will fit into most tablet cases that have elastic grips.* My 9 year-old daughter has been using it a lot and is having a great time. Recommended for a responsible child as a first tablet.The bottom line: if you can only afford an inexpensive tablet, if you have a child that is always taking yours, if you just need a real basic model and don't want to invest a lot, then this is a good solution. If you are expecting the same quality and functionality of an iPad or Samsung, save up your money for when you can afford that price tag.I was provided a unit for evaluation and review.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "all 4 stopped working, wont load past android logo.", "Author": "sylvia", "ReviewID": "R3RQGWTOA4YQHE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 4 and all 4 stopped working, wont load past android logo. 3 stays on android logo and 1 shuts off after logo. has any1 else had this problem.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good tablet", "Author": "li-kaenemman", "ReviewID": "R1D2M3I6UVDTAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great buy for the cost but the only problem is the battery after fully charged will only last for half an hour.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "gift for mom", "Author": "K.

In this case, no branding is present at all lol. Check out this hardware dump from the one I purchased here. [...]Just about all information provided in the item listing is current inaccurate, I've submitted most of the changes to Amazon so hopefully they update that. Some key differences to note.*Internal storage is not 4GB, its confusing but its much lower.*Android version is a very buggy re-imagination of 4.1.1*Can take a SDHC card upto 32GB, SDCX upto 64GB*CPU is not the A13, while the clock speed is similar its not nearly as powerful, this device has a ARMv7 based CPU comparable to the iPhone 3GS if that helps you understand*The keyboard is very unresponsive and buggy, typing a simple letter is a real chore, you can trigger keys that are no where near the key you are actually pressing. Voice typing didn't seem to work at all for me.*Battery life is pretty terrible, I didn't break it open to check the mAh but it would be totally depleted in about an hour of actual use, say watching a movie or browsing the web. Standby is about double that, It went from 90% to 12% in about 90 minutes of sitting beside me with wifi enabled. Mind you this device doesn't support cellular or GPS or Bluetooth so the run-time is really pitiful.*Wireless is a bit annoying, it for some reason can not see a hidden network, if you don't broadcast the SSID you will not be able to connect. For me this is no good, I prefer the hidden networks with MAC address filtering.*Video was very choppy playing back 480p but its suppose to handle 1080p just fine, I guess playback is relative, it was playing but very very poorly.Overall, the price is not terrible for what you are getting, which is really not much at all. I'm sending it back because the entire list of features is inaccurate and for my needs it just won't cut it. Maybe get a Google Nexus 7 or something, it might cost you $199 but you will get the processing power of 10 of these tablets that choke during just about everything.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Four stars because of the super-low price", "Author": "R.
