The Ematic tablet does all of these functions well and has an easy user interface. It also has a microsd slot for adding up to 32 gigs memory. I am quite pleased with my purchase, but I don't use it for tons of apps. It works well for me.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far So good", "Author": "Shelly Hines", "ReviewID": "RNA33IR9C4TOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought 2 of these for my son and husband for Christmas gifts.  It was easy setup and operating out of the box.  My son has already added several apps, but like others is a bit disappointed in the lack of internal storage for apps.  He's moved what he can from the internal to the SD card to optimize the system. The audio & video streaming are smooth and fluid.  It does not appear so far to pause to catch up.  Both easily connected to our wireless router networks and neither have lost connection, which has been an issue with others we've had.  All in all, they are both happy with their tablets.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "a good value", "Author": "GoHawks", "ReviewID": "RLITR2C819VGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for a single purpose, to use while cooking to avoid having my iPhone sitting next to the stove or mixing bowl.  It performs that task well. I hoped it would be much more useful, it's not.  It may have Google Play store but MANY apps (Weather Channel, Food Network, Stitcher) are \"not compatible with this device\".  Not the end of the world since all those can be used via Chrome, which works fine but slooooww.  Display is good enough.  It would likely work fine as a music streaming device when hooked to speakers (Pandora and Sonza work fine).  Bottom line it's a $125 tablet, it is worth that but not much more.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "memory", "Author": "kyle thompson", "ReviewID": "R2HTH6V7CAXC3O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i put a 8 gb memory card in it and it would not save to it and it would just keep saying there is no room for storage", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good tablet for the price", "Author": "Adam Boles", "ReviewID": "R1MH7CNRUNKXYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The tablet can connect to wifi and has external storage capabilities. I also like how well tv shows or movies appear on it, since it has a separate processor for graphics.  The main problem with this tablet is that it operates with Android 4.1, while almost everything else with Jelly Bean is 4.1.2.  Unfortunately certain things do not work on it because of this.  The internal storage is also a little small for a tablet, but that might be just because it is bloated with Google apps.  However, I am happy with what it can do for the small price that it costs.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I DIG THIS!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1XGDDSUDKML4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product at the college today and I have been messing around with it for a couple hours now.

It is okay, but honestly I would probably buy a better brand next time as I am not too impressed with this item. It could just be that it was not what I needed? I feel it is really slow, but for a starter tablet it would be good for someone who would not use it as much as I do.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "it's ok", "Author": "thuyen", "ReviewID": "R98PXD2H995PA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i think for watch movie play game it's ok but volume small and sometime no good for touch screen when you  charge batterry", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Gray Geek \"grayhair geek\"", "ReviewID": "R18PIZMWXYNAL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought Ematic's 7 inch tablet in August, 2013.

Nice big screen, comes with Google Play installed, android 4.1, and easy to use & set up.  The main drawback for me is the memory allocated for apps.  There is not alot of space to install apps.  500 MB runs out fast when you start installing apps.  You can move some apps over to the sd card but most apps do not allow this.
