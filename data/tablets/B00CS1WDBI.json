{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as Good as Expected. Go IPad", "Author": "Architect82", "ReviewID": "RDEC13YNTG0L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas over much debate vs an iPad. At $160 it sounded great compared to the $500-$600 for the iPad air so we bought in.Overall the tablet seemed somewhat rugged out of the packaging but it's rubber looking housing is actually just plastic. Setup took about an hour with all of the required updates and registration. We set our parental controls which was more work to use to access the App Store then we anticipated.The free game/app included was very \"low budget\". We expected it \"the ultra\" to have a few more bells and whistles out of the box. For example, the camera quality is not great nor is the processing power as we experienced delays when using functions as simple as the art studio. Although the sensitivity of the ultra was said to be far better then the leap pad 2 when we read in reviews, it still seemed way too unresponsive to the stylus than we would want.The biggest disappointment and primary reason we returned this product was the price of games and apps. The cheapest we saw for our daughters age was a discounted bundle pack that cost $40 for 4 apps. Most apps/games were priced at $25 each for the newer ones. You buy a couple of games/apps on the ultra and before you know it you paid more for a kid only tablet than an iPad full of better 99 cent apps.  One other disappointment was the newly added wifi that constantly kept disconnecting (was not the wifi itself as all of our other household products worked).Amazon was great at taking back the returned tablet and issuing our refund extremely fast. We will now purchase an iPad for our daughter  which we can all use in our household, will purchase a durable case, a bunch of apps that will still come out cheaper in the end. Our only challenge will be monitoring constantly on the internet with an iPad as content issues may occur when she gets older. As others reviewers have said, I can easily see the leap pad ultra being another toy in the bottom of the toy box.The Ultra may be a good fit for your household but vs the iPad we feel it is apples to oranges when it comes to educating and ease of use for our daughter.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Product", "Author": "Claude A.

Wanted him to have something that was tough enough to stand up to him and was only his so he wouldn't have to give up the iPad anymore when someone needed to use it. I honestly haven't gotten a chance to even sit down and check out the apps on this thing because he has been playing with it that much. So he seems to love it. One caveat though. There is definitely extra costs to this thing. Since the Leapfrog app store is totally proprietary you are paying serious prices for those apps, when you first activate the device you get a one day only coupon for 30% off, bought a bundle of 10 apps for $50-ish dollars and so far that's keeping the nephew occupied, but I'm sure that at some point he will want more apps and apps cost between $7 and $25. So they are way more expensive than on the app store or Google play store. I suppose you could get the same effect on any tablet if you really configured the parental controls and carefully chose the apps, but you are paying a premium to be 100% assured that everything on here is kid friendly.So TL;DRPros:1. Easy set up.2. Completely kid friendly with no additional precautions needed. Not even a chance of downloading anything bad as the web browser runs through a leapfrog branded portal that controls all websites.3. The tablet itself is actually pretty cheap for what you are getting. A rugged, decently powerful device that is completely navigable by a child. Super easy to learn if they haven't played with a smart phone before.4. Bought him headphones for it and now he finally has an activity that he loves to do that is actually quiet.Cons:1. Not a lot included. There are maybe like 4 apps on it out of the box? One of which you have to download. So expect to drop some extra coin on other stuff.2. Literally everything except the tablet and a charger is an extra. There is a cartridge slot on the device. Seems like it wouldn't have broken the bank for them to provide at least a demo cart with some short games/stories.3. The apps are not cheap. Most are in the $15-$20 range.4. The cartridges are about the same price if not a bit more and from what I can tell, of similar length/complexity to the apps.5. Evil Space Devil packaging. I'm serious, I laughed when I read this in other reviews, but the box on this thing is ridiculous and operates counterintuitively to all previously known box logic. Their are like 23 pieces of tape on the thing that I cut and they had no effect on speeding the release of the contents of the box. The box is made by space devils.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "All around awesome Tablet for kids!", "Author": "Meghan Cooper", "ReviewID": "R33V928V7IGG6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got the original LeapPad when it came out and my daughter loved it. So I was excited when LeapFrog sent us the Ultra to try out and review. There are tons of differences between the two models and LeapFrog really outdid itself this time. The two main things I love about the Ultra are the bigger screen and the Wifi capabilities. But there are lots of things that the Ultra has that the LeapPad and LP2 do not have it all!Some of those things are: Built in MP3 player, 800Mhtz faster processor, 8GB of on-board memory, 480p video recording, 11 apps included ($80 value), built in lithium ion battery, peer-to-peer play, wifi kid-safe web, and the 7 inch touch screen.Let's start with the Wifi with the Kid-safe web search capabilities. It's called LeapSearch and it's powered by Zui. If you aren't familiar with Zui, it's a website designed for children. A safe way to watch YouTube videos, game online video games. The internet is scary and not made for kids, so Zui makes it safe! Everything that shows up in the LeapSearch is reviewed by parents and teachers to make sure it's safe for the kids to view. I have a very curious kid so when she wants to know what a guinea pig is, she can search it and find pictures to help answer that question!I love all the apps and games available for the LeapPad systems because every one of them has an educational component to them. Plus, you can download or use the cartridges. We have the Tag and LeapReader also so reading is huge in our house. It's nice when she can do everything from reading, writing and playing right on the Ultra. Makes long road trips a breeze! Peer-to-peer playing makes it fun for siblings too. They can play games like Tic-Tac-Toe together on their own devices!I'm extremely happy about the lithium ion battery also. I went through batteries in our LeapPad like crazy. Now we can just recharge at night like we do our cell phones.We normally play on an iPad but I worry about her playing on there and the parental locks are really terrible. I'm constantly looking over her shoulder to make sure she isn't surfing the internet. I'm much happier with her using the Ultra for playing. The parent controls give me peace of mind.So my final thoughts...spring for the Ultra. The upgrades are totally worth it!Here are some free LeapFrog explorer codes for you:The Book of Super Awesome Stuff (e-book): 5813 1140 1518 1413Alphabet Stew (game): 5813 0790 4610 4973", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a definite winner!", "Author": "bmj", "ReviewID": "R2WYOOSD7K4NBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great learning tool and our grandson who is now 4 loves it.

Mellott \"simplybudgeted\"", "ReviewID": "RYGYFJ1PGIWD3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I admit I wasn't sure what to expect with the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra. Our kids have the Leapsters (I know they are old but buying three of everything gets expensive!) and they love the games they can play on those. They also love my iPad and have practically claimed as it their own.When we got this, I charged it up. Our four year old saw it and he wanted to play with it so I figured I would let him try it without any help. I watched him figure out to play the games without any hesitation. His only question is how to turn it on (and he still asks as the button on the side seems to confuse him.)We also have an almost six year old and seven year old. Since the four year old took the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra so easily I thought the seven year old would find it boring but she doesn't. A device that all three of them love is a huge success for us. They have been working well on sharing it so that is an added bonus in our house.Compared to the iPad, I love that the content is all for them and I don't have to worry about getting to other apps that maybe I downloaded on my phone and went to the iPad too ... they don't need the shopping apps for sure!The four year old like the Scaredy Cat in the Spooky Woods game. Pet Pad Party is a favorite for our seven year old who is on level 5 of the game already. Our almost six year old likes the art studio and the fact that she can take pictures with the LeapPad Ultra.The pros are that all the kids love it. We are currently debating if we will get a second one to have since it is enjoyed so much at our house. I also appreciate that it has a wall charger and doesn't run on batteries or battery packs. The screen size is great and the color on the screen is bright and crisp.The only cons are the button placements for the younger age range of this product  (Our older kids don't seem to have a problem finding them.) and the quality of the camera isn't great but you can see what you taking pictures of well enough for the art projects.Note: I received this product as part of a promotional program with LeapFrog but all opinions are my own.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "LeapPad Ultra", "Author": "J.

I was very impressed with those so I was excited when I was offered to review the new LeapPad Ultra.The LeapPad Ultra is a kids tablet with games, wifi, videos, ebooks, music, and access to over 800+ apps.We were sent the green one to review, they also come in pink and blue. It comes pre-loaded with 11 apps and a code for a free app of your choice. Plus if you already own a LeapPad all the games that you already bought will work on the LeapPad Ultra. So you don't need to buy a whole new library of games. Plus they are so easy to add on with the wifi.The best part to me about the tablet is it is so sturdy and almost indestructible because of the tablet frame. Kids love playing games and watching movies with adults phones and tablets but I hate handing them over because they get dropped on the floor and can get badly damaged. Also there are apps on there that I don't want them using or they can accidentally delete.The screen is bright and very big (7 inches) and the speaker is surprisingly loud for a small tablet speaker.There is the option to make up to three accounts on the tablet for your children in the Profile Manager where you fill in your child's name, grade, birthday and gender. You also can control what type of content each child can use.The only downside I found was the LeapPad Ultra turns off after not being used for about 4 minutes. This helps conserve battery life, but having to keep logging in over and over again can get a little annoying.Overall the tablet is a great tool for any child and I don't have to worry about my devices being damaged anymore.*I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

My children love playing their learning games on my phone, kindle and computer.  The thing I did not like about them having access to those devices is the unseen content they had access to on the internet (purchasing apps, linked pages, etc).I was sent the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra to review and the boys immediately loved it.  The leappad itself doesn't come with any extra apps, games or ebooks.  That will be purchased as an extra Christmas gift.However, for a SAFE LEARNING tablet for my two younger boys (ages 5&4) this is a great way to encourage them to LEARN while still PLAYING and having FUN!The LeapFrog Ultra comes with 10 apps. When you register your device, you will be able to get an additional app for free (from a list of 3). I like that it allowed you to choose your last app based on your child's wants and needs.The tablet is super easy to set up and create a unique profile (with photo) of each individual child.The device comes with many things loaded straight from the box, so you may want to set it up before you purchase anything. Included was:10 songs (2 albums of 5)Art StudioVoice MemoPet ChatPetPhoto FunClock (which also works as an alarm clock and to teach time)Calendar (learn about dates, days, etc) You can also add birthdays and other events.CalculatorNotepadIt does NOT come with any books, so that may be something to load right away. It comes with games only if that is what you selected as your 11th app, so games may also be something you want to purchase. You save 30% for registering your device, plus LeapFrog has buy 3 get the 4th free often.The device is sturdy and seems to so far stand up to falls well. My boys has been enjoying the \"green kindle\", and hopefully will not mind now that Jack (our elf) will be bringing them SCHOOL games/apps to load on to the LeapPad! :)I received the LeapFrog Ultra for review purposes from LeapFrog and MomSelect.

Scout helped my 12 year old handicap son learn to spell his name!  We love LeapFrog's products, and was not disappointed with the LeapPad Ultra.One thing I didn\u2019t like much about the earlier LeapPad's was connecting to the computer to download apps.  I really appreciate that LeapFrog took that into consideration - No More Connecting To The Computer!I also really appreciate the 9 hour rechargeable battery, because my son with cerebral palsy is wheelchair bound, and loves playing on the LeapPad. We recently learned about my son's love for technology, and LeapFrog products have helped him more than anything we have tried, or the teachers have done at school.  The LeapPad Ultra makes him want to try things that might be a little difficult.  He\u2019s working on his fine motor skills, trying to do new things, and listening to everything that's said.  He doesn't focus on many things the way he has LeapFrog products, and he's amazed with the LeapPad Ultra!  He loves using the art studio app, listening to music, playing games, and just maneuvering around on the LeapPad Ultra. It's easy for him to hold, lightweight, and the touchscreen responds easily for him.My 3 year old loves the LeapPad Ultra too! She enjoys the interactive storybooks, several of the creativity apps, reading and writing apps, racing games, and jamming out to the KIDZ BOP Christmas Party Hits music app.  Watching her use the LeapPad Ultra has been great.  She knows where everything is, and has no trouble getting where she needs to.  Thankfully, there is awesome parental controls.My 7 year old also has really enjoyed the peer to peer games.  She can play with her cousin (or anyone else with a LeapPad Ultra) using LeapFrog virtual pets, and characters.  She uses the pre-loaded app, PetChat so she can text using the apps pre-selected phrases to her cousin.  They also play the Turbo Racing game against each other, since they are on the same network.  Thanks LeapFrog for the WiFi!The LeapPad Ultra is lightweight, easy to hold, has a nice design, and has an awesome 7\u201d hi-res screen.  I have found the LeapPad Ultra to be an awesome product, and plan on purchasing another one for my two girls to share.  My son needs his own, he doesn\u2019t want to share and since he\u2019s wheelchair bound I would rather him play with an educational device, and he's really working hard.  Thank you LeapFrog, I wish you could see how much your products have helped, and continue to help my son!!I know the LeapPad Ultra is for kids 4-9, but I really found it to be fun for the whole family.  I even catch my 15 year old playing around on it now and again, and her and my toddler will dance to the KIDZ BOP Christmas tunes we have on it.  I have played a few games, and my husband spends time helping my 3 year old play games all the time.The LeapPad Ultra is a great device that provides kids with endless amounts of entrainment and education wrapped up in one.  LeapFrog send me a LeapPad Ultra for review, but all opinion are my own.  I really think the LeapPad Ultra is an awesome device, that offers kids endless amounts of entertainment, and it\u2019s educational too\u2026 So the kids are learning while doing something they enjoy.

You would think that they could at least make it a little bit faster considering how much you pay for it. The Apps Store just plain SUCKS!

Yes, she definitely liked it. No doubt about it. But as I was afraid she loved her sister's Kindle...OK, let's see... The LeapPad is louder than the Kindle. Oh, it's also more colorful than the Kindle. It's more \"educational\" than the Kindle. Well, I can keep going but I think you got the picture.Now, a few weeks after seeing the kids engaging with both devices I just want to share my thoughts with other parents and how I feel about my decision. And basically all I have to say I think this thing has more cons than pros. For instance:- The apps are ridiculously expensive. LeapFrog does promotions all the time but still the apps are very expensive. There's no such thing as a single digit app. Everything is expensive. I bought 3 Disney games averaging $20/each.- The device is slow. Period. Kids have even less patience than adults. And everything here takes a while to load. If you get too anxious and keep clicking and touching it just make things worse. It kinda hangs or slows down even more.- This thing is heavy. I thought my iPad 3 was heavy. This is heavier. Hello!?!??! This is for kids!!!! It's heavier than all previous LeapFrog products we owned (Leapster, Leapster 2, etc).To summarize, it's OK. I really like LeapFrog products, I think they have a lot of value in terms of education. But I think this device could be a lot better than it actually is.My suggestion? Go to a B&M; store and have your kid play with it if possible... And then do the same - play with it for a few minutes. In my opinion a Kindle HD 7 inch is a much better deal and it gives you a decent mix of games and educational stuff and I wish I had bought 2 of them instead. I hope LeapFrog start making more apps for IOS and start doing Android devices as well. I would rather buy their apps for other platforms than for their own...

I mean to the point where he carries this thing everywhere and I have actually started rationing his time with it.  It is the perfect leap pad for a toddler.  Super super easy to figure out.  I charged it and set everything up before Christmas for him and it only took me like 10 minutes to completely set up for him and his little brother.  They each have profiles set up and the parent view is easy to access as well to make purchases and tweak different settings.  I thought it would be painfully slow to do anything since it is a kid's tablet.  But to my surprise it wasn't. He never gets frustrated when switching to another app and it really didn't take too long to download games from the app store either.  I just went to the parent view, unlocked, shopped for games, downloaded and put the tablet up for 1/2 hr or so while sit downloaded and came back and everything was done.  This is a sturdy tablet.  It has been dropped, stepped on, juice spilled on it, it's still going.  I like that it has a \"pen\" that is attached to it with a special slot for it so he can draw and manipulate the screen.  There are tons of songs and videos he can watch and what's best is they are all positive and educational.  Not like on youtube where everything has to be screened.  He played with my kindle fire all of the time before and now has forgotten all about it.  He loves his little tablet.  As for the pictures-- are they the highest quality?  No.  But they're good enough for him.  Sometimes come out grainy but often times the pictures look pretty good.  It comes with a few apps that you choose and then you have to buy more.  My only gripe is apps are expensive for this.  As in like $20 each.  But they are more involved then some silly app I get on my phone for free to keep him entertained for all of 10 minutes.

If my son was 8 or older I would probably have preferred an iPad. I also think this product will prove to be more durable than the iPad, which is great since kids tend to be destructive.

The LeapPad Ultra is a significant upgrade in every aspect, and if you\u2019ve already got an assortment of LeapPad cartridges, it makes the debate of upgrading even easier. (BTW - my child is 5.)Here\u2019s whats new and improved.-The screen on the LeapPad Ultra is now 7\u201d vs 5\u201d with a higher resolution too ( 1024x600 vs 480x272). It is also brighter, has better color, and the touchscreen is more responsive too.-The processor has been upgraded to 800 MHz processor vs 500 MHz and you can definitely notice the difference, although the load time on startup and some apps still is longer than I would like.-The storage has been upgraded to 8 GB vs 4 GB, always a good thing.-The camera is now 2 megapixel vs 1.2 megapixel, but the quality is still just \u201cok\u201d for a kids tablet.-The LeapPad Ultra has a built in rechargeable battery rated at 9 hours of use which is so much better than having to replace AA batteries.-The LeapPad Ultra also features a special kid-safe Wi-Fi which can be used to download new apps and games and also \u201csurf\u201d certain LeapPad-approved content. Definitely one of my favorite new features since I no longer have to plug the LeapPad into my computer to download content.One thing that has stayed consistent is LeapFrog\u2019s build quality. Our LeapPad has taken a lot of tumbles and still works as good as it did when we got it. The LeapPad Ultra is definitely larger and heavier due to the larger screen and built-in battery, but still feels just as durable.It would be great if LeapPad offered some free content to better compete with the Android and Apple app stores, as the prices of the LeapPad apps and games is a lot more than their competition.Overall the LeapPad Ultra is a great upgrade with the larger screen, rechargeable battery (LOVE THIS), and built-in Wi-Fi sure to make any kid happy.* I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

This is the first Leap Frog tablet we have ever owned so as a newbie the tablet was easy to set up. I got my kids profiles all set up and made and immediately blocked them from having the ability to purchase apps in the app store. This was a key feature for me and something I LOVE! No accidental purchases at our house! Speaking of the app store - the apps are crazy expensive, so that is a little bit of an issue. They will make good rewards or goals for my kids, we won't be just buying them freely since they cost so much. BUT I do love that the apps have age recommendations with them so I know which ones are appropriate for each of my kids. BONUS if you search on the internet you can find 2 free app codes, which is super nice!I love that there is a stylus attached to the LeapPad, although it was obviously built for a right handed person. My children are right handed so they don't find it awkward to use, but as a left handed person I find it a tad awkward to use the stylus because of tugging at the cord.I love the 7 inch screen. It is a nice size. The body of the tablet also seems nice and sturdy and while I won't go dropping it on purpose, it seems it would be able to stand up to the wear and tear the kids will put on it.I LOVE the front and rear cameras.

My kids love the preloaded photo fun app to play with the pictures they take of each other.I love that although it is connected to my home WiFi it is kid safe.

At 7 inches, the screen is a nice size and provides a clear picture. She loves using the camera and included apps, especially the Pet Pad Party.  She is even learning to tell time from the clock app. One of the best features is the attached stylus. What a brilliant idea, now the kids wont lose it anymore!Also, love the web feature...she likes to watch kids shows and music on youtube but as you can imagine I am always concerned it could jump to other content.  The fact that she can browse the web herself and see videos and such on the LeapPad gives her a sense of independence, while I don't have to worry about her seeing any inapproprate content.Another great feature is that you dont need batteries and can just use the included charger.  With other kids electronics, I felt I was always changing the batteries, so this is definitely a nice change! And when fully charged the battery lasts a long time!The only downside is that the apps are expensive....they range from $5 to $25, so while my daughter used to ask to buy a few apps at a time on our ipad (usually free or $1.99) I had to explain to her she couldn't add apps as often to the LeapPad.Overall, its an awesome product for kids!!I was provided a sample of the LeapPad Ultra through a review program.

I am sending back to purchase her a Kindle Fire, only logical solution right!", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lousy Customer Service and Unreliable Product", "Author": "Monica Lynch", "ReviewID": "R1CVTPNJ1Q4X2D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought the LeapPad Ultra for our daughter for Christmas. It shut off and did not turn on again later that day. In full disclosure-I believe it had been dropped at some point BUT it was working after that, AND if a product designed for 5 year olds can't handle that then, well.....Contacted LP and they said to pack it up and return it for testing. We did so. We packed everything up in the original packaging and including the email regarding the incident and the fact that at one point it turned back on again only to turn itself off. I call last week to check on the status and they said they would get back to me. I received an email saying it had been tested (not fixed) and was working fine. Came home Friday evening to a box from UPS, all that was inside was the LP itself wrapped in bubble wrap, no USB cable, or charger, NOTHING. I finally realize I can charge it with our LP2 cable and do so. Works fine for awhile then keeps shutting itself off. Saturday morning, fully charged, it turns off again and doesn't turn back on. Of course I tried contacting LF on why they had sent it back without anything, but had to send an email ( which actually has yet to be responded to ) because customer service closes at 3PM Friday-Monday. We just want a product that works. So I call Monday. AND today. All they can tell me is that it worked when they tested it and if a product works they won't replace it. So we need to send it back AGAIN?! Problem is, it doesn't work, I keep getting the run around and no one can tell me WHY it was sent back they way it was. I tried explaining to the various representatives that I just want a new one, that I don't trust them to \"fix\" after the last time AND the way it was sent back. My poor daughter has been without her big gift from Santa :( I would actually return the damn thing if I could. This doesn't seem like a company that respects the customer or stands by their product.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Waste of Time and Money", "Author": "Tamara Ramsundar \"trinicat\"", "ReviewID": "R1CU4MNCMX33TS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed with this LeapPad Ultra, as a matter of fact, I got upset when my wife bought this for my daughter. It is very limited as to what your child can do. We should have bought a regular tablet. The 11 stupid apps you get with this device, trust me, your child will get bored with it. Where the hell are free apps. We get a few stupid free apps when we purchased this device and my daughter who is 4 barely pics up the device. We are seeing a whole lot of sports videos...and adult crap when we go to view videos etc....what the hell is a 4 year old from the caribbean doing watching ice freaking hockey etc... She is into her Kids Videos and watching her disney shows. I wish i can just throw this out. How the hell do you get LP$ to purchase apps. Every tablet maker has free apps at their app store except you all. Full of crap! This device is useless.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "We love Leappad Ultra!", "Author": "momofthree", "ReviewID": "R3NZDKPJJBG62R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our big kids (6, 3) each received one as a Christmas gift this past year in anticipation for a long trip.  What a life saver!  Kept them preoccupied for most of the drive to and from, and restaurant outings were a breeze.  Highly recommend headphones for car trips so parents can have peace while kids play on.Our oldest had the original Leappad which she could never play because our younger child would literally beat her up to get his hands on it.  So it is great that each has their own now.  The larger display and faster processor is very nice.  Love it that it connects wirelessly for updates because connecting via USB was cumbersome.  Bright idea to tether the stylus to the device.  Kids love the front and rear camera.  They enjoy playing tic tac toe together wirelessly.  But for me, the best is that it now has a built in lithium battery.  I despised having to charge, replace, and recharge those rechargeable batteries!  Yay, so happy that is a thing of the past!!We considered getting them iPad mini's, but we would be so upset if they broke them!  The Leappad is a durable kid tablet.  Also, its nice that they can't visit any old website.  A few months ago I noticed pop up advertisements for American Horror Story coming up as my three year old watched Lightening McQueen videos on Youtube on our iPad.  Needless to say, I was mortified!  Additionally, as nice as it is that there are so many free games out there for the iPad, kids get so confused and frustrated at the locked features/areas that can only be unlocked by purchasing or the pop up ads for other recommended games.  We ended up with loads of useless games the kids accidentally installed and charges for accidentally purchased games when we forgot to lockdown our iPad.I absolutely love the content Leappad develops.  The kids love the recognizable characters the games are based on.  Best of all, they really learn stuff and they think learning is fun!  Whenever my daughter spouts out a new fact about something, like the sun is a star or killer whales can eat sharks, she says she learned it from her Leappad.  The games are pricey at retail price, but during the holidays most of them go on sale.  I picked up several at $9.99 and the My Little Pony game at $6.99 this year!  Just stock up then and give out for good grades or improved behavior throughout the year.The Zui search engine is not like the ones on a computer.  It is category based like music, animals, science, etc with no way to type in a web address or search outside of the designated categories.  So it is very secure and limited.So overall, we really like our decision to stick with Leappad.  It makes sense for us and our kids right now.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding.", "Author": "Clark", "ReviewID": "R23PW2ZPWTZSLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 3 1/2 year old grandson loves his \"iPad\" as he calls it.
