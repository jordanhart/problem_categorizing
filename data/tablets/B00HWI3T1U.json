I looked online for hours, and think this was the best deal for the price. It's fast, HD, not to old of and Android version. Charging it is a little annoying. It takes awhile to charge via the USB charger, or USB w/ wall outlet charger. The charge lasts a long time though. I recommend shutting it down for the night or when not in use for awhile, because it uses a lot of juice still when it's on sleep mode. Excellent tablet for the price. I was seeing $200 tablets that had worse specs than this. I spent $185 for a tablet 2 years ago, and this is 10 times better, for almost half the price. Time will tell how it stands up long term.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for reasonable price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1BEMNRCV3OL29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We finally bought Toshiba tablets that were on sale after going through the mistake of trying cheap brand tablets. I waited a month before reviewing our purchases and am pleased. Easy set up, the battery life is decent and I'm able to password protect it so the children have to have permission to get on them. There is glare on the screen when sitting near a window or outdoors but assume a screen protector might help with that.Should have gone with this tablet in the first place.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Excite 7 inch", "Author": "Delores C, Nickerson", "ReviewID": "R23I35JE0F1X4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my old tablet, bit the dust  looked it up on AMAZON  and  there it was, jut what I was looking for a nice7 inch tablet---again  THANKS", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value tablet", "Author": "Glafiro Guerrero \"GG\"", "ReviewID": "R166QML3X9FI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality at an unbeatable price, able to download most Android apps, easy to navigate and set up, reliable tablet by a trusted brand.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "D.
