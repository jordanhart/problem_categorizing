{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome product after you install the latest update from Viewsonic", "Author": "Tony.A", "ReviewID": "RVECOCVGBVJ3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So after I spent a couple of days exploring my new Viewsonic G tablet, I felt like I had to write a review and let everybody know how cool this device is:I did my homework and researched the G tablet thoroughly before I decided to buy one.  I read tons of reviews on various websites before I finally decided to go for it (over an iPad) for the following reasons:1. Price!2. Super fast Hardware (Tegra2 processor)3. USB Port4. SD card slot for additional storage5. No need for a sync software!6. Access to the file system7. Customizable desktop (live wallpaper, widgets, icons..etc)8. The availability of custom firmwares (XDA-developers)Note: I ended up NOT installing a custom firmware, I am pretty happy with the latest update from Viewsonic, which is a must have!!The tablet was a horrible experience out of the box.  No matter what I did, everything seemed to just crash!!  Then I got the Update notification as soon as I connected my G Tablet to my home WiFi.  After the download was done, the update installed and the device rebooted. I finally went through the setup process (create a new profile..etc) and Voila.  Let me tell you, The update is pretty damn stable and seems to boost performance significantly.The latest update from Viewsonic lets you choose between the crappy TapNTap interface and the standard Android 2.2 interface.Flash: I got Flash working by simply downloading a Flash .apk (Android application) available on Viewsonic's website. YouTube never looked better!!USB: I tested the USB port by connecting a thumb drive.  The drive was recognized without problems.  Got a decent data transfer rate (~3 Mbps).  I also connected a physical USB keyboard. The G Tablet recognized it almost immediately.SD card slot: I also tested the SD card slot with a 4 GB SD card. no problems there! I love copying media files over to my G Tablet by simply dragging them from my PC and dropping them on my G Tablet!! Good Bye iTunes!!Bluetooth: I was able to pair my G Tablet with my Bluetooth headphones.  Also, I was able to get Google Maps to connect to an old Bluetooth GPS receiver I had purchased a couple of years ago (you will need an app called BlueGPS for this).WiFi: Connected to my home WiFi without issues.Webcam: The built-in webcam is good enough, may not be the best but it's good enough for me (1.3 MP).Screen: The touch screen is pretty responsive.  Yes it does get fingerprints but that's the case with my iPhone too!! The viewing angles aren't the best on this device.  They aren't as bad as other reviewers had described though. it only gets bad when you tilt the tablet away from you in landscape mode.  I found a cool way to get a better viewing angle: turn the tablet up-side-down!! the desktop will not rotate though but apps will.Media: Tested a few videos with different formats.  The tablet couldn't play a VOB.  AVI's and mpeg's played fine.  Performance is amazing thanks to the Tegra2 processor. My favorite music library stored on the SD card got recognized just fine and imported into the device's music library.Web browser: unmatched browsing experience with the stock browser. Pinching and double tapping work great for zooming in/out. I can't stress enough how easy the virtual keyboard is to use! And it has spelling suggestions too!Apps: Out of the Box, the G Tablet doesn't support the Android market but it does offer an alternative which is Handango. I was able to find almost every app I wanted and for free: Google Maps, Pandora, file browser, weather channel,  Skype...etc.  To install the app, simply download the .apk to your G tablet and execute it.Mail:  I was able to setup my Hotmail account in less than a minute. The Contacts app lets you import all your Gmail contacts to your G Tablet.  If you have a Hotmail account you can simply create a Gmail account, import you Hotmail contacts to Gmail (web) then import from Gmail to your G Tablet.Battery: battery life is Excellent. I browse the Net while listening to Pandora radio (yes, multitasking!!! ) for hours.In summary, I love my new G tablet.  I highly recommend it.  Wait until you have installed the latest update from Viewsonic before judging it!Thank you Amazon for such an awesome product at such an awesome price! Got mine for $359.99 :)Note: I have been updating this review as I come across new features.***Update 06/15/2011***I have flashed my G Tablet with a custom ROM: Vegan Gingerbread (Google it).  The reason for this is to have full access to Android market.  Note that the stock firmware works just fine so you don't really need to flash a custom ROM if you don't want to.Also, I thought I'd share that there are currently at least two Honeycomb ROM's being developed by the XDA folks.  They're still in alpha but fairly stable.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Next gen hardware, but the software needs improvement", "Author": "roebeet", "ReviewID": "R2NA7V81UU88CD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After mulling over the Archos 101 back in October, and increasingly frustrated with their delays, I found this gem in my local SEARS.  It has a Nvidia Tegra 2 chipset, which you will probably be hearing about increasingly in 2011.  A really nice device overall, but it's not without its faults which I will summarize.  First, the hardware....Hardware Pros:- Tegra 2 chipset dual-core with 512MB RAM.  Bleeding edge hardware, so much that the software has not caught up, yet (see more on that, below).- MicroSD slot, which supports up to 32GB.- A full USB port. You can hook up peripheral devices to it, such as a USB keyboard.- Micro USB port (not proprietary) , for mounting to your PC.  Forgot your cable and you're at a friends house?  No worries, just use any micro USB and you are in.- Front facing camera.  It's not the best, but it works.Hardware Cons:- The LCD.  Yes, ironic given that this is packaged by a company known for its displays.  The 1024x600 10 inch screen is essentially a netbook screen.  It's actually not bad at all when looking at it straight on, but the viewing angles are not very good.  This is critical if you were planning on using this as a gaming device where you'll be moving it around.- h264 support is limited.  This is confusing to some, as technically h264 works in certain configurations.  1080p \"high profile\" encoded videos do not work, whereas \"main profile\" does work.  The bottom line here is that you might find issues with certain high-def videos that will be very choppy or flat out crash the device.  My understanding is that this is a limitation of the Tegra 2 chipset itself.The hardware is very impressive, overall.  However, where this device loses a full point is the software that is supplied out-of-the-box.  Although it's Android based, the stock launcher is replaced with a interface called \"Tap N' Tap\", which is actually a third party vendor.  I don't particularly like the interface myself - it's slow, buggy with a tendency to \"Force Close\" very often, and the Marketplace that's been recently added is very different than the Android Marketplace you might be used to on your phone (and not in a good way).  Overall, it's just plain bad.If you are technically inclined or don't mind thinking outside the box, there are already several alternate firmware replacements for the device that can be found by Googling \"Viewsonic G Tablet xda-developers\". These mods can turn the device into something you are more familiar with, if you use an Android phone.  But, keep in mind that these alterations are not supported by Viewsonic and you could void your warranty.  So buyer beware.The other major problem is that Android itself is not built for tablets, yet.  But version 2.3 is about to be released, which could change things considerably in the next few months.  Whether or not the GTablet eventually gets an official 2.3 release, or a more Android-looking interface that is fully supported by Viewsonic is anyone's guess at this point - so, just know what you are getting into.12/21/10 EDIT:  The next official firmware slated for release this week by VS should allow the user to bypass the Tap N' Tap homescreen, and use a more vanilla Android interface.  This is a step in the right direction, imo.04/17/11 EDIT:  I've gotten some heat for the title of \"Next Gen Hardware\".  Remember, this was written in December - that's an eternity in technology terms.  The GPU is actually still up-to-date as of this writing, but Android devices with better screens are starting to show up (ie. the Xoom and soon the Transformer).  So just keep in mind when this review was written....04/23/11 EDIT:  I'm hearing reports that these new Amazon GTablets MIGHT be arriving with the latest Viewsonic firmware - this firmware adds a lockscreen, Adobe Flash and French / Spanish languages and a few other things.  You can tell if you have this new firmware if you go into Settings -- About Tablet and check the TapUI version -- \"1.2\" means the new firmware, and \"1.1\" means the old firmware.If you have a \"1.2\" firmware, please be careful with mods on XDA (as of this writing) as they are generally built around the \"1.1\" firmware, only.  Or, alternatively, you can try the few 1.2-based mods at Slatedroid (just Google \"Slatedroid Gtablet 1.2\" and you'll find them).  You can downlevel your firmware from 1.2 to 1.1 - but there is a small chance that you could soft-brick your device, especially if you don't read directions carefully - there are specific steps to take.  Just be careful, and have fun with your new tablet!7/28/2011 EDIT:  VS has recently stated that there will be no Honeycomb support for the GTAB.  However, there are unofficial mods on both XDA and Slatedroid.com, if you are willing to risk it and void your warranty of course.  And 1.2 based firmware has become much more common on XDA, since April.  If you do plan to mod your GTAB, just be aware of the differences between these branches so you don't risk a soft-brick.2/10/2012 EDIT:  There is a new update (build 5699) for the Gtablet that's now live, but still Froyo-based.  However, Viewsonic has now officially (and since this is now a week old I'm guessing there's no going back) moved to a 1.2 firmware base.  Again, I would be wary of any older mods that are 1.1-based as you could soft-brick your tablet.  But, given that this has been a known factor for almost a year now, hopefully most of the mods have taken this into consideration - best to read the mod's release notes to be certain.Also, there is an unofficial ICS beta for the Gtablet, care of TeamDRH (teamdrh.com will get you to their site).  As with any mod, use at your own risk but for a beta product I've found it to be fairly stable.  Kudos to that team for their hard work!", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sweat Equity Pays Off with Viewsonic G Tablet", "Author": "Alexc", "ReviewID": "R1HPR4IRRJEJU2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own a G Tablet.  I like my G Tablet.  Let me tell you why no-one is raving about the G Tablet.The electronics exceed the iPad at time of writing.  The form factor is nothing to write home about.  The viewing angles on the screen are sub-par, which is surprising given the device's provenance.  The Tap n' Tap user interface is a disaster.  I say again, a disaster.  Slow, inelegant, and insufficient.There is good news.  First, the price is right.  It can be had for as little as $380.00, a far cry from its competitors.  Second, the user interface can be replaced.  There are communities of individuals (XDA), who have very graciously put their hard work and talent into producing replacement ROMs for this device which override the existing software with something that is much closer to the standard Android OS and that interfaces correctly with the Android App Market.  It is DIY, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-dig-into-it work to install a new ROM and get it running properly.  Even then there will be charming bugs to fix.  Expect this to become a minor hobby.In conclusion, the G Tablet is a conditionally five-star device.  It is inexpensive, the hardware is perfectly solid, and a technically minded individual who is willing to spend some time tinkering with it can turn it into a very useful tool.If you are Viewsonic, or work for Viewsonic, or know somebody who's cousin might work at Viewsonic, then please tell them; ditch Tap n' Tap as soon as humanly possible.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid tablet, but with caveat", "Author": "tobor \"8th Man\"", "ReviewID": "RHAZ4VZCWBR3I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit in Dec 2010.  Out of the box, the unit is horrible.  The software that Viewsonic loads it with is slow, clunky, and really unusable.  However, it is extremely simple to flash any number of Android roms on the device. This gives the device FULL Android functionality and, perhaps more importantly, speeds the device up far beyond other tablets.  I highly encourage potential buyers to search the internet for videos showing the device running other roms (there are also videos explaining exactly how to load the roms on the device).The only other downside to this unit is the screen.  When viewed straight-on it looks fine, however if viewed at an angle it does not.  But for about $200 less than a comparable iPad you'll still have a device that runs blazingly fast, has Android market access, and the power of Android...if you take the time to load a rom on it.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Viewsonic - Great tablet", "Author": "John H. Eickhoff", "ReviewID": "R2VLR0TA4V8TUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this for 2 weeks now.  I also own a Ipad 2 (wifi).  Both have there pluses and minus.  I find I only use the Gtablet.  The Ipad just sits there or my wife is uses it.  If I had to do it over I would have bought 2 gtablets.  It would have cost the same as 1 IPAD.I had read many reviews of the gtablet and alot talked about installing custom roms.  I will say that is no longer necessary to have a great tablet.  I played with one back in 2010 before the updates and found its interface was bad and it was sluggish.  Since the system updates it performs great.  Viewsonic allowed you to choose between there customer interface and a standard android interface.  The custom interface is now responsive although useless.  The standard android interface is great.  Everything flows well there are not lags.  They allowed youI have decided not to go with one of the custom roms (at least until a 3.0 version comes out.The Pros1) Price.  At 299 there is nothing that competes with it.2) Touch Screen.  Very responsive3) Flash.  It has flash.  I believe the latest update officially added it to the build but it was available on the view sonic website or elsewhere and worked great.  A lot of websites use flash and other programmable interfaces that do not work on the IPAD because Apple restricts it.4) Battery life.  I have have yet to run out of power.  They claim 10 hours like the IPAD and the claim is true.  It is hard to judge but I picked the machine up at 6PM and after some heavy web surfing and Alot of angry birds at midnight it had 40% power left.  I never sat it down.5) You can install apps from anywhere.  All you need is the APK file.  I have installed from Amazon,  Handango and from other sites.6) Microsoft Share access through the provided ES File Explorer.  You can connect to Windows Shares and play music, movies or copy files there and back.7) Micro SD card.  For 60.00 my 16gb tablet now has 48gb.8) USB drive access.  You can plug in a thumb drive and access it.  I have done it with Thumb drive and a multi card reader.9) 1 USB and 1 Micro USB slot10) Decent Wireless range11) Access the tablet as a drive via usb cable.The Cons1) Screen viewing angle from the bottom (long edge).  Everyone complains about the viewing angle but it is actually fine from the sides or top.  the bottom though is bad and you see this when you type with the tablet laying flat.  Overall the screen is good though.  It is generally not an issue as you look at it directly.2) lack of access to the Android Market.  Apparently Google does not want your money.3) Lack of syncing software to outlook.  Apparently Google and all the companies think we want our stuff in the clouds.  I would never trust Google or any other company with all my contact information.  I know to many people who have had it hacked and wiped out.  Why would you want Google or any company to have that information.  What will they do with it even if they tell you it is private.Comparing GTablet to Ipad1) Price.  299 vs 499.  Winner Gtablet2) Applications.  You could probably remove 90% of the apps from the apple App store and no functionality or choice of products would be lost (yes there are that many pointless apps but when you remove all the uses ones from both Apple and Android Apple still has more apps available.  This will change with time. Winner Apple.3) Web site viewing (flash).  Apple just does not work.  There are enough websites that you cannot access that it makes it useless.  That is one of the reasons there are so many apps because apple creates a app to control how you access a site.  Winner Gtablet.4) Itunes vs Direct Access.  Lets face it iTunes is a virus and is the worst part of the apple experience.  Itunes has to copy songs over you have no control over it yourself.  To move documents or other files around you have to email them to yourself.  It is just a bad interface between the tablet and your computer.  The Gtablet shows up as a drive.  You can copy music or any file over you want.  The music player scans (and quickly i might add) for music to display in the list.  Winner Gtablet.5) Weight and form.  The IPAD 2 is lighter although the Gtablet is easier to hold.  The IPAD back is slick and curved which makes it hard to hold.  A portfolio type case fixes this issue (not that stupid magnetic flippy thing they try to sell you for 39$).  The gtablet is flat and it is easy to grip.  The difference in weight is not that much but it is noticeable.  Ipad 2 wins on weight.  The Ipad 1 is equal in weight so the Gtablet beats the IPAD 1.6) Ease of use.  Pretty much a wash.  The IPAD is designed for mindless apple zombies to be able to use (we will call them ilemmings).  The android interface is also easy to use and customize.  There really is no usability difference.7) Onscreen keyboard.  This is really a tie.  Both work.  Both lack arrow keys which make correcting mistakes difficult.  You have to leave the keyboard and point at the line of text.  The gtablet is fairly easy to reposition the cursor on the character you want.  The Ipad is just pot luck (or at least for me).  It is just impossible to put the cursor where you want it unless you use their Hold your figure and slide feature which is just a patch to a bad design.  Both need arrow keys (at least forward and backard).8) Accessories.  Apple wins as many companies make aftermarket products for the IPAD.  The Gtablet has very few but many can be used because you are not limitted to apples interfaces it uses standard interfaces.9) Cameras.  Both the Gtablet and IPAD 2 have web cams.  Both are very lacking.  If you need a good camera on your tablet you would need to get one of the more expensive Android tablets.  I am not sure why Apple choose not to put the camera from the Iphone on the Ipad but both the front and rear facing cameras are low res webcams (like the itouch).  This is a tie as niether are good but they are both functional.Apples upgrade from IPAD 1 to 2 added nothing for the user.  It added a better processor, lightened it and added a web cam.  No functionality was added or flaws removed.Overall I love the GTablet.  You can do what you want with it where as the IPAD you can do what apple wants.  For the price I would never consider buying an ipad again.  The Gtablet wins hands down.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Leap of Faith Pays Dividends! Best Tablet Experience!", "Author": "R. V. Downing", "ReviewID": "R3HG3G7GRSIJKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE (4/18/11): Just a few cleanups after owning gTablet for more than a month now. I actually returned it to buy it again. I gave it 5 stars at the $390 I paid for it. If I could give it 6 now that I replaced it at $299, I definitely would. It really does blow my mind what you can get for $299 versus the competitors at $599. The competition may very well be better (XOOM, iPad 2, Galaxy Tab 10) but there's no chance it's $300 worth of better. I also upgraded to TnTLite 4.4.0 ROM and it's a tad slower (but still really quick) than 4.2.0 but much more complete and way more stable. This is an incredible deal.I also decided to elaborate on the screen issues since it seems to be a big deal to a lot of people. It's not as good as an iPad screen, which means you can't view it every which way. It's absolutely fine most of the time. The biggest issue you'll run into is with dark screens (likely from video content). This is where the viewing angle becomes most evident. Again it's fine with what I call natural angles but any odd angle and you'll lose the picture. Having said that, I can't for the life of me figure out why so many people are bothered by it. The only time I notice it is when I'm trying to view the tablet when someone else is using it and when the tablet's on the nightstand charging. Neither of which seems like a make or break limitation but to each their own I guess.ORIGINAL REVIEW: About two weeks into the purchase, I love my GTab. So much that I kept it over a Refurbished iPad 1 I got on clearance for nearly the same price.If you're reading this review, chances are you're a lot like me. You realize a tablet's not an essential purchase but you want one anyway as a nice to have. You're thinking about jumping into the tablet market, perhaps ready to finally get an iPad/iPad2 but you're looking for possible (cheaper) alternatives. You like the reviews you've seen so far on the GTab, but you're exceedingly anxious as to whether you have the tech credentials (or even the patience) to Flash a new ROM.My advice. Do it. The GTab represents a tablet computer. The iPad is an iPad. While this doesn't have the finished product appeal of the iPad (thin form, slick finished edges, stable SW out of the box), it represents a much better addition to my device arsenal. I also own a 2Gen Kindle and an EEEPc Netbook for class (I know...) and if I wasn't so extremely picky about how I'm using each device, GTab could really replace both.I tinkered with the GTab a bit out of the box as I was curious to see just how terrible the stock ROM was. While I didn't think it was terrible (I think I had a more up to date version than some of the earlier reviewers), it was a \"Force Close\" field day. Lots of applications and processes failed, which is not something you expect to see with a brand new product. So I went online for the directions to flash a new ROM and within about an hour I had TNT Lite flashed on it. There are really good, step-by-step directions on how to do it out there!Having flashed the new ROM, I immediately started to realize it outdid the iPad 1. This thing is FAST. Really fast. It snaps from app to app in a heartbeat. It often feels faster than my i7 desktop without a full Win7 OS slowing it down. Ports! SD Mini and USB! You can upload and download files without a computer, attach a peripheral, etc. File Management Apps that let you handle files like you do on your PC.Android Market lets you get Apps that seem more flexible than Apple apps (like live wallpaper, widgets, file management, internet browser, etc) then lets you set those as the defaults! You never have to look at the stock internet browser or video player again if you don't like them (but I do).ADOBE FLASH! You'll miss it more than you think you will. Nothing beats opening up pages like CNN.com and ESPN.com and having video content start up. It's amazing how many Apps you don't need when the browser supports the entire internet. I went through my iPhone to see which apps I should check the Android market for and I realized I didn't need many of them as a weblink on the home screen was the best option when working with a 10inch tablet.I could go on all day but I won't. In summary, I think the GTab is a great tablet paired with TNT Lite ROM but you've got to be prepared to tinker a bit. TNT Lite helps a ton but the open development environment will mean you can still crash it occasionally if you get carried away (which is easy to do because there's so much to explore out there!). I don't consider myself terribly computer savvy (although definitely a gadget whore) and I was able to figure it out.PROS:+ Everything you love generally about tablet computing. Portable, convenient, and great for casual/mobile computer use+ Cost! Great value considering the HW package and the price seems to be dropping even more+ More flexible Android OS (More computer-like than phone-like)+ Lighting fast operation (w/ TNT Lite 4.2.0 ROM). And I mean REALLY fast.+ File Management Capability w/o syncing to a computer+ Wide-screen Format+ Customizable! I like how you can set it up to use it like you like to use it.CONS:- Extremely glitchy out of the box- Few custom cases and accessories available- Lower Screen resolution (not viewing angle), but not that bad- No location support, GPS or otherwise (this may be a ROM issue)NEUTRAL:* Limited Screen Viewing Angles, but most natural use angles are fine (think Privacy Filter)* No 3G option  (if you're just SO important that you have to have it connected 24/7)* Some multimedia content hurdles if you're locked into iTunes already (DRM on iTunes video content, etc)* On screen keyboard works phenomenally in portrait orientation, not crazy about it in landscape", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Viewsonic Updates Make This A Bargain", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RUQ01XSRNBM0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Viewsonic has recently updated (mine was updated yesterday 12-23-2010) the software and added functionality to their G-Tablet which now makes this little tablet computer a complete winner. If you are interested in a 10\" tablet, get this one asap. I've played with all three major tablets, Ipad, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Viewsonic. The Viewsonic competes or beats all three in almost every category. The biggest rap against the G-tab is probably the viewing angle on the screen. You pretty much have to be right in front of it to see the screen clearly. But overall you can go where you want to go and have a great internet experience with the G-Tablet.I bought the Viewsonic Gtablet right around Thanksgiving because it had (or was supposed to have soon) everything I wanted in a tablet computer...that is, a tablet I could use like a PC. Back then the Viewsonic did not have the updates it has now, which is what makes this little tablet such a bargain. Waiting for Viewsonic to deliver proved to be a good move. While many people tweaked theirs to make it better, many others who are not as tech savvy returned theirs. This could have proved to be a mistake if demand now exceeds supply. My patience was rewarded with a great little device.Is it perfect? No, but it just blows the doors off the competition re overall function (it's fast, has flash and a clean user interface with enough apps to keep me busy (yes, even Angry Birds) as apps are added) and price (you won't find a Galaxy Tab or Ipad for anything near $399.) Once people realize what a deal this tablet is compared to the Galaxy and the Ipad, they may be more difficult to find and purchase.SUMMARY: Viewsonic stumbled badly in their rush to get this tablet to market, but they've made it right.

In fact, I had resolved to wait for this Spring's deluge of awesomeness (and likely accompanied by equally jaw-dropping price tags) in the tablet market. The Xoom price and linkage to Verizon put me off, though.I was still leery on the G-tablet after hearing everyone moaning about the viewing angles of the screen. I had the chance to see the G-Tablet at my local Office Depot, which happened to be offering it for the same price as most online retailers (379), and I found the screen to be not-so-bad. It does have very restrictive viewing angles, but in my opinion, this isn't always a bad thing (if I'm out in public, that means fewer people will be able to see what I'm doing!) In short, I ended up buying the G-tablet that day that I finally saw one in person.I had read all the reviews saying that this tablet wasn't for the faint of heart, even with Viewsonic's firmware update. Well, I'm a bit of geek myself -- I can hack code, develop web sites, and I generally tinker with computers both with hardware and software, so I figured I had enough skills to root and install a custom ROM, though I had yet to do either on an android device. I'm familiar enough with the regular operations of android from my phone, so I dove in head first.Thanks to the fellows over at xda developers, I had my G-tablet rooted, installed tntlite, sideloaded flash, got a full android market, and sideloaded angry birds within the first 24 hours (I would have had it all done inside of 4 hours, except I had to hunt down the latest version of the Angry Birds apk, which took me until the following day).Once I did that, this tablet is absolutely amazing. I love it. I haven't put it aside for longer than a few hours at a time since I got it up and running TnTLite. It's as snappy as my Samsung Captivate phone and runs all of the same apps. The screen is big enough to view web pages in desktop form rather than mobile. GPS? I wish it had it, but it's no big deal for me. Battery life is incredible. I sit down with it first thing in the morning and use it heavily for at least 2-3 hours and the battery doesn't drain past 85%. Gmail works wonderfully as does Angry Birds (sideloaded because it will not show in the market for this device for me). I've installed several browsers, but I must say, the stock browser on tntlite is just fine. I've also run Dolphin HD and Opera mini without issues. I intend to load Mozilla's beta of Firefox sooner or later as well.The bottom line is if you're a little on the tech-y side of things and willing to put a little work into it, this tablet is probably the best (hardware-wise) bang for your buck out there right now, no contract required.

Start to Load took only about 20 seconds.  At first glance the Tap-Tap interface wasn't bad but a few minutes later I realized what a mish-mosh of design by committee engineering it really was. Performance was tepid. The screen had a narrow available viewing surface. Really nothing to write home about. No Android Market. My mobile G2 phone did better. I gave Viewsonic an E for Effort and pressed on. Underneath the interface was the heart of Android 2.2.  Once I was sure everything was in order I knew what I had to do.On my home pc I navigated to the XDA website, found and read the install instructions and then downloaded stable releases of the ClockworkMod application and Vegan 5.1 (Android 2.2) in zip format.I grabbed the g Tablet and its USB cable and plugged it into my PC.  When the directory appeared I extraced the ClockWorkMod application to the Root directory of my g Table. I exracted/copied over the folder to a location off of the root folder. It came up with an update detected message and did an update.  Moments later my g Table was rooted and the ClockWorkMod Installer was ready to go.I reconnected the USB. I copied over the Vegan 5.1 zip file to another folder off of the root folder. I disconnected the usb cable and rebooted the g Tablet again.On the installer menu I deleted the User Data and then the cache I then selected the zip file for Vegan off of the menu (Use the rocker volume switches) and we were off!  The update took a few minutes.  I don't know exactly. When I looked at the screen there was the Vegan Logo and then there was a typical Android 2.2 screen.First off let me tell you in 30 minutes my g Tablet went from being a clunker to a screamer. Applications that were poking along popped up on the screen.  Everything was snap, snap, snap!  Wow! I finished the setup process with google. I then downloaded a couple hundred of my favorite apps and games from Android Market (already installed) and was promply rewarded.  Angry Birds was awesome, Pulse newsreader looked amazing, Pandora was great.Provided that one is willing to do a little extra effort and a little homework the payoff in performance and value was amazing.  Clearly this was a case of a happy investment.  I cannot recommend this course of action enough.  By now Viewsonic has gotten word about what people are doing with their discarded inventory.  And they have already issued an update.  My warning is Don't do it or allow it! Their update is an effort to disable your ability to root your g Tablet. If you do then you will have to download another 'fix' from XDA that will basically roll the Tap-Tap to the previous edition so you can upgrade it.Except for the Screens narrower range of view the g-table was now as good or better then the Motorola Xoom or Samsung Galaxy Tablets.  Do take advantage of this great value. I cannot be happier with my purchase.PS: One little nice extra tidbit of info. Android 3.0 Honeycomb is in the works to be available for this Tablet shortly with Vegan ....Update:Well its been over 6 months now.  This tablet has been steady and reliable for the whole time.  The only irksome item I've found is that the viewing angles tend to be a little limited to around a 90 degree field of vision instead of the usual 160 degree found on the iPad's or on the Samsung Galaxy.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review of Viewsonic gTablet", "Author": "John Bowden", "ReviewID": "R14U52RZ6PQH7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Full review can be found at [...]I purchased this device with my own money, and have had no contact or business with ViewSonic previous to this review.  Other than buying this tablet.  And that was in a store, not with Viewsonic....What I'm trying to say is that Viewsonic did not bribe me to do this review.  Nobody else did either....If you would like to bribe me to do a review on your merch, then send me a free one.  I'll be glad to mock it publicly for you.Ah, the android tablet device.  Everyone wants one, until they find out it's not actually an iPad that costs less but does the same thing.  Then, they complain.  Alot.  Loudly.Well, I have news for you.  Android tablets are here.While most of you have been hearing about the Galaxy tablet, I'm not talking about that one.  I'm talking about the new gTablet by ViewSonic.  This new sub-$400 device now stands as the cheapest usable android tablet on the market.What do I mean by usable?  I mean it has hardware and features that rival the iPad, the defacto standard of all thing paddy and touchy.  With the gTab (Yes, I went there), you can download apps, watch videos, use youtube, read PDFs and any number of ebooks from multiple publishers, listen to music, browse the web (with flash, bite me apple), and anything else you can find an app to do.That is, if you can get it to load the update from Viewsonic that fixes a few ba-jillion issues.  I mean, SERIOUS issues.  \"Can't connect to the network or setup gmail accounts, and it keeps crashing\" issues.If you're still reading, let me assure you:  The patch they have you download DOES work.  It fixes every problem I could find, and my tablet is a happy member of my tecnophile brigade of tools.  Seriously, this thing runs better then my Atom netbook.  Significantly smoother in use and video playback too.Let me give you a URL for the tech specs of the device: [...]Read that, and get back to me.  <waits>  Back already?  <frowns> You didn't even read it did you?  Bah.  Moving on.Look and Feel:The device has a noticable weight at 1.5 lbs, and is large enough to be highly visible and easy to grasp.  The back is rounded, with the trim rising slightly above the glass around the front edge.  While the device does not feel flexible or shoody, it is not aluminum either.  The plastic backing is a mat black, with the face being a shiny black with a noticable lcd window.  The front IS a shiny fingerprint magnet, just like every other black electronic device on the market.  (Seriously, would it KILL you people to make things in color or just slate grey once in a while?)The touchscreen is capacitive (meaning it notices skin contact, not pressure), as are the four 'buttons' on the front edge of the screen.  This makes it easier to hit the home, search, menu, and back buttons.  The downside is that it's easier to hit these buttons.  Alot.  When trying to hold it.You do get used to it and learn not to touch the touchy parts.The volume and power buttons are actual pressure switches, and have the ability to wake the device from sleep mode.  To my suprise, so do the capacitive buttons as well, at least for a few moments after the machine goes to sleep.The screen is responsive and accurate to touch, and the lcd bright with good color.  The viewing angles ARE limited from some directions.  In landscape view, the left to right angles darken the screen a little, while looking from a downward angle darkens it alot.  Upward viewing can wash out the screen a bit.  For the normal user, this is really not such a big deal, but some might find it annoying.  Two people could watch a movie on it without too much of a problem, really.Hardware and Software:Did I mention that you need to install a patch when you setup this toy.  I MEAN it.  Do it first.  Immediatly.  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.  Go directly to update.In fact, you may have to try it a few times to get it to work.  It failed on my twice before the charmed third attempt.After that?  It's easy.It comes with a web browser, email client, youtube, facebook, angry birds game, and media players.  You can download more options from their website, easily accessable with the favorites icon.Whle you can't download apps from the google market, it CAN load them from a half dozen other marketplaces for android apps.  I tried them all, and found that the sites run from excellent service and function to being absolute trash.  With so many shops to choose from, you'll be able to find anything you need, though.It should be noted that the device is VERY fast.  It's ability to playback full screen video and games should be applauded, considering the number of so-called tablets that can't even show a menu without stuttering.  At no time did the device feel like it was being stressed by the apps it was running.This device actually includes not only a micro-SD slot, but a USB plug.  A real USB hub-plug.  One that would allow you to plug in a hard drive or USB thumbdrive.  It should be noted you will have to use the file manager program to open the USB filesystem folder, and that it does not automaticly do so for you.  That does not change the fact it's available for use, a serious upgrade from many tablets and pads on the market.You of course have a set of common ports on the device:  Headset, power, and mini USB.  You also get a docking station port as well, though only china seems to have any docking stations that work yet.  I found a basic wal-mart folding picture stand allowd the gTab to sit comfortably on my desk, and that a USB mini keyboard made a nice accessory for writing emails on it.I also have just gotten word that Sony seems to be adding playstation support to Android.  If this is the case, tablets are a part of the future of gaming, and I'm glad I got in on the ground floor.Battery Life:And here we are.  What all of you keep asking about on the forums.  How's the battery life?Pretty doggone good, actually.Actually, no.  REALLY doggone good.During normal use, (meaning random games, web, audio video playback and the like) I got about one hour out of every 10% of my battery.  That means about ten hours of hard use, as far as I can tell.  Considering I've only had it a few days, that may even out lower, but 8 hours of use before it needs recharging is still quite usable when compared with most of them bleeding out in less than three hours.Standby mode uses VERY little power, as well.  It seemed to drop about 1% power per hour when sleeping.  Meaning you have days of standby power.  It does wake up for alarms and timers in that time, but did NOT activate the wifi, so emails did not show up until I woke it up.A few bad apples:Now, while this product is comparable to an iPad, I have to say again, it is NOT an iPad.  It will never run apple iPad apps, though Android does have some that were ported.  Also, it cannot yet play Hulu or Netflix videos.  Both companies say that they will support android 'soon', but we all know what soon means in corp speak, right?A message to Hulu and Netflix:  Get off your corpspeak bottoms and whip your programmers until you support Android.  No excuses.  I don't want to hear about \"It takes time!\" or \"Don't you want a bug free experience?\".  No.  I just want you guys to get it DONE and stop puttering around on it.  For god's sake people, I can't find anything legal to watch, but I can find tons of flash players dumping movies and tv shows illegally.  Get it done before you don't have a market anymore.  MOVE!Overall, I feel it's a useful device, but what do *I* know.  I'm just a Fool.END OF LINE.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "UPDATE: What to know when buying the Viewsonic G Tablet", "Author": "G.

If you can score this tablet for 200 then fine, but might as well fork the extra dough and buy an Apple, its so much more worth it.Viewsonic G tab - For Dummies (me)--------- Loved it after I realized what to do. When I first read the reviews on here I was like what in the heck are these people saying???? Rooting? ROM's? Installing new software? I don't know a lot about computers so I figured I'd break it down for us computer illiterate.In short here is what they are saying...1.  This tablet stinks if you use the original software it comes with - For the normal person updating/fixing your tablet is NOT AN OPTION. If you want to buy this tablet and use the original software it comes with, I'd pass. However, it is cheap, you can get this new now for around $250-275, so may be still worth it, since spending another $300 on an ipad is a lot! the stock Gtab is not horrible, but it aint great either.2.  If you think out of the box a little you can make this tablet into a STUD! This is what these guys are talking about with Rooting, Roms, etc. This tablet goes from average to AWESOME after you do this, and if you can do this, pay under $300 for it, you probably found the best deal in the tab market, hands down.3.  So you ask how do you do this, cause believe me I had ZERO CLUE TOO. Well, you can go two routes really...find a friend or a guy at work that knows computers pay him 30-50 bucks and have him do it for you (not a bad option considering you still paid a low amount for it). When their done your tab will be worth 500-600. Tell your friend to go to XDA-Developers.com and they'll know what to do from there, since for any computer guy this isn't hard to do.4.  Second option is to learn yourself, if you dont know computers well, this may take some learning, a little effort, but in the end you'll be a smarter person and better consumer for it. There are so many people willing to help its great. The first amazon reviewer (under most helpful), Roebeet has been excellent on here but he has also been great on XDA-Developers (a website geared towards people + forums using Androids (not ipads). These guys have everything broken down for you step by step. For those with marginal computer skill it will definitely take some patience and learning, but if you are willing to put in the extra effort than it will surely pay off. Since i feel this tablet is worth 600 with the new software installed.5.  Here is the gem I found on how to do it yourself...This guy made a Viewsonic G Tablet for Dummies Website (and for dummies like me) IT IS AWESOME. Literally he walks thru every single solitary step. Here is the site (I have to alter the URL so just replace the zero in the .c0m) [...]This is a must buy if you don't mind a little extra work to make your tablet great.The fact you plug in USB's, Micro USBs, expanding storage and allowing you to hook up to USB keyboards, etc makes it easier and more convenient to use than the IPAD. The upgrade + the price = best value on the market. I paid around $250 for this, vs. the lowest grade IPAD 2 at about $540 when including tax. A little more effort on my part is worth almost $300 if you ask me, but hey some people dont want to be bothered so I understand. In the end Im very happy I took this route since I learned so much more about computers all while saving a ton of money.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Ton of Fun", "Author": "Phillip Martin \"The Barbarian\"", "ReviewID": "RMAPZDMIZQ2UR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ViewSonic gTablet with 10\" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2I had been mulling over buying a tablet for several months.  I have an iPhone 4, but wanted out of the Apple ecosystem.  Android was the obvious choice, but right now it seemed that there was a bit of a lull.  Many tablets were out there with Android 2.2 shoehorned into underpowered hardware, and since 2.2 wasn't meant to be a table OS, many manufacturers were forced to modify it for use on their tablets.  Google has their new tablet optimized OS out, Honeycomb, but two problems exist, it wasn't released fully functional (missing Flash support and some other features) and to limit the fracturing that had happened with their phone OS, Google is only making it available to select vendors initially (Motorolla, Samsung).  What was I to do?With new tablets on the horizon, prices are dropping like crazy, but many of the older tablets are running 800mhz or 1 Ghz single core processors and only come packed with 256 MB of RAM, so no wonder their prices are falling.  Well, all of them except the G Tablet.  The G Tablet ships with a dual core Tegra 2 processor clocked at 1Ghz (Same processor as the Xoom, for half the price of the WiFi version) and 512 MB of RAM (twice what the iPad comes with) and 16GB of storage.  If you're still reading this, then maybe you've wrestled with the same dilema.  Well, after a couple weeks of research, and another $100 price drop, I picked up a G Tablet.  I'll confess up front, that I like to tinker with electronics, I used to build computers and studied IT for a while many years ago, so I'm not afraid to dive in and try stuff.  I mention this, because, although you don't need a degree in computers to enjoy the G Tablet, if you struggle getting Netflix to work on your blu-ray player or call Geek Squad first before trying to fix your computer yourself, them your potential for enjoying this device will be diminished.  Okay, on to the good and bad...I'll start with the bad, because if you make it past these qualms, then you'll really enjoy the good.  First, the screen.  It's 1024x600 resolution is comparable to most budget tablets, and even name brand ones (Galaxy Tab) and the most popular ones (iPad and iPad 2 have a 1024x800 resolution because they are 4:3 rather than 16:9, but they offer the same pixels per inch).  They bad isn't so much the resolution, the colors (which are a bit muted compared to the iPad's) or the brightness (less than the Xoom and iPad, but not noticably so) but the viewing angle is atrocious.  You can't slightly tilt it so your partner on the couch can see it, you have to hand it over to them.  When held landscape, tilting it up more than 10 degrees makes it pretty much unwatchable, left to right is actually quite goo, and even down isn't bad.  But tilt it up, and no dice.  This is something I have adjusted to, you may not.  The other rub is the stock software.  The average consumer may not find too much to dislike, as the updates Viewsonic has provided make it quite usable.  But compared to the potential the hardware has, the software it ships with is bloated, occasionally unresponsive, and slows, what should be lightning fast hardware, down to pedestrian levels.Okay.  Did you read all that?  Are you still interested?  Good, because there is a whole lot more to like than dislike!  Your first step after unpacking, charging, turning on the tablet, tilting it around a bit and thinking, this viewing angle is a bit jacked up, is to head to the XDA Developers website.  Seriously, don't play around with the stock software.  It's not horrible, and if you don't know better, you may convince yourself it's not too bad.  DONT'T DO THAT!  The tablet was released 8 months ago, and boy has the development community been busy.  1Ghz not enough for you?  They've created a hack to get it stable at 1.4Ghz and are puching it to 1.6Ghz.  Want an actual Android experience with the market and tons of freely available apps?  Great, get one of the modified ROMS and Boom!  The software is now twice as fast.  Speed tests peg it slightly faster than the Xoom when the Vegan ROM is loaded (it's not entirely stable), and about the same speed with TNT Lite (probably the most fully functional).  In the future, they plan on releasing 2.3 mods for it as well.All in all, I love to tinker, and I love new gadgets.  My weeks of research resulted in the G Tablet, and I haven't regretted it.

I'm happy with my decision. The G-Tablet is a powerful tablet with its Tegra 2 processor and Android 2.2 (Froyo) OS. I find that everything it does, it does well and quickly. It only has 512MB of RAM, but this doesn't appear to be an issue at all. The \"Tap-n-Tap\" software that the G-Tablet runs is no longer as bad as it was when the G-Tablet first launched. You don't have to use the Tap-n-Tap Dashboard. You can run the tablet with the \"Classic Android\" interface. If you're adventurous, you can install one of the several 3rd party ROMs, and get rid of Tap-n-Tap completely. The G-Tablet also does not come with the full Android Market, but there is also a hack to fix that too if you so desire. I find the G-Tablet's battery life amazing. I easily get 12+ hours of use between charges. As others have pointed out, the G-Tablet's screen has a limited viewing angle. Looking at it straight on though, it looks great. It's bright and clear. Since I have no reason to be looking at my tablet at any angle other than straight on, it doesn't bother me at all. All in all, I'm very happy with the G-Tablet.

Naneville", "ReviewID": "R32GTTK5XDITH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me dispel some common misconceptions about the Viewsonic gTablet.Misconception # 1: The screen viewing angle is horrible.  I can tell you that the screen is similar to a laptop screen so if you were to lay it flat and try and view it yes it is an issue.  However, if you are like most people who hold your tablet in your hands the viewing angle is pretty good.  I have had my gTab about two weeks and use it daily and I really don't notice any problems viewing the screen.Misconception # 2:  The gTab is useless out of the box and you have to root it in order to enjoy it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have not rooted my gTab.  Most of the gTabs are now shipping with the latest version of Android 2.2 which includes Viewsonic's Tap n Tap 1.2 interface.  The update includes full Flash support.  I haven't found a website yet where Flash didn't work.  The user has a choice between the standard Android interface or Viewsonic's Tap n Tap interface.  After using it for a while I actually like the Tap n Tap interface because it has handy information right there at my finger tips like the news and weather.  If you get a gTab with the old OS an update is simple to perform.  Press the Apps icon from the Android launcher screen and select Updates, or press More in Tap n Tap and select Updates.  No complicated software modifications are needed as some other reviews have indicated.  Again, when updated to the latest Viewsonic OS the gTab is fast and supports Flash.Misconception # 3:  You do not have access to the Android Market so you will have difficulties getting Apps.  While the gTab does not have access to the Android Market, unlike the iPad which forces you to buy from Apple, the gTab can access countless Android App sites including Amazon's Android App Store which has thousands of Apps.  Amazon even offers a free App of the Day.  Other reviewers have said this tablet will not run many Apps because the OS is outdated.  I haven't found an App yet that didn't work, including Angry Birds which comes pre-installed on tablets with the latest OS.  I haven't tried Netflix because it has only been officially released for select Android phones but, I have several popular eBook readers installed including the Kindle App.Misconception # 4:  The gTab is hobbled and slow.  I beg to differ.  I haven't had a single problem with Wi-Fi and the capacitive touch screen is very responsive, even with an XtremGUARD screen protector.  The gTab is as fast as any tablet on the market, including the iPad.  In fact, in Quadrant speed tests the gTab actually outperformed the Motorola Xoom at half the price.The Viewsonic is fast and is very responsive.  It is priced right and for another $50 to $60 you can add a two or three year SquareTrade Warranty with Accidental Damage protection to your Amazon purchase.  You don't have to be some Android hacker to enjoy the gTablet.  However, you have to have common sense enough to visit Viewsonic's gTablet website where it explains how to perform the OS update and also has links to other useful software.  After installing the OS update, this is a tablet you will truly enjoy.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Price/Functionality ratio as good unit to use at this moment", "Author": "Tech Savvy \"Tech Savvy\"", "ReviewID": "R2TZ7J75NGTA48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: a) Core CPU is the best on the market. b) Rom can be updated easily if you are willing to learn (Thanks to XDA) c) Memory can be expanded easily with (cheap) micro SD slot (so you don't have to pay the $99 increment from 16G to 32G) d) Optional (and cheap) case with keyboard (via USB) makes viewing with ease e) Price is right.Cons: a) Narrow view angle (keep your privacy, however) b) No built-in GPS (but can use external Bluetooth GPS if you really care) c) Only one front facing camera (so you cannot easily scan barcode for Android applications printed on paper nor use it as a camera/camcorder) d) 512M RAM (instead of 1G in the newer ones)There are many Tablets available on the market now. The newer ones, such as Asus Transformer ($400) and Samsung Galaxy 10.1 ($500), are better in specifications. (They are hard to get at this moment.) But at this moment, GTablet still has its edge over the others.First, it is priced right. At around $300 price range, the newer models is at least $100 more if you can get them. Honestly, I think $250-$300 should be tablet price range. Anything beyond this may not last. (Think of first GPS unit priced $300-$600 on the market, now it is around $100-$150 for a very good one.) Tablet is evolving quickly at this moment (again, just like GPS units 3-5 years ago). So financially, it doesn't make sense to spend lot for a unit which will be replaced quickly in a year.Second, the ROM can be upgraded easily. As one of the popular model on the market (one day, boot.com sold over 10,000 units), many people have developed better ROM for this model and ROM is updated fairly quickly. You may go to XDA website to follow very simple (and user friendly) instructions to flash your built-in ROM. I am currently using Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo VERSION 6. It is very responsive and battery efficient. But there are many more (Honeycomb alpha is available also) for you to experiment.Third, there are many apps to satisfy your everyday personal needs. Like your smart phone which runs Android, this tablet runs with Android 2.x (2.2 Froyo or 2.3 Gingerbread depending on the ROM you put it on). Comparing with iOS from the business point of view (such as security), Android may not as secure as iOS. But for personal use (web browsing, e-mail, reading books, viewing stream TV or movies, listen to music or radio, etc.), security is not a major concern. Besides, they are many Android apps developed for this OS. True also, the Android 2.x is phone based designed mainly for smaller screen (3-5 inches). So it doesn't take the full advantage of the screen size to design user interface nor the high screen resolution in the 10 inch screen. But more Android apps are developing for tablet and tablet based Honeycomb 3.0 and Icecream 3.1 OSs have already on the market. People at XDA are developing ROMs based on these new OS and they most likely will be available for Android 3.1 (even though Android 3.0 alpha is already available at XDA).Fourth, comparing with PC or laptop, it starts up quickly and runs faster (as no need for antivirus to run at this moment), and last long time (10 hours+) between charges. For people who are unfamiliar with smartphone (either iOS based, Android, or Windows Mobile), they need to make a necessary transition by getting used to using direct-linked Apps (instead of doing search with Google) and using market to find Apps quickly (again instead of doing Google search).  This is particular true for people who are not growing up with smart phones. Once you really formalize this idea (and difference between PC and phones), you will know how effectively use it enjoy using it more often.Overall, it is a good starting tablet in this fast developing new market. It has the best price/functionality ratio. Not perfect or something to showing it off, but best for the money to satisfy your everyday usage. You shouldn't get rid of your PC or laptop (as Tablet is designed for total replacement at this moment). But for 90% or more of your daily work, you may use this instead and it does better.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Addicted to G Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3G0XV9HU5VFFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two G Tablets for about 6 weeks.

But only when watching videos.  For anything else, it is, at best, a nuisance, hardly noticeable.  But when streaming a video or movie, I notice it.  That said, I watch a lot of streamed videos.  For me it is an irritant, not a deal breaker.Wifi is more than adequate.  I am frequently at least 50 feet from my wifi router. It is located in the basement. Last night I watched three episodes of a TV show with no problems.The battery is amazing.  Eight to ten hours.The Acer Aconia and the Asus Transformer are attractive, but reading their reviews, they also have issues you have to learn to live with.  Plus they are more expensive.  I got two GTablets for the price of one Xoom. The Acer cost 50% more, but I don't think I'd get 50% more value. I don't need a back facing camera.  An HDMI port would be nice, but I have only used the one on my laptop twice over a year.  I've got the same processor as the Asus, Acer, and Xoom.  I'll be getting Adroid 3 soon.If you absolutely have to buy a Tablet today, the Gtab is an excellent choice.  If I wanted to spend $450 to $600 dollars, I'd wait to see what comes out during the Christmas season.Support from Viewsonic is worthless.  But the support from the community of Gtab owners and programmers is priceless.  People get a lot of problems solved by knowledgeable community members on sites such as XDA developers, and slatedroid. I have directly benefited from this community when I ran into problems installing a new ROM. Of course not every problem gets solved.  But I think the odds are in the Gtablet owner's favor.The bottom line is that you must decide what you are comfortable with, how much you are willing to pay, and how long you are willing to wait.I understand the features and advantages of the newer tablets on the market today.  But I don't seem them as a superior value to what I've got.  I know that the Gtablet will serve me very well for a long time.  I reserve the right to change my mind 6 months from now.  But as of today, having had these Gtablets for six weeks, I'm very happy with what I've got.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Tablet for the Money", "Author": "old school john", "ReviewID": "R2QL50FZXGVSBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my ViewSonic gTab for 3 weeks now and I am giving it a 5 star review, not because it is the best tablet on the market -- that honor would probably go to the iPad2 -- but because it is most definitely the best value in a tablet computer currently available.  I paid $279 for mine from Woot (with free shipping!) and as has been noted in other reviews, the gTab has hardware specs that compare favorably to the Motorola Xoom at more than twice the price ($600).  I played around with a Xoom last week for an hour and I can honestly say I saw no appreciable performance qualities that were better than the gTab.Please don't let all those early reviews about the awful user interface software dissuade you -- the gTab's OS has been updated many times in the last 6 months, so most of those reviews are out of date.  The gTab will automatically update itself on startup (just make sure you have a good WiFi connection) and the stock updated inteface is perfectly fine for the average, non techno geek user.  You can certainly surf the web, update your Facebook status, check your email, and view movies with abandon.  This is my first tablet and I have to agree with Steve Jobs, it certainly is a \"magical\" experience.  You just don't have to pay $600+ to get the magic.For those of you who want turn a good tablet into a great one, by all means update the stock OS with a custom ROM.  It's really very easy to do... the hardest part is finding a non-confusing set of directions to follow.  I installed the TNT Lite 4.2 custom ROM, and it literally took me about 15 minutes.  I just downloaded two files from the web, decompressed them, copied them over to my gTab via USB, then rebooted the gTab.  That's it!  Getting Google market to work took another download of Titanium Backup, then using that app to clear some data out of gTab's system and then re-booting.  Again, it took far longer to find a clear set of instructions on how to do it than to actually apply the fix.  Once the fix was applied I had full access to the Google app market.The TNT Lite interface is super fast and with the full Google market you will have access to thousands of apps, both free and paid.  I have downloaded about 30 so far and they all seem to work just fine.  I am also using it as an e reader, it comes with the Kindle app and I added the Nook app.  The Kindle reader is really barebones, I would suggest going with the Nook app as it has a wide choice of font styles, sizes, page margins, etc.As many reviewers have noted, the viewing angle is somewhat restrictive but I really don't see what the problem is... if the screen isn't clear you just move it in your hand until it is. What's the big deal?  It's really only a problem if you intend to regularly share viewing it with someone else -- for instance if you are doing demos for a customer or watching movies with your loved one.  In that case you might be better off with an iPad... or just buy two gTabs!The only real con that I can think of is that are few accessories available for it.  You can find cases, a docking stand, etc but they only available over the web.  You're not going to find them on the shelf at your local Staples like you can for an iPad.Pros and Cons in summary:Pros:+ great hardware specs, comparable to Xoom at half the price+ Good battery life 10+ with WiFi enabled+ 10.1 screen size great for viewing web pages, watching movies, etc.+ Capacitive screen is very responsive+ Comes with Flash right out of the box+ Lots of great custom interfaces available from support communityCons:- Stock user interface may seem lackluster for more sophisticated uers- Lack of accessories", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product If you follow these instructions", "Author": "Ian Duncan", "ReviewID": "R2A1TGSH17XHNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you dont want o go to the trouble of doing this yourself there are several on ebay right now with custom Roms installed.

Many reviewers admitted the limited viewing angle of the screen. However, many found it a minor issue.Installing a custom ROM was very easy and I was happy with the performance, as far as the CPU was concerned.

Often times, the tablet is resting on your lap or on your desk when you are trying to look at it from an angle. That is exactly where things look really bad on screen. Because of limited viewing angle, looking at the tablet in portrait mode (for reading ebooks for instance) gives a different brightness and colour intensity to each eye.

So here are some points to clear up.1.  Google had decided to make Honeycomb closed source for now.that is why Nvidia, rather than Viewsonic, cannot release the hardware acceleration drivers for Tegra 2 under HC OS.2.  Currently, there are 3 or so of unofficial Honeycomb ROMs for gTablet in alpha build. The main reason for a lack of progress is due to Google not allowing the release of hardware acceleration drivers.3. The current HC ROMs all have full market access, are relatively stable, gapps enabled, and overclockable up to 1.4 ghz.4.  The main drawbacks of current HC alpha builds are lack of hardware acceleration so graphic intense games and in browser flash content may not be displayed. But it will play most videos, with some slowdown in higher resolutions. Also webcam doesn't work with HC builds.5.  Initially out of the box, you need to check if your stock rom is 1.1 or 1.2 (April update). You need to be very careful about whether you install a 1.1 based custom rom or 1.2 based. Cross flashing these two will result in soft bricking.6.  Even if installing custom rom may void your warranty, like jail breaking an iOS device, you can always restore it to stock rom. If your device will not boot in to recovery or Android OS itself, the those who provide warranty service will not be able to either.7.  Viewsonic had not discontinued it's support for gTablet and intend on providing future updates. The primary reason for a lack of HC is because Google is charging a huge amount for it's license. Android 2.2 and 2.3 licensing fees are substantially lower.8.  Since it's release, gTablet had received two official and comprehensive updates. That's more than any of its peers released at around the same time. Other tablets from the time received mostly minor fixes.9. GTablet also has one of the most vibrant user dev community of all android, Tegra 2 tablets. The community remains highly active and makes steady improvements to it's frankencomb.  The current HC for gTablet is a ported aggregation of codes pieced together from Transformer, Iconia, and Xoom.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Replace the stock OS right away and you have a great bang for the buck", "Author": "Hien Nguyen \"scatterbrained\"", "ReviewID": "R3TULOQUR7FXNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We all know the specs are impressive - well, except for the limited-viewing angle LCD - but it's really the stock OS that holds it back.Don't let that hold you back from buying one though unless you're not up to the task (it's easy) of rooting it and loading a new OS on it.XDA-Developers has a forum section dedicated to this tablet and quite a few custom roms to choose from.The stock rom didn't last more than an hour for me and I went through CM7, TNT lite, and Vegan (Froyo and Gingerbread).  I've finally settled on Vegan's Gingerbread build for its speed and functionality.  Granted, I won't get HW-accelerated graphics, but I didn't find myself watching a lot of videos on it.

Great Bargain!!!", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK out of the box, a screamer when Modded", "Author": "Califrisco", "ReviewID": "R1Y8WXYN4XJ1XI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the almost tablet I'd been waiting for. For months now I've been salivating for a tablet without knowing exactly why: maybe it was the size factor, maybe because the iPad has been such a hit, and now with the sleek iPad2 out, I really needed to know if I wanted it just out of lust for new technology, or because it really will serve a good daily purpose for me. I've got a 15\" Macbook Pro and I really love the Apple products, but could not see myself going out for an iPad2 without trying the tablet form-factor out. So when Woot and Amazon offered this for well under $300, I jumped and am very glad I did.First: this tablet is solid, well-built and surprisingly hefty for it's size, just like the original iPad. Its much reviewed screen is highly reflective and smudges easily, so with a little glass cleaner and the supplied cloth, you'll need to use them often if you care about a clean surface. You'll be gently reminded to use this mostly in landscape mode, since (1) it is a bit heavy for one handed use and (2) the back is not very tactile and will slip if not held with more than one hand.Second: the supplied Tap N Tap stock software is OK, especially when upgraded to their latest over the air version 3588 but it was still not as good as a fully modded system. While there are alternative sources to Android Market (AppBrain, App Market, Applanet, Amazon Appstore) the Android Market is still one of my favorites and works perfectly on my VeganTab 7.0.0 ROM (along with the others). I put up with the Tap N Tap for about 8 hours before I settled in, read the XDA rooting directions, watched a few You Tubes to make sure, and then did the deed. I am never looking back--the difference in speed and responsiveness is startling and not subtle.Third: Orientation. The supplied onscreen keyboards are much easier to type with your thumbs when in Portrait mode vs Landscape. I like the ones that are split with the number keys in the center, relieving you of having to press a key just to type numbers. The nice thing is that there are free and alternate keyboard apps that you can download to suit your style.Last: I wanted to see how this would behave as an e-Reader (with Amazon Kindle) and it is very good but still a bit heavy. The viewing angles are not as awful as people stated, but I do find that portrait is easier on the eyes when having to travel less left to right to read than in landscape mode. The reflective screen is never going to be as good as a Kindle (esp. outside) but then the use of each device will dictate how much this will be important to you. When reading, the landscape mode is maybe too wide but it is less prone to screen graying when tilted left to right. When held in portrait, it is actually more comfortable to me but suffers more when tilted left to right. Bottomline: the tilting of the screen up and down (in Landscape) and left to right (in Portrait) will affect your relatively limited viewing angle of this screen.All-in-all, this is so far a good buy and for those somewhat technically minded, the directions to mod the tablet are pretty straight-forward and it is worth it to get a tablet that even iPad owners would be envious of.*4-23-11 Update* This is probably too heavy for long Kindle reading. After trying to use it in either orientations, it can fatigue your hands. Needs a stand for long periods of viewing or reading. The Google Books App that it comes with VeganTab is OK but not as polished as the Kindle App, but still, certain books are actual scans of the books (e.g the 1907 edition of L. Frank Baum's \"Ozma of Oz\"). Pretty cool to read a classic like that. But I am going to get a keyboard-stand that I will prop it up with to read and use it as almost a netbook.Streaming Video: This can now stream Netflix so you can finally use it for that site. And the Amazon streaming works fine even though it will say \"Not optimized for Mobile\" (which your tablet is really not). Of course You Tube is not an issue, but some sites will stream to the gTablet depending on how operating system-specific they are.*4-25-11 Update* this weekend I had to essentially restart from zero in order to stop the Market from crashing. Tip: even though you CAN move various apps to the SD card (doable through App 2 SD Free (move app to SD)). I moved everything I could, including the Market, and that's when the problems started. So I restarted and got everything reinstalled and am cautiously moving apps over to the SD (like the non-Market ones). I also backed up everything via ClockworkMod AND Titanium backup so I can roll back (if I don't wipe the partition that I backed up on).Regarding fingerprinting: if you use Castrol Accuvision (Rain Repelling Glass Treatment) or RainX you'll find it easier to clean the screen of prints AND you will find the screen is a bit slicker to move your finger across. If the glass is squeaky clean (no Accuvision), it will tend to hold fingerprints more stubbornly and your fingers will not be as able to swipe or gesture as easily.

I've always viewed the Ipad as a media consumption device. I saw the G-tab on sale here and decided to give it a try.The hardware is very comparable to the zoom in most aspects. The stock firmware is both better and worse then the Xoom. Honeycomb is far from optimized and actually delivers a less then stellar experience. The G-tab offers a \"better\" initial experience but lacks a true android market. However everything does work well \"out of the box\". So for a non techie looking for basic connectivity, word processing/document viewing, web browsing, e-reader and online content consumption (except netflix) the G-tab does well.It took me literally about 10 minutes to upgrade the ROM on the G-tab to a more functional alternative that allows the full android market (among other things). I loaded up logmein ignition ($29) and now have complete access to my work desktop anywhere in the world I have internet connectivity. This allows me to handle about 70% or so of my normal business tasks anywhere I have a wireless of cell connection (my phone is a hot-spot if needed). I can handle about 20% of the balance using logmein with the tablet interface. The other 10% that requires more complex document preparation or editing or significant data entry requires me to use a wireless keyboard/mouse with the G-tab. Again this can be done anywhere with a connection but requires me to carry a laptop style case. Normally I'll take the keyboard/mouse in my luggage but just use an ipad style portfolio and \"catch up\" if needed at night.If I really need the horsepower I'll use my E121 slate, however the G-tab offers significantly better battery life. I have mobilenoter linked across my G-tab, E121 and desktop (and phone) to provide cross platform OneNote support.If your primary perceived use is social/media driven I think the ipad is an equal or superior platform, however if your in the business of doing business then the G-tab offers much more, both now and in the future. The slate platform is far superior to the laptop or phone in many ways. The tremendous inroads that the Ipad has made are a testimony to the form factor not the ipad itself. Apples willingness to meet corporate security concerns (which surprisingly Microsoft is not with its mobile platform...yet) will keep them well entrenched, however I think android will quickly surpass apple in business specific software. The lack of a true active digitizer is the biggest issue in both the android tablets and ipad and no current tablet supports one (that i'm aware of).The G-tab is a quality alternative to the Xoom offering roughly equal capability for less then 1/2 the cost.

Amazon's android apps store was a decent substitute during this period, but it'll be a few years before it's as full as Google's market.Avoid trying to install the new ROM on the internal SD card.  The root directory is protected.  I downloaded Clockwork MOD on a micro SD card, installed it without problems. You need it to install most versions of new ROMs.  I then downloaded installed Vegan Tab Ginger Edition RC1 ROM from XDA developers on the same SD card and then did a full wipe and install of the tablet.  It's been quite stable thus far.  You can easily change ROMS if one doesn't suit you.

The viewing angle is a nuisance if you let kids play on it, like I let mine. It's hard for 2 kids to see the screen if they have it in their laps. If they prop it up and sit further back it's fine. I didn't really get it for the kids though, so not too upset about it.Most games and apps I put on this work, but some didn't. A couple games would kind-of work and show big square blocks instead of the characters. I didn't put this in the \"Cons\" above because it wasn't a problem with most apps and shouldn't be a deciding factor for anyone to get this. If one app doesn't work, a lot of times you can find another app that does the same thing that does work.Also, this has the same processor as a lot of other high-end tablets, but half the memory (512 mb, compared to 1 gb in more expensive), so I don't know if you can *really* put this in a class with the other tablets (or smartphones) that have the same processor. That said, this might be easier to overclock the CPU than the other tablets, which helps a bit. I recommend sticking around 1.2-1.3 ghz if you overclock, more isn't very noticeably faster and it'll run hotter; prolong the high speeds and I imagine the longevity of this device will go way down. 1.2-1.3 ghz doesn't cause an excess temperature increase.This was a bit of a learning experience for me to do all the tinkering on this thing. I had to go to a site to download the original settings after I killed it, and had to install (and reinstall) that a few times. It was interesting to learn, since I really had no idea about that sort of thing beforehand. I'm a little bit of a computer nerd, but didn't have any experience with android devices. So not as big of a learning curve for me as it might be for someone who has no tech-experience whatsoever; that said, if you have no tech experience I don't really recommend this.Anyway, after finding the android OS I liked (then deleting it because I put on too much too fast, then reinstalling it, rinse, repeat. Probably installed it 4 times before I decided it was the right OS for me) it ran smooth. Games work pretty well and scrolls through pics quickly. I really recommend you try out a lot of apps, pick the ones you like, then delete and reinstall the OS of your choice; just my opinion, but I think it runs smoother with less installed, even if the other programs don't run in the background. The touch screen sensitivity isn't the best, but good enough for me. If you get this order a screen protector with it. The smudges are ridiculous on the regular screen, and only a little extra for a screen protector. Screen protectors also doesn't scratch so easily, and if they do they're cheap to replace; the regular screen, not so much (if it is even replaceable).So it was fun to tinker with, but at the time I'm writing this they have the Kindle Fire, which is smaller but runs as smoothly (in my opinion) and has much (much, much) better viewing angles, which makes up for the smaller size, in my humble opinion. Oh, and cheaper. If you can afford to buy something just to tinker with and learn about the technical side of an Android device, buy this. I probably spent 50 hours tinkering before I settled with an OS, and I could have spent a whole lot longer if I wanted to really experiment.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad, depending on use", "Author": "srags104", "ReviewID": "R1KBMSMGOHK456", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did lots of reading before I decided to buy this tablet.My main attraction was the price and hardware spec.

As such, the limited screen angel of the ViewSonic is not an issue to me. Now to the good part. The Interface of the View Sonic straight out of the box is bad. The unit needs an update to be able to play FLASH content. The update is automatic once connected to WI FI. However, ViewSonic uses an overlay which does not allow direct access to Android Market. You can still download apps, but it is trough the View Sonic interface,  which also limits the apps. The unit with the ViewSonic update works very well.

But if you do that you may not notice what lies beneath, beneath the most inexorable software that comes stocked with this product is some piece of hardware that takes some time to getting used to appreciating. You may not appreciate this device instantly but you will if you stick to this for at least two weeks. And not that it will happen automatically but it needs some work from your side too, like 30 minutes of effort for a layman and after that what you are going to see is a treat for your senses. And the experience is even more rewarding due to the fact that you put in some effort towards flashing a new ROM -- and in turn saving some money for yourself -- you will feel good about this too. And further knowing that you can re-flash the image whenever you want -- no need to stick to the same ROM -- also keeps you more interested with this tablet. So rooting this product takes it to a level higher than an 'ipad' -- atleast according to me -- i've used ipod touch before, but this device beats that experience, I mean the touch screen experience, the market, the out of box support for so many codecs, the flash plugin, the ability to attach a pen drive and start browsing immediately, full scale web browsers and the list goes on.Rooting this device is made very simple, trust the people who have done it.So overall 4 stars for the product, one star less for the build quality -- the plastic casing etc -- and the product is heavier to my liking.and yes the viewing angels too is a problem, but then I guess that is true with any LCD screen tablets, you have to live with it.EDIT: I am using VeganTab custom ROM.

My first impression was favorable, but that faded when I found out that the stock ROM (the operating system) could not access Marketplace and that, therefore, many thousands of programs for android machines could not be accessed.  One easy example, is that I have a NookColor reader (which I \"rooted\" to add Marketplace and many other apps to it, making it a small tablet).  I wanted to add the Barnes & Noble Nook reader to my tablet, but I could not access the application (app) via Marketplace, AmazonApps, Barnes & Noble's web site (which routed the request to Marketplace) or otherwise.  Thus, the dozens of e-books I owned for my NookColor were unavailable on the tablet.I was not a happy camper.This led to a lot of research (many hours worth) on web sites frequented by program developers and other Viewsonic tablet owners, including YouTube (videos of people changing the ROM), xda-developers, pcgeeks, android central, etc.  I discovered that a lot of people have been working to improve the ROM for the tablet, but there were multiple alternative ROMs out there and the task of changing out the ROM seemed daunting and somewhat risky for someone like myself.I was frustrated after 4 days of research.  Then, I finally found a blog where a writer laid out the steps to change out the ROM.  One of the benefits was to obtain access to the full Marketplace and to improve the performance of the tablet.  The ROM-change process took about an hour, of which part was reading the instructions, downloading the programs to my laptop, then transferring them to the tablet as instructed.  I followed each step exactly as described.  When I was done, I had a tablet that not only could access the Marketplace, but from all I could tell was operating faster and more smoothly.  In the 24 hours since I made the change, my view of the Viewsonic has changed from a bit of ambivalence/disappointment to enthusiasm.  Now the device rocks.One last issue was getting a good browser (oddly, Chrome doesn't exist for these android devices and I found Firefox 4 not suited to my browsing style).  After the change, the stock Dolphin browser was gone and for some reason it could not be downloaded from Marketplace (Marketplace didn't recognize my tablet as compatible for Dolphin although Marketplace let me download a boatload of other apps).  I finally found it by searching for the apk (the software app) via Google and found a download that wasn't linked to Marketplace.  Once installed, it ran the password manager (lastpass) which I have installed on all my computers and which synchronizes passwords across all 5 of them.If you buy this device (and at less than $300 it is a steal), change the ROM.  Search the internet using Google.  The instructions I found were on Blendblog.net, poster was Sean, title was \"Flashing the Viewsonic GTablet with VEGAn ROM and fixing the Market\".  If you include that information, Google will take you to the instructions.The ROM change has changed this purchase from what looked like a marginally useful device to my desired travel computer.And yes, the Nook app is happily on my Viewsonic tablet along with my Barnes and Noble book collection -- including my travel guides.UPDATE: May 6, 2011Took the tab to Mexico and it worked well.Note that I added a link to the ROM change instructions in a reply to a comment.

This tablet is a fantastic bargain - IF you're not squeamish about rolling up your sleeves and doing some customizing.  As others have said, the hardware is great, but the Tap 'n Tap interface it comes with is horrible.  I took other's advice and found a good guide for installing a custom ROM, and now I have myself a nice slick little tablet.Now even if you customize you need to understand that this is a $300 tablet, and even with a custom ROM if you put the GTablet up against a high end tablet like a Xoom or an Ipad 2 its going to lose.  That being said, it doesn't really lose by all that much when you consider those tablets are roughly twice the cost.  Here's a breakdown of the good and the bad with this tablet:The Good:Speed - This is a fast little bugger, it will hold its own with much more expensive tablets.  I hit over 2200 on Quadrant Standard (if you don't know what that is this probably isn't the tablet you should be looking at), not bad for a $300 tabletPrice - A dual core processor with a 10\" screen for $300?  You're not going to beat that anywhere.Customizable - This tablet was VERY easy to root and install a custom ROM.  If you can follow some simple step-by-step directions you'll have it up and running with your new ROM in no time.  And there are some very good ROMs available for it too.  I went with TnT lite and I'm very happy with it, but there are others that have gotten good reviews also.USB Port - You can slap a thumb drive on this for even more storage, or to easily transfer filesThe Bad:Screen - Its serviceable, and it looks great if you watch a movie or something with the angle right, but the viewing angle is very limited.  I guess they had to cut corners somewhere and I guess this was it.Software out of the box - Well its been beat to death already so I won't go into detail again with thisNo GPS - This is pretty minor since you can tether it to your phone's GPS if you really want to use this thing as a massive Garmin.  Personally I think its a little too big and clunky for that anyway, but if you have a rooted Android phone you can still do it.In summary, if you're tech savvy and buy this tablet with the intent to root and install a custom ROM, then its a 5 star bargain.  If you're not comfortable about such things I'd give it a 3 because the out of the box software is so limited and clunky.

The webcam was sub-par, but there might be support for external USB soon. Battery life is as promised, 11 hrs.Software: The new version of TapNTap (which you can get by automatic update) runs as smoothly as 3rd party OS's, like TNT lite (which I am currently using.) There were some minor glitches, but for the most part the software did what was expected.The second biggest problem was the app market. You don't get google's android market, and the gmarket is scarce. In fact, many of the gmarket apps are effectively incompatible or partly incompatible with the device. Even with careful research and trips to online app stores ([...]/android is great) the selection is small and poorly organized. The best apps are found by lurking on specialty forums.The community is small, so support is minimal.The single greatest failing of this device has been wireless connectivity. So far, the only way I have been able to connect to enterprise level networks has been by formatting the device to factory settings and going through the setup process. Once the device is running, there is no GUI option to select MSVChAPS or the like. Even many simple routers and WPA secured networks have failed to connect.If you really want this device, Here is a list of what I have found useful:1- keep the default browser, but additionally install the \"Dolphin HD\" browser. You will find both have features you want that the other does not.2- install Rockplayer, it will run proprietary file formats that the default player will not3- install ES File Explorer, in fact I just got the whole suite because they were pretty good. This file explorer has great features and an intuitive copy/paste setup.4- While most radio players (including I heart radio) don't work, \"TuneIn Radio\" does.5- some task manager is necessary, I use ES task manager, but most swear by another app I can't remember6- Setup Teamviewer <[...]7- the IMDB app is great, although it won't play trailers for me it does for a lot of other people8- Don't get a 3rd party OS, it isn't necessary.

The fairly consistent word on the web is that the hardware is very good, although the screen leaves a little to be desired (poor viewing angle. lower resolution than the Xoom). I've upgraded 2 and I have another one the way. The biggest hurdle you will have with this device is when you first power it up. After you try to play with it for a few minutes and setup WiFi it will probably hang up, reboot, and /or forget any settings you put in the first time. Don't panic or get discouraged. The second time it starts up you SHOULD be able to setup a WiFi connection and do the first update. It is pretty stable once the update is installed. You will need to do some Google searching and studying but if you have fairly average computer skills you should have little trouble installing one of the custom ROMs out there. I recommend installing ClockworkMod08, then VeganTAB5.1 Final and the Beta Vegan Launcher for Tablets. TNT Lite is ok but the Vegan Tablet Launcher works better with VeganTab and is way better than the other launchers you get. I'm holding back the 5th star only because of all the work you have to do to make this a great tablet. Once all the upgrades are done, it deserves a 5 star rating, especially considering the price, roughly half the price of the Xoom. It's really more like 2 stars out of the box, 3 stars after the first update, and 5 if you install Vegan (ROM + Tablet Launcher).

Harkey \"J.M.Hakey\"", "ReviewID": "R2BGZ8IZLUD8K8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned the G-Tablet for a little over two years now and it's still kicking. You might think to your self \"Why would it still be kicking after only two years? Most devices last longer than that!\" Well you are most certainly right but I have other reasons for mentioning this.First lets start off by saying that this device was pretty solid in price and performance compared to other respectable models that were out during that time, namely the iPad 1 and the Samsung Galaxy 7\u2033 tablet. The specs on it were very good for the $250 price tag. It had a better processor than the iPad and just as much RAM (or memory) and a screen that was just as good in terms of resolution and pixel density. Here are the listed specs of the G-Tablet:Screen Size 10 inchesScreen Resolution 1024 x 600Max Screen Resolution 1024 x 600 pixelsProcessor 2.10 GHzRAM 512 MB DDR2Hard Drive 0 GB ATAGraphics Coprocessor GeForceChipset Brand NVIDIACard Description Tegra 250Wireless Type 802.11GNumber of USB 2.0 Ports  1Average Battery Life (in hours)  8 hoursExpandOther Technical DetailsBrand Name ViewSonicSeries gTabletItem model number GtabletHardware Platform PCOperating System Android 2.2Item Weight 1.6 poundsItem Dimensions L x W x H 13 x 2.75 x 9.75 inchesColor  blackProcessor Brand ARMProcessor Count 1Flash Memory Size 16 GBAudio-out Ports (#) 1Battery Type lithium_ionPower Source ACVoltage 240 voltsPretty impressive for a tablet that cost sub $300 when the Samsung Galaxy Tab and iPad 1 were going for about $500-700 dollars depending on the features you got with them huh? This tablet came with a fairly new and impressive operating system called Android Gingerbread that could play all the modern mobile games, watch FLASH video, run office suites and was highly customizable. A true contender for that mid range tablet device that so many people wanted.The Bad:While this tablet was really good for the money, it had some serious flaws that could not be overlooked. The biggest issue this tablet had was the viewing angles. Yes, the screen resolution and pixel density were great but the viewing angles were just terrible. You literally have to be looking at this device straight on and hold it horizontally (long wise) for the picture to be clear and precise. If you were not holding the tablet properly most of your screen would be blackish-gray and washed out, making viewing anything really hard.The second issue was the stock operating system, while great at the time, came with a horrible UI called Tap `n Tap by Viewsonic that just made the device sluggish in all aspects of operation. Now, when people buy tablets they prefer to have a working tablet out of the box. This was not the case with the G-Tab. You had to root the device, install Clock Work Mod, and then flash the operating system with a custom ROM developed by people you didn't know.The final issue was with the company Viewsonic and not the actual tablet. Viewsonic basically made this product, sold it, but offered no real support other than hardware replacement. If you had any issues with the software or getting something to work via sync, such as a blu tooth device, you were plain out of luck. This was also a major turn off to people who wanted to buy the G Tablet but couldn't trust the provider of coverage.Let's get to why I think this device was great for its time and why I think it's still a good device now that is kicking after two years of abuse.The Good:Knowing all of the problems above by reading reviews on Amazon and a ton of other online super stores, I still decided to purchase this tablet. The specs alone were amazing as they gave me nearly the same performance as $600 dollar tablets. What really makes the G Tablet an awesome device is it granted me the ability to learn how to flash Android devices. The G Tablet has one of the biggest modding communities on the planet and getting help with any issue related to the device was easy and faster than it is when trying to contact support with a real company.I have spent over two years constantly re-flashing the ROM over and over and have never had any cause to RMA my device back to Viewsonic. It's just that good at taking the abuse it receives. The worst thing you could do to the G Tab was \"brick\" the device, which means that the device would not boot into the operating system and you could not even access the \"bios\" as I call it. Your device was basically a non functioning paper wait, or brick. Even this was easy to fix though, as taking apart the G Tab is simple, and all you had to do was jump the 4 pins on the motherboard to reset the device. You could then try re-flashing your ROM and you were good to go.Using this process of learning I was able to apply my skills at my real job and unbrick quite a few Android based phones for the company, saving them hundreds of dollars on new phones. I felt like quite the hero at my place of work, even though I wasn't rewarded for it ;)I also want to mention that because this device was heavily moddable, I was able to get my tablet to run Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwhich, and Jelly Bean well before other tablets pushed out official versions over the air. Many of my friends were jealous at the fact that I had these new state of the art operating systems 6 months to a year before they finally got theirs from Samsung and other companies who rolled out the updates via OTA updates.Conclusion:I wouldn't recommend you buying this device new as the price is still around $250-300 on most online stores, but if you can get your hands on one of these used for around $100 or less then I would say, GO FOR IT! It's a capable device, still fairly powerful, and a great learning tool with a great community to help you out with any problems you may encounter.Score: 6/10 for functionality and 10/10 as a great learning device.Check out my website at JMHarkey[dot]com for more awesome reviews on books, movies, and devices!", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "paddi", "ReviewID": "R3OKS603D8RMFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this for 2 years now it still works great.

But if you are watching something with bright colors, like Angry Birds, the colors are fine, and you can even see it from a pretty good angle.

The screen is really not as bad as some reviews I have read. Looking straight on, it is crisp, clear, and very good. Looking from the side, it gets difficult to read quickly (almost consider it to be like a privacy screen built in). It is also a little on the heavy side.

It is probably closer to 1.7 or 1.8, so it is not the lightest tablet out there.Now that the price is dropping to the <$250 range, it is definitely something worth checking out.

Brady", "ReviewID": "R10OSVQM2W24YI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was concerned about purchasing this tablet due to all the negative reviews out there about the ROM/software and screen angle.  I purchased in June 2011, and found the ROM/ Android operating system to be acceptable after the first over the air update to version 3588.  I used it a week or two with that stock ROM and really didn't have any problems, so was hesitant to do any tweaking or hacking.  The tablet works with flash 10.1 to 10.3 contrary to many of the reviews.  There is a link to download it from Viewsonic's website ([...]).  As far as the screen, it is really a good screen, but it seems like it works better if you hold it upside down. Holding it normally, in landscape view, It needs to be viewed straight on, or from the top down. If you tilt the top away from you, it gets dimmer, and doesn't look good.  As long as you hold it flat to your view you are fine, but after a while the weight gets to you and you start tilting it away. At that point, just flip it over, and you can see it fine from the bottom view (tilted slightly away from your eye). Only problem with this is the switches are in a different position than normal, but I haven't had any real difficulty with that. So the screen is not really a big problem and it actually looks great from the right angles, or holding it upside down in landscape mode.Also during this initial 2 weeks time I was researching on the internet all the various options for 3rd party ROMs to use on the Viewsonic GTablet device.  There are many choices in ROMs for the GTablet, from Android 2.2, which it comes with, to 2.3 and 2.4, and also alpha or beta versions with Android Honeycomb 3.0.  Anyway, after a while using the default Viewsonic ROM the device stopped being able to find my music. It just quit showing up in the music player.  I tried other music players, and copying off and back on the music files, but still no luck.  Anyway, I finally got frustrated with this, and decided to take the leap and install a new ROM. It took me 3 attempts to get it to boot properly, having to use both nvflash (needs Windows USB drivers, which were a little difficult to get installed in Win7-64bit) and Clockworkmod. These are both developer tools for changing the ROM.  Anyway, there was a lot of information on the internet about the process, and many had tried and run into similar problems before, so a few quick google searches and I got the new ROM installed.  I went with a stable version of Andoid 2.3, along with some kernal tweaks that allow overclocking the processor. It really flies now, and works even better than before.  It also works with the Google android marketplace once hacked. Of course the Amazon Android marketplace is also very useful and I have made a few purchases there. ;-)Anyway, I am very happy to get a 10.1\" high resolution Android tablet for $300 ($375 with nice carry case and extra 16GB SDHC card (again, from Amazon). It also has made my previous purchase of an internet radio, ipod touch, and Nook ereader not necessary, so those items will be going up on ebay soon. Who knows when I'm done, I may have my total net cost down to less than $200. That would really be awesome!!  So if you have a technical bent, and have possibly hacked or cracked devices before, are willing to keep trying until you get it done (ROM change), do not be afraid to purchase a GTablet. During June 2011, the Gtablets actually dropped to a low price of $249, but quickly turned around and are no longer available for much below $300.

Yes the $500 and $600 dollar tablets are going to work great. The $200 or less ones are NOT going to work. Some how Viewsonic was able to get just the right amount of hardware (10\" screen, SD expansion, 1.3 Mb cam, Dual core, wifi, and 16GB internal) for just $300. Then you add in the fact that it is the easiest tablet to modify with home-brew Android OS's and I say this is an iPad killer. Or at least as close to an iPad killer as you are going to get for HALF the price of an iPad. Like a lot of users I installed a new interface. The g-tab comes with TapNtap installed and the newest version is OK but it does lag and will crash on you several times. I installed TNTlite 4.4 (thanks to all the guys at xda-developers I was able to get this installed in less then an hour with NO experience. I know computers and have some common since when it comes to electronics so I was able to work it out. The main issue that I had was all the tutorials that guides that I watched were based off the old TapNtap interface (3588) and yours may come with (4349). So do some reading at xda-developers and they can fix almost anything. Once I had my tab back down to a 3588 interface it was really easy to install newer faster more stable User interfaces and there are several to choose from. Also there are several youtube videos that really help. So YES even you can mod this device. If you just need this tab for web surfing checking email  and playing Angry Birds then you will be fine right out of the box. The next biggest issue for some is the viewing angle. I haven't seen other screens but this one is fine. Yes it can be hard to see if you lay it on the table then try to see if form 3 feet away. But if you are holding the tablet in your hands  (were it is supposed to be) then it is bright and sharp(1080p looks great). Hope this helps. In closing if your in the market for a tablet BUY this one.

Screen touch is very good. Skype seems to have some issues, but with Microsoft now as owner, good luck to all of us in android world!The real power comes out when you root the tab and install a custom ROM. I am now running Vegan 7 Gingerbread (1.1 tab firmware) and it is awesome, take it to a store and place it next to a Honeyconb tab! Flash and utube work fine in a web browser, better than reduced capability mobile apps. There are several great sites out there which provide clear guidence, make sure to look for the latest posts, the developers move fast.Any smart (and carefull) person can root the tab but be aware of some major items:Make sure you know if you are running 1.1 or 1.2, they are completly different paths.The 1.2 upgrade has been currently pulled back by Viewsonic, but you can find it in the user sites.If you flash to 1.2 you can try the Honeycomb versions in developement.If you stick to 1.1 the developed base is mature.Do you research, I created a new favorites folder for \"gtab\" and just started to save web pages. Lots of utube instructional videos out there too.The real beauty is as an unlocked tab you can move at will to newer, better ROMS. You will be able to do a wireless tether with a rooted smartphone for a home rolled hotspot. You can also overclock the processor which will then scream past a stock Tegra 2 tab.I would have given 5 stars but this is not a plug and play device, however with some relatively lite file loading and attention to procedure you can have a powerfull Andriod tab for a superb price.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best performing Tablet worth your money!!", "Author": "Abdur R Iqbal", "ReviewID": "R22GG0LQW9A50U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Viewsonic  G-Tablet has all the top notch hardware to make it one of the best in the market.

I highly recommend Amazon Prime.  For your $79 annually you get free shipping or really cheap next day service.  And buy one big ticket item during the year and it pays for itself.  I recently purchased a 50\" Samsung HDTV. Shipping alone would have been about $180.  More on that later in my review on that purchase - For now back to the G Tablet... :)The GTablet is a good deal.  $279 for a 10inch tablet.  The stock operating system is OK but it is limited.  The power of this tablet is released when you root it and install a custom operating system on it.  Instructions are all over the internet.  Check XDA-Developers.com.  There is a forum section dedicated to the Viewsonic G-Tablet (and about every other device)Let me tell you about my experience with Amazon and my G Tablet.Like I said earlier - ordered it on April 5th.  Received next day.  Out of the box I suspected a problem with the unit.  For some reason the touch response was TERRIBLE! It would not respond to touches, swipes or other finger gestures that make these tablets so much fun to use.  After it \"warmed up\" for a while, the touch response was better.  But still not as nice and fluid as it should be.  I decided something was wrong after using it for a couple of days and reading information on the net regarding poor touch response.  I went to Amazon.com and selected \"Return Item\" from \"My Account\".  Amazon.com provided me a paid return UPS label via email and immediately processed a replacement shipment even before I shipped the defective one back to them.  This in my opinion is super customer service.  So I boxed up the sick G Tablet in the original packing and sent it back to Amazon by sealing the box, affixing the emailed label to the box, and dropping it off at my local Staples store (UPS Drop station)  Again - no problems whatsoever with the return process.  Thanks Amazon!Okay, so the new/replacement G Tablet got here in two days.  Un-boxed it, charged it up and started to use it.  What a difference!  The G Tablet operated just as it should.  And, the stock Operation System was okay.  Nothing special.  It is an Android environment.  But the G Tablet Application Market is NOT the Android Market.  Lot of Apps available on the Android Market are NOT available on the Viewsonic G Tablet market that is installed.  Also, there really are none of the loved (sic) Android Google apps that I like.  So - Went to XDA-Developers - found at ROM and rooting instructions (VeganTab and Clockwork Mod) and followed the easy instructions available on XDA-Developers.  Now I have a G Tablet that really works GREAT!My recommendation:  The Tablet Market is evolving.  Yes the iPad broke new ground and is doing well.  The Android Tablet landscape is in its infancy in my opinion.  It will evolve RAPIDLY in the next year or so.  Many new Android based tabs are coming out.  Motorola Xoom is nice, Blackberry Playbook (although not Android) is okay for RIM fans and others are cranking out Android tablets at breakneck speeds.  So, don't blow a lot of your hard earned cash on a $500-$600 tablet.  Get a Viewsonic G Tablet (about $250-$279 - shop around) Root it and install a ROM (VeganTab or CyanogenMod are my favs)You get a really nice Android tablet, front facing webcam, Full Android Market, latest Google Apps for a pretty affordable price.  Then in a year or so when the whiz bang super-duper tablets come out, sell your G Tablet on eBay for a couple of hundred bucks, and buy a new tablet.Okay - that's my opinion.

I'm told that if you send it back to the factory they'll upgrade to 2.3.  Maybe it's true.2.  It won't run anything from google play.  They don't support it.  Tough luck, GTablet owners.  Handango has a number of apps, but the selection is poor and the download process is iffy.  I had them send links to the gmail address I use only with the tablet, and half of them DID NOT CONTAIN the download link, although they were supposed to.3.

Discussions with their customer support resulted in my doing a factory reset, destroying all my downloaded apps, email, personalization, etc.  This happening ONCE sucks badly, but I persevered and got it running to my satisfaction again.4.  And then it locked up again.  This is absolutely unacceptable.  At this point I contacted my CC company and have submitted the necessary paperwork so that they will extend the warranty.  I have no idea what's going to happen, but I can't imagine this thing being repairable and Viewsonic -- for obvious reasons -- no longer makes it;  the replacement product is less capable in several essential ways.5.

The processing power and complete feature set make it an excellent tablet to cut your teeth on.  However, you will be much happier if you root it and install one of the custom roms.  I've already installed several and they enhance the value of the tablet.  If you are uncomfortable with flashing roms and tinkering with the setup then this probably isn't the tablet for you and you should spend an extra 150 to 200 and get an Acer Iconia or a Asus Transformer, or Lenovo, all of which are excellent tablets for those who don't want to tinker.Even with tinkering this tablet isn't perfect.  The screen does have a relatively narrow field of view - good for \"privacy\" but not so good when you're in your recliner and trying to balance it just right for viewing.  The second issue I have with the tablet is they copied the shape of the iPad so much it has the same kind of profile which is just about the most difficult to handle shape possible.  I really with more would have followed Toshiba and Asus with textured, rubberized backs so you could hold onto these things well.  They are kind of slippery and uncomfortable to hold in your hands for a long period.  Stupid idea to have these things slick and with the curved back.  It is a base Froyo which is OK but many want to move to Honeycomb, which you can - BUT, you are still a bit limited until Google releases the source code so it can be properly implemented.  Honeycomb on the gTab is OK but still have some hurdles to getting everything working properly.  So, you should probably plan on staying with a Froyo or Gingerbread based rom until that source code comes out.So why did I buy the gTablet?1.  The hardware was at the top on the performance end and had all the essential features; USB (2), SD card, HDMI (with an adapter you buy separately), camera, nice capacitive touch screen in 16\"9 format - although I wish it were 1280 instead of just 1024.2.

However, here is my personal experience and path from 'oh no' (when unpacking) to 'oooh' (after a day).Needless to repeat: The gTablet as delivered comes with horrible firmware to the point of un-usability. It is unresponsive and the applications sluggish. Fortunately, pretty much immediately after gaining wireless access the tablet offers an update to a more recent firmware which installs itself and reboots the device in a matter of minutes. The result is a dramatic increase in speed and better applications. While that is all nice and good - without access to the Android market the software would leave a lot to be desired. Yes, you can read your PDFs using the Adobe Reader (which sucks on Android) or you could get ezPDF off the market - if you could access it. Wouldn't it be great if you could rent movies from the market, watch your NetFlix account and play any of the endless number of free or dirt-cheap games off the market? Once you realize this the shiny gTablet and its market alternative look underwhelming. I felt pretty disappointed. However, after a day of Googling and a USB stick I managed to custom flash my ROM (there are many custom versions freely available) the market can be fully unlocked - and what a difference it makes. (While the process of 'flashing it' sounds dangerous and only for the geek - it's really a five minute process that requires little to no technical know-how.)Seriously, out of the box I felt the gTablet was a *very cool* calculator and email program but that was about it. When custom ROM flashed this dirt cheap appliance is a serious iPad contender. NetFlix video plays back in HD quality and pretty much any market app I purchased or downloaded for free worked flawlessly. I do not fully understand the reasons for the problems the stock device has accessing the market (Viewsonic has a new, better and more expensive device in the works that can?!?!) but once unlocked the sky is pretty much the limit.The only minor gripe I have is with the screen and its limited viewing angle but it's within the limits of my pain threshold.At the price that this tablet now sells for (~$260 as of this writing) it's a steal.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value if you put in a bit of effort", "Author": "Vladimir Costescu", "ReviewID": "R15APVT6JGNJI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my G Tablet on August 2, 2011 and paid a small premium to buy from an Amazon-fulfilled seller so I could get it the next day with Prime. Even with the extra cost of my impatience, the tablet was still under three hundred dollars, and I was happy that I got such a good deal on a 10-inch tablet. iPad, Xoom, and Galaxy Tab be damned, I haven't looked back since.Having done my homework, I immediately ditched the stock OS and installed CyanogenMod (CM)  7 RC1, which ran quite well and gave me no trouble. However, I had been reading about the available Honeycomb (HC) ROMs and decided to give them a shot. I read Ray Waldo's article comparing the three big HC ROMs and decided to go with Gtabcomb (GC). I used it for a few weeks, and it ran fairly well, but not as well as CM7. I didn't want to go back to Android 2.x, though, so I stuck with Honeycomb. Not having tried Flashback (FB), I installed that and have been running it since. While it's certainly not perfect (camera doesn't work and HD video is pretty sketchy), I love the HC interface, and FB seems to run better than GC. I stopped using GC because of its stalled development, and I didn't even try Illuminate because of all the sketchy things I heard about it. I'm hoping that the remaining issues will be solved when Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) and its source code become available. (Side note: I think Google really screwed the pooch by not releasing the HC source. I don't care how hideous or hacked together the source is, Google should have just released the damn thing and let the community fix it for them.)Bottom line: the G Tablet's 10-inch screen, 512 MB RAM, 16 GB storage, 1 GHz Tegra 2 CPU, expandable MicroSD, USB slot, HDMI with Malata Zpad dock, and perfect price point make it the ideal toy (yes, it's a toy) for anyone who can use Google, read a few instructions, and ditch the crappy Tap-n-Tap with some rooting magic.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Problem after only having it for hours", "Author": "Miranda Manning", "ReviewID": "R3DCSL9MU5MKJT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I totally loved this product when i got it last night.

I don't have to worry about it getting too hot or the keyboard getting in the way.I do have a few complaints though. I think the spot for the speakers is pretty dumb. It's in the perfect position for my hands to block them when in Landscape Mode. Pretty stupid. When I plug the mini USB in, it doesn't go in completely. It looks like it's only in halfway. Same goes for the power plug. I'm afraid sometime in the long run, these will become loose. Another weird thing is that the volume button functions are switched. Usually on devices, the Volume Up (+) is on the left and the Volume Down (-) is on the right. When held in its Portrait Mode, I always think about how it should be the other way around. The Android buttons for Back, Menu, Home and Search do not light up when in use. Even my crappy HTC Droid Eris phone has its buttons light up and this thing only uses Android 2.1. Luckily for me, the VEGAn-TAB generously adds those buttons on the screen as part of the interface. Very smart. The charger itself is oversized. It definitely reminds me of [...] . It's not even a box. It's rounded like a stone.I don't mind the screen. I've read enough complaints about it, but I haven't been bothered by it.

The hardware definitely shows in the custom roms and I'm psyched to see what else is out there for this. I took a star off for the ridiculousness of the stock crap. I took another star off because it made me go through the hassle of rooting it. I'm not the most comfortable with this type of stuff. My brother always did it for me with my gaming devices.I'm sorry if I have recycled all the previous complaints and stuff. But I do have one last problem with this. The screen is definitely widescreen or whatever like most phones, tablets, monitors, televisions, etc. But in Portrait Mode, it's too narrow. It's not like holding a book.

But it does show fingerprints easily.  I put on a Skinomi screen saver, and it helps.  Expect to use the internet for info often as you start trying expand your use of this tablet.

A lot of them are no longer applicable. I purchased my Gtablet about a month ago. My thoughts were that I would like to have this for e-Reading. I carry around a lot of VERY thick technical manuals.I am not disappointed! I absolutely love this tablet. With it, I can view all of my Kindle books, B&N; books and any .pdf file books. I can also rent library books (which I've not yet tried to do.) I love that all of my books are in color and the e-reader software is excellent. The .pdf viewer allows me to shrink or zoom by pinching or expanding my fingers on the screen.I do not think the tablet weighs too much. It weighs a LOT less than the books I read, a LOT less! I just bought the Kindle version of a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 book (here on Amazon). First, the physical book is 1700 pages. But, there is a CD that includes another 800 pages in .pdf format since they cannot print a 2500 page book. It's no problem on the Gtablet. The 2500 page e-book version was several dollars cheaper AND the tablet doesn't weigh any more than it did before this and 30+ other books were loaded!The Wi-Fi works pretty well. After initially configuring for each of the wireless routers I connect to (at work and home), I automatically connect wherever I take it. There is no monthly fee!I would agree that finger prints do get on the screen, it is a touch screen after all. I've found that I can touch the very side of the screen to turn pages in my books, so it's not a really big issue. I recommend using one of those micro-sham towels with a little bit of hot breath to really get the screen clean and quickly.I am a computer geek (and have been one for over 30 years). I originally bought the device thinking I was going to load a different OS (still Android, but just a different flavor). I have not done so. I love all of the built-in software. I've been enjoying free games from Amazon on it, too. (Amazon also has many free books!)I love this tablet so much, that I bought three more of them today. I bought one for my wife, my son and another one for me to play around on (trying different OS's, etc.)It's really cool that you can turn the tablet on it's side and the pages in my books will re-format themselves to fit the new orientation.Also on Amazon (for about $20), I purchased a keyboard/cover for the Gtablet. Now, I can hold it like a book when I'm reading. I can kick the back cover out and make it sit like a laptop and use the USB keyboard. Great stuff!This is a really fun toy. The 1080P for watching movies is incredible. The sound is amazing considering the teeny-tiny speakers. There is so much more but I don't want to repeat all of the specs that others have posted. The battery life is about 10 hours for me. Note that it does not use USB for charging. You can use a charger in your car, but it will need to fit the little hole on the side (where the 12volt/2amp Center pin positive) wall charger plugs in.The screen does wash out if not viewed perfectly in front of you. Not a big issue for me though as I didn't buy it to watch movies.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Describing this Tab as horrible would be a compliment", "Author": "James J.

The search, home, function, and back keys on the side are not back-lit, so if you are in the dark it can be kind of annoying.Easy enough to root if you have some technical experience. nvflash is easy enough to use if you flash a bad rom or the device boot loops or gets stuck at the 3 birds logo.I honestly didn't use the stock froyo installed for more than 10 minutes. I flashed directly to CM7 86 nightly. Issues I've had with this rom are after flashing the google apps patch and the market updates, it force closes a lot. This is due to some issue with the new market. To resolve this you can uninstall the new market and use titanium backup, rom manager, or a similar program to \"freeze\" the market updater app which basically disables the android market from updating. The only downside is you're stuck with the old market. For me I don't care. I'm not going to be renting movies on this device anyways, that's what netflix if for.

In no time at all he'd figured out how to connect to the company wifi and was trolling the internet, posting on Facebook and playing games on a couple of other websites. Like I said, this is a very intuitive system.  The gTablet, despite my painstaking (I thought) research, isn't exactly what I wanted in a tablet. That's my fault, though, and not the fault of the tablet itself.

That's where it's my fault.I also had a few problems with the stock virtual keyboard. It failed to recognize keystrokes on numerous occasions.

After just about 6 weeks of use, I can say that I am absolutely hooked on this device.  It does have the flaws many have described (poor UI, viewing angles), but it has an active community dedicated to making it better (Google or Bing \"XDA Developers G Tablet\").  Loading alternative firmware (replacing the UI with a more customizable and standard Android UI) was not difficult to do, nor was accessing the Android market or adding Flash.  In my opinion, doing this makes it a formidable alternative to the IPAD.  When Netflix and Hulu become available, I fear I won't be able to set it down.In comparison to other Android tablets, none are as powerful that even come close to the price of the G Tablet.  This device is a bargain. With the most recent updates, the stock UI is improving, but for my taste, unsatisfying. It's likely some of these other devices have a better UI out of the box, but paying $100-200 more for a better UI on a tablet with inferior hardware isn't necessarily the best option. In reviewing the forum at XDA Developers, I have not found anyone posting they've bricked the G Tablet loading firmware.  Again, the community there is VERY active and very supportive with lots of instruction and assistance.  Rolling up your sleeves and customizing your tablet gives you a sense of satisfaction and makes it more your own ... something far easier to do on an open source platform (Android) vs. a proprietary one (Apple).

Viewsonic licensed an interface called Tap `n Tap that looks like it came straight out of an 8th grade class project. It is bulky, cumbersome and crude. Rather than the Android Market, which is no prize itself, it comes equipped to connect with the Handango market which is indescribably bad in terms of the selection of offerings. If you're at all familiar with Android software, you'll immediately see that most of it is not here. Finally the screen is awful as well, which is very surprising considering that Viewsonic turns out some pretty good monitors. Installing a third-party ROM - which is not everyone's cup of tea - resolves the problem of the pathetic Tap `n Tap interface.I installed VEGAN-Tab. This was my first installing a ROM and with about an hour's research, I did it by the numbers and encountered no problems. I now have an interface which is usable, Adobe Flash and access to the Google Android Market.With VEGAN-Tab installed, the Viewsonic G-Tablet is a pretty good performer.But nothing can improve the limited viewing angles of the screen.

However, once you run the update it's a little bit better. I decided to see how long I could maintain just using the stock OS that came with the tablet. I lasted about a week. The lack of Google Market really made getting the apps I wanted difficult. Using the handango was hit or miss; amazon's marketplace app helped some. But this hide and seek method of getting apps and getting them to work got old quickly.So after much YouTube viewing and forum asking, I rooted it and put another rom on there. It was like night and day, suddenly I had Google Market, most apps weren't force-quitting on me. I even switched out to another rom that I like even more than my first rooted attempt. The device runs smoothly; apps that were closing early on stock started working and I enjoy my tablet.Yes, viewing angles can annoy but you just need to tilt it just so and you're fine. The wireless works great. I've tested the wifi from home and at work with no ill effects. There is no gps in this, so google maps only work via your wifi location which is fairly accurate. The video viewing is rather nice, but it is limited to what kind of files you can use. There are speakers that they are not bad as long as your hand isn't over the speaker ports. The camera is meh.

The front-facing camera, however, is perfect for live video chatting, and snapping pictures of yourself.Another amazing feature is the full sized USB 2.0 port on the left side of the unit. For the price asked, not many tablets have a full-sized usb port. This allows for you to hook up anything from a keyboard case to a wireless remote receiver, greatly adding to the gaming capabilities of this outstanding tablet.Recently, a program came out called 'Onlive.' If you are a serious mobile gamer, this is a MUST HAVE, FREE application. You can purchase games that you would play on your PS3, XBOX 360, and various other consoles, and play right on your tablet. This amazing tablet has such a spectacular processor and display, its like a 10\" portable Playstation, or Xbox!All in all, I am EXTREMELY pleased with the proformance, quality, size, and over all price of this unit. I would recommend it time and again to any one looking for a versatile machine, Android-based, with the potential to run exquisitely detailed games and programs.

Graphically, it has severe aliasing problems which makes it look like a cheap electronics toy from 15 years ago.The viewing angle is horribly poor; you need to be directly over the screen to see anything, which makes the glare issue even worse.The display does not rotate to portrait mode, which is exacerbated by the odd aspect ratio at a resolution of 1024 x 600 (it's not an existing film ratio, so what were they aiming for exactly?)On top of that, the unit is unnecessarily thick and the construction very cheap; the back panel for example is a flimsy piece of plastic.User Interface of web browsing is terrible as the url / web toolbar takes up a fourth of the screen space and the only way to hide this is to enter \"fullscreen\" mode by un-intuitively pressing and holding down on the screen for 5 seconds and then selecting the \"fullscreen\" icon...The company Tap n' Tap, who wrote the software, has done a horrible job, with most of the user's inputs requiring multiple taps. I think the company knows this and chose their name as joke: Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap n' Tap....I really wanted to like this. I desperately wanted to like this, because I'm so tired of Apple and the iPad. But I'm so disappointed by this touchpad. The iPad has a very clear branding, a very clear product line. No matter what, you know that iPad 2 is better than iPad 1. And when iPad 3 comes out, you know it will be better than the previous two. Not so with this one. By name, you cannot distinguish between the: \"Viewsonic gTablet\" and the \"ViewSonic ViewPad\". Which one is better? Which one came first? Why is one called \"tablet\" and the other \"pad\"?Can someone other than Apple come up with a competitive, good-quality touchpad that is part of a consolidated, sensical product line?

I then went to G Tab for Dummies and followed the instructions and rooted it with Brilliant Corners. It is noticeable faster and very stable. I wanted to keep video hardware acceleration so I went with the Froyo based BC. I really like it, I have several computers at home but like being able to just pick up the Gtab and go whereever I want and surf or check emails. YouTube works great and the default app with BC automatically runs at full screen and looks very good. The screen needs to be looked at pretty much straight on but that doesn't bother me. Android Market app comes stock and works great. I really like the default web browser and email app on BC and every game I download works fine. This is a really nice piece and it's too bad Viewsonic screwed up the launch because this should have been a successful major seller for Veiwsonic. As it stands it's a great low cost tablet with good hardware specs and with a little work becomes an excellent new experience in tablet technology.

They basically said when you get it you would to have to root it with newer software. So I got on YouTube and watched a video on how to do it and then ordered the g tablet. We recieved the tablet superfast from the seller Woot,charged it up then turned it on, registered it and then hit the update button about 30 sec later it was done and this tablet runs FANTASTIC!!! without having to do anything else to it.  This hooked right to our wi-fi at the house with no problem. When it hooks up to web sites it may do it a tick slower than the ipad2 but faster than the galaxy tab.So its right there with the tabs that cost twice as much. Screen quality seems pretty good but without being able to compare them side by side I cannot tell for sure but I am happy with the g tabs screen. Speakers are the same as other tabs and they just plain suck. We have some enternal speakers plugged into it and it sounds very good.

The view darkens when you tilt the tablet away, but is only a minor inconvenience. Great definition and color.*The fact that you can personalize the dashboard (desktop) by sliding in what you want to view in each frame is great.*Great sound chip and good speakers which give very pristine sound to the classical music I usually hear.*Fast processor.*Light enough.*Great to have so many free Android apps available.*Easy to use controls, although I would prefer they would be placed on the upper frame instead of the right side frame, for I tend to close webpages or apps accidentaly with my thumb.*I love to have the mini-SD slot and a USB port.*Easy to use and intuitive configuration controls, which allow you to uninstall apps very easy.*Very good battery, with a charge indicator in view.*A very useful pending task or ongoing task indicator, very handy when controlling download and installation of new apps.*Very intuitive web browser controls and navigation.*Two choices of main window design: a classic Windows type one, and a dashboard type with three different setups which you can choose by sliding horizontaly with your finger.*Easy interface with your PC with the included cable. Great to download music or files to your tablet.Few cons:- Sometimes, when I am changing apps very quickly the tablet freezes: by keeping the on button down it shuts down and you can star again.-It takes some time after your daily startup to get your internal music organized and accesible.. but only for about a minute.-Setting up YouTube is a problem, as is getting to use your Gmail account: ironic given Google is the creator of the operating system Android..... :(- The keyboard configuration is English US or English UK (I didn't know they used different layouts!).

The default software setup that is included on it fails to take advantage of the hardware fully, and worse, hides the google marketplace (but is trivial to fix).The upside however is that this is a dual core tegra 2 processor, same as xoom, transformer, and all the rest of the high tech tablets that are coming out. It also manages to beat them in performance courtesy of a slightly smaller screen resolution (1024x600 instead of 1280x800), it also has a built in USB port, and also a built in micro sd card.

If you are looking to pull the Viewsonic G Tablet out of the box and have a great experience you are going to be severely disappointed ( I would rate it at 2-3 stars).  You have to have some technical savy and some motivation to want to modify the device to unlock its full potential.The bad things right out of the box -The viewing angles are terrible.  If you plan on trying to look at the screen from other than right in front at a 90 degree angle the picture gets really bad.Form factor is nothing special.  The tablet is not going to be the thinnest tablet around as it was one of the first Tablets using Tegra 2 platform.  If you hold it for an extended amoutn of time, it can become uncomfortable.  But nothing a stand or docking station can't fix.Software Interface is terrible.  It is slow and clunky out of the box.  The Interface that is laid over the android OS takes up quite a bit of the resources which leads to terrible performance by the tablet.  The nice thing is you dont have to use the stock interface.The Good things about this tabletPrice Point - At $280 you can not find a better tablet after you put a little bit of work into it.Hardware - This tablet is one of the first that was on the Tegra 2 dual core processor.  This processor provides plenty of power to run the different apps and widgets till your heart is content.  It has also been shown in benchmark scores to perform better than the iPad2 and Motorola Xoom with a custom ROM on it. Tegra 2 dual core processor, 512mb flash RAM, up to 32gig micro SD card support, capacitive touchscreen, micro usb + full usb ports, and a docking station port, and a 1.3mp (pretty bleh) front facing camera are what this tablet comes with.Modding - The greatest thing that android has is that it is open source.  This leads to different communities and devs donating their time to make products better as the source codes are open to them.  This tablet has a great community on the XDA Forums.  Developers have put in their hard work to come up with ways to root the phone as well as custom ROMs which make this tablet better than ever.  As of right now there are great Android 2.2 ROMs out that will blow the stock software out of the water.  There are also experimental ROM's for those that like to tinker and test new things.Accessories - If you look up Viewsonic G Tablet accessories you wont find many mainstream accessories for it as it isn't as popular as an iPad or Motorola Xoom, or Samsung Galaxy.  However the reference design leads to being able to find accessories under different names which work and fit perfectly for this device.  There is a docking station for the Malata Zpad that provides power, ethernet, usb, and hdmi ports to the tablet.  There are a handful of cases that also double as stands for the computer.  There are also different skins/screen protectors designed for the tablet.  One great place to look for the accessories is XDA Forums or [...]  IT Steve keeps a good stock of accessories at a reasonable price and is very fast shipping and reliable.

The wifi became reliable, the applications were usually solid, and the system behaved very well. It was arguably the best of the four ROMs I tried.However, it is *NOT* a Google Android Device. The Google applications are missing: contacts don't sync with google contacts, the calender doesn't sync with the google calendar, etc. Most notably, the market is the HandanGo market, not the google application market. Not only is the selection poor, but the apps I tried were all badly out of date when compared to the versions on the google market.Looking at the TapNTap software they provide - and the startup sequence - this tablet is clearly meant to replace the whiteboard in the kitchen, or something similar. You enter family members as part of the startup, and get displays of news/weather, or calender & todo lists entries.As a sop to those wanting an Android device, it's possible to switch to a more classical Android home. You can even install other Home screens if you can get to them - but you want to choose one that lets you set the # of rows/columns on the screen & in the app drawer, otherwise it'll be the 4x4 array of a stock Android phone.Bottom line: if you want a tablet for sharing with your family, this actually works reasonably.

If you are concerned about image, this may not be your tablet.  It is not as \"sexy\" as other tablets on the market today, but it should do fine if image is not a conern of yours.Those are my only complaints.  I'm not certain spending $500+ on a tablet is the way to go when you can pick up this tablet at a much more affordable cost. Just take into consideration the cons of this tablet.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a great choice", "Author": "db \"db\"", "ReviewID": "RXQO9J6LIEFMC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one of these refurbished and used it some (my unit stopped working about a month after I bought it), but I do NOT recommend it because it is bulky, clunky in terms of software, the screen is terrible, and the wifi was not as strong as my PCs.

I read a lot of positive reviews for it and was totally stoked to get it into my hands and through it's initial paces. Unfortunately, the love affair with this gTablet quickly ended within a couple of days of ownership.I agree with all the other reviewers \"Pros\" for why you should buy this, so I don't need to rehash any of that too deeply here. Yes, it's a technically sound device that packs a lot of horsepower for the price. You definitely won't find anything anywhere near this price with similar hardware capabilities.As others have said, you're also going to want to root the device and get a better ROM for it. The stock OS is ok with their latest update but I just don't understand what they were thinking by not loading this thing up with all the necessary Google apps and access to the actual android market. I guess Viewsonic must receive a cut of the purchases with the second-rate app market they partnered with out of the box. If you dare, \"viewsonic-gtablet-for-dummies.webs DOT com\" is a great site for figuring out how rooting is accomplished. A lot of reviewers say it's easy to root this device, and they're right about that, for those of us with experience in doing so with other similar devices. However, without very specific instructions, a lot of less technically inclined folks will definitely get tripped up with the process. I could just imagine my 70 year-old aunt trying to decide which ROM she should try out for her particular ROM branch... Not happening.If you're inclined to tinkering with your OS, then by all means \"hack\" away, but you probably won't be too impressed with the OS as it comes out of the box, you may want to steer clear or buy in the hope for a quick wait for them to release a stock upgrade to Android's gingerbread or even honeycomb OS versions.Software wasn't really the issue however... The dealbreakers for me with this device lie entirely with the hardware design.1. The weight. Even though the specs say it's only 6oz more than an iPad, this thing feels like you're holding a brick by comparison. The wife has an iPad2, it's thinner and feels significantly lighter by comparison. I'm a pretty big guy, and I do a lot of bedtime surfing, this thing is just too heavy to do hold onto for any extended period of time. I tried using a stand I also purchased to prop the tablet up on my chest/stomach, but then you're faced with dealbreaker #2 The cheap, slick backing doesn't help at all for grip either.2. The button positioning. When held in landscape mode with my big banana hands, the buttons on the right side of the device are right where my hand naturally wants to hold it. As you can guess, that creates a great deal of frustration when navigating the web and using different apps with all the accidental thumb brushes on the 'home', 'search', 'menu' and 'back' buttons. Yes, I'm aware that these buttons can be disabled and that some ROMS duplicate the buttons on the screen, however using those buttons presents issues of their own because of their non-intuitive placement on the bottom left while holding the device in landscape mode. My thunmbs don't bend back that far.3. The viewing angles of the LCD. Unless you're looking straight at this thing at just the right angle, you're not going to be able to see what's on the screen with any degree of accuracy. Forget watching videos with a friend at arms reach unless you're shoulder to shoulder with them. One of my few pleasures in life is watching funny 'net clips in the sack with my wife, this device makes it nearly impossible to share the experience with her.4. USB Charging. Something I really should have taken note of prior to purchase, but this device cannot charge while plugged into a computer or portable battery pack supplying USB voltage. You have to use the AC charger. Ugh. so much for that 11,000 mAH battery pack I've got.5. Fingerprint Magnet. Unless you want to be constantly wiping this thing off, you may want to get yourself a stylus. I can't believe how gross it looks in the morning when the sun shines on it after a late evening of surfing.6. The screen dimensions. The screen is great for watching 16:9 video in landscape mode. When reading books/magazines/pdf's in portrait mode however, it's a somewhat awkward resolution as the pages don't naturally fit within the narrower confines of the LCD. Thus, as a reader, it's not the best choice.7. The single front-facing camera is far from great. Would suffice for general skyping, but that's about it.So there you go, I hope this proves helpful. This could have been a great tablet if they would have thought it through a little more. All I can say is that I'm glad they accept returns, just wish I didn't have to pay for shipping.

It doesn't use the traditional Android Market Place, it has its own. The only thing I am using it for at this time is to listen to Pandora Radio. This is also the worst version of the Pandora Application I have seen; but it was on this devices market place. There have been at least two updates applied to the device. It still is very clunky, in that it is slow to context switch and to respond to key presses. With each update it does get a little better; but this thing feels like a generic port of the Android 2.2 OS. I have a Droid Incredible (un rooted) and it is far superior as an Android device. The other annoying thing is the default application/desktop/wallpaper, maybe again with rooting it may be possible to change the settings, and get the traditional Android Market Place. After I first powered the device up I had it get into a situation where the browser would crash all of the time, and this thing is heavily dependent upon the browser. The situation was fixed by doing a hard power cycle, and it hasn't acted up since. The display on this thing is bright; but a very limited viewing angle, maybe +/- 45 degrees of perpendicular.This thing has a lot of the specs to be a top notch tablet (except the display); but that is if the manufacturer puts some resources behind updating and adjusting the port of the Android OS. It feels like it was intended to be something like the Sony Dash which costs a lot less money.

When the iPad was announced I thought it would be a perfect device for my mother to explore the internet with. This reason I thought this, is that she was always afraid of doing something wrong on her laptop. With a tablet there is low risk of messing something up, and you use your hands to navigate. My problem with the iPad was the cost of the machine. I am in college and do not have the money to throw $500 into a gift. But $300 is a whole lot easier to stomach. Since I have gotten the device for her, she has used it all the time. She now surfs the web on it when she is on her lunch break at work or when she is watching TV at home. I planned on rooting the device for her so that she could get the whole Android Market. But she hasn't really wanted that much to do with excess apps, so I have yet to do it.

I went to my local OfficeDepot & they had one set up to play with - it had all the latest updates from Viewsonic. There was nothing slow about this puppy - very quick response, easy to flip between standard Android 2.2 interface & Viewsonic's (which was also very intuitive). Liked the IO options vs the 30-pin Apple proprietary interface. Only one camera not a big drawback to me. Anyway, never having played with Android (Win 6.1 work phone) this unit at OfficeDepot was very intuitive to use & was very responsive.The only thing about ANY tablet that still bugs me is the (seemingly) easy/intuitive way to print (w/o having to buy the latest version of HP printers).

Strong developer community at XDA3. At 270$ it is not a terrible price for a 10'' machineCons:1. Awful viewing angles2. Heavy3. Android buttons (home, menu, back, search) are not illuminated4. Unable to fully utilise the Tegra 2 as some apps (Dice Player) require hardware accelerated Honeycomb rather than Froyo or Gingerbread5. Unable to access many tablet apps as they are locked into the Honeycomb market6. Honeycomb roms are not hardware accelerated and limited to 3.0.1Thoughts:Booting up the Viewsonic tablet you see 3 birds with vivid plumage with the caption \"See The Difference\". This seems like a horrible joke to me as the only difference I could see from my Galaxy Tab 10.1, a friend's Thrive or Transformer was that the viewing angles were beyond just being noticeable to being a hindrance to general usage of the tablet.I understand that this tablet is nearly half the price of the 10.1 but the sheer lack of quality that went into this machine is boggling. Having owned a B&N; Nook Color I can say that the notion of illuminated buttons is not a new thing that Viewsonic could not have imagined on a tablet and its absence is quite handicapping when trying to read at night.Much like the other Malata zPad lines this will probably never have HW accelerated Honeycomb and may never see official Ice Cream Sandwich although given the talents of the people at XDA and if Google makes ICS less closed than HC then we might just see it.Overall Review:This product is currently useful only as an occasional toy for a child who might break something more valuable but I think even a 4 year old would begin crying for an iPad 2 after 5 minutes with this thing.

Android Marketplace is inaccessible, as is the pre-installed Gmarket app. An experienced Android tech at the store spent 5 hours getting some more useful apps for us, but apologized profusely when he was done as it was still pretty useless. It does play movies in 2 or 3 formats (not AVI), and is semi useful as a kindle reader. I have to download hacked apps on my netbook and transfer them. It often closes windows for no reason (no, I am not accidentally tapping icons on the upper right) or shuts down completely with a full battery. Geeks will say this is a great tablet once it is re-rooted, requiring some tech skills, many downloads and several hours of tweaking. I would rather skip it off the shore of a lake or drive over it many times. Finally, try to read a PDF file with no \"goto page number\". You finally make it to page 235 then Acrobat disappears for no reason. Open the PDF again.  . . on page one. Then flip slowly (or else it crashes) back to page 235 if you dare.

Last week I added this item to my friends wish list and was coming back to buy the first batch today.  Boy, was I surprised to see that this unit jumped in price from $364.00 to $438.00, a $74.00 jump.  I am very happy that I did not originally purchase the first set last week just to come back next month in Feb to see this price hike.  I am not sure about what most people believe, but I am quite certain that a 20% increase in a week is ridiculous.  This is especially true for a device that is barely holding four stars.  If you are looking to purchase one of these hold your horses just a little while and maybe these will come back down to $364.00 or close to it.Submitted by Stephanie at approval of Tisha.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this product", "Author": "jokil", "ReviewID": "R3HMMF2U61RNKU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "- viewing angle is the worst of any tablet- slow, slow,slow- touch screen is the worst I have seen-slow, slow,slow- can't find my wireless network- slow, slow, slow- buttons don't always function- slow, slow, slow- build quality is sub-standard", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gtab from Viewsonic", "Author": "PMV \"PMV\"", "ReviewID": "R26VQD6P0YYA4U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Tablet needs a lot of work.
