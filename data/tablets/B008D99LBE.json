Big mistake. This product is poorly built, has very poor screen resolution and display, and would not function correctly out of the box. After letting charge to full capacity and attempting to use, this product would not function correctly. For the few minutes it would actually work, there was a literal 4-5 second delay EVERY time after pressing screen for command. The rest of the time, the product would do nothing but blink on and off constantly and have to be rebooted  After spending a half day of fooling with this nonsense, it's packaged back up and headed back to amazon. Save yourself the $11 return shipping cost and stay away, buy something with a trusted name brand. You get what you pay for and I learned it the hard way with this purchase.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, 7 inches Display\nAll winner ARM CORTEX A8 OMAP 3 1.2 GHz\n0.5 GB RAM Memory\n802_11_BGN wireless", "Name": "Kocaso MID-M760 7-Inch Tablet (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415Hl722r9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008D99LBE"}}
