{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good buy if you are realistic about what it is.", "Author": "J. Williams \"Jim Williams\"", "ReviewID": "R24DPD3NVPMQ65", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A friend of mine purchased one of these for as a gift for someone and asked me to check it out for them.  The first thing you need to understand about this device is that it is not meant to be and never will be an Ipad or a $500 tablet.  It is a reader with some additional capabilities. A lot of complaints I see on other reviews here are the result of expecting a $500 device for $100 or less.Perhaps the biggest weakness of the device is the Resistive touch screen. Consumers are used to the response of a capacitive touch screen such as the ones on Iphones and other smart phones.  These are very responsive to contact. The resistive screen is different.  It is actually an overlay screen which is sensitive to pressure.  Simply touching the screen is not enough, you have to apply a little pressure. This is something you just have to get used to.  If you can't adapt to the feel of the screen, something to try is a rubber tipped stylus.  These have a soft rubber tip that will allow for more precise selection than the tip of your finger.  In my opinion it works much better and makes the reader much more friendly. It also avoids the otherwise unavoidable finger smudges on the screen.  The screen on this device is fairly glossy and the fingerprints really show up.The Android OS 2.0 standard on the device is a little long in the tooth.  You will find applications that will not run on it, but there are literally thousands of apps out there that will.  To be honest I have been able to find a compatible version of every app that I wanted to run on mine with a little searching on the internet. One of the best sources I've found is [...].  They have the most recent versions of apps but also usually have several prior versions.  If the newest doesn't work on 2.0, one of the prior releases normally will.  These little inconveniences are just something you have to put up with if you want a tablet for $100 or less.Another note about apps...they install to the system memory NOT the internal or external SD cards.  System memory in this reader is only 256 mb and about 190 mb of that is used for the OS and pre installed software. Many apps only occupy a mb or two, but some of them are much larger, Accuweather for instance is almost 6 mb. You are not going to be able to install dozens of apps on here at one time. The mention of 2 or 4 gb of storage refers to the internal SD card which is used to store user files such as photos, video clips, music, etc. Apps use this space for some of their storage needs but the app itself installs to the very small and not upgradeable system memory. There is an external SD slot that allows you to expand the storage space up to 32gb...but again, this is not available for app installations unless you modify the device and install third party software to accomplish this.  There are programs for this but I have not seen too many successful reports using them on this device.One very positive thing about the Cruz is battery life...it will run a long, long time on a charge...probably 8 - 10 hours depending on how you are using it. Also, the thing is built like a tank.  It is fairly heavy and not at all flimsy or cheap feeling.Making it better:Out of the box the only source of apps is the Cruz Market which is basically a handful of the most common apps. If you don't want to do any modifications of the reader, you will need to install another source of apps such as amazon appstore. In its stock setup you will not be able to access the android marketplace. Sources like the freewarelovers site mentioned above are accessible through the browser, and have direct links to install the programs. If you try to install an app and get a \"parsing error\", it probably means it is not compatible with the 2.0 OS.If you are a little brave you can replace the stock operating firmware with a custom version. Most of these will upgrade the OS to 2.1 or a modified version of 2.0 that will make it much more functional, including the complete google apps suite and access to the Android Market app store.  This is not hard to do in it's simplest form, as long as nothing goes wrong, but anytime you do something like this there is the potential of something going wrong and rendering your device completely non functional and voiding your warranty.  Do a lot of research on any ROM update you are considering installing and be aware of problems experienced by others.  Most problems can be fixed but it may require a higher degree of technical ability than that of the average user.After playing with the CRUZ I was evaluating for my friend, I purchased one for myself. At $79.95 locally, it is well worth the price even with some of the limitations mentioned above.  Mine is now running Macho CRUZ firmware and doing everything I want to do on it including Facebook, Kindle Reader, Youtube (using a standalone app...the browser does not support adobe flash), Gmail, POP3 Mail set up for my business email account, basic web browsing, music playing, note taking, etc...not bad for a $79.95 Reader in my opinion.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Even What You Pay For", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3ELTJ4O0KI70I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Absolute garbage. When they say it is a touch screen, it really means that you have to pound it to get any kind of response from the device. Not only that, but it is not sensitive to even open the right selections you have made. You press on one button and something else opens up...sometimes. Sometimes it just sits there doing nothing. It runs on an antiquated Android system that is not compatible with anything, really.

This \"touchscreen\" is the worst I have ever seen, I was forced to buy a stylus for him. Well on top of that 3days out of the box the stupid thing just shuts off and won't come back on. I tried contacting the company with no response so i filed and A to z claim with amazon. Finally the orignal company responds and says because I reported them to amazon they would not give me a refund. The next day Amazon lets me know that my claim was denied because even though amazon provides 90days for you to file a claim the original seller only offers 30days and I should have \"read the terms on the 3rd parties website\" the whole point of me ordering on here is to ensure ill get my moneys worth.

It's only as of this weekend that I've had the patience to get the darn thing up to speed. Now that it's working (i.e., I've downloaded some books, surfed the web, accessed facebook, downloaded the Kobo and Amazon Kindle apps, and figured out that you need a stylus/toothpick to navigate the screen), I think it's OK.The thing that seems to frustrate most new users of this Cruz is that it is not responsive to finger touch. The Cruz R102 has resistive technology which means a stylus is the best way of using the touch screen. Had the manufacturer spent an extra fifty-five-cents to include a stylus on with the Cruz users would realize this. Instead we pulverize our fingertips and wonder why the screen doesn't work like every other touch screen we're now used to does. Once I learned that a stylus/toothpick provided the \"good touch\" that the unit required navigation was much easier.The next biggest problem for me was, seriously and I'm not embarrassed to say, finding the keyboard. Laugh if you want but the Cruz is not intuitive. This matter was solved by placing the stylus in any field that required entry. (In my mind, I expected the keyboard to reveal itself if its use was needed.)Downloading apps from CruzMarket was a no-brainer. Easy, peasy. Finding the apps once they were downloaded? Where the heck are you? Solution: select ASTRO, apparently the brains of the Android world, to find and install the the downloaded app.Connecting to WiFi was not problematic for me. The thing that might be an issue for some is that there seems to be a delayed response when you tap the screen to turn on WiFi. If you tap-a-tap-tap the process gets gummed up so patience is required; tap to Turn On Wifi then wait for a few moments.As I said, I bought the Cruz R102 in January 2012. Honestly, the only reason I still have it in July, seven months later, is because I couldn't locate the box to return it to the store. I had put the tablet aside and haven't touched it at all since February.I spent this weekend figuring out technology, including how to recover lost my vacation photos that I accidentally deleted (recuva, great free program--got back all 333 photos). I also spent time on line tracking down Cruz info and manuals from the manufacturer (Velocity) and user groups such as Slatedroid. And did I mention patience? Patience was certainly the most important factor.Yesterday and today I've surfed the web, downloaded books from Kobo and Amazon, shopped for apps, logged onto facebook and probably a few more things than I remember. The Cruz R102 doesn't play youtube videos but I've read there's a workaround. Maybe I'll look into it later. Internal storage is limited. But for a few bucks above fifty including taxes I think it's an OK deal. Patience is a virtue. Maybe my resolutions will reduce your need for patience.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Who has the money for an Ipad?", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Hrdboplvr\"", "ReviewID": "R3SQXIQIXRUA8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this Cruz for a few months now and I enjoy it more than my Acer Iconia.

While it does not download games, I have a Yahoo mail app, E-buddy and other apps for music which I do not use.  I can watch You Tube videos and movies after upgrading to 2.21.  I got my reader from Walmart for 90 bucks and I have been totally satisfied.  At times it appears slow but this depends what wireless network I tap into.  I have two apple Mac books and did not want to make Apple any richer.

Thank you WorldWide Distributors for the very fast shipping!  My wife got this for me for less than $50 only because I had a $25 gift check and others.All I needed was an e-reader capable of reading epub, kindle, ebooks, pdf, and stuff from the public library.  I wanted an e-reader so that I don't have to bring a lot of books in my bag when I go to work.  I also wanted this to have a bible on it so it would be easier for us in church.  This baby certainly met all my requirements.  It can browse the web too but does not have flash which means you can't view videos on the web like youtube and others.  No, you can't install Angry Birds on this one but I'm too old for that.  I do not intend to play games on this unit anyway.  Yes it only has Android 2.0 but it's all I need.  Thanks to the internal 2GB, I can load pictures and videos that I want to take with me and a lot more space.  I do not need to buy an extra sd card for now.  I had to convert video files though to make it playable on this unit.  I also have a few MP3's on it but I do not intend to make it as an MP3 player.  The build is great!  Feels solid and durable.  It  is a little heavy but not much... not a big deal for me.  It certainly looks better than a flimsy Maylong that I previously ordered for my wife and returned because the wifi is unstable.I am pretty much pleased with this unit considering that i got it for the price of a digital picture frame.  If you want more from an e-reader or a tablet for games and what not, get an ipad or a laptop.  I have read about doing some tweaks to have a higher Android version but I don't need it.  it works good enough for me out of the box.I would certainly consider a Velocity Micro product if the need arises.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "poor connectivity", "Author": "Debbie D.
