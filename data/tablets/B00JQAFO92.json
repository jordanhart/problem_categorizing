{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One hell of a tablet", "Author": "C. Carmona", "ReviewID": "R3M37E07KXEPVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*** Updated 5/8/2014 - if you're using Dolphin Browser with Adobe Flash player do yourself a favor and do NOT update Dolphin Browser if prompted to in the Google PlayStore. It seems like every time they update Dolphin there's a chance for Flash to no longer work without jumping through more hoops ***I come from a Windows OS background and I'm an ex-Apple iPhone (now Galaxy Note 2) and iPad user. I've been waiting a long time for a tablet like this to be released: a large screen, expandable memory and the freedom of Android. Thanks to my Note 2 I have a little over a years of experience with Android OS but I knew what to expect from the Note Pro 12.2. Originally I had my eyes set on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, Black), after months of waiting and playing I decided to bite the bullet and buy it. Just before doing so I read of a possible 12\" model coming out in the following year so I figured another 6 weeks of waiting can't hurt and patience definitely paid off.Comparing the Note 10.1 2014 Edition and the Note Pro 12.2:One big issue that annoyed me with the Note 10.1 2014 Edition (\"14E\") was the ridiculous My Magazine app that never goes away. It constantly hogs system resources as it runs in the background even after forcing shut downs of the app, and disabling the Home button link to this app didn't help as it would just keep running in the background. I noticed that the 14E was constantly using 1.5-1.7GB of its 3GB RAM total at all times even after factory resets, disabling apps and reboots. Thankfully the Note Pro 12.2 (\"NP12\") doesn't have this issue as it hovers around 1.2GB of memory used after a reboot. Even having pages of the magazine feeds and widgets running it still allocates memory usage better and best of all: no pesky My Magazine app!Luckily I was able to compare both tablets side by side at the local Best Buy. This was a large factor in my decision to go with the NP12 over the 14E. Both tablets are about the same when it comes to hardware but there are other major differences between the two. Let's go over some of the features that the NP12 has over the 14E...1. Over 2 extra inches of real estate on the screen. This means writing on the NP12 with the stylus while in portrait mode is very much like writing on a real piece of 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper, aka standard notebook paper. The palm rejection does a great job of making sure only the stylus gets recognized for input (if you want that on). I find that a 10 inch screen is too cramped to comfortably write notes on. Do your research, this is a 12 inch tablet so don't be surprised and don't consider it a downside.2. Larger, longer lasting battery rated at 13 hours (9,500 mAh) versus the 14E's 9 hours (8,220 mAh). My mixed use gets me anywhere from 8 to 12 hours before plugging it in for a charge, depending on what apps I'm using and what the brightness/volume is set at. Lots of gaming/graphic intensive apps will exhaust the battery quickly whereas reading PDFs, E-books, etc. is where the battery really stretches its legs. There are numerous settings and options for the tablet to use minimum energy which I will go over later.3. Multitasking on the NP12 is fantastic. Multi Window allows you to run 2, 3 or 4 apps on screen at once (the 14E supports up to 2 apps side by side). There are many apps compatible with Multi Window. You can also resize the windows depending on where you need the most room on the screen. Chatting with friends on Hangouts, surfing on Dolphin Browser, watching your favorite movie and checking/writing Emails all on the same screen is productivity at it's finest. You can save Multi Window templates too for quick access so that you don't need to drag the apps one by one every time you want to multitask. Just select your template and all the apps open up automatically. I usually have 3 apps going at once: Video (or Music) at the top left, AquaMail at the bottom left and Dolphin Browser taking up the entire right side of the screen.Bonus feature: there is a trick that allows more than 4 apps open at once on the NP12, up to 9 apps total. First use Multi Window to load up whatever 4 apps you want on the screen, then hold the S-pen above the screen and press the pen's button which bring up Air View. On the Air View pop-up select Pen Window. Now use the S-pen to draw a box and then choose an app to launch in that box. The app loads up in the box you drew. It comes up as a floating window that can be resized, moved around on the screen and also minimized to a floating \"bubble\" that you can move around anywhere you want. You can do this 5 times total. So 4 apps via Multi Window and 5 apps via pen window. The Multi Window apps are all joined on the main screen while the 5 pen window apps are solo floating windows and can be minimized to a bubble to have them out of the way. Pretty cool!4. KitKat 4.4: the new \"Magazine Home\" user interface (UI) is a little like Windows 8 but at the same time its different. After playing with it for a little while you'll actually want to use it and set up multiple pages filled with your news subscriptions, feeds, widgets, etc. I did not think I would like the dashboard/widget style UI but on a screen this size it works well and looks great. Basically you can set up different pages filled with all sorts of widgets ranging from:Application widgets (Email, Calendar, Music, Video etc.)Social widgets (Twitter, Flickr, YouTube etc.)News widgets (Art & Culture, Science & Technology, News, Style, Sports, Business, etc.)Each news category has dozens and dozens of publications to subscribe to and I find myself spending more time reading articles than I ever thought I would. If you're not a fan of the new UI the familiar Android desktop is still there with your standard icons and widgets. If you'd rather customize the tablet completely I highly recommend Nova Launcher.Those are the main differences to me. Now onto some general information about the tablet as well as apps I use and features worth checking out:Like every other phone, tablet and computer out there the NP12 does come with some bloatware. There are different types of bloatware so I'll cover each one:1. Some preloaded apps can be uninstalled completely giving you back some minor storage space. This is a good thing.2. Some preloaded apps cannot be uninstalled and instead can have \"most\" of their data cleared and then \"turned off\" - these apps remain installed on the tablet but are disabled. Some of the preloaded apps that can only be \"turned off\" are Chrome, e-Meeting, DropBox, Gmail, Google+, Twitter, Cisco WebEx and others. These are just some that I do not use myself so I turned them off. Even when turned off/disabled, these apps still take up some room but its very little, 5MB or less per app.3. Some apps cannot be uninstalled nor can they be turned off. They can have most of their data cleared though. Either way this is just plain stupid. I can only think of two off the top of my head: Evernote and RemotePC. I don't use these particular apps at all so why can't I at least disable them so they don't show up in my apps list? Both of these apps use about 9MB of space combined. Again it's not a deal breaker for me but Samsung y u do dis?!I bought the 32GB model. The tablet needs about 6-6.5GB for the operating system and preloaded software/apps. Out of the box you have around 25.5GB of space to play with, this of course depends on what preloaded apps you choose to keep/update or disable/uninstall so your free space will vary. A great investment would be a SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A, which gives you another 60GB~ of extra space for apps, movies, music, pictures, whatever you want to put on it. This SD card plus the tablet's free space adds up around 85GB which for me was more than enough. It's very easy adding your media files to the SD card, just plug the card into your PC with the supplied adapter and create folders like Music, Movies, etc. then copy/paste or drag and drop Artists folders into the Music folder, and videos into the Movies folder. I loaded music, movies and pictures on the SD card and I leave the tablet's internal storage for apps since applications seem to run faster off of the internal storage as opposed to off the SD card. If you think you need more space you can go big with SanDisk's newest 128GB card also found on Amazon.The screen is beautiful. High quality photographs and wallpapers at the native resolution (2560x1600 or bigger) look really, really good. If you're looking for some stunning wallpaper for your tablet check out:interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/widescreen_16:10/2560x1600/This model is WiFi ONLY! There is NO slot for a SIM card. The WiFi model also works with your MiFi device and can also connect to the internet via a mobile hotspot such as your iPhone or Galaxy smartphones. I use my Note 2 smartphone as a mobile hotspot and it works great.If you are looking for the 4G/LTE version you'll need to check out the model that Verizon offers. It's available through Verizon or here on Amazon, just search \"note pro 12.2 verizon\"GPS - yes the tablet has GPS built in, you do not need to be connected to the internet for GPS to work (such as the Google Maps app).Hancom Office is included with the NP12. This is Microsoft Office for Android, simple as that. You get full versions of word processing (Word), spreadsheets (Excel), and slideshow (PowerPoint). It all works very well with the large 12.2\" screen and I find it very familiar after using MS Office for so long. You can even open existing word, excel and powerpoint documents with Hancom Office and continue editing and creating. Hancom Office is fantastic, however I must admit it was a little involved to get it up and running, so I will explain as best I can: After the initial setup of your NP12, go to your apps (bottom right, little white squares) and launch the \"Samsung Apps\" app, it will require an update so go ahead and download then install the update. After that is done, go back to your apps and launch Hancom Viewer (there is also a Hancom widget in one of the two default Magazine Home screens if you want to launch it that way). When you launch it a small white box should come up and it will say installing fonts and files, etc. so let it do that and when its done the Hancom Viewer app should open completely. On the left side select Office Download, then OK. This should open the Hancom Office Update Manager. When you do this there's a good chance the Update Manager will prompt you to update it so go ahead and do that. After its updated you can launch it again, the Hancom Office Update Manager is where all the Hancom apps are downloaded/updated/installed. You'll see 12 rows of Hancom apps such as Hcell, Hshow, Hwp, etc. Update and/or install all the ones that need to be done by pressing the rectangular button at the far right of each row. Each time you press the install or update button on the far right it will take you to Samsung Apps where you can press the Update button. Go ahead and update all 12 apps if needed, some may already be updated but will need to be installed (or vice versa). Once every button on all 12 rows is greyed out in Hancom Office Update Manager, then you know you're done! Now just go to your apps and launch whichever one you like. Hcell is excel, Hshow is powerpoint, and Hword is word processor.Hangouts is a cool app and it comes with the tablet. It lets you text/message anyone with an email address or phone number. If you are familiar with iMessage then you know what this is.*** UPDATED BELOWDolphin Browser is a must for surfing the web. It is fast, supports tabs, and has a cool feature named speed dial. A speed dial is a bookmark placed on the Dolphin home screen for easy, one-tap access to the webpage. You can have pages of speed dials, its very useful and beats going down a list of bookmarks looking for a particular site.Perhaps the best feature of Dolphin Browser is that it supports Adobe Flash and Java. I bet your iPad can't do that! What is Adobe Flash? Many of the websites you visit require flash to display the content properly, some websites even have flash animation and to play those you will need the flash player. One example of flash required content is Youtube videos, and Youtube videos that are embedded in other websites. Here is how to enable Flash on the NP12:cultofandroid.com/49840/install-flash-player-android-4-4-kitkat/*** NOTE: the link to download the Flash Player Installer on the website above is broken. Here is an updated working link for the Flash Player installer: downloadandroidfiles.org/Files/Apps%20%28APK%29/KitKat.Adobe.Flash.Player.11.1.apkWhen you're all done installing Flash player you should head over to the official Adobe Flash website to test the flash player so that you know it works. On the website you should see a bouncing red box. If not just refresh the page and you should see it the second time around. The Adobe page to test your flash player is:adobe.com/software/flash/about/PROTIP: ONCE YOU GET DOLPHIN BROWSER AND FLASH PLAYER UP AND RUNNING, DO NOT UPDATE DOLPHIN BROWSER IN THE PLAYSTORE UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. It's not worth taking the chance of the update messing up Flash Player.Amazon Instant Videos - yes, you can watch them on this tablet. Yes, you'll need Dolphin Browser and Adobe Flash installed and correctly configured. If you followed the aforementioned links you should be all set by now. Here is another link specifically dealing with streaming Amazon Instant Videos on KitKat 4.4, which is the tablet's operating system. This worked for me and it should work for you!:the-digital-reader.com/nates-reviews/stream-amazon-instant-videos-android-tablet/*** UPDATED ABOVESplashtop 2 Remote Desktop is a remote desktop app that you can download for free and in my opinion works better than the RemotePC app that comes preloaded on the tablet. This app allows you to access your PC or Mac's desktop environment so that you basically have your entire PC/Mac on your tablet. It takes advantage of the 12.2\" screen by filling it entirely with your computer's desktop. This is useful since you can run all your PC/Mac programs right on your tablet. It works really well and is probably my favorite app that I have come across. There is an optional paid upgrade to the app that let's you remote into your PC/Mac from anywhere. For now I am just using the free version to access my Windows PC, very cool and worth the download.If you want to connect this tablet to your HDTV, a projector or anything with an HDMI input, you'll need a Samsung MHL HDMI adapter. This adapter allows you to mirror your tablet's screen onto your HDTV or other source. I also noticed that you can play a movie on the tablet (which also displays on your TV) and still use the tablet for other apps while the movie plays uninterrupted in the background of the tablet but still in full view on the TV. In other words you can play your movies or shows on the big screen while surfing the net or whatever apps you want to use on the tablet. This adapter is available here on Amazon but I chose to buy mine off of ebay. If the one sold on Amazon does not say \"shipped and sold by Amazon\" there is a good chance you will get a cheap knockoff adapter that will not work, just read the reviews from other buyers for yourself. If you want to try your luck the adapter can be found here: Samsung ET-H10FAUWESTA Micro USB to HDMI 1080P HDTV Adapter Cable for Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2 - Retail Packaging - White. The seller I found on ebay is selling the legitimate Samsung adapters that have the hologram sticker and QR Code on the box indicating that it is a genuine Samsung product. Mine arrived promptly and works great. Save yourself the headache and get a genuine one here: ebay.com/itm/350958988570Bluetooth is available so you can connect a BT mouse and keyboard if you like. Samsung makes an S Action mouse especially for the Note Pro and Tab Pro line of tablets and it works very well. The mouse buttons are specifically linked to actions such as Recent apps, Multi Window, Back, Menu, etc. I got to play with this mouse recently and it's fun although I opted not to buy it as I don't see me using the mouse enough. If you are interested its available at Best Buy (search ET-MP900DBEGUJ) and here on amazon: Samsung S Mouse for Tablets (ET-MP900DBEGUJ)You can also connect USB peripherals to the tablet using a USB OTG cable like this: Black Color Micro USB 3.0 9pin OTG Host Flash Disk Cable for Samsung Galaxy Note3 N900 N9000 10cm. This allows you to connect a number of USB devices such as a mouse, keyboard, flash drive, external hard drive, even a PlayStation 3 controller to the tablet with the ability to access them - If you have a lot of movies on your external hard drive you can use the OTG cable to connect it to the tablet to watch movies. Another example is if you have a thumb drive on your keys, you can connect it to the tablet to access all your files. You can connect more than one USB device at a time by using a USB hub along with the OTG cable mentioned before. I don't recommend connecting more than two devices at the same time in the USB hub, especially if its a device that sucks up a lot of power like an external hard drive.Netflix, Vudu, Amazon Kindle, Google Earth all work great, no issues. If you want to stream video from the tablet to your Smart TV (like Apple AirPlay) check out the AllCast application made for Android devices.Extending battery life is simple: disable the vibration/haptic feedback and keyboard/stylus sounds as it really isn't necessary. Keep the brightness on Auto and the volume at half or less. When you're done using it for a while make sure you close all your apps and clear your RAM before putting it to sleep. This will greatly increase the standby time of the tablet so that when you pick it up again later it will still have lots of juice left in it. This is the procedure I do:Swipe down the top of the screenClear your notifications by pressing the X under the sound barSwipe down the top of the screen againTurn OFF WiFi (important)Press the \"Recent apps\" soft button (to the left of the Home button)Select Close allPress the Recent apps button again (no apps should be running now)Select Task ManagerSelect RAM manager on the leftPress \"clear memory\" - do this AFTER closing your appsPress Home buttonPress Recent apps button a third timeSelect Close all (this closes Task Manager)Press Power button to put it in Sleep/Standby modeDoing the above every time sounds tedious but after a few times its second nature and you will notice the battery percentage stays where you left it (or it only drops only 1 or 2%) even after an entire 24 hours in standby.If you notice when opening/closing apps and switching between apps there is a slight visual delay, this is normal. It is meant to make the transition between apps look \"pretty\" - Microsoft OS and Apple iOS have something similar. This will eliminate the windows animation and transition effects which in a nutshell will make the tablet run much quicker and smoother:Swipe down and go to SettingsGo to the General tabScroll down to About DevicePress the greyed out Build Number section continuously, 5-7 timesDeveloper Options is now enabled right above About DeviceUnder Developer Options, scroll down to the Drawing sectionSet all three of these settings to OFF:\"Window animation scale\"\"Transition animation scale\"\"Animator duration scale\"You'll notice how snappy it runs after doing that.Another available on/off toggle is the double-press Home button to bring up S-Voice. When you press the Home button twice quickly it will launch S-Voice. If you'd rather have this feature disabled read on:Launch S-Voice by pressing the Home button twice (or via apps > Samsung folder > S-voice)At the top right press the 3 small squares then select SettingsOn the next window the second row down is the \"Open via the Home key\" on/off toggle.Some apps that my girlfriend has recommended for drawing/painting/art. She is a graphic designer and bought her own Note Pro 12.2 soon after playing with mine so I will take her word for it. I have seen some of the pieces capable with this tablet and it is impressive. Also note that the files you create and save in some of these apps can be opened and worked on in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop:ArtflowInfinite PainterSketchbook ProSketchbook for Galaxy (included with the tablet)Fresco Paint ProPaperlessOnto the accessories:I am using the Samsung 12.2\" Book Cover with my NP12. It is well made, very sleek looking and does protect the back and corners well. The stand works well in both positions. Don't plan on taking too many pictures with this cover though because when opened the cover wraps around the back and blocks the camera lens. That is OK though because you should never be using a tablet to take pictures. Ever. Stop. No.... don't do it. You look ridiculous. I'm pretty sure there is a law against this - ipadisnotacamera.com - I rest my case.Anyway, I bought mine at the local Best Buy and you can find it on bestbuy.com - search for \"samsung book cover 12.2\"The IVSO Slim Smart Cover Case is nice too and protects the tablet a little better than the Samsung Book Cover but I find the IVSO's stand to be a little more flimsy and I don't like that it makes the tablet sit upside down (home button on top) when using it in your lap. On the plus side the camera lens isn't covered with this cover and there's a thin magnet that holds the cover to the tablet so it doesn't flop around. IVSO Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2/Tab pro 12.2 Ultra Lightweight Slim Smart Cover Case with Auto Sleep/Wake Function-will only fit Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2/Tab pro 12.2 Tablet (Black)I picked up this Galaxy Note Genuine Wacom Touch Pen 8pi Stylus (ET-S200EBEG) - Black. It is about the same thickness as a regular pen so its easier on your hand and it has an eraser on the end, too. Here's a tip: go to settings > controls > S-pen and at the top make sure \"Turn off pen detection\" is not checked, now you can use a second stylus without needing to remove the factory stylus from the tablet. If you're going to be using the S-pen a lot this is a very good investment.If you're looking for a great sleeve, check out the Merkury Innovations 12-Inch Solid Zipper Sleeve, Black/Blue (M-LL1090). It fits this tablet perfectly, even with the Samsung book cover on it and the quality is top notch. I love the fit and finish of this sleeve and how well it fits this particular tablet, the side pocket for the charge cable/external HDD is a bonus.Need a longer USB 3.0 charge cable? I bought one of these here on Amazon: Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type A to Micro-B Cable in Blue 10 Feet. It works just as well as the factory cable for charging and is available in 6, 10 and 15 feet - useful if the nearest wall plug is too far away.I like choices so I bought another sleeve, this one has a handle though: Evecase 10.6~12 inch Tablet, Netbooks Ultraportable Neoprene Zipper Carrying Case with Dual Hidden Pocket & Handle - Black/ Red. This sleeve is great because of the handles so I can throw in the tablet and carry it around just like that. If using my backpack I'll use the other sleeve mentioned above inside my bag. This sleeve is just as nice as the other and also has a side pocket. The black/red color looks sharp.Last but not least: the User Manual. This has TONS of useful information about the tablet. Definitely worth it to look through this, in fact most questions that people keep asking about the tablet can be answered just by looking in the manual. The direct link to the PDF is:downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201403/20140312030602240/GEN_SM-P900_Galaxy_Tab_PRO_KK_English_User_Manual_NAE_F5.pdfIf you have any questions just post a comment and I'll get back to you.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not too big. great functionality for someone on the road or just at home", "Author": "GumbyR1", "ReviewID": "RU6XKJQEKQ6ZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that I am an ex-apple customer that demanded more options and over time have switched from the iPhone to Note 3 and from an ipad to the Surface Pro and now to the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. For those that have a Galaxy note phone, the Note Pro tablet is more than just a larger version of the same. The functionality is greater, the multitasking is excellent, and from both a personal and business use, it has met my every expectation. I will address a few areas of concern I had before purchase to try and help anyone that may be feeling the way I was.SIZE - my job has me on the road marketing every day. This tablet, to me, is portable enough to not be a problem or feel like I am lugging around something uncomfortable. I carry a clip board with a few forms and the note pro 12.2  in a slip cover case (until I can get my hands on the book cover case which is back ordered). When I read the initial reviews I was terrified to buy this thing sight unseen as many talked about it being too big or too heavy. It is not too big and the weight feels light next to the surface pro. If you are looking for a large tablet screen...This is for you.  Also the large screen allows for the full size keyboard which is nice (this review is being typed on the screen)MAGAZINE UX - the difference in the updated interface had me scared. Is it like the new windows tiles? Is it completely different than what I am used to on the Galaxy Note 3 phone? Here is the deal. The Magazine UX is not bad. I am not a fan of the new Microsoft Windows tiles which i had on the Surface Pro. The UI is different and better in my opinion. You can set up your tablet to look almost identical to your Samsung Note phone if that is what you want. There has to be at least one screen of the magazine but to be honest, I have it set up to where I really like it. When I hit the button to go to the home screen it takes me to the same setup I have on my phone which is folders with different apps, time and weather, etc.32 or 64 GB - Being an early adpoter, the 64gb model was not available on release. It is unlikely that you will be using this tablet to shoot a ton of HD video (which is the biggest storage hog) and with an addition of a 64GB sd card that you can swap out if needed, 32gb device memory works just fine.WiFi or 4G - that depends on your needs but if you can use your phone as a hotspot, why pay extra for a cell radio in the device plus pay more to add it to a cell plan? The answer for my needs was WiFi works perfect and tethers with my phone on the road.I can't say much about the battery life yet as I have only charged it once. It had about 50% charge when I pulled it out of the box after purchase.CONCLUSION - I was disappointed in the info updates on this device before the US release. All of the videos and reports were all from CES and there were no new hands on reports. I can tell you that this device has a premium price but also carries premium capabilities. If you just want to update a status on Facebook and play candycrush...This isn't for you unless you want to spend the money for the screen size. If you want a nice big screen to multitask and you are either familiar with Android or are willing to educate yourself on the possibilities. You will be impressed.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet! Well worth the price! w/ Bonus Zagg keyboard review!", "Author": "Olaf Johnson", "ReviewID": "R17NYA6EFL1HHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "April 2014 Update:It has been over a month of usage with the 12.2 and I have to admit myexperience has become more and more positive.Things I am liking is the the stellar battery life, the way appsupdate to work better with 4.4os, the physical durability, the screensharpness/brightness, and the internet browsing experience.I love the multi-day battery power you get. I realize even with thescreen up at 80% brightness watching Netflix all day the battery stilltakes forever to drain. The only App that seemed to cause Batterydrain and slow recharging issue was Word-With-Friends, Blurb Checkoutand HP Printer Services. Once you delete those and make use of TaskManager to curb background activity everything improves.  Also keepingGPS Antenna off helps.Apps seem to be updating regularly to work smoother on 4.4os and toalso support the multi window display. So now more apps  can be swipedinto new windows when in multi window mode. By contrast I have somepopular apps on my iPhone that are only now updating to work betterwith last year's iOS 7.I'm finding the feel of the tablet is great for daily use. I love thefaux leather back and aluminum trim. You don't necessarily need a caselike you would on a scratch prone-metallic iPad. The faux leather issoft to the touch and easy to grip, yet handles dailycommuting bangs and scrapes well without any signs of wear and tear.One thing I didn't expect though is the faux leather to be a bit of afingerprint magnet.I tried using other tablets since and I now realize how great thescreen is. Apart from the slight fuzziness you get when importing lowres pics (or browsing the Facebook/eBay app) hi res images, websites,eBook/Adobe Reader text and colors always look sharp and bright. Ieven take back what I said about the 10.1 Note Pro's screen beingpossibly better. The 12.2 has a greater overall screen. As long as youstay away from your Grandma's 1 MP pictures and don't expect extrasharp images on the Facebook and eBay app then this tablet will makeyou happy. Actually if you use Chrome or Internet to browse Facebookand eBay then the images will look sharper and will scaled upproperly.This brings me to my final impressions for the 12.2:  the web browsingexperience is second to none! I'm very impressed with the consistentspeed and page layout of the Chrome and Google web apps. This is thefirst tablet where I can say anyone's  dependence on a full desktop PCor laptop PC for internet service will be greatly diminished. The onlythorn  in this positive is that Adobe Flash material may or may notload on certain websites but there is an Android Flash Player Patch(not found in the Play Store/Samsung Apps) that you can install thruyour web browser  to work around this.Positives aside there have been some hiccups with the 12.2. There is aslight interface delay when using the S pen on certain Apps. It worksperfectly in S pen native apps.  I don't find myself using S pen forwhat I normally do on my 12.2 so it is no bother to me but still worthmentioning.Also the Android/Samsung Gallery and File Management system can getcluttered if you tend to store a lot of documents and media. Add inthe automatic Facebook/Dropbox media file import and you may findyourself lost in a sea of tricky to remove pictures that you never puton the tablet. However, coming from an iOs iPhone background whereApple manipulates your media and files for you I am actually enjoyingthe freedom of organizing my images and files the way I want.I don't really use the Magazine but, unlike widgets, the Magazinetiles do not auto update. [Yeah I checked with Samsung and] there is'currently' no method for selecting them to automatically refresh withnew stories and content. It has to be manually done for each tileevery time you open Magazine. This actually defeats the purpose of whatthe feature is about-quickly exposing users to new and newsworthyinformation. On the flip side I'm curious how battery life will fareonce Samsung allows background auto update of all those tiles.Over all I think anyone who chose this tablet will be happy. I stilldon't know why haters still rate the 12.2 low because Samsung wants$750 for a 12.2 tablet when in the same stores Samsung smart phones, iPads and iPhonessell for $799+.---------------------------------------------------------------------------I originally wanted the Note 2014 10.1 for the holidays but decided to wait when the 12.2 appeared at CES. After seeing a some early online gadget reviews and videos I went into Best Buy held both the 10.1 and 12.2 and in under 3 minutes I was sold on the Pro 12.2.What I realized after looking at the 32GB 10.1 at $549 versus the 32GB 12.2 at $749 that for $200 more you get a lot more than just a bigger screen.After a month of daily use with my 12.2 did I make a good choice? Let's find out.PROS: The battery life is very good. I usually go all day with usage (bluetooth, wifi, apps running, screen brightness at 60%-auto brightness set to OFF) and never go below 70%. Some applications (words with friends) and widgets will drain battery quicker even if you are not directly using them so it is best to use the task and application manager in settings to see what is using your battery the most. Also GPS antenna being on all the time will kill the battery life.The first thing you will notice is that the 12.2 handles multiple tasks VERY quickly. It is not as quick as my iPhone 5S when opening heavy apps quickly like Facebook but because 99% of the time I am doing more than one thing at a time on my 12.2 any lag (minute as it maybe) is completely forgivable. In fact other than Facebook I have not notice anything to be slow on this tablet. YouTube, GPS-Google Earth/Maps, Web Browsing, Hancom Office, etc... can all run at 100% at the same time on the same screen.I had absolutely no issues with stuttering, slowing down or freezing up like some review videos have griped about. The software has updated since I took it out the box so that maybe the trick. Make sure to update your software and all the apps to get the most up to date performance.This tablet also doesn't get hot in my lap at all when doing heavy work. Netflix, YouTube, streaming Video playback is smooth, crystal clear Hi-Def and looks amazing! Images and text on Mazagine, web browsing apps, FlipBoard,  emails, Adobe Reader, games, ebooks, etc... all look crisp, bright and vividly sharp.The Chrome and Internet web browsing apps are blazing fast! I never liked web browsing apps on tablets and mobile phones because it was never as quick and natural as internet on a PC or notebook but here it feels natural and fast. Pages are full pages and not scaled down versions of websites. I also found the Android web browsing experience MUCH BETTER than Safari on the iOS iPads.Contrary to some early YouTube reviews I did NOT find this tablet to be too big or heavy for one handed use. The average adult should be able to hold and use it in one hand while standing. The Note Pro 12.2 is the around the same weight as my fianc\u00e9's pre-iPadAir iPad3.At  8\"+ by 11\"+ inches the 12.2 Note Pro shares the same footprint as a standard sheet of paper (Go to your printer or office desk and pick up a standard sheet of paper it is the same size as this 12.2 tablet)If you are coming from an older 8\" or 10\" tablet then the Note Pro 12.2 will 'feel' much bigger but not much heavier. However if you are like me and never owned a tablet before while coming from a Laptop/Desktop background then the 12.2. will feel portable enough.In fact this tablet paired with the Zagg keyboard has already completely replaced my premium Lenovo Thinkpad for on the go Laptop duties.Speaking of Laptop PC Windows duties the Productivity Software that comes with the 12.2 is not the usual bloatware you would expect. In fact apps like Hancom and WebEx puts Windows Office to shame.These productivity apps put the practicality of Microsoft Office onto a tablet environment where everything runs smoothly (especially with S pen) without the costs, drama and high maintenance that you get with Microsoft Office products.I mainly use Hancom Word for writing (novels) and in this regard I recommend an external keyboard (like the Zagg) since the touch screen keyboard can hog some screen real estate.Other obvious positives to a 12.2 screen is that you can do way more stuff at the same time and this tablet does the job of multi windows smoothly. My only prior tablet experience was my fiance's iPad3 which interfaces only one app at a time. Having the 12.2 do more than one thing at once took some getting used to. It is fun and most practical.CONS:The 12.2 screen carries over the resolution from the Note 10.1's screen (why?). This means in apps like Gallery, Facebook and eBay some lower resolution photos do not scale up properly to fill out the bigger screen.  Instead the Note Pro 12.2 tablet stretches out and enlarges images in these apps which results in slight fuzziness on those pictures. So if you are importing old school throw back pictures that you scanned back in 1999 then don't expect those pictures to look good here.On the Note 10.1 the same images would come out sharper on the smaller screen space. Lisa Gade at MobileTech has a brilliant side by side 10.1 vs 12.2 video on YouTube that shows this effect better than I can describe here.In fact isn't a big issue and most people who use hi-res pictures won't notice it at all. That said the camera on this tablet like all current tablets is quite crap compared to most high end cell phones or digital cameras. The camera app does have all the latest and greatest features but dont expect wallpaper quality pics. Use your samsung cell phone instead and import pics.Regarding the screen resolution I will add other apps like Adobe, Chrome/Internet, NYTimes and Magazine/FlipBoard have very crisp and clear images that are on par or better than iPad Retina's images so don't let that turn you away.My next gripe is in the box this tablet comes with nothing.  You get the usb cord/charger combo, a quick start leaflet, and replacement nibs for the S pen.For $800 spent here I would have at least wanted headphones and a proper manual booklet (you have to search Samsung's website for the 178 page SM-P905 pdf file).  Funny enough the SM-P905 manual when you download it has A LOT of important information regarding how to use this tablet properly. For one it warns \"do not use a screen protector on the Note Tablets\" which is the first thing we all buy for it. I use one anyway and it works fine with the S pen and touch controls.Be careful with where you buy your MicroSD card from. I went thru two eBay-bought SanDisk and Samsung 64gb cards, most likely fakes, that didn't work, died and almost damaged my Pro 12.2. I finally purchased the genuine Samsung 64gb card at my local Best Buy and it worked. Funny enough the eBay cards worked perfectly on my PC laptop and BlackBerry smartphone so that means the MicroSD card drive on this 12.2 tablet is very picky.One of my early concerns was out the box it took this tablet about 5 hours to charge from 70% to 100% and much longer to charge from near empty. To improve charging time I went to Application Manager->Running and deleted hidden background Bloatware like HP printer services, Blurb Checkout, etc... On kitkat 4.4 these sneaky apps remain running even after you sleep the tablet suckling away at your battery. With bloatware gone I now go from 30% to a full 100% charge in 4 to 5 hours. If that is too long for you then the LTE note pro 12.2 tablets will have batteries that charge much quicker but the downside is they will also die quicker than non-LTE models.Price was not a con for me but Samsung releases so many similarly priced tablets with a range of features that it makes me wonder if the Tab Pro 12.2 didn't come out at the same time would the retail for the Note Pro 12.2 be cheaper.Other than these minor gripes this is a perfect tablet for everyday useBONUS!ZAGG KEYBOARD REVIEW: I love that this keyboard works flawlessly, protects the screen when closed has great battery life. Also with its own leather stitched back matching the 12.2 perfectly BUT the Zagg is not a good case holder. The 12.2 lays facedown into the Zagg and clips on but the connection is loose and the tablet moves up and down inside the clips. Also removal of the tablet (as per the instructions) requires you to yank it up snapping back the holding clips open to release the tablet. The issue here is those clips are springy but still plastic and look like they will eventually break (I assume) from continued removal of the tablet. Furthermore you can easily pry or yank the wrong way and send the tablet flying across the room since it requires a bit of force.Also at $99.99 it is an overpriced keyboard accessory that isn't backlit and looks like it will wear out in a year or two of use. Already my spacebar key needs to be pressed really hard and in the center to work.I only purchased it at the time I picked my 12.2 because I needed a case right away and the only other case in Best Buy was $59.99. So I did the math and figured $40 bucks more got me a keyboard and stand for the 12.2. It does make a great stand.In retrospect I probably would not have bought the Zagg for more than $50 but I didn't really have a choice.It does its job with minimal features for the most part but do not expect a drop-proof case/holder or stellar desktop keyboard performance out of this product.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing!!", "Author": "Cody Bawden \"MrFlankster\"", "ReviewID": "R1T5127OGNXDR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who've rated this low because of the size, do your research.

OS and app BugsWhile the tablet is beautiful after using it for almost two months, I find it shockingly buggy. Apparently there's a battery drain problem in sleep mode. My Note Pro goes from 100% to dead in 18 hours of no use. It drops about 5% every 30 minutes. Many apps I expected to be mature and debugged like NYTimes, Wall Street Journal are laggy and crash frequently. Moving from an iPad to the Galaxy Note Pro, I have to say that there's something to be said about the benefits of how Apple manages expectations downward. While there is no multitasking on the iPad as there is on the Galaxy, there's a lot of lag and failed swipes on the Galaxy. Never on the Apple.2. Many apps haven't been updated for this larger screenLots of apps appear in the wrong orientation and/or won't rotate, or appear in one quadrant of the screen.3. Chrome won't work the way you think it will workIf you were expecting a more desktop (or at least laptop)-like Chrome experience, forget it. The version of Chrome that installs on this tablet is designed for smartphones. No plug-ins allowed, no bookmark bar, bookmarks appear in a tab window instead of a drop-down/slide-out.4. BIG problems when using a ChromecastExpect your Note Pro to crash when attempting the seemingly simple task of streaming music from Google Play to your Chromecast device. Easy-to-reproduce and requires a tablet reboot only to happen again when you try streaming music.5. Nobody knows anything about this thingNot Samsung, Not Verizon (I have the LTE version). Other than the basics, at least as of two weeks in, nobody knows anything about the Galaxy Note Pro.6. BloatwareOh my goodness, they're redefined the phrase. I appreciate some of the freebies, but wouldn't it have been possible to remove the ones I don't use? Google+, Hangouts, Knox, (and of course Knox store, whatever that is), e-meeting, etc., etc7. A mouse!Ok, so I was amazed. Yes, with a Bluetooth mouse connected, an arrow icon actually appears on the screen and you can use it pretty much like any mouse on a conventional PC. I'm using the Microsoft Sculpt Touch mouse but any Bluetooth one will work. You can also connect a keyboard at the same time.8. Limited amount of accessories and ridiculous prices thereofBecause of its newness, there are a limited number of accessories and cases for this tablet. Furthermore, I guess because companies like Zagg and Logitech believe you're willing to overpay for the tablet, they can charge you a premium for accessories. $129 for a keyboard/case? You must be kidding.9. Amazon video/Flash player:Streaming video from your Amazon account is almost impossible. I was accustomed to using Amazon's streaming video app on the iPad to watch tv shows and movies I get from Amazon. There is no such app for Android devices.  This is very unlike Amazon and Google (but less so for Adobe) and I wish they would get over themselves and help their customers. BTW, there are no problems watching Netflix, YouTube or Hulu using their respective apps.10. The guys at Adobe (or someplace) will make sure you can't use this as a notebook replacementGetting Flash installed on this tablet is an exercise in contortion. It can be done via the installation of an obscure \"Dolphin\" browser, an older version of Adobe Flash and then jimmying with settings to put it all together, but it's complicated especially with this tablet running KitKat. I was successful, but it took a while. I understand this is because of a disagreement between Google (Android's developer), Amazon and Adobe.11. Amazon (or someone) doesn't want you streaming your library on the Note Pro:There is no Amazon streaming app as there is for the iPad (see #10 above).  This is very unlike Amazon and Google (but less so for Adobe) and I wish they would get over themselves and help their customers. BTW, there are no problems watching Netflix, YouTube or Hulu using their respective apps.12. New Charging / sync connector on cordThe Note Pro uses a new Micro USB 3.0 connector. It's wider than the one that THE ENTIRE REST OF THE PLANET USES. You can use an old-style Micro USB charger, but it takes much longer to charge it than if you use the cord that comes with it. Also, there are no USB 3.0 car chargers (that I've been able to find, anyways). ALSO ALl those zillions of USB chargers you own? Many of them won't charge the Galaxy Note Pro.13. Pricing and obsolescenceThe \"professional\" reviews of this tablet are lukewarm- mostly revolving around the reviewer's opinion of its high price and \"who would want a tablet with this large of a screen?\" These reviews can slow sales and drive the price down. The price of this tablet may decline at a faster rate than usual. What's weird is that even the reviews that start like that, often end up with a conclusion that it's a terrific product. I don't get it.UPDATE: Other thoughts:I've been using this device intensively for almost two months now as a replacement for an aging iPad and hopefully a replacement for an infrequently used notebook. If you're used to holding an iPad, this tablet will take some getting used to. Once you've had it for a few days, you won't want to take your hands off of it. For me, it is a near-notebook replacement, especially if you add a keyboard and a mouse. The Hancom office software is shockingly close in appearance and functionality to Microsoft Office.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good!", "Author": "Ibrahim Hafeez", "ReviewID": "R2ENI5PETK18LD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's be honest. The only reason someone would pick up this tablet is for the sheer size of the beast. Since the Pro line of tablets have extremely similar internal specs the 12.2 in. screen does (somewhat) justify the added cost.With only a few hours of use, I found the device to be snappy and responsive. The new magazine UX is a nice touch although Samsung definitely needs to add support for more apps to be displayed (you can't add Gmail to the magazine UX!). Furthermore, small things like when you tap the calendar widget in the magazine UX it won't open the calendar app. Instead, you have to select an event displayed on the widget and then you'll be taken to that specific event (basically you can't go to \"month view\" or something similar just from the Samsung calendar widget).The S-pen is a delight as usual- even though I found that I didn't use it as much as I thought I would be. With a huge screen (and battery) the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is definitely a two handed device. Holding it with one hand gets tiresome very quickly and quite honestly feels a little awkward. If you're going to be moving around then this may prove too heavy of a device although it's certainly doable.The display is gorgeous. Nothing else needs to be said here.Overall, if you're looking for a tablet that mimics the power and productivity of a laptop then this is a great buy.

I really wish Samsung would get rid of the bezel buttons. Additionally, charge time is too slow. I've read that the LTE version of this tablet will have faster charging due to its Snapdragon processor so maybe it's a limitation of the Samsung processor on the Wifi version.  Due to the buttons and charging, I have to give 4 instead of 5 stars.Overall, this tablet seems best suited to those who prefer using a BT keyboard.

Also, just to give you some perspective - I buy a lot of tech and upgrade pretty frequently.  Have owned 7\", 10\" and (now) 12\" tablets - including Samsung, Nexus (Google), ASUS and Toshiba.  I almost didn't buy this one because of the price tag, but glad I did.What I really like...* Screen size (obviously), big difference over the 10\" screen (had the Nexus 10 previously)* The pen is great, this and screen size were my main two reasons for me getting this tablet* SD Card - great added bonus but with a catch (see below)My issues...* The SD Card, thanks to Google's new OS (4.4.2) apps no longer get full access to the SD Card.  Many apps cannot write to the SD card.  This means you have to download to the internal and then manually move things to the SD Card.  You also have to use the built in File Manager (for the same reason - limited permissions for SD access) which means you can't use some of the cool split screen File Mangers like Total Commander.* Same issue I had with Samsung's 10.1 (2014) tablet - button placement is not ideal.  You will occasionally hit the button while holding it and unlike the Nexus they don't relocate when you go to portrait mode.  This is a minor issue - will probably just take some getting used to.Other comments...* I don't mind the weight.  Probably because how I use it.  I'm sure if I was holding it in front of me for 30min it would get annoying (the 10.1 feels like you're holding nothing).* Charging time is pretty good, faster would be nice but it charges reasonably quickly.* There is a long stream of comments on another persons post about the Manual for this tab - you cannot (as of writing this) get a full manual.  Every location and method seems to get a different corrupted manual.  The best one I found was missing like 20 pages int he middle of it.  I pretty much never read these things but figured I would point it out.  Come on Samsung - you can make this tablet but you can't put an uncorrupted pdf online?????* TouchWiz and the new Magazine interface are okay but I replace the hoe screen with NOVA Prime.I'm still looking for the perfect note taking app for use with the stylus - currently using Papyrus.

I have discovered playbook app and the ability to upload my rather extensive book library.  I use calibre with a drm removal program so that I can have all of the books I purchased available anywhere.I have had some issues getting this to sync with my samsung tv.  I have the remote control working and am able to control my tv just fine but I just can not get the screen mirroring to work.  It acts like it is going to connect and show up on my tv screen but then fails.  If anyone has an idea as to what I am doing wrong I would welcome your advise.It continues to function great and is getting free updates from Samsung for software.  I really like the rubber back....around the house i do not need a cover.So you are thinking about buying one of these.  They are rather high in price but you do get a nice large screen and a LOT of free software.....NOT what I would say is bloat ware.  For me bloatware consists of basic come ons that give me a few days for free and then I have to pay more money.  While that is true about some of the software much of what Samsung offers up is FREE>I will not simply cut copy and paste the specs.  You can see those for yourself.This is a new type of device.  A natural evolution of a common device.  It is a new and fresh approach to this whole new category of consumer tablets.  New in that they are still in their diaper stage........ much change has happened to size and weight.  Screens have become better and functions have increased.I like this device.  I am still learning how to use it.  My usage of windows 8.1 definitely helped me get going on this.  Sure I know this is android but it does share some common characteristics with the surface pro2...... i.e......you can have multiple applications running side by side.I like using the pen.  It is unlike any other pen I have used.  It communicates with the screen long before you ever touch it.  It is stowed in the side of the device.  I did not know this so I looked back through the box thinking they had forgotten to send it to me......then I found it.I was able to sync up my microsoft exchange account, my cox account, calendars, contacts, etc....I am able to use the amazon mp3 app to listen to my music..... I uploaded ALL of my music to the amazon mp3 cloud many months ago.Dropbox works fine as does OneDrive.Like many people I have vision problems.  Vision problems are not something for the aged it affects millions of people of all ages.The accessibility options are cool.  I have my voice over set for British female voice.  She sounds sexy.  I think I would like to meet her....anyone have Raj's twitter account..... Since he found Siri maybe he can help me find my sexy British voice......(don't tell my wife that I am looking for her)Sooooo with the pen out you just hover around the screen and it tells you exactly where you are.  Touch the icon for settings or samsung apps and she will talk you through it all.  I have the power button set so that if I hold it down for two seconds it pulls up the accessibility options so I can turn her off just as easily as she turns me on.One caveat with the voice over on is that you HAVE to use the pen..... finger touch does not work to change pages etc.....Playbook.....  a great way to get books and a FANTASTIC way for those of us with vision problems to get the text just right.Now that I have been using my new iPad Air and this Galaxy note for reading I fully realize what I was missing using my amazon HDX 8.9.  You can get the fonts way larger on the iPad Air and the Galaxy note than the amazon device.  When i say bigger i mean BIGGER.  We are talking about the difference between say 40 font and 60 font.PLUS with the added real estate of the galaxy I can get around 15 words per page.  The playbook app also has free and always on text to speech.  You just move the pen to the top and click start speech.Voce over works pretty much like on my iMac.  It works with programs on the note.  i.e...... Netflix.... voice over works with it and will read me what is on the screen.  A big plus for those of us with vision problems.  No more trying to find my high powered glasses...I can just activate voice over and use my lower powered 5.0 magnification glasses.Sadly when I use the google playbook I have to listen to there rather robotic female american voice....... please google let me use the samsung british voice.  I think I love her.I bought one case for this but it just is not what I really want.  I have two of the ionic brand on order.

I just felt like it cost too much.  However, now that I have the tablet I have nothing but great things to say about it.  My previous tablet was a Gen-1 Ipad and this tablet and my ipad are night and day.  I enjoy using the multitasking and the S-Pen is very handy as well although,  I wish that I could do multitasking with Netflix without rooting the device.  Accessories are  cheap (unlike Apple), but not plentiful (unlike Apple).  I was able to purchase 2 cases and screen protectors for about $30.Battery:I have had the tablet for about a week, I am getting approximately 9-10 hours of use.  I typically stream Netflix, play games and surf the web with some light drawing via S-PenStorage Expansion:I purchased the Samsung 64GB Micro-SDXC-I card.  The card worked great no need to format it.Syncing:This is where I ran into some issue and had to do some serious research.  I wanted to be able to continue using iTunes to organize my media but sync that media including playlist to my android tablet.  I triedSamsung KIES 3:  I thought this would work very well for me, but it seemed to be missing a lot of functionality such as exporting playlist, etc.  KIES 2 had all the feature but was not compatible with the GNP  DoubleTwist:  This product worked well, but it will not sync any DRM protected content, my view here is I paid iTunes for the music and I would like to be able to put it on a non Apple device without paying to use their service.  Doubletwist also would not let me write my music to the SD card.  Android KitKat 4.4 prevents applications from writing to the SD card. This was a show stopper for me.  I want to control where my content goes.  I know they did it for security reasons but they need to find a better way to handle this.  iSyncr:  This is a paid app ($3.99 US)  .  This app allowed me to continue using iTunes as I did in the past, it simply hooks into iTunes and finds your content/playlist and syncs that with your Android device.  iSyncr also allows you to write to the SD card no problem.Screen:The screen is phenomenal I have watched a few bluray movies on it and I am very impressed.Speakers:The speakers on the GNP compared to my Gen-1 Ipad are very good.  The sound is not only loud, but rich and crisp.  I do not see the need of always connecting a Bluetooth speaker to my tablet just to hear over some back ground noises.Docking:I currently use the cable that came with the device, but would really like a docking clock system for my bed side.  Unlike Apple, Samsung has very few options in this space.Camera:Camera doesn't seem to do a very good job in low light, but who takes pictures (often) using a 12.2 inch tablet.  The software for the camera and movies seems to be feature rich, but I cannot provide a lot of detail as i have not used this part of the tablet often.Performance:The tablet is smooth and does multitasking without any issues.  Inititally there seemed to be a little lag as you swiped from screen to screen, but I followed the advice of another Amazon reviewer by the name of Chris Olic to resolve those issues see link below.http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OHHGEWFW3577/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdponSummary:I hate that I took so long to purchase this device.

I'm giving it 4 stars only because it's my first impressions.Update: WOW, I new there could be 4 windows but they are always shown (on various website images) as a quad of windows. In fact you can turn many apps into overlapping windows or Facebook style chat head bubbles. I'm writing this review with my \"s\" pen and it's absolutely fantastic. It's great to have it on your lap while using the S-pen. So far it's very nice and I Love the large Screen. Update still loving the device. Very easy to touch type on. The interface is smooth, no jitters as far as I can see right now. It would be nice if more major apps could be windowed.There are two different ways to use the windows.  If you swipe left from from the side of the screen you see the multi apps. There are currently about 28 apps that use multi window. If you just TAP an app it will open as a floating window, like in, well, Windows.  You can have 5 apps open at once in floating windows and they can be resized and minimized into chat heads. Very handy.  If you DRAG an app it snaps into grid formation and you can have 4 of those. I really like the flexibility in the operating system.Another great thing and I don't know if this is kit kat but I know I can't do it on my note3 which is still running jellybean, but you can set Google play movies to DOWNLOAD MOVIES TO YOUR SD CARD  and for me this is huge!The only reason I wanted a 64gb tablet was to hold more movies but I only need 32 now because I can put a ton of movies on a 64gb sd card. Makes the 64gb version unnecessary.If anyone has questions I'll do my best to answer. Loving this tablet!

It's a Samsung product, it's an Android OS and it's NOT an Apple Product! Win, Win and Super Win! Sorry, I know apple makes decent products, but I just don't like them!Ok, I digress on with the Review.I have always had good luck with Samsung Products, I have a Galaxy Note Phone and it's been great!So, it was time to replace my tablet, I had a Kindle Fire, the \"original\" release. It was a fine 7 inch tablet but it was time to upgrade and I wanted a true android operating system.I did my research and once this went on \"sale\", $50. off, I jumped. It has been GREAT! Can you Say FAST! Wow! The Quad-core processor is amazing. It's so fluid and smooth. I like how easy it is to operate and how LIGHT this tablet is considering it's a 12.2 INCH Tablet! I mean, it's not lighter than \"air\" but it's also much larger than any \"good\" tablet on the market.  :\")The freebies that come with it are a nice added bonus, but the tablet is worth every dime I paid for it and the $50. I didn't!The S Pen is great, I love the S Pen on my Galaxy Note Phone and it's even nicer on such a LARGE Screen! Great for drawing, writing, whatever you want to do with a pen, you can do with this S Pen!This tablet is so fast and responsive on Wi-Fi and makes browsing a dream. I tether at work with my phone and it works great too! The Display is amazing, best picture I have seen in a LONG time, watching movies in HD is flawless and beautiful, it's almost immersive and a bit mesmerizing. The speakers actually produce clear crisp sound in stereo or even SURROUND!  It's a pleasant experience to say the least.You are drawn in by its beautiful picture and the 12.2 inch screen is the perfect size for watching TV/movies anywhere! Great Job Samsung! This is the best product I have purchased in a long time.Honestly, for what you get, it is priced just right, it's not expensive at all for what you get. I purchased this product for fun, leisure and enjoyment. If you want a fantastic, beautiful large screen tablet, I truly think there is no reason to look further. I love Android, so it's the android of choice for me.I did not buy this product from amazon.com even though I love them, I got a better deal buying it through Costco, not on the price of the tablet mind you, same price but on the price of the extended warranty.First, you get two years of warranty on all electronics you buy from Costco, secondly, you have a NINETY Day return policy and thirdly, the extended drops spills warranty I purchased was about a fourth of the price for something comparable on amazon.com. So, that's the only reason I didn't purchase from amazon.com.I will probably update this review as time goes on, but for now, I say make the jump, you won't be sorry.For the millions that have abandoned Apple and switched to Android, if you haven't yet but are tired of Apple's overpriced antics, this would be a good first experience with Samsung and All that Android's operating system can do for you.Also, while I love my little Kindle and as I mentioned before I wanted a true Android OS, not an amazon Hybrid, I would have purchased another Kindle Fire if it had a larger Screen and it would be nice to have Google Play on Kindle Fire too! Just sayin.So, Go by this tablet, you WON'T Be Sorry! You will be Happy, like me. :\")P.S. I wanted a 90 day return policy, just in case I had buyer's remorse.  Sometimes with large ticket items, I have buyer's remorse.  I am here to tell you, that didn't and won't happen.  I am \"connected\" to this bad boy, I take it everywhere and why not, it can do ANYTHING! :\")ll be Happy, like Me. :\")", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replaced my notebook with this tablet, really like the tablet, but....", "Author": "PSmith", "ReviewID": "R3S7OI56V8MD1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the galaxy note 10.1, 10.1 2014, and now the Note Pro 12.2, this is mostly comparing the tablet to the older versionsI really do like this tablet, compared to the 10.1 it is definitely a bigger tablet, but when you actually have it, you'll be glad you have the real estate (and the updated android!). A lot of online reviews say you wouldn't want to pull this out all the time because it's so big, and I call bologna. It's so much smaller than my laptop, and way more convenient for simple tasks, even compared to my Galaxy S4, I'd much rather pull out my tablet to watch a video or surf the web.Pros:-Even though the specs are the same, it feels a little zipier than the 10.1 2014 did, which could have something to do with the TouchWiz and Android updates.-Unparalelled multitasking compared to other tablets-Awesome battery life (this is like hour 29 of pretty frequent use, and I still have 20% ish left)-Charges faster than traditional devices on laptops/computers thanks to USB 3.0 support-Stylus! The stylus is accurate, and easy to use, and offers a lot of features on-screen.-WHat used to be just the menu button to the left of the home button is now dual purpose, click once to open a much faster and more efficient applcation quick-switch bar, with a short hold to bring up the menu, definitely a plus.Cons:-It's actually lacking a few features from the 10.1 2014, such as NFC, which I don't use often, but would be handy in transfering files from my phone to the tablet instead of using bluetooth. Given that this is the \"Next Generation Samsung Tablet\", AND the \"Pro\" series, I would expect these tablet to have more features, not less.-Price: It's $200 more for the same hardware, absent eye tracking, and no NFC. Really?! Ok, a bigger screen is cool, but is it $200 more cool? Hardly-Stylus (also a con): It's tiny, I'm going to get a Bamboo Feel stylus and just atatch it to my folio when I'm not using it, the small stylus is convenient in that it fits into the tablet, but if you want to get some serious work done or take serious notes, I'd definitely get a bigger stylus.Final Thoughts:Yes it's a big(er) tablet than all of them on the market, but once you have it in hand, it's phenominal. You can hold it in one hand, it isn't hard, the only time I don't do this is when I should be holding it with two anyways (like over my head), it's heavy, but it's bigger. If you can choke down paying an extra $200 for literally the benefit of a bigger screen, it is worth it, the screen is great, the tablet is a great size for anything you could ever need it for, and the updated software is fantastic.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Andrew S.", "ReviewID": "RO5XH3D40YOYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my note pro for a few days, being a owner of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2012, this is much better than the original note. I first got it, yes it is a big tablet, to be exact, it almost covers my HP 17\" laptop's keyboard.A side note on the S Pen- it is the same design as the note 3, however the size is different. It is a little bit longer and a little bit bulkier.When I took it out of the box, it was about 60% charged, took about 3ish hours to fully charge, and this is partially due to the processor. I charge my note 3 from completely dead to 100% in about 2.5 hours.As far as the magazine on home, I personally am not a fan of it. I like how you can swype up on the note 3 to get the magazine. The Hancom office is very useful, I now have no need to get Microsoft Office 2013 for my laptop.Speakers are better sounding on the sides, as I can also close my case and listen to music clearly. App to SD card transfer is adequate. Screen is very sharp, very clear with my live wallpaper in the background.There has been some slight problems with lag time, but I am used to it from my old note 10.1. There is a reason why I knocked it down from 5 to 4, not because of anything but the price. 850.00 is very expensive for a tablet,  as my laptop was cheaper and it has the new intel i7 processor. The starting price should be 600 for the 32GB, 700 for the 64GB.

I love the size......it's perfect for me.", "Author": "Saviorself", "ReviewID": "RIOMPBMMTKATS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little background so you know what I was looking for and why I am satisfied with my purchase.The last tablet I purchased was a 7 inch generic Android Tablet a few years back. Never really cared for it and while I thought I wanted something small and portable I found myself wishing I had gotten something bigger.I currently am using a Note 3 for my phone which I absolutely love. I had been using it as an all purpose device for work to take notes during meetings and looking at excel documents. While it served it's purpose sort of. I had some problems with certain excel files and never did find an office program I was completely happy with and it was hard to take lengthy notes without a proper keyboard and while the screen is big it wasn't big enough for long lecture note taking.For me this product was a good compromise of a tablet and a laptop. The bigger screen of a laptop with the portability of a tablet. I wanted something I could use for work and for play.This thing is big though. With that being said I wanted that extra 2\" of screen real estate. For me 6' tall with longish arms and average sized hands I can comfortably cradle it in one arm and use my other hand to operate it. I also find it very easy to read and operate laying down propping it up on my leg.The display is beautiful. My only complaint is in a dark room I can see a tiny bit of bleeding at the bottom when it's first booting up. Not a deal breaker for me. Movies and games look good.I'm currently using a Note 3 with the quad core snap dragon processor and was not sure what to expect with the Octacore. I am not disappointed in the least. The system is responsive with no real noticeable lag.I love the new Magazine UX Samsung implemented with this tablet. I personally find it a refreshing change up. A lot of the reviews talked about this and it seemed to be a love it or hate it. Don't let that scare you away though the core Android system you are used to is still there. There are still home screens to customize and your standard app tray. The 4 part multi view works awesome and doesn't feel cramped and you can resize the windows.It comes with Hancom office viewer by default and you can go In and download the editor for free. By FAR the best office suite I've used on Android. I have a logitech 810 bluetooth keyboard I bought to sync to this to take notes and I had zero problems getting it to work with this and both were very responsive with no lag. Made typing up emails and word documents a breeze.The S Pen functions work great as they do on the note 3. Though I wish they had made the pen a little bigger. It's the same shape as the pen in the Note 3 but 1/8\" to 1/4\" longer and just a tad thicker personally I didn't notice much difference till I put them side by side.Battery life has been fantastic hard to say how long I have been getting on a charge because I have been playing on it non stop.The built in speakers are quite adequate in both volume and sound quality. I have a bluetooth JBL Flip speaker I usually hook up to listen to music or watch Netflix on my phone to get increased volume. And while the JBL speaker was still better for overall quality and volume I didn't find it a necessity to use like I do with my phone.Camera quality is fine though I don't plan to use it for taking pictures or video I have my phone for that. And rarely will I be using it if at all for video calls. Though the option is certainly there and does a solid job.Internal storage, I went with the 32GB model. Almost 10 gigs of that is taken up by the OS and other bloatware. The good news of course is that it takes a micro ST card so you can expand the memory without having to overpay for a tablet with more space.All in all extremely happy with this tablet. Hope this review can help someone out.Update - 3/10/14I opted to get a keyboard and mouse for this tablet. I picked up the logitech k810 keyboard and logitech t651 trackpad. Both work perfect.I have been using this tablet for a few weeks now and I thought I would update. I am actually typing up this review with my logitech keyboard from my tablet :)I have been using this tablet a lot for work. One question came up which was did it seem to much to have both a Note 3 and the 12.2 pro. I think this comes down to the user. I use sNote and Evernote quite a bit. I like that I can jot down quick notes with my phone and reorganize on my tablet later. I wish evernote had a better tablet layout but thats not samsungs fault thats evernotes fault. However with the large screen size on the tablet I can just go to the main website for Evernote and log in there which is handy.One thing I am really enjoying is reading comics on this. It's one thing I really wanted to be able to do with my Note 3 and it just didn't work. To much zooming and moving around. The screen on this thing is perfect for that and combined with the comixology app...MONEY!What have I been disappointed in? Since everything cant be 100% sunshine and rainbows. Lack of customization for the new magazine UX. Samsung pulled a bunch of the widgets for that. I didn't notice it at first because I didn't really end up using it as much as I thought I would. It wasn't till I was reading on the XDA Developer forums that I noticed this. I have noticed a bit of stutter when sliding between screens now that I have loaded up some of my apps.They could have made the icons smaller to allow more icons in a row rather than making them bigger.The only other thing I wish it had was sPlanner. I love having that widget on my Note 3 as I put everything in there and its nice to be able to slide a screen quick to get a quick glance rather than opening the app.Aside from that I am normally very quick to root my devices but am still rolling stock at the moment.I still don't regret my decision. And I liked this thing enough to dump another 100 bucks into a mouse and keyboard and another 150 for a \"man purse\" if you will that holds the tablet keyboard mouse cables and external battery backup.

If you have lead poisoning, this tablet may not be for you.- Thin- S-PenThe S-Pen is a pretty neat piece of hardware. Although you can get a stylus for any touchscreen device, the S-Pens built in software and the inclusion of detecting whether the pen is in it's craddle or out makes it just that much more useful. Utilizing Tasker and Note Buddy, for example, puts the S-Pen on another level.- Hancom OfficeJesus, this piece of software is a gem. Couldn't ask for much more from an android Word replacement.- 4 Window Split Screen & Floating Apps  * Floating apps have been around for ages including browsers and calculators, so that feature isn't very original. But the 4 window split screen is done impressively well and the 12.2 inch screen really provides the real estate to make it viable. The ability to \"pair\" apps together is particularly useful for things like email and calendar.Cons:- TouchWiz & Samsung AppsAs always, TouchWiz remains a fairly unresponsive, crashy UI. WatchON crashes constantly in the background and I've even had the entire UI process repeatedly crash on me until I hard rebooted the tablet. There's also some hitching when returning to home screens, but that's par for the course with most android devices.- PriceYeah, not much to say here.- PPIBecause of the massive screen size, the pixels per inch is significantly lower than, say, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".

But this is reality. Let us compare the PRO lines from Samsung. I will first compare the TabPROs briefly, and then give a crisp overview of the popular Tablets in market now. Then I will do in depth into the current tablet itself. This will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision. I am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which suits you. If you have any questions, do ask in the forum and I will respond within a day. The three Galaxy TabPROs and the single Galaxy NotePRO differ only in size, and little bit in specs; they are functionally identical in all respects.The single most fascinating part of the TabPRO and NotePRO lines is the resolution. Astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines which means on 8.4\" has the maximum ppi and excellent look. In comparison last year's Tabs have much lower resolution. I personally think this 12.2\" is heavy for personal purposes. Weight+Cost was the primary reason for my rating at 4 stars. For this price you can get a full blown laptop. I got it for work purpose, using with bluetooth keyboard and for personal purpose I will suggest the super gorgeous 10\" or 8.4\" tablet.COMPARISONS GALORE:key_specs: { model: resolution, ppi, CPU, RAM, Flash memory, SD_card, camera spec, weight, OS_type, size, charging/sync port type, GPS:y/n }Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 8.4-Inch {B,W},  WQXGA 2560 x 1600, 359 ppi, 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 331 gm, Android 4.4 Kit Kat OS, 8.62 x 5.06 x 0.28 in, microUSB, GPS yes.  4800 mAh battery (the very best resolution on a tablet!)Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 10.1 {B, W}, WQXGA  2560x1600, 298 ppi, Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 469 gm, Android 4.4 KitKat, 9.57 x 6.75 x 0.29 in, microUSB, GPS: y, 8,200mAh batteryWow, a 12.2\" tablet now!

The resolution of WQXGA 2560 x 1600, and has a pixel density of 247 ppi. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read text very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app, and they are super sharp. Resolution will blow you away.  This new Multi-Window UI that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously, each in its dedicated window. 12.2\" is great for pdf, books and magazines.PROCESSING POWER:Exynos\u00ae 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 3 GB RAM. Very powerful indeed! I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool. Notepro is truly professional in nature.  This tablet is touted as Enterprise-Ready and has Corporate E-mail/Calendar/Contact; Microsoft\u00ae Office-compatible; Mobile Device Management; On-Device Encryption (ODE); Preloaded WebEX; Remote PC and E-Meeting Apps; Virtual Private Network.  It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any market in the US and other countries. All these apps are available in your other device. Yes, you have it in your laptop!STORAGE:Notepro comes in 32/64 GB configurations.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a camera is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12\" tablets.  I personally don't use back cameras as much on 10\"+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to say of cameras, they just work for the required purpose. Front camera is good for skype and business meetings.ERGONOMICS:I personally like 8\" for home uses, but  at 12\"+ this is truly a laptop replacement. I really wonder if this will have a market, but it is an experiment from Samsung. At 748 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  This is 1.65 pounds. Still less weight than laptops. For example, 11\" MacBook Air weighs 2.38 pounds. Size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.33 in. The battery is 9500mAh and should come  for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp. Being a geek, I love this form factor.SOUND:Excellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISC:This is the only tablet I could see in Samsung's lineup with microUSB 3.0 port with backwards compatibility with microUSB 2.0. I tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band is really state of the art. 802.11ac is blazing fast!Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Also has infrared which can be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.Obviously the S-Pen is the one that differentiates this Notepro from others. S Note docs, S Planner makes it so easy to organize with S-Pen. Also this has NFC  as well as Ethernet connectivity via adapter.  I really doubt if people will use ethernet connectivity when wifi is used everywhere. I really wonder what is the use case.APP POWER:I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate.

The 12.2 Note Pro has received a high percentage of positive reviews on Amazon and other sites. Most professional reviewers, on the other hand, seem to think it's just too big, too heavy, too expensive, or it's just not an Ipad. Fortunately for me I've learned to take professional reviewers with a huge grain of salt. Thanks to reviews from real users on Amazon and balanced reviewers like Lisa Gade from Mobile Tech  Review I was able to take the plunge when the Note Pro went on sale.And I love my Big Ass Tablet (BAT)! I wasn't sure I could use that word in my review, but I did a search on Amazon and found out they sell this Liquid Ass So I guess it's okay.I've owned two 7\" tablets, two 10.1\" tablets, and I recently bought the Samsung Tab Pro 8.4\". The 7\" were good for portability outside the home, while the 10.1\" were good for couch surfing. I thought the 8.4\" would be a good compromise between the two that I could use for both, and consolidate down to one size. However, after using the 8.4\" for about a month I discovered my eyes aren't up to looking at a small screen for several hours at a time (reading/web surfing on the couch is my favorite past-time). The 8.4\" has great resolution, but text is still small and zooming in just means you have to scroll a lot. However, it is great for portability outside the home, and I will keep it for that.The 12.2\" offers no compromise web browsing and document reading. Rarely do I feel the need to zoom in. I'm also addicted to the S-pen. Love to use it for navigating my tablet, and I also prefer to write with the pen then use the onscreen keyboard. I guess it's Samsung tablets for me, until the competition catches up and produces something better.Some people might complain that the tablet is too heavy for couch surfing. I've solved this problem by modifying the Aerb case I got for the tablet Aerb\u00ae X Pro Series Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Leather Case Cover Stand W Sleep Wake Function (for Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, Black Style A) By folding the cover of the case and securing it with four small binding clips I can use the case to prop up the tablet while lying on the couch or in bed. Weight becomes a non-issue and I only need to lightly grasp the tablet with one hand to keep it from tipping over. I've included some pictures to show you how I modified the case, for those that are interested (see the user supplied picture area of this product's web page).So far I'm completely satisfied with this tablet. My only complaint is the price. Wish it was more like $600.Even so, I'm livin' large and lovin' it! I hope Samsung keeps making this size tablet.

This has not happened, Oh sure they made it thinner, weigh less,upgraded the hardware, gave it a bells screen, they even made it smaller.SO what??? Apple failed to make the Ipad better in all the ways that Count. Apple also has foiled to make the Ipad in the size needed most 12 inches.Sounds like I am Apple bashing right?Wrong! I have been patiently waiting for Apple to make the Ipad everything this tablet is. Apple has been stubbornly doing whatever it pleases with the attitude that the Customer Can take it or leave it.I agree with Apple so I have left them.While Apple has been busy being Cheaper on there products and Charging more for them while becoming even more restrictive if that were possible, others have been improving their Operating Systems & Hardware.Microsoft has proven Abjectly Clueless when it comes to mobile operating systems and did not offer me a real choice regardless of which manufactures were loading there hardware with Microsoft terrible offerings.Reluctantly as I began to suspect I had only one option left and that was to look at the Android Operating System.Make no mistake I detest Googles desire to destroy privacy, and this is the one thing that prevented me from looking at Android offerings to begin with. Then I thought about it some more and decided who really knows what Microsoft and Apple Are really collecting anyway?There is allot of crapware that comes loaded on this tablet trying to get you to give up give up your privacy for the right to use their application. Some of it also in addition to compromising your privacy wants you to Pay to use it.Unfortunately these are also in addition to compromising your privacy wanting you to Pay to use it.Unfortunately these are Apps touted to make the tablet more appealing.My solution was simple I uninstalled them!When setting up the tablet I also did not Use my Google Account.Oh I did the first time And realized they were following the heck out of everything and there was no way to turn it off.I just about contacted Amazon for a refund until it came to me to restore the device factory settings in settings.After I did that I discovered I could set up the tablet without using my Google account and getting it so embedded into everything.Now I could pick and Choose my privacy options with apps and yes even Google.At the end of the day though it is more about retaining the right to privacy than tinfoil hat reasoning.This tablet is remarkable it is fast, it is responsive, it is the perfect size for viewing magazines, web pages, Video, and working with spreadsheets, documents,reading PDF's or books even Via my kindle library.The screen is chez easy to read text on.By the way this entire review was written YES WRITTEN Using the included pen.

I remember two years ago, the first time I bought a 10'' tablet, I was disappointed at how small it was. I always wanted something a bit bigger so I can read my technical books without zooming in and replace my old laptop with. This tablet fit the bill. I don't understand people saying this is too bulky. I carry my 10'' tablet in a bag most of the times so it doesn't bother me at all to instead carry a 12''. Plus, I used to bring a 7 pounds laptop with me so it's definetly not an issue to me.In fact, this is much lighter than a laptop but yet at the same time it's more flexible. Want to read a book? No problem, this is a tablet after all and you can read in the confort of your couch. Want to type a text on the go? You can pair a bluetooth keyboard and a mouse and use your tablet as a laptop. Want to write something? Use the Spen. I really like to be able to choose my input method based on what I want to do.On the downside, there are three things that I would change. First the physical button. I mean when you are holding the tablet in portrait mode, it's really annoying to have a button on the side of your tablet. It's so easy to press it by mistake. I don't know why Samsung is not putting virtual buttons on its tablets instead. This is a no brainer to me. It's not a deal breaker though. You get used to it but this is something that should be corrected.I also don't like the fact that not a lot of applications support the multi windows mode. I know for a fact that if you root the tablet, you can enable all the applications to be windowed so it's not a technical problem. I don't understand why Samsung made this choice. It's really annoying to not be able to use all applications side by side.Third, I wish this tablet was wider. This is a 16:10 device so the device is very narrow compared to its height. I wish it was one inch larger. This way it would be closer to a legal letter dimensions. Better, why not having the possibility to remove the bezels when you put your tablet on a table.

The more I used the docked TF701, the more disappointed I was with both dock and tablet. It is fast, faster than my old Windows 7 laptop, but I was eventually dealing with crashes as well as the dock not responding and at one time it quit working altogether. Some tech savvy folk have returned their dock more than 5 times only to get another lemon. I was specifically looking at the TF701/dock as a laptop replacement for Windows, but most people who had replaced their Windows laptops with Android told me: \"Go get a Galaxy Note.\" I didn't want to go down that road because Samsung seems to be dominating the Android hardware market. I felt we needed a more level playing field as there was during the old PC-era with Dell, HP, Compaq, and the other companies which built hardware for Windows. I tried an $850 Windows 8 substitute for my old Windows 7 laptop, but it was rife with so many issues that I finally decided to stick with Android and eventually caved in and bought the Galaxy Tab 12.2 with the Zagg keyboard/dock (yes, I looked at the iPad as well and realized this was not a point in my life for re-entering the Mac-world). Boy, was I surprised...What a machine! Samsung has nailed the first generation of windowing on Android (and we can all hope there will be many generations to follow), the SM-P900 brings up a very complex Excel spreadsheet in less than 5 seconds (one which took my old Windows laptop nearly a minute to open), and it is just overall a phenomenal experience to use this, well, what can I call it? I feel like something from the future which has fortuitously landed in my hands . You can write on the screen and then send the notes to email or wherever and so far the translation has been nearly always right. The capabilities just go on and on...it is a laptop replacement and much, much more. This product showcases why Samsung dominates Android hardware, though their software wrap on their tablet is a lot of bloat-ware stuff which just gets in the way; because of that and the fact that the new leader of Android at Google has disabled external SD-access in Kitkat 4.4.2, I had to root it, as it looks like all of us will with any device which has an SD card in the future which we want to use as a disc drive unless standard access to external SD memory is reinstated, but rooting was an easy 15 minute process in my case (though one which voided the tablet's warranty if not unrooted before making a claim). I installed the Nova launcher as well.  Anyway, all said, when I look up from interacting with this Galaxy 12.2 Tab while writing this review by speaking/handwriting/and a bit of typing, I fully expected to see myself floating between solar systems in an advanced anti-gravity machine which is destined to take everyone who understands the power of the machine on an unprecedented adventure...it's the type of advance which makes one feel that way.

Screen is still sharp, though not as sharp as the same pixel dimensions in the two smaller versions, but every bit as good as an iPad, only bigger. I really like reading the Zinio magazines on it. Lots of folks have written way more, so I'm going to keep this short. I bought mine as used, not new to save about ten percent. Wrong idea. No complaints about the unit or accessories. The box was a bit crushed, but I got the version \"in original packaging\" thinking it would be new, just a defect in the packaging. Well, the unit was apparently registered by someone else and, upon trying to register it, I was told I was out of luck on claiming any of the perks -- like a $25 Google Play credit and multi-year free access to several services. I'd have to login using the original credentials, which, of course, I don't have. Not only that, if I want to use the Google \"find my device\" service, I can't because it's not registered in my account. I'm a bit concerned that whomever did register it could also activate the \"erase all data\" option and wipe me out. So I'm not too sure about buying things like tablets through the warehouse. It's a great device and an OK discounted price (although too high overall, but it is 12.2 inches), but the loss of other benefits may not be worth it.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just what I've been waiting for!", "Author": "Brad M.

I really liked the Yoga 2 laptops except the windows tablet apps don't handle the resolution well and the screen is too narrow in portrait mode.  The Note 12.2 fits what I needed exactly.The feel and look of it is top notch.  The size is perfect for reading magazines, which is my primary use for it.  It's also just right for web pages and the bigger keyboard is easier to type on like you would a traditional keyboard.  Although it's not always as buttery smooth as my wife's iPad, the performance is quite good.  Far better performance than my Nexus 10.I love all the 140 lb nerds that say this thing will break your wrist.  True the size isn't for everyone, some people actually exercise and don't mind lifting 1.9 lbs.  I'm pretty sure my hand weighs more than that.  And it will effortlessly fit in any backpack with your laptop.

The installed version of Android does not allow the user to write to the SD card in the slot; only apps can do so for their operating use.  Thus, I would not suggest purchasing a large SD card for your document storage. A smaller one is fine.  Documents added by a computer can be read, but not changed and re-stored on the card.

As a tablet I give it 6 stars out of 5.Having said that, the reason I got the Galaxay Note Pro was because it has been touted as a lap-top replacement.  I bought is as an office productivity lap-top replacement for my 81-year old mother, who has never used mobile touch technology.  DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS.  This is still Android, and even if file management, etc. is a little more convenient than iOS, it\u2019s a tablet.  To print a photo, you have to got out of the gallery, open a printing app, find the picture again, and go through many touch-steps (like a dozen touches) to choose all the options.  Compared to a PC, it\u2019s a bear.  And for my 81-year-old non-techno mom to learn this?  Forget it!  That alone would take forever to teach her.  But every basic PC function she\u2019s used to, other than Chrome, is that much more complicated.Hword margins are in mm, not inches.  (Maybe there\u2019s a way to change it, but if so, it\u2019s non-intuitive).  The fonts are better than most Android WP apps, but limited compared to Word.  There is no way to print non-gmail emails from any printing apps I tried.  (Google only wants you to use Gmail, I guess.)  And let\u2019s face it \u2013 mobile operating systems were never designed to DO the data management and manipulation which Windows or Mac OS do so naturally.  Mobile devices are still computer ACCESSORIES, designed primarily for communication and media consumption.  Of course, they do many things a computer CAN\u2019T DO.  The touch-world and app-world are amazing.  But not full-on office productivity.Theoretically, yes, you probably could do 80% of what a laptop or PC does on this, but yikes, what a nuisance!  You could also write a novel on your smartphone, but would you want to?I\u2019m bummed, because I love so much about this tablet.

It worked fine for few files and then transfer failed. I copied HD movie file and mp4 video files, transfer worked for few files then stopped.  The tablet recognizes the SD card and USB drive and I can view data and play files from the USB Drive and also shows SD card.. so nothing  wrong with  USB or micro SD card . But the transfer of the files failed after the transfer of few files. I formatted the SD disk and again try to copy from USB to Micro SD card and it failed again.  I took my system to best buy Samsung Re. They also tried and could not transfer the files from the USB to micro SD card. They called the Samsung technical consultant who gave a ridiculous answer that the system cannot be used for file transfers. So what I am supposed to do with this tablet ? Just browse net and download games ...? I wanted to store video files and photo albums on SD card by transfer from USB drive and watch them when I am in a place where I do not have internet access and also use this for my video presentation. But,  could not make this work.  I spent hours to resolve and even best buy Samsung representative tried their best but failed.In a nutshell FILE TRANSFER FROM USB TO MICRO SD CARD DOES NOT WORK.  I have not tested the display ability on large screen as I do not have the connector. For me this tablet is glamorous piece of junk. I would call Samsung tech support myself and see if this get resolved.I talked to Samsung Tech support and they concluded my SD card to be defective( which I purchased from Costco a day ago). It is weird that micro SD worked for few hours then gets screwed for some reasons. I went to best buy purchased another SD card and tested. For now I am able to copy from the USB drive to Micro SD card. Let me see how this goes and would update my review.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "What a Nightmare", "Author": "Lance D.

After that the menu button and other exterior controls frequently wouldn\u2019t work.  This made it impossible to exit a program (or settings).  It went as far as the on/restart button not working either.  I have to force a reboot in order to get out of the program I'm in most of the time.I thought it must be the tablet so I exchanged it.  The problem returned almost immediately, so I contacted Samsung.  The person I talked to said they\u2019d never heard of anyone having this problem so they suggested a reset/reinstall, because they have to say something.  The idea seemed pointless to me since I had just gotten a newer tablet a couple of days previous, but I tried it anyway.

Make sure your product's seal is unbroken!!", "Author": "Matti Nazeeh", "ReviewID": "R27DDOX4H3P5DR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so excited to get the Samsung Galaxy Note pro 12.2. I ordered the product from Amazon and when i received the product i was very disappointed with it. First of all, the seal was broken (opened), and Amazon has covered the broken seal with another seal of their own. I can clearly say that there were two seals one on top of the other. But they've put the other seal on top of the original broken seal so that it would appear that the product was new and unopened. The second thing is that there was an obvious fingerprint on the device when i opened it, And also some dust inside. The third thing is that the original stickers ( that cover the sides and the back and the screen ) were replaced by a cheap replica and i could tell the difference for they were not placed perfectly onto the product and there were bubbles appearing on the screen sticker. Anyhow, i always doubted amazon selling used product and i said i'll try this time maybe i'm wrong. But i was right. I returned the product and will never trust Amazon again. Always buy from the original company, even if you have to pay a little money on the taxes. It's better than getting a used product.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it, but as a tablet, the size is too much to handle", "Author": "Big Willie \"Big Willie\"", "ReviewID": "R580MGSFV22EL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, I bought this today at noon.  Black.  Also, I have an S4, and the gear watch...also an iPad 2 32g.  It is time to change out the iPad while support is still to be had.  I was geeked about this, the size all the extras..and I truly love it.  I travel often, so this considered a nice option for the flights, both for work and leisure.  But once I got it in my hands, was able to sit with it, move around, try both landscape and portrait, I realized how large this ting truly is.  I started to doubt it's practicality in my working environment, one not far off from many others.  That being said, I have come to the solid conclusion that it is just simply too large as a true tablet.  I am 6'4\"...a big guy...big hands.  It is just too large to use as a natural tablet.  With a keyboard, or less frequent mobile use...it likely is a gem.  But when I consider traveling, flying, pulling this sled out in a meeting, you may as well grab your lap top...NOT A TABLET....I just can't do it...plus the price does not make it any easier to overlook the uncomfortably large size.As in all things, especially tablets, how one uses it defines how good it is...to each person.  To me, The size, as a tablet replacing an ipad2 for business and personal use, it was overbearingly large. I really, really wanted to love this and have it work out....but it is going back.  I have since purchased a 32GB 10.1 Note 2014 edition, I believe it is a better, natural, tablet.
