A ultrabook sized laptop with reasonably good discrete graphics card, count me in.  However, who in their right mind puts a absolutely terrible TN 1366x768 panel on a 1,100 dollar laptop?!?!?!  Even my 750 dollar work laptop has a gorgeous 1080 IPS touchscreen (if you don't know the difference IPS has much truer colors, much better contrast, and worlds better viewing angles.  Almost all screens on high end tablets and Macs are IPS, which is part of why they look so good).  This is simply another case of a computer manufacturer shooting themselves in the foot by trying to cut corners and hoping that no one will notice on a machine that has so much potential.  You can and have done better Asus!!! The only other complaint is the lack of a pure SSD storage system, although this can be forgiven as it does at least include some SSD cache and there are many people who prefer high storage capacity to storage speed.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E36LGTG"}}
