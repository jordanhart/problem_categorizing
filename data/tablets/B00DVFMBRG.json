Firstly as a mini travel laptop that weighs very little and takes up very little space, secondly as a sketchbook, and lastly just as a couch tablet like most people.As a sketchbook, it's pretty solid. I've installed photoshop and while the computer isn't fast enough for giant files, it works perfectly well for light sketching and painting.When it comes down to it, this is not the fastest machine on the market. What it is though, is the cheapest full windows 8 tablet with a pressure sensitive pen that is currently available.  The Surface Pro is faster and overall better, however it's also heavier, costs more, and doesn't come with a keyboard/cover (which costs even more).Weigh your options.  There are android tablets that are pressure sensitive and faster for cheaper if that's what you want.  The newest galaxy tablet is that.  This particular tablet just suited my needs the best based on what was on the market.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for work! Terrible for gaming!", "Author": "Georgi S.

In addition to serving well for networking and entertainment.Many reviews (professional and not) have complained about a deficiency of CPU power.  I have yet to encounter this as a problem.  I imagine I would if I tried to run high-performance apps or games on it.  But as is clear from my list above, that's not why I wanted it.In my first few days of adapting and configuring I had to overcome the following problems:1)  I did not like carrying it around or holding it with the keyboard that comes with it.  Nor did I like holding the device all by itself.  I bought a carrying case for it (Targus makes a nice one that specifically fits this device and the Galaxy Note 10) which it now lives in.  I prop it on top of the Bluetooth keyboard when I want to use that.  On rare occasions I put it back in the original keyboard carrier when I know I'll want to use it as a \"laptop\" for an extended period.2)  The text and icons on the Windows desktop were too small for me.  I hunted around and found the Windows settings to increase the device font and icon sizes and now it feels like a tablet, rather than a microfiche viewer.3)  I had never used Windows 8.  It took me a while to understand that the \"metro\" interface really is the \"Start Menu\".  If you swipe up on the metro interface you get a listing of all the Windows apps -- including the basic accessories and utilities.  Took me forever to find those.4)  The built in Mail app cannot connect to POP email services.  I had to re-configure my email account to IMAP to get it to work.5)  You can't dynamically synch between a Google Calendar and Windows 8 (as of now, thought that may change).  I had to start an office.com account to synch my Windows Calendar app with my Android phone.So, I experience a bit of frustration the first few days.

Every time it went for service and every time Samsung customer support had me reset or refresh the tablet, I lost 4-6 days of productivity. Everything had to be re-installed (Office, Norton 360, all apps) and windows had to go through several normal updates.

I can't use it on my lap, while traveling, because the entire thing falls backwards if it's even slightly tilted back - so I need to have a coat or backpack in my lap, then arrange the Tab 3 on top of that so it's cradled at the right angle.  It's iffy on top of soft quilts/mattresses.  Worst of all, you can't rotate it 360 degrees.  So if I want to use just the \"tablet\" functionality, such as when space is really tight, I can't just flip the keyboard all the way around and lay it flat.  It seems like such a stupid design flaw.

BUT, I wanted Windows Tablet that was 10.1 (tried 8\" DELL, and it was too small) and the price was very good.  So I took out insurance and jumped!  I did have a major problem with Windows 8.1 install, with my \"wireless\" connection continually falling into a degraded state -- viz. it showed a connection but wouldn't transfer data.  I'd continually start over at base Win 8 install, make restore points, and slowly add functionality up through installing Win 8.1 though the Store, then my wireless would go sideways.  Even with updated wireless drivers from SamsungUpdate app.  Then I ran across a comment on the internet where a guy, with the same problem, un-installed Norton antivirus (using the uninstall tool downloaded from Norton), and the problem went away.  I tried it, downloading Norton uninstall from their site, and that fixed the wireless problem. Upgraded to Win 8.1 (from the Store) with no problems.  OK, now for a list of tips:1) As soon as you get through the initial startup setup of your ATIV, go through Charms-> Settings -> Change PC settings->Update and Recover-> windows update  and put on Win 8 updates until you stop getting notices of updates when you return to this spot (as listed at the start). This should happen a couple of times.  Don't use Samsung Update tool yet.  Note: you'll need to restart repeatedly.2) Remove Norton Antivirus as described above.  You can use Windows defender for your virus protection -- and it's free.  Restart if requested.3) Run Samsung Update app.  Some people have had with GPS, Bluetooth, and Digitizer.  a) Don't work about GPS -- uncheck it -- you don't have a GPS.  b) Update the bluetooth.  c) As for the digitizer  you will HAVE TO go to the Wacom site and download the Win 8 driver as the Samsung Update app driver will fail it's install and tell you the same.  d) restart as needed....4) Go to Store and upgrade to 8.1 -- Give yourself plenty of time!!!!5) If you go to windows update, as described above, I have stayed away from any!! Win 8 updates to date -- cannot vouch for them in terms of their effect.6) make restore points after new installs, so if they goof you up, you can roll back.The ATIV is not a fast machine, but it's ok.  You can install the free Home Office 2013 without issue.  I picked up some utilities from Stardock that go a long ways in facilitating navigation between the traditional Windows desktop and Metro.  With the 10.1 screen, the Windows desktop is very workable by touch!
