{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good tablet in 10\" range, better resolution was expected", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R1E3E93MNC6P9I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung has done it again. They are releasing tablets at very periodic intervals. Samsung's fourth generation of Galaxy Tab series is as expected and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 and I am very much impressed with Galaxy line of devices.  In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. If you are looking for playing games/reading books, 10.1\u201d is good. I really wish this had a better resolution. Hence only 4 stars for pixels per density for this tablet.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 4 series. This year the space has become crowded as Samsung also has 8.4\u201d, 10.1\u201d and 12.2\u201d Tab Pro Series. They are pricier, but if you can afford I very STRONGLY suggest you get the PRO series just for one thing - RESOLUTION. I was really hoping the Tab series will go to a larger resolution. But again price/performance is a factor that drives Samsung to make devices at all ranges.Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 4 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 3 models. I have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop. If you have Tab 3, don\u2019t upgrade. No need to. Those devices worked well a year back and still are. The photos look just as beautiful on them as they did a year ago!Some Tab 4 specs have certainly become better, but not in a revolutionary sense. The pixels per inch ppi is the best in 7\u201d among all of Galaxy Tab 4 series. That is because all have same resolution and size is the variable. For a first time user, you will be blown away by the feature set now. The tablets have multi user profiles, so each user can customize like a home PC.Look at three specs that really interest you and nail down the tablet you need. Look at the big picture, what you want from a tablet now, a year from now, what your family needs out of this and make a decision.7-inch Galaxy Tab 4 tablet: 1280x800, 216 ppi, 1.2 GHz Quad-Core, 1.5GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 32 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 9.74 oz.

(510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming.The 10.1\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs very lightweight. SD card capability is awesome! With prices plummeting for microSD GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.This has Bluetooth 4.0\" and have USB Host. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. All devices perform most of common functions.7\u201d Tab is smallest, portable8\u201d Tab is biggers, readable8.4\u201d TAB PRO awesome crisp resolution - Best pixel density of all 6 Tab 4 and TAB Pro versions10.1\u201d TAB gameplay10.1\u201d TAB Pro games/books/sharper resolution12.2\u201d Bring on the books and Glossy magazines!If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos, playing games 10.1\"is definitely great. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background.

This review is not incentivized by Samsung in any way. I purchased the product for my own use.What is it?The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is the aforementioned company\u2019s latest foray into the midrange tablet market. With these tablets you\u2019re not likely to find a \u201cretina display\u201d or anything over 720p resolution, but they\u2019re more reasonably priced, and therefore, more likely to be adopted by more people.SpecificationsProcessor: 1.2 GHz Quad CoreMemory: 1.5GBStorage: 16GB with additional microSD slotDisplay: 1280\u00d7800Operating System: Android Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz UIAs you can see, those specs really aren\u2019t too shabby, but they\u2019re definitely not bleeding edge technology. However, having the latest and greatest isn\u2019t always the best. For example, I recently purchased the higher end Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and was utterly disappointed in it. Yes, the screen was beautiful but you could tell that not a lot of games had been properly coded for that resolution as the HD graphics appeared pixelated and blocky. Also, the Tab Pro suffered from massive lag and stuttering when when navigating through the operating system. You can read about my experience with that tablet here. It was promptly returned to Best Buy.Back to the Galaxy Tab 4.As mentioned earlier, it runs Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsung\u2019s custom TouchWiz user interface over top. In my opinion, this isn\u2019t a bad thing since I have never been a fan of HTC\u2019s Sense UI. It sadly still comes packed full of bloatware that I almost always remove if possible.Initial ThoughtsBeing an ex-member of the cult of Steve Jobs, I am still getting used to the Android world and the lack of high resolution displays in some products. The Galaxy S5, which I own, has the best display and form factor on the market right now. Are you listening Apple? Thankfully, there are cheaper Android tablets available that still offer a high quality user experience.Once you go through the obligatory setup screens and sync your applications, the tablet is zippy and runs with no lag whatsoever. Overall memory utilization is low when using several apps at once and multi-tasking.DisplayOK, this is a 720p display. You will notice a difference if using an S5 and then the Galaxy Tab 4 \u2013 but let\u2019s not compare the two. The 1280\u00d7800 screen is actually quite beautiful and bright. This is one of the brighter screens I\u2019ve seen on a midrange tablet. Text is sharp as are the graphics, both are quickly rendered thanks to the 1.5GB RAM and quad core processor. Yes, I think it should be a 1080p panel, but it\u2019s a $319 tablet.PerformanceI was able to open apps and switch between them fairly quickly. This little tablet is definitely more responsive than it\u2019s bigger, more expensive brother. Even under heavy use the Tab 4 performed excellent. It\u2019s able to handle video encoded to 1080p with no stutter, even though it\u2019s obviously rendered at 720p on the screen. No complaints at all about performance.Final ImpressionsI\u2019m still an Apple fanboy, just now living in an Android world. I really like the Galaxy Tab 4. It\u2019s fast, responsive, light, and does what I need it to do. I feel like for the most part, I could ditch my laptop when traveling. That is, as long as I\u2019m not running a GoPro, or editing HD video.The display is not as sharp as I like, but the applications and games I use are not upated to be displayed yet at the higher resolutions on the Tab Pro.Kit Kat has grown, the OS takes up about 4GB of the internal 16GB, and by the time you add-in the Samsung applications and associated bloatware, you have only about 9GB of usable space. That almost sounds like a Surface tablet, no? LOL Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist. Samsung says the answer is to use a microSD card \u2013 which you will want to do immediately. They state on their site, that a maximum of 64GB is supported, although I am tempted to buy a 128GB and try it. I know those work in the S5.So, should you buy it? If you like new gadgets, sure. If you want a great performing Android tablet for a great price, absolutely. I can\u2019t really find anything wrong with this little guy. It\u2019s a keeper.UPDATEI pre-ordered the Galaxy Tab 4 on Amazon at $349. It was released May 1st, and it looks like the price was dropped to $319.99, making it an even better value.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it BUT......", "Author": "Bruce", "ReviewID": "R2IWRCS7H5LI39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got our Galaxy 10.1 and were very anxious to get started with it. Everything went fine until we tried to link up devices with bluetooth. We like it BUT it turns out that some of these tablets have problems with Bluetooth and we must have gotten one of them.

I need to contact Amazon and find out what can be done about the Bluetooth issue.Note: I did do some research on this and found that Samsung does not have a fix and they really do not seem to know what to do about it.

I'm not sure.I personally know my local USPS does not handle packages like some Fedex and UPS workers we've all seen in Youtube viral videos destroying packages. I can't speak for the rest of the shipping team in other parts of the city and country. The box it arrived in wasn't damaged at all though, it had a minor crease in it, can't even call it a dent. The Tablet however arrived with a crack in the upper left hand corner of the screen, which at first seemed very minor and my mother still loved the gift and decided she would keep it anyway due to her being old and not caring for superficial things like us modern day kids do. However, almost a week later she started to complain to me that she couldn't figure out how to use some of the features correctly. I inspected the product further and after some testing I noticed about a quarter of the screen where the crack was located was not functioning properly. While there were no cracks in the screen itself, only the glass protecting the screen, the finger sensor was not reading her finger so when she tried to click on things to swipe it didn't work in that specific region leading to almost all if not all the apps not working properly.Talking to Amazon they offered a replacement or refund, I would rather have a replacement considering my moms loves the idea of being able to watch T.v and E-mail from anywhere. I opted for that and now I'll be receiving a replacement in a few days.Overall happy, just wish it didn't come as it did.The product however 5/5 Stars, its a tablet on steroids, No need for overpriced Ipads.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "super", "Author": "Richard C.
