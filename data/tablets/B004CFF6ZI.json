If you want an Android tablet you can root or upgrade, don't bother, you will not be happy. If you want it to be an Ipad, forget about it.However, if you want a $250 color e-reader that has a stable OS, long battery life, and a seven inch 800x600 touchscreen you will be pleased. You will be more pleased with the capability to surf the internet, check e-mail and load simple apps. The Cruz comes preloaded with the Kindle reader and most other e-readers can be downloaded from freewarelovers.com.  The screen size, the rubber back, touch screen, wifi, and all day battery life make this an excellent e-reader that compares well with the Nook color. The new version of the Android Kindle app (which can be downloaded from freewarelovers.com) also allows you to download magazines in color.As an e-reader with expanded capabilities the Cruz is a great product and I am very pleased with it. Out of the box, the software is very stable, the battery is 75% charged and the Kindle app is ready to go. As a cutting edge Galaxy or Ipad competitor, the Cruz falls short, but it is much cheaper than those devices. I describe the Cruz to my friends as a  Kindle version of the Nook Color. A \"Kindle Color\" is the best way to describe it.I have loaded my Cruz with the following apps, all obtained from freewarelovers.com or the web, and they all work well: Kindle, Overdrive Media Console (for library e-books), Kobo Reader, Aldiko Reader, Wapedia, Newspapers, Reuters, Iheartradio, Skyfire browser and Dolphin browser.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "EDITED: Not As Happy Now", "Author": "Kalaab M. Pickering", "ReviewID": "R16DI7XMBS05SA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "EDIT: After having this tablet for over a year now, I'm reducing the star rating from 4 to 2.  After buying and reviewing this tablet originally, I bought a Samsung Transform phone, which runs Android 2.2.2.  After having a direct comparison, this tablet started showing its flaws.  While I still stand by my original comments (which remain unedited below), there are some significant issues that I found unsatisfactory:* Software Limitations - This turned out to be a big one for me.  When I bought this tablet, I noted a wide variety of file support.  However, as time has passed, this device's fairly early Android O/S doesn't support a lot of newer apps.  Also, while finding .apk files to install software on the internet is easy, the complete lack of Android Market/Play Store support is a major disadvantage.  Also, you can't upgrade the Android O/S on the Cruz, possibly on account of my next point:* Hardware Limitations - I can't weigh this too heavily, simply because tablets are a one-shot device that can't really be upgraded (though I believe that day is coming soon).  In any case, The Cruz's 528mhz processor (compared to my Transform's 800mhz processor) definitely trails behind.  Both devices have 256mb of RAM, and the Transform's performance totally clobbers the Cruz.* Usability - Since my purchase of the Cruz, I have also purchased a low-rung Kindle.  I purchased the Kindle when the price dropped, and I won't read on another platform ever again.  I've had experience with the Nook readers (both color and virtual paper display models), and the elegance and functionality of the Kindle is far superior.  I was shocked at how pleasurable and simple the reading process is on the Kindle, as compared to the Cruz, which is clunky and slow.  The gripe I had with Kindle's more narrow format support is easily remedied with the free open-source software Calibre, which organizes your library and converts formats.  With the Kindle, pages turn faster, the text is easier on the eyes, and the reading process is far more transparent than on a tablet.  I find that to be the case with color readers in general, including the Kindle and Nook, but the Cruz makes it very obvious you're doing other things besides reading when you use it.I'm still fairly happy with it as a portable media device and a mess-around toy for internet browsing and such, but the execution of this device could have been a lot better.  I still recommend it, with the caveat that you understand what it can and can't do before purchasing it.  I still find uses for it.ORIGINAL REVIEWOriginally, I was going to title my review \"Excellent eBook Reader\", but that would be selling the Cruz Tablet short.  Although I primarily use my Cruz Tablet as an ebook reader, it is actually a multimedia device with internet capabilities.  This is a stark difference to conventional ebook readers, who usually tack on features like MP3 playability almost as an afterthought.  The Android operating system effectively and elegantly addresses six key features: ebooks, internet, music, movies, pictures, and games & apps.  I will break each down:eBook Reader: The Cruz was an obvious choice for me as an ebook reader for three reasons: PDF, TXT, and HTML support.  Of course, there are apps that allow you to read the major ebook formats as well (Kindle, Nook, etc), but given the abundance of ebooks that use the three standard formats mentioned above, the lack of support for these formats on any reader is, to me, unacceptable.  These formats have been around for many years and are excellent formats for ebooks.  When an ebook reader supports only its proprietary format and maybe one of those three, that sends a message to me that they're interested in the money of their constituency, not their ease of use or satisfaction.  In any case, the Cruz supports all major formats for ebooks, and reading on it is a pleasure.  (*****)Internet: The Cruz supports true internet connections, meaning 802.11x wireless connectivity.  The included browser is sufficient for most applications, but does not support Flash, meaning no youtube, etc.  A previous reviewer recommended the 3rd-party browser Skyfire, which I have installed successfully for that purpose.  Aside from that, there is not much else to comment on.  The web is at your fingertips, as the tired old saying goes. (****)Music: With the ability to read numerous formats and create playlists, it's a good fill-in for an MP3 player if you only want to carry one device.  Media of all types (ebooks, movies, music, etc) are stored on an SD card, which I find more convenient than limiting.  The size of the device does not behoove you to ditch your standard MP3 player, but considering all of the additional functionality of the device, it'll make you think long and hard about it. (****)Movies: This device reads MP4 format for video.  While I prefer other codecs and file formats for compressed video, you can get a reasonably good-looking and -sounding full-length movie down to just over a gig with the right software, making this a very enticing feature of the tablet. (***)Pictures: Photo support is pretty standard these days, and the implementation of photo galleries and desktop pictures is what you would expect.  Nothing about this feature stands out, but on the other hand, nothing is missing. (***)Games & Apps: A lot of people have griped about a lack of official Android Market access on this device, and while those complaints are valid and realistic, there is an abundance of software you can install on your Cruz from many resources.  There are third-party marketplace apps ready to be installed, and finding apk software bundles on the 'net is a cinch.  Installing is as easy as dropping the apk on your SD card, browsing to it using Android's Astro file browser, then launch and install.  I have run into a few applications that don't want to cooperate, but the vast majority of apps and games I have installed have been problem-free.  Keep in mind, however, it does take some know-how and creativity to find apk's without Android Market, but it is not difficult. (****)Overall, I'm compelled to give this tablet four stars overall.  The tablet takes a bit of getting used to, but is easy to use and makes taking media with you wherever you go a snap.  The fact that the tablet features a user-replaceable battery is also a perk, considering some manufacturers (who shall remain unnamed) like to stick it to you in that area.Naturally, this tablet will garner a lot of comparison to the iPad.  However, this notion is strictly apples-to-oranges in its nature of comparison, though I will say that I prefer the ability to choose and install software rather freely with the Cruz, an option not as immediately available to iPad users.I do not wish to make this a soapbox review about the evils of Apple equipment; I will be the first to admit that Apple makes good, sound, reliable, and accessible equipment.  However, for reasons stated above (as well as reasons not stated in the review pertaining to Apple), my purchase of the Cruz was not just a matter of settling, it was a matter of preference.I love this product.  After using it as much as I have (for all sorts of things), I just shake my head while I look at the Kindles and the Nooks with bemusement.  They seem to me like a dial watch: \"What, all it does is tell time?  Isn't this the 21st Century, the Information Age?\"  ... Okay, that may be taking it a bit far, but there is certainly a gap in functionality between these new tablet devices and ebook readers.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love Mine But After A Few Easy and Legal Mods", "Author": "FrisbeePat", "ReviewID": "R3VCRTXRCF5DLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I love this device! And just so you know, I was a software engineer in my previous career and now teach an engineering curriculum in high school, so believe me, when kids are wowed by your technology then you know it's good stuff. A few months ago I foolishly bought a Chinese knock-off Android tablet and I hated it; it was the classic case of \"you get what you pay for.\" The Cruz T301 is definitely NOT a knock-off. The screen is gorgeous and extremely responsive, the Kindle app works just fine with all my eBooks, and there are plenty of the apps that I need in the Amazon store. Take note, I said \"apps that I need.\" No, the Cruz does not have access to the Android Marketplace but let's be honest, there's a lot of junk apps in the full marketplace and I don't need 99.999% of them.For those that are either having troubles with their Cruz or are hesitant due to some of the negative reviews, I should tell you that the Cruz is not great out of the box. There are some things you need to do in order to get the maximum performance out of it. None of these things will void the warranty (like rooting it) or take a great deal of expertise.1. Read the complete user guide BEFORE opening the box. The manual included with the Cruz is laughable at best.2. UPGRADE TO ANDROID 2.2! I am shouting that one because it is the first thing you should do with it out of the box! (After giving it a full charge anyway) The upgrade is easy to do, takes about no more than 15 minutes, and there are simple step-by-step instructions on the manufacturer's web site. Believe me you will see a great deal of improvement in performance if you upgrade it. Plus upgrading it to 2.2 is just the right thing to do. No one should be running 2.0.3. Download and install the SkyFire web browser. The browser is not available in either the Cruz Market or the Amazon Marketplace (as far as I can tell) so what I had to do is find the install file online, download it to my laptop, copy it to the Cruz's SD card, and then install it from there. This browser has workarounds for lack of Adobe Flash support and loads full web pages (instead of mobile versions of web sites) at acceptable speeds.4. Spend the $9.95 to upgrade to OfficeSuite Pro. I've had pretty good experiences with not only browsing MS Office documents (both old format and 2007) but editing and even composing them as well.5. Install a screen shield/protector. Not only will it reduce (if not eliminate) scratches on the surface, it reduces the glare and improves the touch response, especially when dragging items. Actually every tablet owner should do this, it just makes sense. If you don't want to do it yourself, find a Zagg store at a nearby mall and have them install one.6. Repeat to yourself: THIS IS NOT AN IPAD! You paid less than half the price of an iPad and you're getting almost all of the capability. If you want an iPad, save more money, wait a while longer and buy one. It only has 256 MB of RAM so don't go crazy opening 20 apps at once. Some apps will stay in system memory even after you close them out, so use ASTRO (the Cruz's file manager) to kill any unwanted apps to free memory.Again, I'm a techie so I think I have a sense of what's good and what's not. For the past year I've been Jones-ing for either a Kindle, and iPad, or both. Now I don't want either one because my Cruz has made me extremely happy, once I did the steps I listed above. And I hope I've persuaded those of you on the fence to go ahead and buy the Cruz 301, I think it's a steal at for the $160-$200 price range.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "As long as your expectations are in check, you'll love it", "Author": "TRLB", "ReviewID": "R18SIF1P5ONZKM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved this device for Christmas, and was a little concerned given all the negative reviews I've seen. But I must say, after having it for a while now, I really like it. And this is totally honest, and I don't work for VM. It does everything I wanted it to do. It's an awesome e-reader, it has excellent video playback, I can surf the web easily and I've been able to install a ton of apps from Android Market alternatives.My only con would be not having flash and You Tube video access, but that was not my primary reason for wanting this item. I think too, people are extremely critical without knowing enough about the device or not really playing with the device enough before judging. I'm sooooooo glad I didn't spend $400-600 on an Ipad, when all I wanted is what is on this device.I would suggest, that before you purchase, go to the website and read the manual. Find out if it does the things you need it to do, and if it does, it will be a great purchase. If not, buy an Ipad.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "An eReader/Tablet that Fails Miserably", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RMBB5WXGIC054", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Velocity Micro Cruz T301 from a third party seller (not Amazon).  I have no complains for their customer service.  Velocity Micro as a company is a different story.  But first, the tablet itself.Out of the box, everything seemed set up for success.  The features were decent for the price, the tablet itself is nicely designed, a stand is included, the instruction manual was short but helpful, and the tablet came fully charged.  Unfortunately, the good design stopped there.First, the screen, while acceptable during initial testing, is clearly not the highest quality.  Text was fuzzy, more so than the 800x600 resolution would warrant.  Text was even fuzzier than on my wife's 3rd generation iPod touch. Since the T301 is sold as an eReader or Reading Tablet, text clarity is crucial, and the tablet fails on that count.Since the tablet has the Kindle for Android app \"pre-installed\" I expected that Kindle, of all the apps, would work fine.  I signed in and downloaded a few books out of my Archived Items.  I opened a book that I had been previously reading.  It crashed.  I opened another book.  It crashed.  A few other books.  One or two worked.  I thought perhaps an update would help.  I downloaded the latest version of the Kindle app from the Cruz Market.  That didn't help.  I tried restarting the tablet.  That didn't help.After perhaps an hour of constant crashes in the Kindle app, I decided to try some other eReader apps.  The Nook app wouldn't install.  The Kobo app installed but I didn't have sufficient time to test it.  I can understand some other eReader apps not working/installing properly, since the tablet only runs Android 2.0, but why doesn't the built-in Kindle app work?I decided to try the web browser.  I discovered that the screen, while capacitive, is nothing like an iPod Touch, or a basic Android phone.  Instead, you have to press firmly to scroll.  The web browser crashed.  The tablet even rebooted at one point while trying to use the browser.A few other basic apps are included, and those worked for the most part.  But I didn't buy the tablet to check email or update Twitter; I wanted to read my Kindle books.I decided it was time to call tech support.  I was at queue position 36.  Two hours and fifteen minutes later, I was finally at queue position 2.  When I got through and the phone started ringing, I discovered my two hours of waiting had landed me in...you guessed it...a voicemail box.  No apology, no \"sorry to keep you waiting for two hours when you could have left a message after 5 minutes.\"  I left a message, expecting a call back the next day.  No call by noon, so I called back.  Once again, queue position 25.  I called sales.  They were also busy.  I called PR and got in touch with a friendly but unempowered individual who promised to have support call me back \"as soon as possible.\"  Midnight Thursday night, and still no call.  Repeated attempts to reach tech support earlier on Thursday landed me in the queue at positions 26, 18, and 15.Perhaps I received a defective device, but due to my inability to reach tech support, or even sales, or even get a human being to answer my calls, and due to the constant crashes and loss of functionality, I cannot recommend this tablet.For what it's worth, the T103 Cruz Tablet I played with at Borders before buying the T301 had similar crashes, but I had hoped it was only their much-abused display model that had issues.  Now I suspect it is the cheap parts and poorly configured software on the Velocity Micro tablets/ereaders that is at fault.Don't buy the T301.  Save your money for another tablet, like an iPad or Nook Color, or else just buy a Kindle.  Having used all three of those devices previously, they are leaps and bounds ahead of Velocity Micro's offerings.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised!", "Author": "B. Montgomery", "ReviewID": "RAN88P26F3CPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Velocity Cruz Tablet T301 expecting to have an E-READER, as well as a light, internet tool to play with around airports, public spaces, etc. when I couldn't be near a computer. I will have to say, I have fallen IN LOVE with this Tablet! I commute on a daily basis downtown, so I am very happy that I was able to download all my books on this device. (You have the KINDLE app and BORDERS app included on the device) The only bummer is I can't seem to get the NOOK app to download on the device, so if you love Barnes & Noble that's something to think about. (I even went on freewarelovers.com and it allows you to download the link, but it won't finish the download once on your device.) Speaking of freewarelovers.com, this website has TONS of cool free Android apps to download that are super easy to install, I have downloaded a lot and continue to see more updated daily, so make this website a favorite because you'll be using it a lot! (Anyone know any other cool websites to download from???)The tablet is very fast on the internet, and has great colors and clarity for websites, as well as an awesome zoom capability! Also, one cool thing to note with the Kindle App is you are able to make the screen white, sepia, or black (for night time reading) as well as highlight sentences which can open up the dictionary (already installed) while reading to let you know what something means, as well as add notes to certain sentences if you happen to be studying, reading something of importance, etc.All in all, for the price it is, I would have to say I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. I wasn't willing to spend $400+ for a tablet, I just wanted a good machine that would allow me to read my books from multiple e-reading sites, as well as allow me to go on Facebook, Email, and any other websites!! This tablet has allowed me to do that, and a bit more! :) I have also downloaded the PANDORA app, so it's very nice to listen to music while reading and browsing the web. Speakers sound nice!!! (Headphone plug as well)Cons: At this moment, we are not able to get on the Android Market, so you are cut off from certain apps because they are connected to that Marketplace. (Hence freewarelovers) I'm hoping Velocity will open that up because that would be awesome!! Also, no flash player, I believe you have to find an app. to play videos on-line. Saw a few for youtube, etc. just haven't put on my Tablet yet. Also, as stated before, no NOOK app available for this yet. (Even tried putting it on SD Card and transferring to Tablet, will not work.)Pros: Great size, awesome e-reader capabilities, fast internet, all websites are colorful/detailed and will fit to the tablet screen (not small websites that are hard to read), cool apps, long battery life. (Mine will last about a week, and that's both reading for about an hour everyday, and surfing the web for an hour everyday. Can go longer if WIFI is turned off.) and cheap SD cards you can buy to have a larger file if you feel that 8GB is too small.Anyhoo, Hope this review was helpful, I know that I was very nervous to buy the Tablet after a few reviews I read. But I can tell you, I think you'll be very surprised and pleased with what a great little purchase this is. And again, if you're looking for an IPAD, this is not it. (Has similarities.. but not it at all.) So if I were you, I would either spend the money and get the IPAD, or spend less and get this item without the disappointment or regrets. :) Happy Shopping!", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price.", "Author": "P.

Update: They now have an update on their site to Android 2.2 and it is much better.No access to app market and finding apps is tedious especially since a lot of them don't install.Doesn't support flash, though skyfire browser lets you play flash.No camera.Mixed feelings:Capacitive touch screen - although better than any resistive screen I've used, it's not as good as other capacitive screens I've used, probably because of the slow processor.The stand is nice but it was designed to use with a charger that has a 90 degree bend and not the straight one that comes with it.I am fairly happy with it.

The browser also works great, especially for Facebook.  My son, on the other hand rarely uses his Archos.  It is very hard to get a Kindle app to work with it.

It is a bit slow, no app market (but I have installed .apk files from the web with no problems) the screen is ok, takes a bit of getting used to, but for a little over $200 you do get a great reader, I like it very much as a reader (updated the Kindle app) you also get a pretty good portable media player with a 'full sized' SD card reader, an ok web browser, true no flash (but I don't think you get flash on the iPad either)...I got this device to see if a tablet would be something I would use long term, as a test case for future buys...so far I think it was a great buy and first taste of the tablet experience. I will most likely wait a bit before my next tablet, first because between the T301 and my smartphone I can do anything I would want to do in the mobile world, and secondly I feel that by the end of this year the Android tablets will really come into there own and I think the end of this year will be the right time to upgrade to a full fledged tablet.

Like having a soundtrack for a movie.That is unitl the one downloaded book that I actually purchased, couldn't be recalled 4 weeks later. Borders promised over 99 free downloadable books. Slim pickings of not very interesting books. The books I did download for free, however became unaccessible at the same time my purchased book did. The book cover icons remained in my library, but the device would try to upload the books and say, \"This book cannot be accessed right now, our site is working on this problem.\"VIDEO PLAYBACK is a JOKE.I uploaded a 10second vid from my PC -that had originated from my camera. It only half worked before freezing up the entire device and I'd have to exit the program and re-enter it just to see 3 seconds of the vid. It's impressive \"lookin\" but don't believe the hype. After a while, My Velocity Cruz Tablet just completely would not work at all. It couldn't be reset, couldn't be recharged. I took Took it back to borders and got a refund.Oh and get this, Before I took it back, I called Borders cuz I loved it so much, I was willing to settle for a replacement. I mean it was a gift, I figured I could work through the kinks. The Border's lady said, \"All the ones we have are returns and have to go back as defective\" -She said she'd call around town and find me one. \"She called me back and said \"No Borders in our city had them in stock.\"  She was like, I guess we haven't really ordered any new ones.  Well I guess Border's wouldn't order any new ones, the Christmas season is over and everyone's got wind that the Velocity Cruz is a piece of expensive JUNK- Border's, who's going outta business unloaded this crap onto the public, and the public unloaded it RIGHT BACK.Since I've seen them all over Home Shopping Channels at $150...it's trash and they're still trying to sucker people into buying them.The device is defective. They know it and they'r still trying to unload it on the unsuspecting public. Should be illegal.I saw on YouTube Wal-Mart is apparently selling them 50% off now. There is a reason it's 50% off. Its a dud. A dummy. Don't get suckered in. My mom bought it from Borders on 12/21, by February I couldn't charge it, couldn't reset it, it was just a blank, black pretty piece of trash.Prior to conking out, my books DISAPPEARED. It showed their icons but then \"errored\" and I couldn't read them. My mom paid a total of $466 -That was for the CRUZ, PROTECTIVE SLEEVE, EXTENDED WARRANTY. We got all her $ back about 2 weeks ago.EDITED TO SAY: Maybe I'm not being fair to Borders. I'm sure they didn't 'unload this device' as I accused them of. I'm sure they thought they were selling a reputalbe device that could rival/compete witht the IPAD/Kindle etc etc...I'm sure they've not ordered any more for stock because they've realized the ones they did sell are being returned for unforseen defects and I'm sure they've made the conscious decision not to burden their customers with this device any longer.They were very kind to me for the most part when I returned the device.  So while I've ragged equally on Borders and the Velocity Cruz, what it boils down to is my whole-hearted disappointment that my new Christmas toy of which I cherished with all it's kinks and flaws ultimately did not work out for ME.That said, Borders in and of itself is KEWL in my book.

Good battery life too.I found that the browser was functional but not overwhelming. I could sign on to my webmail account and view emails of interest.

I contacted them re the power supply and the tethering problem. Five days later thay responded that I needed to email them a copy of the invoice for my purchase of the device before they could send me a replacement power supply. I emailed them the requested information. I never did receive any satisfaction on the tethering problem.

So we returned it to the store. Our 2nd purchase was the Coby Kyros tablet and it was a total waste of time. Totally not what we wanted so we promptly returned it. So we kept our expectations low when we purchased the Cruz. Being totally honest I just wanted to read and I preferred to read on the kindle app. The Cruz came pre-loaded with the Kindle app so I felt like I was in heaven. My memory card has caused me to delete and re-install the kindle app twice but other than that no complaints. I called technical support when I was having problems with the kindle app (for the 2nd time) and my call was answered promptly and my problem was solved within a couple of minutes.

I've been regularly consulting Amazon's user reviews of this device since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my wife six weeks ago.  Since that time, I've read countless reviews unmercifully bludgeoning the T301 as completely useless and incapable.  Not so, say I.I will agree that it is somewhat frustrating to find a number of popular apps that won't work on this device; I'll grant you that.  But with some patience and fortitude, you will be able to find a goodly number that do in fact work just fine.  Or at least that was the case with us.And for the price we paid, I am absolutely pleased with what we've gotten out of the device.  The things it does well include:1)  ACCESSING WI-FI throughout our house, it always seems to lock onto the signal from our wireless router, and does so from that point without interruption.  The device also detects other nearby wi-fi networks within the neighborhood, and I note that it seems to be more capable of doing this than my kids' IPod Touch's.  (i.e. more sensitive)2)  INTERNET ACCESS - We are able to access the \"mobile\" version of many popular websites, and surfing is generally pretty gratifying with this device.  It's certainly not the same as doing so from a desktop or laptop, but it's not bad either.  As others have noted, Dolphin HD is a good choice, and arguably a better browser than the one that came pre-loaded on the T301.3)  FACEBOOK - My wife, unlike myself, is an avid Facebook follower.  This device performs admirably in this regard, and she has generally been very pleased with its capabilities.  No complaints here.4)  YOUTUBE - This is somewhat hit and miss, and admittedly wasn't one of the things we cared too much about when we made this purchase.  That said, there are many Youtube videos that play well on the device, including those embedded within Facebook posts and e-mail. Again though, it can be somewhat hit and miss.5)  E-MAIL - The stock e-mail program that comes with the device is somewhat rudimentary, but it serves its purpose.  The program is certainly not as robust as MS Outlook, for instance, but it generally does what it was meant to do and does so well. (presuming that your primary goal is to use it for the purposes of downloading, reading and perhaps responding to an e-mail or two)6) FILE MANAGEMENT / STORAGE -  I purchased a 32gb SD card and installed it shortly after purchasing the T301.  It was immediately recognized without problem, and has been ever since.  This increases the device storage many times over what it came with originally, at nominal cost. (noting that Apple devices do not allow such upgrades at all)I should also mention that it is a very simple matter to transfer files and content between this device and a computer.  I've successfully loaded apps both from a PC, via USB cable, and wirelessly.  (Pay CAREFUL attention to the \"tethering\" instructions, and particularly the following:  \"Long-tap the status bar and drag to reveal more options. Tap 'USB connect.' Tap the button 'Turn on USB storage' in the bottom right of the screen to make Internal storage shown in your PC.\")7) PERFORMANCE - We've had little trouble with the device crashing, even after challenging it by playing videos, opening multiple apps at one time, and playing music from online services such as Pandora.  I've only had to use the \"paper clip trick\" to reset the device once, and that was when I first took it out of the package.  (as it otherwise wouldn't turn on)  I do agree that the device can at times be somewhat \"sluggish\" - for instance, when first loading a YouTube video or first opening the Kindle application.  Once you become accustomed to its behavior however, and your expectations are adjusted accordingly, this to me is not a big deal.  (when one weighs it against the benefits of having the internet right there at your fingertips, to carry with you where you please)8)  E-READER CAPABILITIES - I mentioned the Kindle app.  The T301 works seamlessly within Kindle, and with the Amazon app store in general.  It downloads and scrolls through e-books very adeptly, and we've also found various useful newsreader apps that allow us to access a variety of online newspapers and news sources.  Again, no complaints here.9)  BATTERY LIFE - Splendid.  It'll easily last through a day's \"normal\" use, from what we've seen.  Very impressive.10) USER FRIENDLINESS - It took a little getting used to, coming from using my kids' IPod Touch's.  That said, we've settled into using it and are now very comfortable navigating around within this tablet.  Everything is generally very intuitive, and the capacitive touch screen is arguably (and remarkably) just as sensitive as an IPod Touch.  Again, very impressive given its relatively low cost.11) AUDIO/VISUAL CAPABILITIES - While not \"hi-fi\" in the least, the built in speakers are definitely convenient. I haven't as of yet confirmed whether the headphone output is stereo or not, although I see that some have suggested that it's monaural.  Screen resolution is a step below the IPod Touch, no doubt, but generally quite adequate.  The color re-creation is good, as are the brightness and contrast, in my opinion.On balance, we've been extremely pleased with and pleasantly surprised by the T301 - particularly given its price point, as well as some of the curmudgeon-like reviews (ahem) herein.  I honestly feel that this tablet has been given a bad rap by many of the reviews I've seen here, and this is what compelled me to write my own - so as to \"set the record straight\" based upon our own, generally positive experience.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "Dylan Fan", "ReviewID": "RVXD74N86298O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A purchased this on woot for about $75 refurbished, basically because it was cheap and I wanted to give an android tablet a try (I have an ipad I use daily).  So, my expectations were extremely low given the early adopter experience with iPad which was excellent, and the bargain base price.  The unit came already upgraded to Android 2.2 (those with 2.0 can upgrade at the Cruz website).The device is a comfortable size and weight.  It comes preloaded with a number of apps, including web browser, email, Kindle, a dictionary, OfficeSuite, etc.  After reading about the Android 2.0 version I was concerned it wouldn't have an easy easy way to download apps, but was surprised to find \"Cruz Market\".  Unfortunately, there are few apps available.  I haven't found an adobe reader, which would be something useful, but there is little else I would have expected which isn't present.  Also, haven't found Netflix app yet.Principal complaint to date is that it is evidently processor and/or memory challenged as some things happen quite slowly, although not unbearably so.  I notice it, for example, during page turns on the Kindle app or when rendering pages in the browser.  Still, it is fast enough for most purposes.  And secondly, the screen isn't as bright as that on the iPad (again, it costs a fraction).I actually think I like the keyboard better than the iPad's.  Build seems solid overall.Overall, while somewhat underpowered and not many apps are available, I think it is an excellent low-priced device for those interesting in getting something at low cost that will do the basics (e-reading, web surfing, youtube, email. and a few other basic tasks) without spending a fortune.Oh yeah -- network setup was easy.  This device seems to be finding its way to the coffee table in front of my TV, where having a computer around is always handy.  Although, the suggestion has been made that it be left in the bathroom as a reader, which may be its eventual disposition.I guess I'll keep it and use it for something.  Not an iPad but doesn't have an iPad pricetag either.  Excellent value IMO.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "what works..., its depends.., a great value!", "Author": "L. Cooke", "ReviewID": "R2GIOWQPVH1QHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hey All,First, this tablet is fine as a general internet access, reader, and simple office services device.  What it is not is a media entertainment device, a full service pc or a phone.Me?, I'm a simple network and information systems engineer.  What got me here is a lark.  The bride, an avid reader needed a Christmas present, when I had suggested a reader, it got shot-down, so I looked around for alternatives.  However, when it came to it, it was clear that the most cost effective solution was going to be a reader; however, it had to have multiple uses, be in color, an internet portal, easy to use and cheap.Well, the closer Christmas came the less choices there were.  The issue was my criteria could only be met by a $200+ device.  That is until I found the Cruz reader for a mere $120.  It offered reader capabilities, color, internet web access and could double as a mp3 player.  That there was a domestic web presence for  acessories and support was the clincher.  My wife was hesitant at first; however, within 2 hours she was very comfortable with the operation and reader functions.  Within 4 hours she was downloading music and jamming to her favorite tunes.  After 6 months she was still elated.  All this from a textile CNC specialist--Textile/Window Treatment Artistian who up to 6 months earlier could not load anti-virus software on her laptop.So, here I was with a dying laptop (Dell B-130) and a birthday.  Knowing my background my wife realized I would not be happy with a resistive screen.  When she went looking, she first looked over the Cruz T-103; but, they were no longer available or the vendor would not allow returns.  Luckily, she found a brick and mortor offering a Cruz T-301 at no more then 5% more then the best mail order price.  Well, knowing the price at the time being above $200, and older cheaper models no longer being available I was not expecting what was in the gift bag the morning of my birthday.So what can I tell you now two weeks later, well one this is as close to a notebook computer running linux as you can get.  For a young person with simple internet gaming or social networking needs, this device is perfect.  At the sametime, for an executive or sales person needing to keep in touch, creating, editing and reading Office compatible documents and spreadsheets this is a great tool.Though not a phone, this device can connect to most Wi-Fi devices effortlessly.  Through this connection it is possible to access most any app necessary to perform most services you buy a laptop for at 1/10-1/100th the cost of an equivalent Microsoft or McIntosh product.There are a few cons, mainly limited to a lack of flash video viewing, and what appears to be a non-stereo or mono earphone jack.  (You can plug in a stereo earphone; but, will only hear the right channel.)  Though Amazon offers many android apps, due to the internal ram being limited to 256Mb versus 512Mb some apps for android 2.2 will down load; but, not install.  Slowly the Amazon apps store is adjusting the apps made available that will be compatible with your tablet.  Though not an issue for me, the lack of a microphone and web-camera for a \"Skype\" equivalent voice  or video capability may be an issue.  Also, I have not tested it; but, a compatible usb keyboard or keyboard lap-docking system would be a welcome addition.After acting as  a sysadmn for Unix System V, Linux in all of it's various flavors, Xenix/SCO, BSD, as well as supervisor for Novell and administrator for Windows Servers starting with the pre NT version, I can share not having root access is a bit frustrating; however, this also provides a sense of security, to put  it simple it is unlikely you can hurt it.  (Though you might want to keep a reset paper clip handy incase of a lockup when adding apps.)This is not a toy or a through away, nor is it a serious pc.  What it is, is a nice simple tool to access web services, read electronic books, listen to a little music, play a few games and write or read Office documents or roughly acts as a simple laptop you can nearly carry in your pocket.  Not bad for half the cost of a Notebook or cheap Laptop.Cheers!Dave Cooke", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Velocity Micro T301 Disappointment", "Author": "Keith W.

You may believe that you are buying a Cruz t301 with 4gb internal memory (along with a bundled 4gb external sd card). I am sorry to burst your bubble and perhaps save you some trouble but this tablet, while still being the t301, it is NOT the 4gb internal memory one but the TWO gb internal memory version of the t301 Cruz tablet and it DOES NOT COME bundled with ANY extra sd card(s).Now, onto my review of this, the TWO gigabyte internal flash memory t301 Cruz tablet:The screen is very responsive to my touch, almost TOO responsive. Sometimes I want it to STOP scrolling or it will hit too many keys at once because of the featherlight touch required with the integral keyboard. I have also used the Reader so maybe I was more sensitive to the tablet's touch-screen compared with the hard jabbing one must proceed with when engaging the Cruz Reader's touch-screen. After some clumsy starts I got the \"Feel\" for the touch-screen and I must say that I really do enjoy it much more than I ever did the Reader's.It comes with the Kindle reading app pre-installed and for those who use Kindle and read the Kindle ebooks this is a great thing. For me I did not care much for it so I uninstalled it right away and installed my old stand-by reading app; (Aldiko) which works wonderfully with this tablet.There are a few apps that are different that the Cruz Reader (r101) and most are pointless fun like \"Solitaire\" and \"Sudoku\". Though, I've found the \"InkPad\" app to be a little bit of fun for practicing creative writing or if you wish to keep a little diary on your tablet.The video player is wonderful to me. One of the main differences between the Cruz Reader (again r101) and the Cruz tablet is the difference in available video file formats for the media player. The Reader will only play versions of mp4 videos whereas the tablet will play mp4, MOV, and, (my favorite!) AVI files! It will play all sorts of different .avi files. Also, the video player has never given me any of those \"Sorry, Cannot Play Video\" error messages and the audio does NOT cut off at all when inserting headphones, (both problems of the Reader).Battery Life: For my experience; and I know some people's Cruz tablets are different, my battery is amazingly long. Although, when I first opened up my Cruz from the mailbox it didn't look so promising; I pulled out my tablet and found that the battery was completely dead. It wouldn't even hold a charge long enough to turn on.Here is when I made the first negative discovery of MY particular Cruz tablet that my sister, who has the same exact brand although the 4gb instead of the 2gb, does not share: My tablet will NOT charge nor even register at all the presence of a dc-in wall charger. Either the one that it came with or others. It simply will not charge via the dc-port/wall. However, it WILL charge via the mini-usb port either tethered to the main house computer or to a mini-usb wall/car charger. So, thank heavens I already had a dual-mini-usb wall/car charger on hand I had bought at Walmart about a year ago and it works beautifully with it.Allowing my tablet to charge on the usb wall charger for the night in the morning around seven or eight I will remove it from the charger and proceed to use the tablet off and on all day going on until after midnight or so and more often than not I will still have half a good charge left on the device nearing two or three a.m. after being off the charger all day.Though, I must explain about one small little quirk of my tablet that I don't know if anyone else has the same issue. It's not really that much of a hassle, just a curiosity, really: In the morning when I go to unplug it from the usb wall charger the green led light will be aglow and the battery life indicator will show it refusing to charge but it will show it to be only charged up around half-way. The green bar will be half-covered. BUT, when, and this happens every time, I reboot the device and once it comes back to life the led light will, of course stay green, but then the battery indicator on the screen will now show a completely FULL battery for the beginning of the day and start the slow discharge towards whenever I return it to the charger.All in all: This device is good for ebooks and video, (avi!), pictures and simple tasks; writing, calculating your bills, etc, playing cards, or whatever other apps you want to install.The wifi is good provided you can find a good hotspot or someone nearby lets you use theirs. I got a fun little free Police Scanner app that uses the internet to work that scans police and fire trucks radios from all over the US and England and some of Scotland. That's fun to listen to. Oh, be sure to head over to the Cruz main website and upgrade your firmware to 2.2 right off the bat!Remember: This tablet is the 2gb t301 version that does not come with any sd cards so you might want to do yourself a favor and order an external standard-size 4gb/16gb or 32gb sd card to go along with your new tablet.In parting: It is a good tablet for those who have a lot of patience, tender-loving-care and who aren't afraid of getting their hands metaphorically dirty with figuring out all the ins and outs of the technical mumbo-jumbo of really making the device YOUR OWN.Enjoy!", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted.", "Author": "TY", "ReviewID": "R1VO269H95SLIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not looking for a tablet to use everyday, only when I travel.

I am very disappointed in this product and will probably return this item and pay the extra $200 for an IPad because it is easier to use.

Certainly there are better tablets but for the price and for what it does it is a sensible purchase.

A great browser is QQ, which runs on cloud; Dolphin, Maxthon, Skyfire and MSN mobile are also good. Overdrive Media console is a good app for downloading library books for reading.The Amazon app store is getting better, offering more apps, as well as Get Jar apps.  There are plenty of productivity apps for those of us who are not game players.  This reader/tablet does well for those of us who are budget conscious (the working poor) and recognize that an IPad cost more than a mortgage payment!  So that was a no brainer to bypass it.  I got my Cruz at Walmart.It is sufficient.4-29-12I have continued to evaluate this product as I seem to be enjoying it quite a bit.  I continue to add apps thru the Amazon Marketplace and many of the games based the old Simon are great. There is Lost Jungle, Mahjong and quite a few reader apps which I use for all the free ebooks out there.  What I am pleasantly surprised about is the email app that came with it.  I downloaded Hotmail and Yahoo email apps for my personal emails.  I utilze the on board email app for my business emails and calendar which is a boon for this android.I have learned a little patience as it is not as quick on the net as some of the 3.0 and higher droids but it is no problem.  I find myself using only the QQ and Skyfire Browsers now. I keep my device functioning well by cleaning out the cache weekly.I brought my tablet from Walmart for 80.00.

It even gets prompts of incoming email (via Wi-Fi). Sets up just like my Samsung android cell phone.* Angry BirdsYes, I heard it doesn't work on the Cruz.Back when I was researching which android cell phone to get, it seems there are two different type of touch screen technologies,.. which is why some types of screens won't work with the touch pens, and why some apps won't work on some phones.  (so far, my daughter hasn't experienced android games, she has an x-box)  Whichever display they put on the Cruz, it looks pretty good.* You-TubeWorks Great. I didn't know the Cruz came installed with this app. My Wi-Fi router is downstairs. My daughter watches the You-Tube music videos upstairs with her skullcandy earbuds,.. no hesitation with the 256 Ram. Did I mention the great display? (this is her favorite feature so far)* E-reader (Amazon Kindle App)I downloaded each of my daughters some books thru my Amazon account. They were mostly the ones I `purchased' for free.  I was surprised to notice that whatever I ordered one for Kindle or Cruz, it would show up available to install on the others.  So they all have whatever I purchased, linked thru my amazon account. Obviously I need to be aware that if I order a romance novel (not that I would do that- a guy thing), my youngest daughter may have that available.-note- all my daughters love reading with the Cruz and Kindles.* 4GB  vs 2GB>>>>>  I read somewhere that the 2.0 version shows the full 4gb memory if installed.  When updated to 2.2, the memory is still 4gb, but 2gb for the processor and Cruz programs isn't displayed,  and the 2gb for available storage is show (non SD Card).  <<<<<I think my daughter's is only 2GB total.....

She was so set on getting the Ipad, but I told her why get the Ipad when I know you are not going to use everything the Ipad has to offer. I knew she just wanted a tablet so I looked into getting an inexpensive tablet to where she can do everything she wanted to do. I came across this tablet and was amazed at what it could do. So without further research I purchased it. When you get the tablet you have to update it, then you can start putting apps on it. There are alot of apps you can put on your tablet the catch is you need the right model for the apps to be downloaded, and it was not shown when I purchased it. Pretty much everything you want to watch will require Adobe flash player which is on the tablet when you purchase it but when you update the tablet you will lose the flash player and you can not put it back because the T301 is not equiped with the flash player specifications. In conclusion I had to return her tablet and purchase the PS47 which is going to do everything she wants it to do. Watch netflix movies, her dowloaded movies, pictures, music, everything. If this is things you are wanting, purchase the PS47 or T400 series' not this 301.

I picked mine up for $99 and it comes with a soft case and a stand in addition to the other normal things such as charger. I started researching what it could do prior to the delivery, and unfortunately became a little scared when I saw so many negative reviews. Needless to say it is important to remember prior to adding any programs to upgrade android to 2.2. This is very easy and instructions are on the Cruz website. After that you send your email address to amazon and they send you a link to download the Amazon Market App store, and the perks are they have a free paid app every day. Other markets to download are Slideme, 1Market, andApp store, and Mobile9. If you are looking for other apps but are unable to find them google them in their .apk format. Another thing to remember is if the app you are wanting to run will not install is that you may have to pick an older version of that app.Another HUGE thing to remember with the Cruz T301 is to get as big a SDHC card (32 gb max.) as you can. I started out with an 8 gb sdhc and it wasn't the experience that I wanted. I took the micro sd from my phone which was 16 gb put it in the adapter and it worked immediately (there were also experiences that micro sd would not work with T301). It is much faster now.The only keyboard sub I found that will work is A.I. Type keyboard which is free through Amazon Market. As far as the tablet not having Google Market I do not find that a loss except in the sense of apps that I had bought through them. What I really don't miss is the constant almost forced updating I have to undo on my phone on a weekly basis for Google Apps that I don't use.Oh, did I mention movies? It totally rocks. I transferred a couple from my laptop in .avi format and began watching them immediately. Still you have to remember if Flash is a requirement for the purchase of a tablet this is not the one for you (some people have to have flash to access college classes). Also if you are a huge YouTube watcher I have not yet been able to get that to work even with Skyfire (recommended by Cruz).I hope this review offsets the many negative ones that were expecting this to perform like android 2.3 and up. For the price I am more that happy with my experience. Now to get a case and screen protector.Okay, so my opinion on the bettering of the experience when you throw in Google android programming has changed. This is a week to the day after the delivery of my tablet and I love it. I found yesterday the link to add google android market and google apps to my tablet and they all work, and the best thing is I did not have to root my tablet. I am a novice and can not afford to buy another tablet at this point. Anyway, I am now able to access the Android Market. The tablet runs even better after adding the Google software as before I could not get YouTube to download video and play them. Yesterday I watched a 24 minute episode without any problems at all. It still does not have flash, but I have been able to enjoy downloaded movies on it, as well as content through YouTube.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Deeply Disappointed", "Author": "Christopher C.

About the third time I sent it back, Velocity indicated to me that they had replaced the item. However, when I received it back, I checked the serial number to find that they had not actually exchanged the item. The last time I sent it back, I demanded that the item be replaced and indicated that I had written down the serial number so they could not BS me.I few days ago received the item from Velocity...Well, they had replaced the tablet, or at least changed the serial number on the tablet. This time I was actually able to use the tablet for a full day. When I returned home that night, I plugged it in to charge it overnight. Guess what? The next morning, when I tried to activate it, the bloody thing won't turn on. At this point I have given up. I've turned it into an expensive door stop.However, the Sony PSP keeps working. I've never had a problem with it and I can watch movies, access the internet, and play games. I've owned it for years. I also own a Sony Touch e-book reader and I've never had a problem with it either. I've taken the hint and just purchased a Sony SGPT112US/S Wi-Fi Tablet (32GB) through Amazon.

Once I upgraded the OS to version 2.2 and loaded some apps it worked okay.  It was pretty much what I expected and suits most of my needs.  It is compact and travels well.  The installed ebook app works fine and it gets decent Internet access.  Don't expect full browsing capability, however, since you mostly get directed to mobile app web pages.  For instance, I tried to get to Google Maps and the Skyfire browser just died.  I suspect the 256 KB RAM is culprit. It is also a little slow but I expected that given the processor it has.  The external SD storage of up 32 GB is a nice feature as well as the replaceable battery.All in all, I like this device.  If you want to do online banking while watching TV or take it with you on the road to check e-mail then it is a good purchase.

It's not the least bit user friendly.  Try to remove a book from the device and you can't get the option menu to come up.  Often you try and the app just shuts down on its own.  When you have a book open and want to go back to the beginning or to search within the book you're lucky if you can get the menu to come up so you can manuever like you want to.  If you keep tapping the screen the page will either advance or retreat or just bounce around a little.  Eventually you may see the menu come up so you can change your location.

After reading the specs, reviews both here and at Cnet and also the fact that the player was $177.00 ( and I had a $20.00 GF ) I must say that after an initial learning curve the first night I am very pleased with this very affordable tablet.

The first T301 I received stop working with in 5 min of use.  I contacted World Wide and they told me to send it back and they did send me a new one.I received the new T301 and this one worked. Well, it worked for a week and than went blank to never again start up.  I contacted World wide and they told me to contact the manufacturer which I did. Velocity informed me that World Wide is not an Authorized reseller of the T301 so Velocity can not help me.  At this time I am the proud owner of a $135 piece of junk that no one seems to want to deal with.I will reserve my opinion on World Wide since I have not heard back from them on this issue since I told World Wide that Velocity will do nothing to help, but I will give my opinion on the T301.I can't believe I'm the only person that has a T301 that just stopped working. After receiving two of them and both stopped working in the same manner I am guessing there is something inherently wrong with the hardware or firmware in this unit.If anyone wants to buy this unit to use as a reader be ware that outside it is useless since you can not see any text on the screen.Over all the unit would have been a nice mini computer to take on a trip to check e-mails and do minor task on line.Within the week that I used the T301 many times I would be reading the screen and the screen would turn up side down and I'd have to turn it around to continue with my reading.  Twice the second unit failed but when I hit the reset button it came back on.  This should have told me that something bad was going to happen.The instructions for the T301 are minimal and needs a lot of help to make it user friendly.I have finally received an e-mail from Amazon saying I will not get a refund for the defective Android since WW policy was clear that the Item must be returned in the original packaging.  For a company to see two T301 Androids and both failed one within 5 min of use and the second within a week and than hide behind a policy that calls for the item to be returned in the original package.  I do not and I do not know many people keep the original package after the item bought worked correctly.  I am disappointed, frustrated and angry to lose $159 for a defective piece of equipment.  I will never again purchase any item sold by World Wide.  Even the manufacture does not recognize World Wide as an authorized re-seller for the T301.  This is a red flag for me, thinking maybe World Wide is selling T301's that are not a Class one Item.  I have also notified Amazon that I will never again purchase Items from a third seller but only purchase Items being sold through Amazon.  Well time for the to toss $159 worth of junk into the trash and find a more reliable company to buy a new Android.

Well, after trying to set this thing up for her over the past week, I've learned that both of those things are HUGE deals.The Cruz market has slim pickings when it comes to applications and many other third party app locations link to the Android Market, which you cannot access to download from.  Searching for apps that work on Android 2.0 has been a challenge to put it mildly.  I've installed and un-installed so many times from this tablet that it spontaneously reboots itself and has a weird static noise that emits from the speakers occasionally.  I think it may be associated with another app that isn't working properly...The pros are that the screen resolution and responsiveness are decent, the battery life is phenomenal and the price is right.  It is a sturdy well made tablet and has a nice design.  My mother will mainly be using this tablet to play games, surf the net, check email and read books, so I think it will work out well for her.I've installed ADW Launcher on this Cruz, as well as Fancy Widget (for clock and weather), BetterCuts, AppOrganizer, Advanced Task Killer Pro, Advanced Task Manager and several games that include Jewels, Bubble Popper Pro, Minesweeper for Android, Solitaire and Sudoku.  Some games built for later versions of Android will run, but they are small and justified to the upper left hand portion of the screen which looks odd.  Your best bet is to search for apps that run on Android 1.6.If you're looking for a color e-reader, ability to check email and surf the internet in a portable device that is priced right, this one is for you.

I feel that with the mods available on this site I have a fairly good working tablet/reader. How I managed to get there is not something I'd ask anyone to do after getting a gift.

If all they need is an inexpensive color device to read Kindle books and you can find one for 100.00 or less, then ok get it. If you are buying this for yourself, want something to tinker with, and know up front it's not going to perform like an iPad (and you are OK with that) by all means find one at a cheap price < $100 and go for it, any more it's simply not worth the money.It's also built well and feels good in your hands.

Getting an app to run on the T301 is a hit or miss affair that in many cases required me to do a factory reset to recover from. Popular games like Angry Birds simply will not run at present. That may change at some point, but it's not going to be enabled by the manufacturer.It's slow. Right out of the box I had problems. I had to use the reset button simply to power it on the first time.

Again, a little much to ask of a child or grandma.SummaryI'm digging it, but only because I don't need to play games on it and can tinker with it to get it to do stuff and to generally make it work.

If you're watching a movie, you will not hear the dialog or it will be overwhelmed by the show's background sounds.  If the audio signal is monophonic (an old movie or TV show) you won't hear anything!  Also, you cannot connect this to a stereo because the headphone jack only activates if a low-resistance (e.g. speaker) is connected.

The tablet comes with it's own Android market but there's not much in it. Kindle App works fine on the 2.2 upgrade and Amazon App also has no problem (these are still native installs on the Cruz).The native PDF reader leaves much to be desired (basically uses the pre-install office app). Downloading a replacement PDF reader from the Cruz store was a bust (none), and every Amazon PDF reader app I downloaded either did not install, or crashed on start.I'm blaming the tablet, it is what you pay for (very underpowered), but most of the problems is with the Android platform. As Android begins to mature, some of the Apps will not run on the older hardware (you see the same thing with Apple apps on the older versions of the iPhone and iPod Touch). It's just very irritating if there is not a free version to test with before you make a purchase. Additionally, seems some of the apps are buggy depending on the hardware. On this version of the Cruz, there's only 256MB of RAM, so there's a lot of resource contention. With the apps running in the background, doesn't leave a lot of free RAM to start up a new app. Also, the Android system, at least on the Cruz, had a lot of processes running in the background when the device startsup. Also, some of the pre-installed apps start automatically when the device starts up, which leaves less RAM for apps you want to start manually.

The touch-screen is ok, and responsive enough.ConsThe main issue is Apps. I am IT professional and would like to think that I more experienced in these things than the average consumer.First, I shipped with Android 2.0 so quite a few apps did not work. Since it does not come with access to Google's Android store, you have to use GetJar or the Amazon marketplace.So, I went to their website, and found the download for Android 2.2. No download for Android 3 available - as for all cheap Android tablets, so no surprise. It's pretty 'simple' to upgrade: take the SD card out of the tablet, put it in your computer, download the update, copy it to the SD card, put the card back in the tablet, reboot while holding 3 buttons and wait. Not the smoothest experience, but it works.Then I tried to install apps again. Still, many simply failed after a download saying 'Application not installed'. No reason, no explanation, no hint what to do.Tried Angry Birds - the staple of Tablet apps. No dice.After some tinkering, here is what I found:(Disclaimer: Android 3 is supposedly (!) better at this, but its not available for most Tablets).The tablet has 2 GB internal storage and 4GB on the SD card. So far so good.The internal memory is divided in 1.5GB 'general' storage and 512MB application storage.What that means is, that installed applications need to fit into the 512MB. If you don't know what that means, let's just say its not a lot.But it gets better. Yes, you can find some menu to move apps then from that internal storage to the SD card, but in order to do that IT NEEDS TO INSTALL FIRST. Since Angry Birds was bigger than said 500MB (actually, mine had only 400MB free) I could not install it, to move it. *&!%^%$$!!!Some more Google searching revealed that if you download the Android SDK on your computer, you can then log into the tablet remotely and tell it to install by default to the SD card instead. So, that's what I did, and it worked. Sort of.Because now, 2hrs later, Angry Birds installed, but some other games wouldn't work. Turns out, some games don't work when installed onto the SD card, because Android does not treat all storage equally. Figures.Now, back into the settings, moving those apps from the SD card - where they now install by default - back to the internal memory. Some games still didn't work.What a mess and what a horrible experience. There is no way, the average consumer can figure this out.So, unless you know a computer guy or know what your are doing, stay away. Even then, it sucks.

Angry birds is not accessible either,  but i can live with out having those.  After working on the phone with tech support I did finally update my tablet to android 2.2.  The difference doesn't seem like a whole lot but it does help. This tablet streams videos well when you can find a site that will support it.  You have to have patience with the touchscreen too.  Sometimes you have to touch the same tab about 3-4 times before it finally registers. Other then that it has HUGE memory possibilities up to 32MB with an added SD card (I have a 8MB card and its been more then enough) and countless apps mostly from getjar.com market.  The standard e-reader is a nice touch and I already have 4 FREE books form the pre-installed amazon kindle app,  including a free bible book. Overall I think the 3 stars is right.  This lil tablet shines as a web browser but lacks the flash memory needed for streaming videos. Still... I would not consider this a waist of money as you can still get good use out of it,  however it is fairly basic when you compare it to more expensive tablets but like I said if your on a budget and want some useful/portable/affordable entertainment, just like to check your email, go on facebook or just play a few games then the Velocity Cruz t301 is for you.

I found it for $159 with free shipping on Amazon and although I was leaning toward the new \"mini\" nook or the upcoming Kobo e-reader, I felt that the combination of Android 2.2, a capacitive touchscreen and color display was worth a roll of the dice.As my primary goal was to have an e-reader with a touchscreen (preferably not a resistive screen) to view scanned PDFs and other e-books for school, any other functions such as wifi and multimedia were strictly ancillary.Pros:--Android 2.2 (no clear path for upgrades, although there is a minor swell of folks looking to port 2.3 to the MIPS processor in this device)--Beautiful color 800x600 display with good contrast and color tone--Wifi with G & *N* compatibility--Uses standard SD cards for expansion--Real mini USB port for charging, data transfer and ADB support--Separate charging port for fast charger--Well finished, with nice overall look (I own an original Motorola \"Droid\" phone and like some heft and \"industrial\" feel to my devices)--Rubberize paint on back of case has nice feel and is easy to grip--CHEAPCons:--A little sluggish at times--Touchscreen can be wonky, but I think that's mostly because it's a little weak processor-wise--Display could be a little brighter--Volume from built-in speakers is weak--MIPS based chipset, so many apps don't install correctly. However, this seems to be a developer issue, as many of the well-review apps work fine.--Wireless range seems to be a bit lacking, but certainly workable in a normal home or workplace--Gloss screen can be taxing to use in bright light/sun--Did not come with an SD card, but who doesn't have a handful of these laying around unused anyway?Conclusion:If you understand the limitations of this device, it's a great compromise for what little it costs. Android 2.2 is getting a little long in tooth, but there's some hope that 2.3 might get ported to the platform (and probably will if these less expensive devices sell well). If you are looking for an e-reader that you can use in direct sunlight or under strong overhead lights with no glare, this is not the right device for you.

Since I only plan to carry around a few e-books and some spreadsheets from work and my music, this will be a good beginner's tablet.  The only real problem I have is that the charger supplied with it has a plug on it that does not fit the supplied cradle/docking device.  The dock is designed to hold the tablet while charging and the end that goes into the tablet makes that impossible since it is straight and not angled to fit in the cradle slot.  When I called the company that I bought it from (Worldwide Distributors)they told me they could do nothing and that I would have to contact the manufacturer.

I normally research expensive purchases before making them...especially for brands or products i'm not familiar with.  It's important to know that this item had the potential to be exactly what I was looking for.  I originally wanted an iPad.  But decided that I would be wasting my money since I already own an iPhone and MacBook Pro.  So I decided that a more affordable eReader was what I wanted.  However, the Kindle with it's black and white display and less than simple button features were a turnoff.  I wanted a product that was full color, and was touch. After reading mixed reviews on this product I figured that I knew what I was getting myself into with some of the \"cons\" of this product.  I knew that a $199 price tag was not going to get me  \"a cheap iPad\" but I did expect to get what was advertised. And I did not.  Straight out of the box the device would not power up.  I referred to the \"start up guide\" (a four page spread and the only documentation included spare the warranty) and it said nothing about charging it before use ect, I referred to the internet (on my laptop) to the online manual...which still included no trouble shooting or start up information.  I referred to an online blog written by some other poor sap like myself that wasted money on this paperweight.  They suggested resetting the device...and wala it powered up.  I set up the wireless connection with no issue and after setting up my Kindle & Facebook apps (already installed)  they worked well.  But after powering the device down (so that it could fully charge as is it arrived to me with no battery), and attempting to power it back up it was then stuck on the android load screen and cannot be reset.Some people have had success with this device and love it, and I am not sure weather I received a defective item or if this product needs some work.*Update: I returned this item to Amazon, and I must commend them on their STELLAR customer service!  The item (with provided return ship label) took only a few days to reach them, and are already issuing my refund.  This renews my faith in purchasing expensive items online.

I want 4:3 and capacitive touch screen for viewing Bible and music sheets, and the normal web stuff. But iPad costs too much. Cruz T301 seems to be the only product that meet my criteria.The good:A solid product. The screen is bright and beautiful, with very good viewing angle both vertically and horizontally. The capacitive screen works well, typing is effortless. Battery life is good. Most, but not all, applications that I care for do run on it. I'm especially happy to see Weather & Toggle Widgets run on it. So does Evernote, Dropbox, Googlemap (no GPS, but great for checking traffic). WIFI works well, connects and reconnects quickly.The not so good:First impression is that it's noticeably heavier then Kindle. But I got used to it after a while. Second thing I noticed is that the processor is slow. I need to swipe slowly, and expect a little lag for the tablet to respond at times. It takes some practice to avoid registering a 'press' when I really wanted to swipe. The 7\" screen is much bigger then other 'narrow' 7\" tablets, but still too small for music sheets. Lacking the scroll button causes some problems with some apps, such as going to the next chapter of the Bible.Suggestions:A task killer seems to help with the performance. Although Android experts don't think task killers are useful, but some tasks do run in the background and take up bandwidth. And the T301 needs every clock cycle it can get. Hopefully the next firmware release can improve on this.Freewarelovers.com does have a good collection of apps in installable .apk format. I also ran Astro on my Android phone and backed-up all the applications on the micro SD card as .apk files, then transferred the files to the Cruz via the SD card, and ran Astro on Cruz to install all the apps. Astro saved me a lot of time.Conclusion:For older people who don't have good eye sight, don't care for games, the T301's screen is big enough for reading and access the net, and quite portable.

It seems more usable in landscape mode than many other tablets.But if you are looking for an easy to use out-of-the-box e-reader with a color screen that let's you browse the internet if you need to and download some apps and games, then this is a pretty good value for the money.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "More than a reader", "Author": "TonyP1964", "ReviewID": "RZOW3YKMIFZEX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this primarily as a reader, to replace a Literati (which sucked). I wanted something that did more than read books but didn't need to be a full blown laptop or smartphone. This fills the bill for under $200 with no additional fees for access. WiFi, Email & games are pretty painless to set up. I've been able to find free WiFi in lots of places even in the burbs. Many apps require some trial and error. The Kindle and Borders apps are useless if you have your own books (free from many torrents)and only work with books you buy from their website. Cruz recommends Wordplayer but I found it to be unstable and with a poor format that was hard to read or customize. For reading Aldiko works great but you have to use the older version for Android 2.0 or earlier. The built-in Browser works well, also tried Dolphin which was a little easier to use. Battery life seems to be ok especially if you shut off wifi when not using. Battery will charge while usb is connected, or so it claims. I never left it connected long enough to test it. Had a little trouble connecting to PC at first. Didn't realize you had to click on usb icon on cruz and \"mount\" the SD card. Wasted lots of time trying to find WinXP drivers that aren't needed. Once you figure it out, file transfer is a breeze. I tried the CruzSync/ZumoDrive app that comes with it. It allows access to files stored offsite kind of like FTP. I had trouble transfering files from Zumodrive physically to the card. Acessing them via WiFi wastes power and has lots of transfer errors for realime things like music play.  The 4GB card that comes with it seems big enough for now but it's good to see it will take up to 32GB card. Spec says it has 4GB internal but don't mention you have no access to it or that OS uses almost all of it.

As a e reader it functions well although the page flip time had a noticeable lag compared to running the same Kindle software on a iPhone 3GS. The web browser it came with was kind of sketchy but a upgrade to Skyfire made web browsing acceptable. It also opened up the ability to watch flash based videos and made you tube videos clear (the you tube app it came with is unusable! video is all blocky and choppy.) Getting Skyfire loaded ended up being a real chore since the Cruz does NOT have access to the Android marketplace despite what the product details say: Access to the official Android App store. WRONG! it only has access to its on app poor store. Access to the Android app  store is denied! After using a mirror site to download Skyfire web browsing and video were acceptable,Most apps will not install and those that will install do not usually work. Angry Birds, Forget it! There is NO workaround to load Adobe Flash 10.1 on here either.Initially I was very excited to get this, even paid the $10 for the ability to edit Microsoft office on this. But the excitement quickly wore out and I tried to do everything I could to keep this. I gave it up, it doesn't do what the product detail say it does, does some of it half-a@@ and performs the rest well, after some help.If you are ONLY looking for a e reader with web capabilities, ok. But this is sooooo dangerously close to the full potential it could have had, it will be hard to justify the price within a few weeks.

It had a little of power on it so I was able to connect it at once to my wi-fi, and log on to internet. It worked fine for like half an hour then I turned it off. Later I charged it. To my dismay it can no longer be powered on!As far as the apps installed on it, I was not so happy too. The calculator, for example, wasn't even a scientific calculator! I thought this tablet was made by engineers, did they have only a grocery store calculator?! It doesn't have a dictionary installed. I tried installing \"borders\" app, it didn't work.Updating firmware? This tablet even said it can't find the update files that were supposed to be in the included SD card. When I check out the SD card in my real HP computer, the SD Card contained folders that had nothing on it!My impression is that this tablet is not cool, it is just a business hype, luring people people who want to save money. I wanted something that I can use both in my work and entertainment perhaps, but doesn't cost a lot of my hard-earned dollars.I have to return it right away, rather than get madder and just smash this brick thing against the wall.In conclusion, this Cruz tablet is not even worth its low-cost now of 200 dollars.

All I wanted was a portable device (for my wife) so that she wouldn't be stuck in front of the PC monitor all day surfing the Internet and checking e-mail. This device is not for serious work, it is not for work at all, actually, but like other people have said before me, it is very useful for simple/mobile tasks (checking websites/e-mail while on the go, or when you don't feel like waiting for the PC to boot up - this little device turns on and connects to the Internet in just seconds, provided it has a router to connect to, obviously). The only minor gripe I have has to do with the touch response, the screen seems to be fairly responsive by itself, but sometimes it takes a while for the command to be recognized by the system, so navigation can be rather slow at times. Also, I would have liked to have a microphone input so that we could use it with Skype for telephone calls on the Internet, but for this price (around $150 as of November 2011) I am pretty happy with it as it is. Also, it doesn't have a camera, either, again, that is OK for what we wanted. On the plus side, it DOES have a slot for an SD card, and it DOES have a mini-USB input, which makes transferring files very easy (Ipad doesn't have either of them, and that was one of the reasons I did not want an Ipad, I'll let the geeks jump through their own hoops to transfer files).

They took no steps to expedite the delivery but rather I had to wait a week shipping each way to get it back.

I literally called 8 times to try to straighten this out before they finally got me a new product key.  In the interim, they made me call back several times, call Microsoft to try to work it out, and send them various pictures.  This process began in February and only was finally resolved in May!

It's very simple to get it started and downloading Kindle books is a breeze. I can check my email, browse the web, Facebook, listen to the radio, and play games. Great!Now..the not so great!

I also like watching news and video from my phone and thought I would be able to do the same on the Cruz, but unfortunately the Cruz does not support flash. The owner's manual reccommends Skyfire, but it's only found on Google Play, which this tablet doesn't support.

As another reccommended..do an update! Also, alot of good suggestions on the Amazon message board.Bottom line: If you just want something out of the box and you want to be ready to go, I'd say invest in an Ipad, Kindle Fire, or another Android app friendly device.

It really looks like my experimental Linux desktop after I spent hours getting it installed and running 8 years ago - sparse and clunky. Just a couple of apps.Fourth: The browser is really a dog. It reminds me of the browser my Nokia clamshell phone had in 2004. To zoom in, you double-touch. To zoom out - same. That's it. No variable scaling. Did I mention there is no multi-touch? OK, getting over it.How about I play one of the tens of thousands of games on the android market? Ummm, let's see, where's that Android Market app? Sorry - no Android Market. There is the Cruz Market, though, so that's gotta have the same apps I like, right? Nope. In fairness, I didn't search for Czech HangMan, just those Angry Birds, which were nowhere to be found.Other problem: The touchscreen started randomizing the calibration points. Once that happened, the unit wouldn't even unlock, as I had to guess where to touch the screen. That required a system reset, but in the meantime provided a modicum of entertainment.It's an unfair comparison, given the 2.5x cost difference, but I was given an iPad this Christmas, and while the roads on the Apple-only Turnpike I'm forced to drive on collect frequent tolls, at least the roads are paved. That iPad personal entertainment device sure does handle nicely.So I prepare for return my sad Cruz Tablet with all the technological flash of a pre-gladsnost Moscow taxi, with its lonley sparse desktop and nowhere to get decent apps.

That's what this feels like. Trying to run Linux on a 486 computer with a 400 MB hard drive. Maybe this is being too technical, but that's what I felt I was doing with this product.Not that Linux is bad, cause it isn't, but there are some things that it won't do as well as Windows and this thing definitely has its limitations.The reference to the 400 MB hard drives is that once you install a small version of Linux on your machine, you don't have much space to install very much else if you plan on customizing the applications you have running on your computer. This thing comes with a 4 gig micro sd card but it doesn't help you if you plan on installing many apps. You quickly run out of space being that this only installs apps to the dedicated system memory. Which at this moment, I cannot recall how big that is. But it's not much. I tried to install an android game of 17 megabytes that was downloaded to the sd card. Could not install it. Would not install it. And that's with only maybe 4 other apps that I had installed. A couple of browsers and some readers apps. The browsers are necessary if you plan on watching any youtube. And good luck on finding those without having any direct access to the android market.

With Froyo OS installed, things were quite smoothly. Using the Skyfire browser, I even could look at a limited amount of Flash files. It works quite well on YouTube videos. You can load your own videos, still pictures, and audio MP3 files, and have a good device to handle those as well.Now, after all these compliments, you might wonder why only gave it a \"good\" rating? First of all, it will often jump out of a very long webpage--no matter what browser I'm using--or perhaps a page that has some video content that upsets it? This can be irksome, to say the least. It almost always handles mobile webpages and short standard webpages  well.  I found out, apparently, what was causing the problem, JavaScript.  It is very easy to turn off in the included browser. Resets caused by certain webpages seems to have been eliminated.Now, this tablet is doing most everything I want. I do want remote control of at least one of my home computers. This actually might be done, I got it to control a netbook on my home Wi-Fi. I used AndroidVNC (at the freewarelovers site) and TightVNC on the Windows machine. However, this may wipe out the Fancy Widget and clear your screen of that particular clock and weather forecasting widget. However, for me this is not a big deal. Setting up TightVNC on a Windows machine is a pain in the neck, though. No, Teamviewer will not work on this tablet. Probably the other major frustration of this tablet is not what doesn't work at all but partly works, such as AndroidVNC which apparently works with the aforementioned consequences as does App2sdpro.apk. You can get App2sdpro to work, actually quite well for programs, which can be moved, but it seems to either erase or not transfer material such as bookmarks for browsers. This is could be a serious nuisance for some people.  Considering there are few apps that I want to run on this tablet; I can keep everything I want just on the flash memory of the tablet. But, I would have hoped that apps could be transferred smoothly from flash to SD card.There are of course apps that don't run on it, but also quite a few that do. Just be aware so when experimenting you might get some surprising and unpleasant results. Unless you consider this  as a learning experience for you, and that is what in part I look upon it as, for Android devices. So, if you get the tablet for the right uses and reasons--and especially the right price--I can recommend it, because it is solidly built (Yes, don't drop it on your foot, it might hurt!), and I found the help that Micro Velocity staff provides is good.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wife loves it!", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "RVWPGWV8GCWSF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought if for my wife-executive who struggled with a netbook and wanted something she could toss in her purse and pull out when she had a moment.

As soon as I plugged it in it the battery said that it was at 45% - realised there was a battery issue packed it back up for return.Cruz ereader #2 - Returned original ereader to BestBuy and drove to the only other store in my city that had the replacement. Took replacement home started playing with it and guess what? Yep the battery started failing almost immediately.Cruz ereader #3 - Having returned #2 to BestBuy hit up Borders and decided to give it one last shot and yes I hit three in a row.Three units of the same model from two different retailers within 72 hours suggests to me that they have something of a problem with this product.Am returning #3 tomorrow and am ready to finally accept that this can't and doesn't do what it says it will.

The Cruz Tablet is just about what I am looking for.First, if you know nothing or very little about smartphones, computers, etc., then don't get a slate and then complain about it.  Learn about it first then buy one.  And don't ever ask a salesperson about any kind of electronic device.  They only know enough to make a sale, not serve as tech support.Second, yes the Cruz Tablet has an outdated software version.  Hack the tablet and load up what you want, or stop complaining about the software.Third, fake reviews or not, an Android device will have its ups and downs, just like an Apple device and a Microsoft device.  Given the current state of the tablet slice of the market, I believe a lot of companies have done good with delivering some decent tablets.Fourth, and last point, if you want a tablet to do what the iPad does but are looking for an alternative, just bite the bullet and buy a doggone iPad!", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "RETRACTION", "Author": "VICKIE", "ReviewID": "RATRRPUFSOYHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I PREVIOUSLY COMMENTED ABOUT THE T301 I BOUGHT FROM EZCORP WHICH WAS NOT GOOD AND I RATED THEM ONE STAR.

She wanted a kindle, but after doing some research I came across this. I viewed it as a poor man's Ipad. She loves it, but is having problems downloading any apps. When we go to the Cruz website it doesn't help us much. The steps you have to take to upgrade the android to a 2.2 is soooo very confusing and just seems like a huge hassle. I feel bad now that I may have just bought a very expensive paperweight. I hope we can resolve these issues because I know she would really enjoy using this thing to it's full potential. Too bad there isn't a physical store I could go into and have them help us. Maybe I'll try Best Buy.

I called the sales line and the first person I spoke with said all I\"d need is a mini USB headphone/mike set for the unit to use Skype.. but then I called back to ask another question about Memory types and I happen to mention something about skype.. well I was told. Nope, it won't work.. so, being persistent and knowing I'm at 50/50 on the answer I thought to send Tech support an email... for get that with out a registered product I can't even email tech support.. so I went in to the general mail box and asked the question... I wonder if I would an answer here faster than from their support team....So, if anyone has been able to install skype on this unit please post your sucess!Thanks", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Android 2.0\n4 GB integrated\n7\" TFT 800 x 600\nWiFi 802.11b/g/n", "Name": "Velocity Micro T301 Cruz 7-Inch Android 2.0 Tablet (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z4vfeoxJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004CFF6ZI"}}
