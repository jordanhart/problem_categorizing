I just bough IPAD from Apply noted 3G etc and though it came with Sim slot via the statement is based on provided not unlocked sim.  Ensure you validate and check the product pictures and also note International which is true unlocked and sim provided.  The price is mostly the same i.e. IPAD 3 64gb with sim slot will run about 850-900.  The value is world wide service you can jump into any provide with a sim as ATT etc.  Warning, US brands are formatted different and would need to be factory unlocked leaving the US were company cheat and try to own you and the product even though you paid for it.Thanks", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "iPad", "Author": "ITz", "ReviewID": "R2LVXWAXDV20KP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent quality - exactly as per the offer.
