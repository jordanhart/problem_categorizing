{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "Gary Lai", "ReviewID": "R3DGXDQG6HOGLS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm typing this review on the A500 now. I was deciding between an Ipad2 (and had actually purchased one), an Asus Transformer, and the A500. I became frustrated with the limitations of the Ipad 2, and once it became clear that the Asus Tranformer wouldn't have adequate stock for weeks, I decided to give the A500 a try. No regrets, and I ended up returning the Ipad2.Why this is better than an I pad 2 -- Micro SD card slot gives this all the memory you practically need with just a 16 gb model. Cards are cheap - you can get a 32 gb card for $50. No card slot on the I pad 2.- USB port makes file transferring easy. You can plug in external flash drives or a USB keyboard. Yes, it has a USB host port so it can externally power or charge devices through the port. No USB on the I pad 2 without buying a $30 adapter.-HDMI port - easy projection to your HDTV. The A500 screen has about the same aspect ratio as most HDTVs, so you will be able to take full advantage of the area on your HDTV. With the Ipad2, you need a separate $39 adapter for this, plus the IPad 2 screen is a different aspect ratio than most HDTVs.-Android Honeycomb is way better than Apple iOS. It's much more customizable and supports true multitasking. Yes, iOS has a simpler, dumber interface that your grandma can use, but for me it is too simple and limited. Plus, with Honeycomb you are not chained to using ITunes to manage your content. You can just plug it into the USB port of your PC and manage files like you would any external USB drive.-If you use Google applications like Gmail, Picasa, Docs, Maps, Youtube, etc., the integration is excellent. You log in with your Gmail account and all your Google data is synched to the device within minutes.Don't believe the reviews about lack on apps for Honeycomb or frequent crashes. I have had almost no issues in a week of use. Most of the apps for Android smartphones I tried work fine and there are over 65,000 of them now. The Android market is better than the Apple market because there are a lot more free apps.Because of the USB port this is a better value than the Transformer too, which doesn't have USB port without the separate docking station.This is a fast, powerful tablet, great screen, long battery life (I'm getting two days with normal use). A good value.-----------------------------UPDATE 10/20/11: Had the A500 tablet for 6 months. Netflix works on it now, and it got an update that enabled Skype and Google Video Chat as well. The OS updates to Android 3.1 and 3.2 made it run faster and smoother. However, after the Android 3.1 update the microphone sound got pretty muffled to the point that video chatting or using it as a camcorder became pretty poor. I would have to speak rather loudly or directly into the speaker for it to get picked up. I checked around online and this seems to be a problem that many people have experienced due to the OS update on their A500 tablets. There were rumors that the Android 3.2 update would fix the problem, but this didn't happen. I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 stars because of this.Overall I am happy with the Android Honeycomb tablet experience and not regretting returning the IPad, but I wanted something that would work flawlessly for video chatting. So I purchased an Asus Transformer, updated it to Android 3.2, and tried out the microphone, and it worked fine. So I ended up selling my A500 and am using the Transformer now instead. Had the microphone worked flawlessly, the A500 is still the better tablet in my mind than the Transformer due to the full-sized USB port and the metal construction, but they are pretty close. If you don't plan to use the microphone I think the A500 is still the better deal. But Asus seems to do a better job of pushing out OS updates.I recommend you'all take a serious look at the Honeycomb tablets. There are many available now, all pretty close in specs, for much better prices than IPads and they are more versatile. With the upcoming launch of Android 4.0, the operating systems for smartphones and tablets will be unified, which will make many more apps useable on the tablets. Just like Android smartphones eventually blew away the IPhone in market share, Android tablets will do the same to IPads someday, I am confident.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why so much angst about buying an Iconia Tablet?", "Author": "R. Mcmillen", "ReviewID": "RKEFK4V8E1C8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I've been on the sidelines agonizing about which Android tablet to buy.Every blog and magazine is filled with lots of negatives about each tablet they review.  After reading all of the negative vibe I was paranoid about buying an Android tablet so I decided to wait.Then the unexpected happened.  My wife bought me the Iconia for Father's Day and surprised me.  I was stuck.Reality has set in now and it's great.I've never had Honeycomb crash on me.  I surf the web, get my gmail, get my Outlook mail, IM, buy apps, play games, check the weather, read books and it's a blast.The screen quality is great and I love the motion backgrounds.  Wireless speed is fine, 32GB is plenty, and I'm glad to have the USB port for future options.  Execution speed is fast and everything I care about runs without issues plus battery life is multiple days.So after two months I'm scratching my head to find a negative... Power cord too short?  Plug it in on the counter top.  No auto on capability?  Push the button.  Fingerprints on the screen?  Try washing your hands more often.  Is the tablet too heavy for your puny forearms?  Get off the couch and do some push ups dude!  Not your favorite color?  Buy a can of spray paint.The real issue is that the negative vibe is keeping people on the sidelines like it was me.  Come on in the water is fine.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good tablet, with some issues that will probably be fixed soon", "Author": "Lyle Eckert \"It's not that I am lazy; It's th...", "ReviewID": "RC23AZ5IEHDY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE - 6/27/11 -I did get a software update a while back for the A500, and it did fix the screen waking up, this made it so that the battery will now last for a couple of days of light use before it runs out, compared to being plugged in everyday like it was before when the screen would wake up for notifications.I haven't really noticed any other large changes from the previous version.  On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it.  Seems like it couldn't quite keep up with her typing.  It doesn't seem to be the keyboard but the A500 that was the limiting factor, because I used the keyboard on a normal laptop, and didn't notice any lag.I still really like using the A500 over having to use a normal laptop like I was before, it is just so much nicer that it is always on and I can just hit the power button and go!  Still very happy with this purchase.END UPDATE**********************I bought this the week it showed up in a brick and mortar store near me.  I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer.  I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome.  When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected.  I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720).  This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound.  I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well.  The display is fine, good, but not great.  I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone).  The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better.  The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side.  I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison.  Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience.  The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet.  As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me.  Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1\" screen).  I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI.  I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet.  Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone.  I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine.  I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great.  Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away.  The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly.  I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates.  First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500.  It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something.  I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem.  I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine.  So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use.  I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this.  It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on.  This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on.  And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app.  I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature.  I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning.  As the software updates came along, it worked much better.  Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area.  The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much.  I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2.  I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me.  I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Iconia vs. Transformer", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R256Q2W9CRM1MR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Myself and a friend of mine bought a new Android tablet recently. I was lucky to grab the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only) on launch date and he just got the Iconia. Both of us are on the market for at least one, possibly 2 more tablets (me with 2 high school kids and a third catching up fast) so we agreed to swap our new gadgets for a couple of days so we could each better decide what our second Android tablet was going to be.Here's my 2-day evaluation of Iconia vs. Transformer with frequent references to the other better known tablet players such as the iPad and the Xoom. This is going to be a quick and incomplete comparison so do feel free to add your own categories as comments to this review.- FREEDOM (even) - They are both non-iPad tablets that are technologically on par (and here and there superior) with the 'leader' AND reasonably priced AND, unlike the iPad, they don't force us, the paying customers, into some 'ecosystem' mandatory straightjacket. While not perfect, both the Transformer and Iconia offer a great deal when it comes to features and expandability. The Honeycomb is a reasonably open OS. You are free by default as you should be. There's no need to jailbreak because you're free. You can shop on more than one app store, do comparison shopping, download beta code and you can even run Flash.But let me continue with my brief Transformer vs. Iconia comparison.- PRICE (Transformer) - with everything else more or less equal, the Asus tablet beats the Iconia by $50. It can be argued that the Iconia has some advantages - I like its solid aluminum backside - but the Transformer has its own so, on a Dollar vs. Dollar competition, the Transformer wins. They each come with options and expansions but, unlike cars, you can get a lot off the base models.- DISPLAY (even) - Both come with 10.1\", 16x9 (wide screen). In my view, they both beat the iPad's 9.7\" screen which is in a 4x3 format. Apples has a few more square inches but movies show much better on a 16x9 screen. The viewing angle is quite wide with few distortions and the colors are rich and bright when used in a room under natural or artificial light. Outside, the glare is significant.- RESOLUTION (even) - 1280x800 on both the Transformer and the Iconia translate in 30% more pixels than iPad's and a few more pixels per square inch.- INTERNAL MEMORY (even) - 1 GB is twice as much than iPad's (better multi-tasking) and on par with the more expensive Xoom.- PROCESSOR (even) - 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 (2 x Cortex A9) is on par with Xoom, clock speed similar with iPad 2.- STORAGE (even) - 16 GB, same as iPad 2 but Xoom comes with 32GB. Both are expandable through microSD.- WEIGHT (even) - they are both slightly heavier than the iPad or the Xoom but only slightly.- CAMERAS (Iconia) - they both come with 5MP rear camera for picture or video-taking but the Iconia has a 2MP front facing vs. the Transformer's 1.2MP. In addition, the Iconia has a flash which the Transformer lacks. Iconia's pictures appeared a little crisper to me.- PHYSICAL BUILT (Iconia) - Transformer's plastic back is not a major concern to me but Iconia's solid aluminum armor makes it the clear winner in this category. The Iconia feels like a solid, well-designed product.- MULTIMEDIA (Transformer) - I had problems with the Iconia accessing content from other media servers on the network while all was more or less flawless with the Transformer. It's a significant plus for the Transformer but my friend is telling me that the Iconia may get a soft upgrade soon that should take care of this. To be fair, I had to update the Transformer before I could use some of the cooler (MyCloud) features.- EXTRA FEATURES (Transformer) - The Transformer comes with a well thought/designed dock/keyboard/expansion option that will effectively 'transform' it into an Android-running netbook. Do people who buy tablets actually want to transform them into netbooks? That's a good question. I'm not sure I do but at least one of my kids believes that he could use the physical keyboard. The Transformer's MyCloud makes it very easy to remotely control other computers and get access to digital content.I didn't have sufficient time to extensively test battery life or downloaded apps but I can say that Kindle and Gmail work great on both tablets.EVALUATIONFollowing the 2-day swap we both agree that The Transformer has the edge at this time and, unless something completely new and unexpected emerges in the next couple of months we are both likely to get a Transformer as our second tablet. However, there is the AVAILABILITY category where, at the time I'm writing this, the Iconia beats the Transformer hands down because you can actually buy one at the list price. This is going to change, for sure.My friend likes the Iconia and so do I but we both like the Transformer more. Let me say this: I missed my Transformer over the weekend. We only wish we could get one or, in my case, a second one.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Former iPad user: The Best Tablet out there, with some SW issues.", "Author": "Alberto Pena", "ReviewID": "R3TN4HAQ29BDST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet, even though not perfect, is among the best if not the best for sale at the moment, including iPad.The Apple iPad is still the reference to compare all Tabs with, having been the first successful tab to gain popularity.--- Hasta la vista, iPad ---I used to have an iPad, but I sold it.  I'm not an Apple hater by any means, I own a MacBook Pro, and iPod Touch, Airport Express and my wife has an iPod.I ripped my ~300 CD collection using Apple lossless on iTunes. I say this because I'm about to bash the iPad a little bit.The iPad does what it's designed to do flawlessly (as most Apple products).  The problem is , -what- it's designed to do.The iPad, IMHO is not designed to be a standalone computer. As soon as you take it out of the box it prompts you to plug it to your PC.You can't transfer music or movies without iTunes.  You can't connect USB mass storage for that.  The only source for Applications is the App store.Most people defend this position by Apple by saying that it helps preserves the quality of the user experience, and while this is true, it's only part of the story.It's also about controlling the revenue flow (just google i\"in App purchases)Then there is the Flash story.  Just see part of the Web.  Yes, Flash it might be outdated, slow, buggy, etc, but I think that taking the choice away from the consumer is not a good thing.There is also lack of Java support.  So while the iPad is a great device, i feel it's a little bit restrictive for me.  It's probably the BEST choice for MANY people, might be for you, but not for me, so I sold it.--- But I got hooked to a tablet computer ----So i got hooked to using a tablet.  Just touch the screen and immediately see the weather, e-mail or call my relatives using Skype.  Control my music Library remotely.  etc.Battery life is long.  Light and portable.--- What are the alternatives? ----Well, this is the hard part.  After monitoring the offerings for a while, I found that there aren't many.-Netbooks, are based on Windows and x86 architecture.And while not a big fan of Windows, that's not a dealbreaker for me.  However, most NBs are based on Intel Atom, which does not have an important feature for a multimedia device: H264/MPEG4 Hardware decoding.So with such a weak CPU, high bitrate videos are not possible.  There is the recently released AMD C-50 which does that, and there is the iconia w500, but I have my reservations (doesn't seem to be fanless design for example)-Blackberry Playbook / HP Touchpad :  I think it's late for a single vendor supported to come into play.  App availability will be an issue.--- Android Honeycomb with Tegra 2 ---I started reading about Android Honeycomb devices a few months back.  I don't even have an Android phone (I use a company owned Blackberry).So I had to do a lot of reading and talking to people.On paper, it looks great.  So does the Tegra2 System on Chip.Android is based on a linux/unix kernel with optimizations and add-ons by Google.  Anyone who has used Linux can tell how lean the base OS is (so is iOS, BTW)Tegra 2 puts power where it's needed, and keeps the power usage down.  iPad and Tegra is the Revenge of the ARM processor. Reduced instruction set and simplicity for general purpose tasks, combined with dedicated HW for multimedia.It just seems like the right combination.  On paper, at least.  So I decided to try, using the money OI got from my Ipad.--- Why the Iconia A500? ---Wanting a 10\" screen there aren't many choices at the moment.  But I even compared with some of the upcoming tablets specs.The HW and SW is pretty much the same, so at the end the decission was based on minor details (never owned Acer before, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, being most of the system off-the shelf stuff)ASUS Transformer:  If you are looking for tablets, you know about this one.  ASUS teased us with a very few units, for whatever reason, and it sold out immediately.  It seems to be back in stock through Amazon as I write this.But this doesn't speak well of a HW vendor (hey, it's not the iPad sho sells by millions). Still, the price point is very attractive.  So I was  going to wait until I noticed a very important detail:No USB port (that I could find on the specs/forum, so check by yourself).  This is a mayor flay.  So I keep looking.Motorola Xoom.  I almost got this one.  But $600 is too much and I don't really need the extra 16G (not for an extra $150 compared to the Iconia).I also don't like the fact that it has a non-LED-backlit screen. not for a HIGHER price.  The power connector also looks flimsy, and it's on the bottom of the device (or top if you rotate)It also has a straight connecto which puts more tension on the plug, so in the long term I see it breaking. (The Iconia has the connector on the side while in lanscape mode, and it's an L-shaped connector)Samsung Galaxy 10.1: This one looks sexy, but it's also more expensive and also seems to lack USB port!Toshiba Tablet:  Seems promising but also a tad more expensive and seems thicker.  But this one I also like.  Plenty of connectivity options.  My second choice.So now to the point.--- Iconia A500 Details---The \"Shell\":The case is well built.  It really feels solid and looks nice.  Power connector is on the side (while on lanscape mode) and it's L-shaped to be easy on the plug.The screen is gorgeous,  LED-backlit and with Gorilla Glass.*Connectivity:-Micro USB to connect to your PC-Full size USB to connect to mass storage device (I need to fully test this though).  Thanks.  This should be the norm rather than the exception.-MicroHDMI.-MicroSD (32G):  It would have been nicer a full size SD IMHO.  Haven't used yet.-Wifi + Bluetooth : I could connect my Apple Wireless Keybord with no issue.  Wifi range is good (see \"Software\" for some issue I've seen).  I get stable connection on the second floor with the D-Link router in the basement.-Headphone plug and speakers.  The sound is excellent for a tablet. Really good both from speakers and headphones.-Docking connector: I really don't care about this at the current price of the docking station ($79).  At least Acer doesn't force people to buy it to get USB.- Rear Facing Camera.  Very good for this type of device.  I will not be shooting video of weddings with this thing.  Just the ocassional snapshot.- Front facing Camera:  Here I have a complaint.  Why on earth isn't this thing centered on the top of the screen, instead of on a side.  You need to slightly tilt the tablet to center yourself on the screen while doing video chat.The toshiba has the same annoyance.  Pretty nonsense.- aGPS: Not the best reception.  I had some issues getting the location a couple of times.  Or maybe software issue?  Not sure.*Software - The bad:Well, here is where the trouble starts.  Android is still buggy.  A dealbreaker?  That's a personal thing.  Here some issues I've found.-I got \"no internet connection\" error a few times, even with 3 of 4 bars of signal.  I get the feeling that it's a SW thing, but I can't tell for sure as I haven't called Acer yet or rooted the thing to check myself.But I have seen this issue reported with the Xoom as well, so I tend to believe it's SW.-Youtube HD playback stutters a little bit.  Not much, but if you're picky, or watching a full length movie, it will be annoying.  I believe there is some application in the background messing up the CPU.It's not the Wireless conenction because it does it even with the playback buffer with plenty of data.  I tried to use the html5 version of YouTube ([...]) but I couldn't confirm it's really playing that version.-The Iconia has trouble sleeping.  It wakes up sporadically, the screen lights up for 3 to 5 seconds, goes back to sleep. Some daemon or service must be waking it up.  Hope I can find which one.-This is probaly not Acers/Google fault, but I use Skype, and I would like to have Video.  I read it's coming.  I hope Microsoft doesn't push it back.I hope these issues get resolved  but in any case, I doubt this will be my main device for movie watching.*Software - The good:- Honeycomb's interface is miles ahead of iOS.  No more restrictions to tiny icons as if it were a phone.  You have widgets you can customize.You can just tab on any snapshot of your favorite sites to launch.  Very customizable in general.- Android market, or any application you wish to download from any source if you so decide to do.  No more iOS protecting me from myself.This comes at a price, off course.  It's easier to get malware.  But you have the choice to stick with the Android market and it should be pretty safe.- Plenty of included utilities: media player, book reader, Documents to Go (haven't fully tested).  I could convert some previously backed up DVDs to play on this device using Handbrake (Free)I still need to tweak the settings more, but this is enough to entertain my toddler for a few hours.- Freedom to tinker with your folders while connected to your computer.- Google navigation: Thanks to integrated GPS, you can download and get directions from Google that work even after you lose your connection.  You can even lose your way a little bit and it will get you back.These are spoken turn by turn.  I hope someone makes a car holder for this thing.  The big map is gorgeous.- My rating: Four startsI have to acknowledge that after a couple of days of use I considered returning this device due to some of the annoyances I described above.But this thing grew up on me, and I decided to keep it.  The above issues seem SW (or bloatware) related, as I have seen them reported on the Xoom as well.  I hope they get fixed.I take one star because of the things mentioned above and because I think Youtube HD should work flawlessly, as it's a Google site, running on Google's browser on Google's operating system on Google blessed hardware.Overall, a nicely priced, well-built, maybe the best tablet option out there IMHO, that suffers from some software issues that will be hopefully resolved over time.I will update this review after a month or so if time allows.UPDATE: Someone pointed out screen is not IPS.  I thought it was.  I corrected that.

Gorilla glass all the way WILL NOT scratch!4. USB!!!! This is huge. Xoom and Ipad doesn't have this.5. Honeycomb is great, runs great. I had difficulty with downloading from the marketplace. Make sure you are logged into Google Talk if you are having issues.6. Got the Acer portfolio case. It's OK. Feels a little cheap, but fits it well and allows access to all ports EXCEPT microSD.7. 16GB is fine for me so far. Again, it can accept a microSD for more storage.8. This thing is FAST!

The fact that I still own the Icona A500 tells the tale. I have had no crashes. I find the multiple I/O connections very useful. I placed 4 movies (dvds I converted to H264)on an 8gb micro SD before a 5 1/2hr auto trip. The movies looked great. Since I was driving the kids watched 2 movies and played video games on the A500 the rest of the trip and I found plenty of battery left when we arrived. That was at a 50-60% screen setting. Since then I've used desktop controller software to stream Netflicks to the tablet from my laptop, I use GPS & navigation software from Google it looks very good on this screen along with spreadsheet & word document programs (while Excel spreadsheets on Android are not as full featured, they suffice for day to day tasks. Sheets created on a regular computer are easily readable). I use many other Android programs daily such as readers and such and while some of the developers are still working on their code the A500 does fine. The Thrive boasts a full size SD and replaceable battery, however after trying it for a day I found the higher price of the Thrive for a 32gb, which is what my A500 is, was not worth it. The Thrives extra battery is pretty well $100 by the time you pay sales tax. Since that was a major selling point for me,the fact that I would be spending  around $700 by the time I got extra battery was a downer. The display is not any better then the A500.Come on, you can get a pretty good, small, full on lap top for $700. And to date the A500 has not failed in coming through a days work without battery to spare for me.Although I would not fault the Thrive for its thickness, it's comfortable in your hand, by the time you get a cover of some kind on it didn't fit well in the brief case space I have for a tablet. I tried the ASUS. I found it to be very nice and thin. The display was fine. But its lack of I/O ports had it off of my list of choices very quickly. The Xoom wow, all I can say is Motorola should have been little easier on all the hype or spent more time on R&D; before they put out a tablet in that price range.It was not long in my possession. It's pretty, but for the money the A500 put it to shame. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 is the thinnest tab I tried. It's display is remarkable there's no question in my mind it has the best display,but, once again it's expensive and, like the IPad it's created to compete against, it has no I/O options other than its own special plug. That is just plain a killer problem for me. I wanted a tablet for help with my calendar, a convenient way to read email, download a forgotten document,show customers pictures & PDF files of products and reading Microsoft Office files. Along with that I use it to take pictures to show customers products from a stores, record work to done or even documents. Normally I would have to get my camera out but the 5mp camera on the back really does great.I can pop a flash drive for quick access to files. Add to that, when I get stuck waiting for someone or want to relax for awhile (tune out at lunch) I can read a book on it or watch a movie. All that taken into account it does everything I need.I feel it is absolutely the best choice for my money.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "The way a tablet should be!", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R5OQGK4LIJCFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only tablets I had seen before the Acer Iconia Tab were the iPad and iPad2, and frankly I use an iPhone, so the big iPod really didn't blow me away.

I believe this tablet is the best tablet for its value.  The iPad 1's touch keyboard didn't run too well, while the iPad 2 had a much improved keyboard, and generally ran pretty well.  The Xoom seemed a bit buggy for some reason when I tried it, and also was quite a bit more expensive than the iPad 1/2 or Acer Android tablet.  I also considered getting the Asus Transformer Android Honeycomb tablet as well, but it didn't have a USB port.  In addition, it was difficult to get the iPad 2 or the Asus Transformer, which were out of stock in many places, so that's also why I went ahead with the Acer Android tablet, as I don't like to wait to buy items.PROS:* Touch screen works quite well (you may need to lightly hold briefly for a few seconds when you touch something, but I find that to be quite fun)* Nice interface* Good screen resolution* Good tablet shape and design, easy to carry* It even came with something extra, a nice cloth to clean the tablet of the surface from your fingerprints.CONS:* I didn't set up WiFi immediately, and it took me a few minutes to find where to edit the settings (by touching on the time near the bottom right)* Some apps don't work on it, but that's likely will improve over time as more apps become compatible with Android tablets* On/off button a bit slow when turning onRECOMMENDATION:I would highly recommend this Acer Honeycomb tablet.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not an iPad knock off", "Author": "J.

Tablet software (even on the iPad) is rather unintuitive, but once one learns it, it is easy.Acer installs a bunch of apps on this which are duplicating the functions (poorly) of the Android apps which are also installed.I installed the Amazon Appstore, Flash, the Kindle App, the Audible app, and Opera Mini (among others).I can watch Amazon Video on Demand streaming through the Browser with Flash.

I really do love this tablet but after two weeks (coincidentally the amount of time Best Buy allows for tablet returns)I started having trouble with some widgets disappearing and acting kind of odd.  I thought a reboot would fix the problem but the tablet failed to load past the ANDROID screen.  I contacted Acer technical support and was floored at how incompetent they were.  They would copy and paste from the user manual (which is not included and must be downloaded) giving me solutions that require the tablet to actually boot.  They eventually deemed it a hardware problem, though it was not, and told me to FedEx it to them.  I spent an entire Saturday afternoon scouring some forums at XDA developers and Phandroid.com trying to find a solution and learned that this is actually kind of a common problem with this tablet.  Eventually some nice soul gave me a solution to restore to factory default.  This erased all my data but it was better than sending it to Acer and probably waiting for 2 weeks to get it back.This is an excellent tablet.  I'd even go as far as saying it is the best current Honeycomb tablet.  However, keep in mind that Acer customer support is horrible and if you have problems you might be on your own.Oh! In case you have the same problem as me, here is the solution: Plug in a USB keyboard and while holding down the volume up button (closest to the power button), turn on the tablet. When the message appears that says \"clearing cache\" appears, release the volume button and press the home key on the keyboard.  A menu will appear that will allow you to reset to factory defaults.

I was a happy Kindle owner before, but felt as many people have that it is yet one more single-purpose device that takes up space. On my work trips I'm often in the plane for 3+ hours and like to mix up reading with watching video, which the Kindle was not able to offer me.I was looking at the tablet options at the time and to say that there were slim pickings is an understatement.  What also was disconcerting is the trend of tablets to not offer external drives for additional memory.  With only 16GB and 32GB options I was not happy with any onboard memory limits of any tablet.  Books may not take up much memory, but video files do and I don't always have access to a wifi hotspot to stream content.  I also was unwilling to pay additional funds for a 3G or 4G monthly limited data plans on top of my cell phone and home internet monthly charges.I was holding out for the new Samsung Galaxy Tab until I discovered it wouldn't have any capacity for additional memory.  Therefore, I was left with the Motorola Xoom, Asus Transformer and the Acer A500.  The Xoom didn't have a functioning microSD card at the time I was looking (and was expensive) so it left the Asus and Acer.  The only reason I chose the Acer is that I liked the brushed metal back; otherwise, they appear to be very similar.It appeared to me that the biggest problem professional reviewer at sites like CNET had against the A500 is its bulk and weight.  Maybe I'm stronger than the average person using a tablet, but I routinely hold it one handed for extended periods of time and don't feel that it's burdensome.  Sure the Kindle's weight can't be beat by any tablet, but it also can't play video or easily surf the internet.Performance is smooth, fast, and responsive.  The web browser is great and I have no trouble accessing any sites.  I've downloaded Moboplayer and use Lumniread to access my content.  Oh and Google Music's cloud service is phenomenal.  I can go out to my back yard and stream all of my music easily from the tablet.  I picked up two 16GB microSD cards and have ample room for videos I carry around with me.  The only downside is accessing the microSD cards is not intuitive and you have to hunt and peck to find the right directory.Since then I have two friends that also have bought the same tablet and they love it.

My only other complaint is hopefully temporary: no Netflix access at this time.The Iconia has excellent stereo speakers. They won't beat stand alone speakers, but they'll definetly come in first against most net books and other tablets.All that said, this is a tablet and is best used for media consumption. I can type on it and do other tasks that I can do on a conventional PC, but the Iconia, like all tablets, is best when used for watching videos, surfing the web, listening to music, and playing games.

You can't delete them but you can remove them from the home screen and replace them with whatever apps you want. Overall the Acer interface is okay. The included Acer Clear.fi works as advertised. It recognized my 4tb home NAS after a few minutes and was able to browse, download and stream with minimal issues(more on that in the bad section).Now for the bad:Android Honeycomb, only in the sense that it is new and still has some bugs. I am sure it will get better as time goes by. Most of the issues with this tab seem to be software driven, such as apps force closing. To be honest if you are running an app designed for a four inch phone with different hardware you should expect some issues.I have not had any of the issues reported in other posts such as the screen turning on and off on its own.Be aware there is absolutely no users guide for this tab. The supplied guide from Acer is pathetic. If you have never used the Android system you may be lost at first.Native suport for video files is poor so you will need to download a third party app for most formats. Arc media or Moboplayer would have you covered for just about all the formats. This may change with the upcoming software update in June.Overall this is a great tab. I tried the Zoom and I can't see why anyone would spend more for what I consider a lesser tab. The Asus Transformer is the only other tab close but you have to fork out another $150 to get a USB port. As for the keyboard my bluetooth one works great, and you can pick one up for much less than $150.I won't compare this to the Ipad as this tab is based on the open source platform, not a closed system.

Woodward \"Woody\"", "ReviewID": "R25XUI1DQEGQFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I feel like many people seem to think that there is a \"best\" tablet and everyone should strive to buy that, I approached my purchase of a (then) Honeycomb more like I would a laptop, analyzing my potential uses for the tablet and then applying that to my buying decisions.For the record, this tablet is upgrade-able to Ice Cream Sandwich, making it a much better tablet. Here's why; ICS features a huge boost in speed and packs in features like support for Chrome (better than stock browser) and NTFS file systems (I'll touch on this more in a bit).I am a bit of techie, so when I buy, I look for bang for buck, when I can get more features for the same or better price, I'm there. I read all the reviews I could get my eyes on, and I knew this tablet was the one for me, and I could not have been more right.The biggest thing for me was the USB port. A full sized host USB port, just like the ones on laptops and desktops. It supports the use of computer mice (a small cursor shows up on screen when plugged in, cool!) usb keyboards (automatically hides on screen keyboard when plugged in, saves screen real estate) flash drives, external hard drives (every format I've tried, Fat32, NTFS, others) and finally, USB game controllers, namely the Wireless Xbox 360 controller for Windows. I even plugged in a USB hub, and used a number of these devices simultaneously! (I managed to get a keyboard, mouse, game controller and flash drive to work on the hub, external hdd required too much power, but still, quite impressive). The only other tablet on the market at the time with a full sized USB port was the Toshiba Thrive, and the fact that Toshiba changed the name of product line to separate itself from that thick slab of plastic shows how much they wanted to steer in another direction.As for build quality, I can say this tablet takes a beating. I am decently careful with my devices (more so than the average person, I would say) but I have dropped this thing, tossed it onto my bed, stepped on it (oops!) and generally had a few accidents every now and then. I can say this thing stands before me today with not a single blemish, and looks just about how it did when I bought it. The front is made up entirely of glass, expect two strips of aluminum at the top and bottom (in landscape) that wrap around back in a gentle curve. The back is aluminum, except for two plastic bands on each side (for the Wifi antennae (aluminum does a fantastic job of blocking wireless signals) and a space for the 5MP camera and flash. The left and right sides are black, shiny plastic. the left side features a headphone jack, micro HDMI jack, and a power button/charging light combination. The right side has a recessed reset button, the host USB port, a micro usb port (for data transfer) a sticker with FCC info, and the power port. The bottom is bare, except for a port for use with a dock. It should be noted that the port has a piece of plastic that sticks out from the back, parallel with the screen to protect the back of the port. It is a little more than a CM in width and a little less than a CM in height, and sticks out at its farthest no more than a couple Millimeters. This is a detracting feature, however, after a few years, I barely notice it. The top of the tab has a volume rocker, an orientation lock switch (a rare feature these days) and a plastic door that houses the MicroSD card slot.The screen itself is 10.1 inches and has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels. I've read reviews complaining of \"visible pixels\" but the pixels are no more visible than they are on any other tablet with a comparable PPI. The thing that has always struck me as weird, is that in the correct lighting, you can see a grid of dots, and then if you shift the lighting a bit more, you can see a cross hatch pattern on top of the screen. I think this may be a part of the touch panel, and you have to look for it to notice it, but it is there. If the screen is on however, it is nearly impossible to see, and who honestly sits there looking at the blank screen in direct light? This thing will attract fingerprints like mad, so either be willing to wipe it off every now and then, or learn to live with it. All touch screens I've used have this problem and the A500 is no worse than the others, it's just an occupational hazard for the glass touch screen. I wipe it down with a shirt tail or a microfiber cloth every couple weeks, and that has pretty much solved the problem for me.The cameras are disappointing to say the least. The front facing cam is sufficient for skyping, and the back cam can be used if you NEED to take a photo and no other cameras are available, but this won't be your daily shooter. I honestly believe, however, that if you are buying a tablet to use as your daily shooter, you may be looking at the wrong device category... Video is stuttery, but again, if nothing else is available, it can work in a pinch. If you are going to a wedding, or your daughters first birthday, don't expect this to compare to even modern cell phone cameras.The audio on this tablet is simply amazing. I don't mean you can replace your 400 watt stereo with the tablet, but it does have the best sounding audio of any tablet I've heard (including any and all of the iPads). It's loud enough to hear clearly in a room with a tv on and people having conversations, but as with all tablets, don't expect to be watching a youtube video at a basketball game. As with all mobile devices, headphones are a huge advantage, but this is certainly a step above the competition.As for performance, this tablet has a Tegra 2, which is an old elderly processor by this time. That being said, I can play the latest games (like GTA: Vice City, Dead Trigger, Shadowgun, and Riptide GT) without a stutter. If you open up a dozen tabs in chrome, it'll get a bit laggy, but for the average user, this tab handles everyday tasks just fine.One troublesome thing is the microphone on this tablet. Do a quick search for A500 microphone fix, and you'll find tons of people trying to figure out the issue. It is located in the crease between the top of the glass and the aluminum strip, dead center. I've come to believe the problem is software related, because doing song recognition (soundhound, shazam) is flawless and Google talk works excellently, but when skyping, I come across muddied and quiet unless I use headphones. It's strange.The other problem is GPS. This doesn't matter to me, as I have a Garmin, but if you plan on using GPS, test it as soon as you get the device, and return it for a replacement if it doesn't work. It seems some of the batches came off the assembly line with faulty GPS chips, so get that checked out.The only other thing to touch on is battery life. This thing is not a marathon runner, but it is more than sufficient for my needs. On an average day I will check my emails 4-5 times, spend approx 30 minutes surfing the web, and up to 2 hours streaming video from netflix, and playing games occasionally. With this usage pattern, I get about 2-3 days before hitting 10%, which is when it start to warn you about low battery. The good news is this thing charges faster than any other device I've owned. It must be the dedicated charger (12 volts at 1.5 amps, for those interested) but it can do a full charge in about 2 hours, I was flabbergasted at the rate at which this tab charges. If you are one of those people who forgets to charge your devices until an hour before your road trip (I've done that once or twice) you can still put a decent charge in this thing before you hit the road.Pros:Insanely Fast chargingstill speedy on it's tegra 2Host USB portmicrohdmi port (outputs 1080p)loud speakersorientation lock switchmicrosd card slot (up to 32gb tested and works great)Cons:low quality camsdocking port sticks out oddlyodd crosshatch and dot patters on screenfingerprint magnetnot the longest battery lifeSummary:This tablet can be an excellent choice for you, just know what you want. It worked out perfectly for me, but I'm the kind of person who would rig it up to a 24\" monitor, plug in a usb mouse and keyboard and use it as a desktop because I kind of maybe might have spilled water on my laptop and wanted it to dry for a few days (btw, it worked perfectly like that). If you just want to watch Netflix and check your emails, there are better and cheaper alternatives. However, if you might want to do work on your tab on the road, it is a cinch to plug in a USB flash drive, copy over files, and review your notes from Tuesday's meeting on this thing. Not many tablets (barring the newer Windows 8 and RT tablets) have that functionality. It's large developer base (see XDA Developers) means any modders would love to use this tab, there are small executables all over the web that will root this sucker in seconds.All in all, I love this tablet, and if you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message, or ask it in the questions section below, I'll check every now and then to see if I can answer anybody's questions.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "After 1 year...avoid like the plague", "Author": "Joe from Colorado", "ReviewID": "R1XCYEQITEZLYR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a very nice tablet for 13 months.  Did everything I wanted, received update to ICS, I was a happy camper.  Then yesterday, it wouldn't boot--got stuck on the Acer logo screen.  I figured a soft reset would take care of it.  Nope, nor would a hard (factory default/wipe) reset.  So I started looking around on the forums and was shocked to find that LOTS of people are reporting exactly the same problem (and coincidentally, during the last couple months), and no solution.  It sounds like it's a hardware problem (apparently the NAND memory), and Acer charges $199 to fix (and a few people have reported that the problem returned after the repair).  For that money, and with this track record and poor customer service, I'll find another option.This tablet is bone-stock, lightly used, and very well cared for (still looks like new due using a very nice case).

Finally Honeycomb 3 is the answer and glad I didn't pulled the trigger on those other android 2.2 tablets that came out last year.Pros:1. mostly same specs as Xoom, Transformer, and Blackberry tablet: tegra2, 1gb ram, resolution, (16gb is little smaller then 32 of the xoom)2. USB, why I decided not to wait forever for the Asus transformer.3. Android Honeycomb is my first android OS and it is awesome: Flash, layout, interface.4. it works (always a plus)Cons:1. it isn't as cheap as the AsusNeutral:1. I heard the Asus has a better viewing angle screen, but I think this Iconia's screen is super itself.  They are both 1280x800ish so not a big deal.  Ipad2 is still 800x600ish, that is like reading a box compared to these wide screen androids.2. material is not as nice as xoom.  But I have a case so it is covered and not an issues anymore.So why people pay for the xoom and blackbery is beyond me (unless you mush have the 3g or 4 g stuff).  Apple Big Brother approach to controlling everything like no flash, usb bugs me.  (didn't they called IBM Big Brother before)  There are plenty of Acer Iconia out there compare to Asus Transformer, which was like a paper release where a few got it.  I gave up on the wider viewing angle of the Asus and knowing that the usb is more important to me.  I take photos on my Nikon D7000 and sometime to view it in the field. I need to view these pics before I get home and find them blurry or something.  Guess what? I can view picture from usb in the picture gallery, excellent.  I thought the silver aluminum body was an odd color to the black bezel edge.  But it is covered now by Acer Iconia Tab A500 Protective Case.AndroidThis is my first android OS and I downloaded a few free apps with no problem.  Wifi connection is no problem.  It saw my home media server (via clear.fi), but not all videos can be played like with window media player.  The camera has a flash to it, but isn't that sharp for photos.  Maybe  I need to download hipstermatic or something.  Some of the web pages are not like full web browsers nor mobile web, but in-between.  Heck I got to stream some ESPN video clip and cnet review, which the ipad can't. (update it does go to the full browser, but you might have to redirect the page)  Also got my hotmail and gmail app and have no issues with the setup or connections.I am using this mainly for browsing and photo review on the go for my dslr and it scored an 5/5 in that department.  Everything else is a bonus.  I don't need a keypad, since I got a netbook.  This is much simpler and quicker to use on the go.  The power cord is a very short.  I give this a 9/10 or a 4.5 star.

I think this a great tablet and despite what other reviews have to say about it, its better to me than some of it's big named, higher priced competitors.  The pros and cons are:Pros:Weight-Too many people complain about it being on the heavy end as far as tablets go but I like the weight.  I don't feel like its going to break if I hold it or accidentally drop it.Ports-It comes with HDMI, USB and micro usb right out of the box...no adapters required.  I've even hooked up a 500 GB hard drive and watched videos from it, as well as a USB based mouse which worked.Sound-Its pretty loud when playing games but this is also a con (see below)Camera-While it's not a high end camera, it takes good pictures and records quality video.  It has a 2mp rear camera that also doubles as a video chat camera, and a 5mp front facing camera with flash.Cutomization-I like the fact that it is easily customizable to however you decide to set it up much like cell phones now with multiple screens.Battery life-On a single charge you can get a decent amount of use out of it.  If you charge it, and put it to sleep and come back later , or even the next day, you can expect to still have atleast 90% of your charge left.Price-Compared to more expensive tablets, you get more in functionality without having to spend more money on adapters.Cons:Power cord-This is absolutely ridiculous how short this cord is.  If you need to use it while its charging, be prepared to sit right next to the outlet.Screen freeze-I've occassionally had an issue with the screen freezing but I notice that it only happens when I haven't turned it off or left it in sleep mode with restarting for a couple of days.  When I resart it, it works fine.Sound- As I stated before, the sound when playing games is outstanding.  Whenever you watch movies, or videos, or play back any video you may have recorded, the sound drops off quite a bit.  Also the sound for recorded video sometimes sounds garbled even when in a small room and near the tablet.Resolution-The screen resolution washes almost completely out when outside.Overall, I think its a great tablet and I'd easily recommend it to anyone looking for a netbook, or even notebook replacement.UPDATE 03/14/14  While I still believe this is a great tablet, I can no longer say that I'd recommend it as a long term tablet built for everyday use.  The reason I say this is because about a year ago, the power/sleep button stopped working and whenever I plug it up, I can see the button light up orange to show it is charging, but the button can no longer power it on.  Additionally, I did research to try and see about getting it fixed, but came across multiple reviews of users being forced to pay for an item that should've been built a little better from the start, or the flat out refusal of Acer to either acknowledge or fix it.  As I said in my first review, I still think it's a great budget tablet for someone who is just getting into the tablet world (especially with all of the features it has), but the fact that the power button stopped functioning a little over a year into it, as well as the limited upgradeability of it caused me to replace it with a 4th generation iPad.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall best aand equipped everything you need!", "Author": "M.

It's not a laptop replacement, but by using this, I have decreased the amount of time I spend in front of the laptop by a couple hours a day.One should view these tablets as a place to gather information.  It's great for downloading and reading emails, viewing webpages, checking stocks, reading news and .pdf files, looking at photos/videos, reading Facebook.  It's good for some basic games like Angry Birds.  It's light, portable and very quick.  For me to wake up and check the stock page, top news, and read emails, this has been very convenient.  I can do this with one hand while brushing my teeth with the other.It's also really good for watching movies.  On a 6 hour flight to Hawaii, my 4 year old son was occupied the entire flight - and I had plenty of battery to spare.  It beats our portable DVD player hands down.  When we got to our condo in Maui, we plugged the HDMI port into the TV and watched movies in full HD.  I also bought a $10 cheap, portable USB keyboard and plugged it into the USB port, at it did okay to send emails.  You can also hook up a card reader to the USB port and look at photos you've taken.It's not a full laptop/computer replacement, because it's not practical to write emails by punching it out on the keypad.  You can get 10-15 words in, but then you go batty pecking away at the keys.  Filling out forms on the internet will be similarly difficult, much less working with a spread sheet.  It's a little slow when it comes some bigger applications, but then again it wasn't really designed for that.My is currently synced up with my work's Microsoft Exchange server (just a note, it comes with Android 3.0 - you have to wait a day or so until it updates to 3.1 before you can hook it up to the exchange server), Yahoo!Mail, and GMail.  It's also connected to Facebook.  It's all been pretty seemless and has worked really well.On our trip to Hawaii, I was able to leave my 6 pound laptop at home and just bring this along, which was a huge weight savings if you count the charger for the laptop.  I really didn't miss the laptop all that much, I was able to get everything I needed to do on the Iconia.Recommendations- Get a good case for it- Get a stylus - it works really well- Get a USB Keyboard - yeah bluetooth is cool but realisticly, you're not going to move more than 12\" from it any any time so a USB wired keyboard will work every bit as good for a lot less.- Wait for it to update to Android 3.1 (usually withing 24 hours)Dislikes- It's probably the heaviest of the Andriod tablets- As of 9/26/11 Netflix is still not available for itIf you look at all my reviews I give very few 5 stars.

First a few disclaimers:1.  In my opinion, the \"perfect tablet\" does not exist.  All devices in this form factor fall short in more than one area.2.  The only other \"tablets\" I own is the Archos 101 and the Velocity Micro Cruz (actually an e-Reader with some tablet features).  I do not own anything Apple...but my wife does.The good:The tablet is fast and responsive.  Of all the tablets I played with, this is as responsive as all the others in this classBoot process is very good. My Archos 101 took a long time to boot and this is much, much faster.Wireless is very good.  Available networks are quickly recognized and easy to connect to despite what some of the other reviews have stated.MicroSD works out of the box.  Popped in a 32GB card and data was immediately available with no issues at all.USB works out of the box as well, but...it has many limitations. (I'll talk about this later).Android 3.0 is a marked improvement over 2.2.  Even as good as this OS is, I believe it will get better as more attention is paid to stabilizing it.Price.  Because you can add an SD card you can increase the amount of storage from the base model of 16GB.  With the 32GB card I added, I now have 48GB for less than I would have paid for the 32GB non-upgradeable device.  $449 is a very reasonable price.The not so good...Pre-loaded software.  This was something I didn't expect.  There are a few programs on the machine that you can't uninstall unless you root the machine.  DocsToGo can only be upgraded using the site tied to the pre-loaded install which means you can't upgrade it to the full version unless you use their upgrade site.  Also, some of the other software programs that run flawless on 2.2 will have issues on 3.0 (Astro SMB is one of them).Weight.  Yes...this tablet is heavy compared to the other tablets on the market in this class.  When you first pick it up it's not that bad but after a while you will notice the difference.  I spent $11.00 (US) to purchase a stand that's portable and folds down small enough to take it with me in my tablet sleeve.Charge cord.  I had no idea how short the cord was going to be until I unpacked my tablet. I did spend $1.00 (US) on an extension cord to help me overcome the short cord but I should not have had to.  I wasn't looking for a 5 foot cord but 14 inches???USB is not fully functional.  Although you can add a wireless keyboard and mouse through the USB, you still do not have all the functionality you would get on a netbook or higher.  Supposedly, the Android 3.1 upgrade will provide you with more functionality but still not 100%.Despite my dislikes, overall this is a very good and I'm happy I bought it.  It will be interesting to see what the 3.1 upgrade will do and I'm seeing more options available for the tablet being offered.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet comparable to the Xoom while cheaper", "Author": "C. Gonzales", "ReviewID": "R24TOHL56O4ET8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say after playing with this tablet for a few weeks I've had some surprises as well as drawbacks.  I came across this tablet in Best Buy after checking out the Motorola Xoom for over a month.My story is as follows: My current desktop PC doubles over as a media center in my living room and currently have no PC in the bedroom for when I wanted to surf the internet late at night.  I figured a laptop would be too big and would be too high maintenance and so I settled on something I could use to do the following:1.  Stream movies from my network attached storage device without requiring an additional TV (my phone screen being too small)2.  Stream my music as well3.  Surf the internet and yet still be able to use flash4.  Occasional video chatting5.  Double as a picture frame when not in use.The xoom was able to do most of these things but I found that when I was in the store #1 was questionable.  While in the store I did some playing around with the Xoom and Acer and used a program called Skiftka to utilize the local bestbuy wifi.  I found I was easily able to watch videos streaming from the Xoom onto the Acer with no problem.  For some reason it wasn't as easy on the xoom.  So I fired up the DLNA website and found that the Acer was listed as certified while the Xoom was not.  One of the other things I noticed was that the Acer had a full usb slot; I will touch on this later.  While the Acer was a bit heavier it had comparable specs to the xoom while being over $150 cheaper.  The only thing I liked more was that the Xoom had the new android OS 3.1 (I'm being told end of June for the acer update).  So deciding I would try out the Acer I picked it over the Xoom.  The thing I liked about the Xoom and Acer over the Ipad or even the Blackberry Playbook is the MicroHDMI port built into it.  I didn't want to have to buy a dock straight out of the box and figured a microHDMI cable would be cheaper than a dock (Please note the MicroHDMI cable does not come included).The two cameras work well and seem to take decent pics.  You can geotag them automatically and switch to video on the fly.  I haven't tested out the GPS system yet so I will have to come back to it at a later date.  The MicroHDMI cable is plug and play and since the native resolution of the tablet almost matches the native resolution of most HDTVs you are able to have a full screen proportional experience.  Just plug in the MicroHDMI cable into the Acer and then the other end into your HDMI port on your TV and switch your TV to the output and you should see the Acer's screen full size on your TV.  It works great for playing videos stored on the harddrive while on the road.So I've covered a bit of the good so now the drawbacks.  First off I would have loved there to be some indicator for when I plug something into the USB host port.  Nothing pops up, no instance file access you either have to open a file manager app or the music or video programs.  Also the USB port is a little tough.  I'm afraid one of these days I might break my USB thumb drive or the port trying to pull it out.  I have also noticed a problem with loading files onto the device.  I had about 10 gbs worth of data I put on at one time and noticed after I was done Apps from the Market would fail to install.  I had to reformat back to scratch and start again.  It might be an OS problem but it gets rather annoying.  The weight of the device is manageable but I can see it getting tiring after carrying it around everywhere.  Maybe it is just me but I also seem to have a slowdown of my internet every now and then with this.All in all this is a pretty solid tablet and I would recommend it to my friends searching for a tablet.  I'll update this as time permits...Update 6/18/11:  For the first time I tried selecting text in an internet window and found it almost impossible to select the lines I wanted.  The text selection tool just kept jumping all over the place.  I find this to be a big negative and hope this to be updated with the 3.1 release.  The word on the street is we should be getting the 3.1 update on June 23rd.Update: 6/23/11:  Okay so it looks like the update isn't coming now until around July 5th according to Acer Germany.  I'm not sure how that pans out for those of us in the United States.  I tried the video chat today for the first time through google talk.  Make sure you have plenty of light as the front facing camera doesn't have a flash.  I didn't find any way to use the rear facing camera either.  All in all the video seemed to stream well.  I was talking with my friend over his HTC Evo 4G and his video seemed to come across well as my video streamed back crisply.  He was able to understand my words perfectly.  I would like to find a better video chat app for the tablet nonetheless.  I give the video chat a 3.5 out of 5.  It could use some improvements to the interface.Update: 7/8/11: This week Acer finally rolled out the Honeycomb 3.1 update as well as some internal improvements.  All in all the experience seems to be a lot smoother.  I no longer seem to get force closes on certain apps.  Youtube runs a lot smoother and crisper and the 1080 output is nice.  I am now able to plug my cell phone into the usb port and charge it.  In this release there are a few new apps.  One of them is a movie studio where you can edit your videos taken with your camera.

And after alot of research and keenly considering factors such as screen size, capability, quality, etc., I bought this one (about 5 months ago-I've had time to test it out)... I must say I am pretty happy with the purchase!Some of the pros vary for me, a major one being Android Honeycomb. It asks you to update from time to time, and it does so rather quickly. About 2 weeks ago it COMPLETELY updated and changed the icons and txt, much prettier and faster. I am really impressed by this. The apps work pretty well most of the time, hardly ever crashes for me. Other huge pros are the HDMI out-you have to buy a cable, 20 bucks on Amazon-and I can rent a movie, play it off this while on battery, and it looks gorgeous-even dims the screen for ya. Its not BluRay quality per se, but just as good as regular DVD. Another good quality is the speed, for the most part, it handles most games and high quality video pretty well. However, I have a large collection of AVI (divx and xvid encoded), and 25% pf the time it acts buggy... Skype works awesome for me, and most issues with limitations can be solved with apps (easy file transfer, BTooth stuff, even remote desktop to control your home computer-sweet!). The price I got this at was incredible, which should also make my comments about cons moot-under 300 bucks I spent!The cons are pretty clear for me, as I have now had a chance to see other tablets and compare. It is a bit heavy. If Im reading a book on Kindle or Magazine on Zinio, it will tire your hand out. Most tablets will do it to an extent, but this is on the heavy side. Also, a lack of (some exceptions)affordable accessories-not even close to what Ipad offers. The acer BT keyboard is like 65 bucks-and not very many options to turn this into a sleek mini desktop. I intend to travel alot and write, so this is crucial for me. Also, the Wifi will cut off while not using, even after I set the setting to leave it on-charger or not. I have to manually reconnect, very annoying.All in all, I am way more happy than displeased, and will never regret the purchase.

Very useful if you want to copy a large number of videos, ebooks, pictures, etc., to or from the tablet.Cons- Slightly heavier than flashier tablets but not really in any way that makes a difference.

It is one of the best price/value product.  I used it for 2, 3 hours/day almost every day. My wife and daughter also use it daily. They all love it.Pros.1. Micro SD slot.I bought a 16G micro SD card for $20, put it in. Now my tablet is the same as 32G tablet. I usually put my own stuff such as video, mp3, pics etc at the external SD. It is so easy to just move them around.Beats ipad hands down2. Full Usb Slot.I  just plug in the logitech wireless mouse/ keyboard combo adapter and use the mouse and keyboard right away. If you REALLY want to write long document or email, full keyboard and mouse are much faster and more comfortable.I also plug in an 2TB external hard disk to the USB port. I can access the data over there right away.Beats ipad hands down3. Great back and front cameraThe 5M back camera takes great quality 720P video.  The picture quality is also good.  Front camera is good for skype video chat.Beat ipad hands down.4. Micro HDMI output.HDMI port makes playing video over the big screen so easy. Just connect the A500 to a TV with HDMI cable, you can relax and enjoy  your favorite show on the big screen.5. Great speakerA500 has a great speaker, it is load and clear.6. High resolutionIt is standard on 10.1 android tablet. 1280x800, it is still much better than ipad, especially when browsing website when often the font is small.7.  Honeycomb 3.2The default tabbed browser, multi-pane  gmail user interface etc are great improvement from android 2.3. You need to buy a tablet with at least android 3.X.8. official skype video call and netflix applicationMy daughter watches the children's program via netflix all the time. Now the A500 gets the official application from netflix.Also the skype video chat is officially supported on A500.9. Full brushed aluminium back cover.It is light and strong10. GPS and Bluetooth.It has standalone GPS. Although I don't plan to use it, it is still better to have it than not.Cons,1.Weight.It is heavier than Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 and ipad. But I found it is not a big problem. Almost all people use a case anyway.  Nobody can hold a 10.1 tablet with one hand for a long time.2. Screen reflection.The screen has reflection problem. If you are indoor and  there  is sun light at your back, the reflection gets worse.3. Battery timeI got about 6.5 hours with normal usage, internet browsing, watching video etc. I prefer  it to be longer.

I have friends that have the Xoom and iPad 2 and could only look at the A500 at the retail store.I chose the A500 because I liked the look and feel, good screen resolution and excellent picture quality when attached to a HD theater system with a 10' screen.  More important for me were two key features..First, the full size USB 2 was quite a surprise because I discovered that not only could I use it with a keyboard and mouse but I could load movies on a USB memory stick and access the movie player on the A500 without having to load them into memory or the microSD card, much less having to use iTunes which I just don't like.  I am able to use different types of video files easily with excellent resolution, including MPGs.  They also look great on the 10' HD theater screen.  I use the Mobo video player app which has extra codecs for MPG files,Second, I love streaming videos off the Internet direct to the HD TV using the Dolphin Browser HD.  My buddies iPad 2 can't do either of these two things.  He was kind of jealous as we watched Fringe in HD off the  A500.  I was considering a DVD player with Internet capabilities or an Internet TV box, not anymore!The Bluetooth works great.  In fact, my buddy with the iPad 2 gave me his Bluetooth keyboard he used with his iPad 1 because it would not work with his iPad 2.I got the 16 GB version and added a 32 GB microSD.  It also has a mini-USB port along with the full size one.

After finally relenting and ordering the A500, it arrived in a couple of days and I was very glad I did.1.  The product is VERY solid.  I was concerned about reviews mentioning bending or creaking, etc.  Well, the only cheap thing about the device is the little hatch cover for the microSD card, and that's something that I only use once or twice to add/upgrade the microSD card, and is otherwise not noticeable.  Everything else about the brushed aluminum and the glass cover is very solid and well built.2. I have had no issues whatsoever with Honeycomb.  The apps in the Android Marketplace are mostly written in Java (unless the developer ported a C code via JNI), and personally, Java is not my prime choice when it comes to robustness or process-intensive programs (although Java has much improved over the years).  This simply means that if you're running graphics-intensive programs such as games, or are number crunching on your tablet, etc., you are bound to see occasional lags and glitches.  That is often not the fault of the Android platform, which is a modified Linux kernel with the Java code running on the Java Virtual Machine that runs on the kernel.  Developers and savvy users can and do port C code for Android apps that can address some of the stability / speed issues (however, a poorly-written C code can be far more problematic and less efficient than a poorly-written Java program).  The one advantage Apple's Cocoa framework has is limiting development to Objective-C; however, I found it to be a pain in the a** to work with, and I think most younger programmers would also prefer developing in Java (while the old-timers prefer C), so either way, Android has better prospects IMHO.My apps are almost entirely my favorite open-source programs that I have ported over after a few minutes of modifying some basics, thus skipping the annoying \"free\" but ad-ridden (and perhaps malware-ridden) market apps.  (There are some very good quality ad-free, free apps in the market, but not that many yet.)3. The interface is excellent.  I find it very responsive and precise overall.  I do have a stylus pen I had bought for iPad2, and I use that to avoid getting finger grease on the display while watching movies, etc.4. Start up speed is ~10-15 seconds from a cold start.  If you put the device in sleep mode, the wake-up is ~1 sec.5. Battery lasts exactly 7 hours with WiFi on, videos / music playing, and multi-tasking.  It is true that other tablets provide more juice (iPad2 ~10 and I believe Galaxy, Xoom and Transformer are also supposed to be higher), but A500's better quality speakers, LED flash, lower actual price tag (not the hypothetical price tag on the other products that end up being much higher in reality due to 3rd-party price-gouging), etc., make the lower battery life less of an issue.6. The cameras are descent, having an LED flash is handy for taking pictures of documents, the microphone quality is good enough for Skype in a quiet room, the weight is less than a typical book, and unless you are suffering from some age-related disease (like another reviewer had complained), the tablet will not \"slide out of your hands by being to slick.\"If 3rd-party vendors start providing high quality, custom-fit covers for this product, then it would perfect in nearly every sense.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why did you buy that over this.....", "Author": "Robert D.

I don't think so this has an ON BOARD USB host slot which is way better because if you want one for the Asus you have to buy an additional dock for 150 dollars, I thought you were looking for a tablet not a labtop and it adds like three more pounds also. And the Asus has gorrila glass, I don't care that thing has light bleeds on the edges, iconia doesn't have those and the screens are almost identical probably both the same quality. Also now the iconia is way cheaper also I bought mine for 350 brand new but the Asus is about 370-380 brand new, and the Asus is a bit wider than the iconia and won't fit in some cases. And the camera on iconia has flash which is also a bonus also an auto landscape or portrait locking switch. So I still don't know why you bought it over the Iconia.the only reason you would buy this because the extra keyboard gives you more batteryNow lets talk about why you bought Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 over this. First of the iconia has HDMI, USB Host slot, micro SD card slot and has auto landscape portrait mode switch, well lets just say galaxy tab HAS NONE OF THOSE!! Why would you not want a micro USB slot, yeah you could use the cloud service thing for transferring over files but does the cloud service charge things? I don't think so but I do think the USB slot does, and if you bought a hub to connect more than one device to it you could hook up a hub to the USB slot, cloud doesn't do that. USB slot can hook up a hard drive or flash drive to it, cloud cant. And I'm not saying the cloud is a bad thing I actually like it but a USB slot is just way better. And and HDMI is a huge plus if you want to share something on a bigger screen and play movies in 1080p format. Also a micro SD slot has to be on a device unless you don't want extra storage I mean I want extra storage don't you? And yeah there are adapters for all of these things, but do you really want to pay 30-40 for an adapter that sticks out like an inch or so, and the micro sd adapter is for only media exchange I believe. And the only reason you would buy this because its much rhinner and lighter and maybe better battery life and screenNow why did you buy a Toshiba thrive over this? Well this one is almost even but the Acer iconia is way thinner and lighter and has flash and gets better battery life and doesn't have those annoying lights on the front of the tablet. Yeah the thrive has a removable battery which is nice but batteries usually last awhile. And the thrive has a full sd card slot which can support up to 128gb. But I would still prefer the iconia over this.Why did you buy the xoom over this? Iconia has way more ports than xoom and the power button in a better spot and xoom doesn't even have haptic feedback or any vibration in it. The SD card slot doesn't even work which is a huge minus. So xoom kind of close but too heavy for how small it is and iconia is still my choiceWhy did you buy an Ipad over this? Comes down to one thing, iOS or Android honeycomb. But I like honeycomb and android way better than ios, and Ipad has not ports eitherThat's why I bought an Acer iconia over those tabletsSorry for any spelling mistakes, typed it on my Acer iconia tab(THIS IS JUST AN OPINION NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN OR ANYTHING, NOT TRYING TO BE A CRITIC)", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Made the Right Choice", "Author": "Jazzbird \"JB\"", "ReviewID": "R215YWBXM5H89A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been hemming and hawing, like most people, trying to figure out which tablet, if any, was right for me. I returned back to school in the fall and wanted something I could carry around with the convenience of a laptop, but without the heft. When a little extra money came my way, this fit the bill.Major \"pros\" on my list:-USB port! So many don't have these. I use a flash drive frequently, and it's nice not to hog up bandwidth to transfer a large file or two (I do use the cloud quite a bit, as well, and have an online repository for documents, but it's not always practical).-MicroSD slot. Expansion! I love that I could add an extra 32gb to the tablet without any trouble.-Portability. It's slightly heavier than some, but I don't notice it at all (I have an extremely bad back, so heft was a concern). With none of my textbooks being all available on Kindle, I love that I can view books in pretty much any format (including Kindle's mobi). I rented digital copies of a few books and the company I used has an Android app. Excellent.-I haven't experienced any sort of lag or slowness, even when I'm running several different apps in the background.-The battery life is great!! I use it fairly often and the only time I ever have to charge when I'm at school is when I've forgotten to charge it the night before and I'd used it pretty heavily. I can watch entire movies and barely make a dent in the battery's charge. I was surprised that using a bluetooth keyboard wasn't much of a battery drain, either.-It's less expensive than many (I got mine for $300, which was an amazing deal, but I've seen them regularly priced at some stores for $350).-It runs on Honeycomb (Android 3.x). This means, among many other reasons, that we can benefit from Amazon's \"Free Adroid app of the day\"! I'd already been taking advantage of this on my phone, but I've scored some great apps that are more suited for the tablet, as well.I haven't really come up with any major \"cons\" on my list.

My uses for my Acer A500 with 16MB internal memory are mostly getting information off the web and reading books, newspapers, and magazines.  Also, using the App \"Documents to Go\" I pick up Word, Excel, and .pdf docs that I need for reference.  The inexpensive ($50) Acer bluetooth keyboard works well for composing anything longer than a quick e-mail.  To get to the point, my Acer A500 has performed without a hitch during the three months I have owned it.  Initially, when I purchased it Dec '11 there were a number of upgrades to the operating system from Acer.  I remember needing one re-boot before the upgrades, none since. Everything has worked well, connecting bluetooth devices, connecting to wi-fi, and the other usual tasks all happen as they should -- easily.I find the wider screen configuration (compared to an I-Pad) to be an advantage not only because it is correct for movies/videos, but because it allows web pages to be sized wider -- a personal preference.Visual clarity, and touch sensitivity are excellent, and very much on a par with my wife's I-Pad.  Speed surfing the web, opening applications, documents, is very fast, no difference from the I-Pad. And it should be noted that the Acer cost $349, and my wife's I-Pad was north of $600.  And if you want to have a USB port and an HDMI connection on the I-Pad, you are into about $60 worth of cables and the hassle of hauling them around.Flexibility of usage is a strong point.  Available adjustments in \"settings\" are extensive, there being more available than on the I-Pad.  My memory card slot contains a 32MB micro SD card, which of course could be exchanged for another -- the point being that you have much flexibility with storage.  Following recommendations from other reviewers (thank you!) I have installed the App \"File Manager,\" which does exactly that.  There is also a USB port that is handy for attaching a thumb drive -- or a large hard drive.  The Acer A500 might be a bit heavier, but the USB port, SD card slot -- and the HDMI socket -- are worth this minor inconvenience.Camera feature is handy, if you don't mind being seen taking pictures with something that looks like a clip-board.  Picture quality is fine for quick recording of an image -- for more artistic aspirations I use my digital camera.When using my Droid X as a 3-G hot spot the performance is directly proportional to the performance of the hotspot.  That means it can vary from being almost as fast as from my Apple Airport Extreme (54 Mb/sec vs 72Mb/sec) down to an irritating slow, halting 5Mb sec, or no connection at all.  Bottom line, and no surprise, it's the strength of the 3-G signal that counts.  Amped Wireless has an App \"Wi-Fi Analytics\" that shows signal strength, channel, and amount of interference on each chanel.  This App has been very helpful getting the best out of wi-fi connections (or figuring out why they didn't work!).Ease of navigation around the device is a strong point.  There is a back button at the bottom left corner that I find much handier than the I-Pad home button.  I felt immediately at home on this device, able to move from one app to another, or whatever, with ease.  It always seems that your apps, settings, bookmarked web pages, Google search -- the stuff you do all the time -- are at your finger tips.Battery life appears to be as advertised, giving about 8 hours of full usage.  I have yet to start the day with a full charge and need to re-charge before day's end.That's about it.

I had been looking at the smaller, cheaper options like the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet. When I opened the Iconia on Christmas morning, I didn't know much about it. I powered it up and immediately started playing with it. The screen is Corning Gorilla Glass- if you aren't familiar with it, you should be. I have it on my phone screen as well (the T-Mobile G2x- which otherwise sucks, by the way)... it is the same glass used on the Kindle Fire. It doesn't scratch easily at all. The process they use to make it stuffs large ions into the surface of the glass and then it is immersed in a salt water bath at about 752 degrees for an extended period of time. This makes the glass very hard and incredibly smooth. It doesn't really need a screen protector, but I use one anyway (force of habit, really.... I'm a little paranoid about scratches.) The screen is EXTREMELY responsive, and quite beautiful. One drawback with the screen is that pictures and video blown up to full size can tend to look a little pixelated, but in my opinion, not enough to be a bother. The camera is good, as is the camcorder. On the camcorder, however, the microphone makes the videos sound kind of funky. From reading earlier reviews, I understand that this has only been a problem since the OS upgrade to Android 3.2. Maybe further upgrades will bring the microphone quality back up. With 16GB of built in memory, it has plenty of memory for lots of apps- as well as an SD slot that allows you to put in a micro sdhc card up to 32 GB. It shares a shell with the Acer A501- so it appears to have a sim card slot but that is an illusion.... the slot is there, but is taped off. There is no radio hardware inside, so if you put a sim in, it will just fall inside the case and rattle around. This is no problem, however, because it has wifi and most phones can be used as mobile hotspots nowadays. The honeycomb OS works great, much less buggy than gingerbread or froyo.The tablet as a whole is pretty awesome- it is fantastic for surfing the web, emailing, playing games, reading ebooks, and plenty of other things. The built in e-reading software, lumiread, was great until the last upgrade to 3.2 and now it force closes every time. I remedied this by installing aldiko premium from the android market for $2.99. It works great but unfortunately doesn't have the ability to tag ebooks for categorization. I am hoping that the next upgrade will fix lumiread, as it was pretty great.All in all, I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone. Although the review might sound critical, it really isn't. I am really just trying to be objective and thorough. I know that any computer or electronic device will have drawbacks, but you really couldn't ask for a better piece of equipment. I have had the opportunity to use several other tablets, and in my opinion this is by far the best.

I really wanted to talk myself into an iPad 2 but couldn't justify the near $200 premium.  Being an Android house so far, I decided to look at Android tablets realizing I had no idea who the players were, except the big names that advertise heavy, including by mobile carriers.Acer Iconia kept popping up in trade reviews as an underdog, an overlooked jewel.  I've never been a fan of Acer for the most part, but knowing how brands and products don't always overlap, I started digging more.  One of the 1st things I did was check for the screen.  Having 2 HTC Evo's in the house I've become a huge fan of screens made with Gorilla Glass (A Corning products) and was happy to see the Acer Iconia on the list of product that use it.  Features and power were comparable to iPad so I gave it a try.All I can say is that from the first time powering on after letting it charge for several hours, I was blow away.  I went through the 4-6 iterations of updates (Android thing, not Acer so check for updates until it says it is up to date) and once done I was ready to take it away from my wife.I didn't notice that it's got some features iPad does not like micro SD card slot and USB 2.0 and USB slave, HDMI out, Ext volume control, orientation lock (great if you're lounging and tend to move the tablet around causing the screen to go back and forth form landscape to portrait), front and rear camera with flash on the rear and it goes on.It's much smoother and quick than I expected, installation of apps has been a breeze, customizing the user experience and appearance all easy.  Battery life is unreal!  Constant use and it's still gone 7-8 hours and had battery left.If it were priced in the iPad 2 range it would still be a great buy and still give the iPad a run for it's money.My wife who is not technically sharp and has never used an Android device has had a ball with it.  I was worried that an iPad 2 may have been a better choice, but not anymore.I also have to mention the lack of \"bloatware\".  I was surprised as the very short list of app's pre-installed.  And the Acer \"convenient interface\" actually works well, and be Android, resources are managed well leaving no issues or conflicts.BTW, I've seen some of the poor reviews knocking it for cheap construction.  I'm not sure what they bought, buy the one I have in my hand is solid and absolutely substantial.  The Alum case isn't thin and cheap, it's solid and heavy gauge and I've already mentioned the screen being Gorilla Glass.  With cutting edge technology, you'll always have the haters to the extreme on one side and fan boys to the extreme on the other side, both touting opinions that go beyond reality or logic.  You have to take that in to consideration.To keep me grounded, if I were to come up with any cons, they would be the layout of the keyboard, but I'm used to the HTC EVO 3D layout.  A second might be the lack of hard controls like you have on most mobile devices.  Both come from being used to something else.FYI, I was able to easily tether it to my phone for network access where there was no wifi and it worked great!!", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Tablet", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "RSEPMNUPU3QDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to start off by saying we are members of the Apple Chapel.

I bought an ASUS Transformer to use at work a couple months back and liked it so much that I decided to get an Android tablet for myself but I chose the Acer for a couple reasons. I like the aluminum finish better than the plastic finish of the ASUS. The A500 just feels more durable to me when compared to the Transformer. But my main reason for going with the A500 is the full size USB port built into the tablet itself. Which means you can plug all sorts of USB goodies into it like keyboards, mice, flash drives, and I haven't tried this yet but external HDDs (the external HDD has to have it's own power supply) are suppose to work as well. As far as keyboards and mice go I have used the Logitech Wireless Combo MK260 with Keyboard and Mouse (920-002950) with the A500 and both the keyboard and mouse worked flawlessly. I've tried a few random Dell and Microsoft mice and keyboards and all worked with no problems. Overall the Tablet works great. The screen looks fantastic, vibrant and super easy on the eyes. It took me a little bit to get used to the tweaks and slight differences of Honeycomb 3.2 compared to using Froyo 2.3.3 on my Droid X but it is all very easy to figure out. Its a great tablet and I highly recommend it.As some others have said the WIFI is a little weak signal strength wise but it hasn't been a problem for me yet. I've have had the wifi just stop working on me twice so far but rebooting cleared it right up. Like any computing device, it is recommended to reboot every couple of days if nothing else to clear the memory. The manual is fairly worthless and the Acer website for the most part is seriously lacking. Oh and I can't for the life of me figure out why, but Acer doesn't include a file browsing app. But luckily there are numerous file browsing apps on the market that are either free or really cheap. I use \"File Manager HD\" by Rhythm software which is free and it works great. The tablet specific apps are still a little thin on the market but most phone apps work fine with more tablet apps showing up everyday.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Love This Thing", "Author": "Anthony Ian \"anthony_ian\"", "ReviewID": "R3ATU6YSBOZD8F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's little I can add to all the tech stuff that's been covered extensively here, so I'll review it from the perspective of a first-time tablet owner.And of course, as that guy the thing foremost on your mind is: should I have gotten an iPad?  The reason I was easily talked into this vs. the iPad was the price.  Roughly around half, although now it's down to around $300, apparently.  Do I regret my decision?HELL NO.First: the one potential drawback to having a non-iPad tablet is obviously lack of iTunes.  Not a problem, though, if you have Google music or, in my case, I simply uploaded all my music to the Amazon cloud, so, ouila!  Problem solved.Highlights:-The display is beautiful-Books are wonderful to read on a 10\" display-The touch sensitivity is excellent-The variety of outputs for a tablet is pretty cool-It plays EXTREMELY well with Google, Google maps, Google mail, etc.-The Amazon Kindle application (for e-books) works flawlessly on this-Video games look stunning-It has a solid, well-built feel-It seems to pick up wireless no matter where you are with little hassle-You can attach a keyboard either via wire or Bluetooth-Typing on a tablet keyboard stinks, but you can download a \"cellphone keyboard\" app which splits the keyboard in two (like you're texting on your phone, holding the tablet on either side--i.e., thumb typing) which speeds up typing notably.  Not as fast as a keyboard, but definitely workable-Pandora and Spotify work perfectly on this thing-The battery life is great (although I don't watch a lot of video)Drawbacks:-Some video, depending on the source, can be a bit slow and/or grainy (when streaming).  This may be because it's non-HD or simply the processing speed-Some people may think it's too heavy-It is a fingerprint MAGNET.  Not sure if that's the case with all tablets, but after any session with this thing you need to wipe it down.  Perhaps a stylus is the solution.Seriously outside of that I can't think of anything to not recommend it.  As a do-everything, mid-priced tablet you really can't ask for more.  It doesn't FEEL mid-priced or lacking in any way.I don't feel like I'm missing a thing.  I will buy an iPad when I get a MacBook and want everything integrated.  Until then, this thing is just perfect.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent device, cost effective compared to others such as XOOM and iPad", "Author": "MercuryAX", "ReviewID": "R1NRKCFDN47195", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many of you know, the computing world is being infiltrated by a small horde of tablets - including the Motorola Xoom, Samsaung Galaxy Tab, and the infamous iPad 2 by Apple.  While these devices are relatively new to the market, there are a lot of choices to be had.One of these choices is the ~$400 Iconia Tab A500 by Acer, an Android tablet which delivers in style, power, and includes a competitive price tag assuming you're willing to give up a 3G mobile connection.Like many other selections out there, the Iconia sports a shiny 10.1-inch capacitive touch screen and no physical buttons to be seen in front.  It's just enough for the simple yet advanced interface of Android Honeycomb, which is at version 3.0 on startup.  On the sides, it has a volume rocker, a lock/unlock button, and a plethora of different I/O that I'll go over in a second.  The device itself feels very durable and solid, with a brushed aluminum backside featuring an Acer logo and stereo speakers.  However, a downside for some people could be the above average weight at about 25 ounces.On the inside, we have basically the same stuff as you'd find in other high-end tablets of the day.  At the machine's core is the nVidia Tegra 2 processor, which is dual core running at a standard 1GHz.  Hackers should be aware that this can be clocked much higher after installing custom software.  The Tegra 2 not only provides some snappy general performance, but impressive graphics as well.  I was surprised to see how well 3D animations rendered under Android, in games especially.  As for memory, the Iconia A500 has a gig of DDR3 RAM.  Note that I said DDR3.  Most other tablets only have DDR2, so there is a slight performance edge here.Overall, the Iconia pars with (if not supersedes) the power of all of the other popular tablets out there such as the iPad 2 or Xoom.  So, if you want performance for the price, this could be a smart buyer's choice.As for the I/O (ports for input and output), there are the basic things you expect with most tablets - including your power connector, 3.5 headphone jack, micro-HDMI port, and a microUSB port.  However, something that impressed me was the inclusion of a FULL SIZE USB 2.0 port.  This allows you to plug in all sorts of peripherals such as external keyboards, mice, and USB flash drives which will indeed allow you to manage files across Honeycomb, so long as the drive isn't formatted NTFS, although I haven't tried ext4 yet.  Mouse functionality in a touch screen device is gimmicky, I would say, but the keyboard connectivity isn't a bad idea, especially if you purchase one of those tablet cases which integrate a small keyboard.  There's also an extra microSD card slot covered by a metallic flap on the side, which can help if the tablet's internal 16GB storage (technically, another microSD) doesn't suffice for your needs.  If anything, the full size USB port is what sets this tablet apart from others in terms of sheer connectivity.Like mentioned before, the Iconia Tab runs Android 3.0 Honeycomb from stock condition.  However, you should upgrade to 3.1 and 3.2 as soon as you can (it will alert you automatically), because software compatibility and speed increase dramatically with the new and matured versions of Android.  Acer was generous enough to provide some extra software including a multimedia player, an ebook reader, and a social media app.  None of them are special, although the media player is convenient at times.  The operating system runs fast and quite smoothly, and provides a great web experience.  There's nothing quite like enjoying a browser on a touch screen this large and responsive.  There are a number of games and other apps available on the versatile Android marketplace, which you can add to yourself if you were so inclined ;  And of course, this tablet does not include a 3G connection, Wifi only, guys!Overall, I love the Iconia Tab A500, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a portable computer with a touch screen.  There is one issue I will point out though - it seems that the tablet likes to run in landscape view a lot more than portrait.  In top-down view, the whole system seems to slow down a bit, and the aspect ratio is a bit awkward, which only goes to show, the thing was meant to be held in landscape view, although you can turn it in any which way and it'll automatically adjust the screen to be right-side-up.Pros: Fast, Long battery life, Responsive touch screen, Great operating system, full USB port, costs only $400 - significantly less than competing models of equal power.Cons: Heavier than most tablets, Works much better in landscape view, no 3G connectivity.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tank-solid, 'Droid Flexible", "Author": "S.

I tend to wait a generation or two when a new bit of technology hits the market in order to give developers time to iron out the kinks (and also to let the price drop!).  However, as a bike.commuting college student, I decided that some kind of tablet PC would be a worthwhile purchase.I chose the Iconia for three reasons: first, it's Android-based, which means it has access to a nearly limitless array of apps and isn't chained to the mighty Apple juggernaut.  Second, its aluminum shell provides, at very least, an illusion of durability (mine is routinely subject to 10- and 20-mile bike trips in my backpack with only its little grey stand-case and a screen protector separating it from text books, shoes, and other dangers).  Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Iconia  has something other tablets lack: a built-in USB port (note: since I wrote this review, at least one other model has been released with a buil-in USB port, but I still think the Iconia is a winner). The MicroSD slot would have been reason #4, had I realized it had one prior to snagging the last one at a local bricks-and-mortar retailer.All of those selling points have proven themselves thus far. My tablet has come through 4,000 miles in a pickup truck, a week in the Black Rock Desert, a few hundred miles on the bike, and even use as an in-kitchen cookbook with flying colors (update: I now use my Iconia in the kitchen at least once a week, and it's still going strong!).  The USB port lets me plug in keyboards and other peripherals.  The stunning array of available apps keeps me organized, connected, and even entertained (thus far, without spending a dime).  Moreover, it doubles as an eReader and syncs seamlesly with my Google-driven life, including Google docs - so my homework and personal projects are always at hand.The Android OS, meanwhile, offers a sleek, well designed, and flexible user interface -  something I really appreciate.  It's intuitive, with only a slight learning-curve for anyone who has ever used a touch-screen device.That said, the are a few minor kinks.  I type at around 100 wpm on a standard keyboard and pretty fast even on Iconia's touch screen, and the in-browser text refresh rate can be painfully slow.  Likewise, the browser crashes more often than I'd like (update: as of 11/14/2011, this is no longer a major issue).  However, I expect future updates to sort those issues out.I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I expect years of service from this device, and I imagine the experience will only improve over time.Rarely have I enjoyed a new device as much or found one as useful as I find my Iconia.

I like how the Android that came with A500 is very close to stock. I had in mind the fullsize USB port to connect mouse, keyboard, flash drive and game controllers. On many other Android devices, even the lowest volume setting is too loud with earbuds and in-ear-monitors connected, on the A500 its just right. I had other Android tablets, but returned them and eventually settled with the Acer A500.WHY I CHOSE A500 over devices below:-Acer A100: A500 has much better WiFi signal detection, the A100 signal detection was very poor to me.-Asus Transformer: The Transformer doesn't have full-size USB port (on the device itself) nor LED flash. Transformer uses mini-HDMI, but micro-HDMI seems more common which both the A500 and my Android cellphone uses, so I didn't need to buy separate cables.-Toshiba Thrive: I really like the Thrive, it has a very slighter better screen than Acer A500 and similar amount of ports. However, it lacks the slim, aluminum design of the A500. No LED flash.LOW POINTS:-GPS antenna seems weak.-Screen quality is only average. Try a more expensive tablet if you need vibrant colors, good viewing angle and easy viewing under the sun. Check out tablets with \"IPS\" screen, also some upcoming tablets will use AMOLED screen.-Even though I have no objection for the weight, I can imagine people with fragile wrists having problem holding this device over a period of time.PET PEEVES:(I can live with these issues, but consider them as feedbacks for Acer developers.)-No file manager included (as of Honeycomb 3.1). You'll have to install one from the market.

I'm an Android fan, but I have used iPad's only because they were the best available.  Acer was the best price at the time so I snatched it up.  First, I love Honeycomb.  The multi-tasking, notifications, customization, browser, GMail app, Google Music app and on and on.  These were all great and huge improvements over the iPad.  I was pretty happy with all of those things.  However, as I looked for the same apps that I have on the iPad I found that the majority of them were not available on the Android Market.  I'm sure this will improve, but it is going to require Android to keep chipping away at Apple to get developers to make apps for both at the same time.  I noticed that there was some lag when closing out applications too.  The screen would go blank and then populate again.  I don't know if this is Honeycomb or an Acer thing.  I didn't like it and it made it feel slow.  Transferring files really didn't seem much better than using iTunes.  I still had to connect a cable, transfer the file to a directory, open the app, locate the file.  I know I could have just used a flash drive, but it is still multiple steps.  Overall though, Honeycomb has lots of potential and I'm excited to see it get even better.Now, the Acer itself.  Meh.  It's big...really big.  I'm used to an iPad 2 and this thing just feels monsterous to hold compared to it.  Some of that is because the screen sizes are different, but mostly it is just....thick.  It has rounded corners, but I found several sharp points where the metal connected.  It kept snagging on my finger as I brushed over them.  It does feel very solidly built though.  Because there are no buttons on it I kept holding it upside down.  The screen rotates so this doesn't hurt the functionality of using it, but you go to push the power button and realize it's at the bottom now instead of the top because I couldn't tell which way I was holding it.  It sounds stupid I know, but it was annoying.  The screen seemed way too dark.  I kept bumping up the brightness, but it always seemed too dark.  There was also a shimmer that I kept noticing.  It's kind of like the wavy lines you sometimes see on an old computer monitor.  I changed the background and messed around with different settings to see if it stopped, but it never did.  My wife uses an original iPad and 5 minutes with the Acer and she handed it back.  She hated everything about it.Honeycomb vs IOS is a mixed bag.  There are things to like about both of them.  Apple is simplicity personified.  Anybody can pick it up and use it.  That is its strength and its weakness.  Honeycomb takes a little digging around to get it just how you like it.  In the end I guess that is where the dividing lines are drawn.  Apple tells you how you will like it and you can't change it and for most people it works.  Android allows you to make it look and act how you want, but you have to know where to go and how to do that.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy Acer products", "Author": "pickels", "ReviewID": "RP0LD4A0L36H3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the Acer A500 in late Oct. 2011.

My sister bought one, my daughter bought one, but I wasn't ready to shell out the $500 for one quite yet.  Then, enter the Android Tablet market.  Android has been around for nearly 2 years now too, perhaps a bit more.  I bought my wife an Android phone, and we liked it.  She learned it, got used to it, learned how to do email and such on it, at least up until she dropped it and then we upgraded her to an iPhone.  For awhile she had a better iPhone than me drat it!Anyhow, back to the Iconia A500.  Acer builds a good machine.  I have a laptop by Acer that is now 3 years old and going strong, never any problems whatsoever.  So, I started looking seriously at the Android tablets made by Acer these past few months.  Along comes the A500 and I start to see \"Used\" and slightly used ones going on eBay for under $300.  A tablet with all the features of an iPad (for an engineer like me I can easily make it do a lot more than the iPad!) and it will do Kindle downloads and Barnes and Noble Nook downloads as well as Gutenberg ePub books and all - I'm all over that!I have not been disappointed in any way by the A500 either.  It's a great tablet!  It has everything, came with Honeycomb 3.2.1 installed, and it's ready to go out of the box.  I only had problems when I tried to put Firefox on it, but that clearly was not the tablet's fault.  I quickly uninstalled Firefox and now just use the pre-installed \"Browser\" (whatever it is, it is actually decent).  And it plays movies, podcasts, YouTube, does Facebook, my wife can get her GMail, and we're both very happy with it.It does categorize as one of the \"Luggable\" tablets, being at least 4oz heavier than any other tablet pretty much, but it also has an HDMI (micro or mini whatever they call it) and it has a full sized USB port on it!  As well as a (useless) dock connector.  I don't think my wife wants a dock for it, but I did at least look at external keyboards.  My wife says the on screen keyboard is adequate and she likes it.  With her usage rates, the battery lasted a week the first charge, this charge appears like we'll get more than that.  After I get a 32GB Micro-SDHC for it and give it 3x the storage it had out of the box, I think we'll be good to go.  I've already got a bit of music and some ripped video on there.  Screen is beautiful, crisp and clear for watching, responsiveness is great.  I've used slow tablets too, they are just annoying.  This one keeps right up.Dandy.  Great.

Specifically, I love the full size USB port and THE MICROSD slot!!!!! I bought the 16GB version since the microsd slot now sports a 32GB card (total is 48GB!!!!).  Further, being able to connect a regular usb keyboard to the tablet makes my laptop obsolete in many situations. Finally, it has the same Tegra processor as the more expensive brands and, unlike the Viewsonic G-Tablet, the Acer's screen is top notch.You may not think that some things like the USB port are that important but you will eventually rue the day you buy a Samsung or other brand that is missing these features.Thanks Acer.

The two devices are similar in some respects but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.  My review is based on a comparison between the two.iPad2 Pros over the Iconia:* MUCH better display than the Iconia.  Watching movies on the iPad is much nicer with its LED screen than on the Iconia which has a LCD screen.* All applications downloaded from the app store are tested to make sure they work with the iPad.  Several applications, including favorites like HBO GO, don't work on the Iconia currently.* More secure in that only approved apps from the app store can be installed without rooting the device.* Better battery life than the Iconia in my experience.Iconia Pros over the iPad2:* Significantly cheaper than the iPad2, I paid $369 for the Iconia vs $499 for the basic iPad2 with WiFi.* Better form factor and easier to hold with its landscape orientation in my opinion.  The iPad2 is a bit more awkward to hold with its portrait orientation.* Built in USB, HDMI, and SD Card ports allow you to connect the tab to any device, including a TV without having to buy special Apple hardware.* Front and rear facing cameras have a flash, which is a big plus over the iPad2.* Open Android based OS which gives more flexibility in which apps you can install.Overall, I can't say that one device is better than the other, because I think they're meant for different types of people.  As with the PC market, the general choice is between a tightly controlled apple platform that puts a lot of emphasis on style but is more expensive and less flexible and a relatively open system that gives the user more control over the device and makes it easier to integrate with more software and devices.  If I had to pick just one, I would go with the Iconia, though, primarily because of the cost and the flexibility you get with an Android device.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "this is a SUPER quality tablet - why bother with the iPad..??", "Author": "Jessy Drastic \"Jessy Drastic\"", "ReviewID": "R2CGYYQ452UKI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, who recently (due to curiousity from watching me on my iPod touch,) became addicted to playing Angry Birds & Words with Friends... He is not the biggest tech geek in the world, though. He has only owned a Mac computer, which he is so convinced is such a superior computer that he wouldn't even considering spending the money on a non-Apple computer product... So, you can understand why I was so worried to get this lower costing \"Acer\" tablet..I was so worried that I would have to hear grumbles of \"but it's not an iPad...!\" after giving this to him on X-Mas.. Well, boy was I worried over nothing...! He opened it up and literally it is now 2 weeks after, and he has not put it down except to sleep and go to work. If he didn't have to drive for his job I'm sure he'd find a way to use it there too...!I have had my iPod touch for about a year and have always loved it... So when I actually was able to pry this out of my boyfriend's hands for a few moments to check it out, I was really quite impressed. Pricewise, it is on the higher end of the tablets - but for this quality and for such a reputable company, you will get your money's worth here.. The features such as expandable memory w/SD, great front & rear facing cameras, ability to play flash; all were factors in choosing this over the iPad... We have only had one little issue with the wi-fi on a WEP encrypted wireless connection at a restaurant we go to often; but out of the box it set up and found our home network in less than 2 minutes..

I bought my A500 about 4 months ago and have never been happier with it. I research the iPad, the Motorola Xoom, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Acer A100 and the cheaper tablets from makers like Vizio and others who put on Android 2.3 or 2.2...I even really considered the HTC Flyer (because of the stylus that comes with it, and I've always been a huge fan of HTC products) after I played with it at my local Sprint store when I was having my phone repaired. When I started doing my research, I had my mind set on the iPad 2 because I thought, \"Well, I have tons of iTunes music and apps...might as well.\" I ended up buying the A500 as an early birthday present to myself after 7 weeks of research and experimentation. Nothing against the other tablets out there (especially Samsung and HTC, both of which make a great tablet), but the A500 was the best Android tablet I was able to play with in stores. I prefer the 10 inch screen over a 7 inch screen, so that was a major determining factor in my decision (just personal preference). Sure, the A500 might be a bit heavier than other tablets out there, but I don't mind that since it makes the entire tablet feel sturdy and not as flimsy as an iPad or Galaxy Tab 10.1. I've never had my A500 crash on me, my microphone has worked just fine, and Android tablet support is growing at a pretty nice rate at the moment. Overall, the entire tablet seems to respond much better than the Xoom or the Galaxy Tab 10.1, both of which seemed to have a bit of lag when I would try to switch home screen panels (the Galaxy Tab moreso than the Xoom). There are only a handful of things I don't like about this tablet though: I wish there was a way to remove the stock apps without rooting (which is common on every tablet or smartphone powered by Android), the power cable is a bit too short (could have been about 6 inches longer in my opinion) and the screen is hard to see if you're walking in direct sunlight (which is sort of annoying while trying to make last minute presentation changes while walking to class...yes, I'm a student). Some will complain that there is not a good way to really root the device or that Acer has bad support or that Acer is slower to roll out updates to the system, and they're right to a degree but that's not a major setback for me. The battery lasts for what seems forever and there are some great games available only for the tablet via the TegraZone app that is preinstalled.

All three tablets are pretty much identical in terms of CPU, GPU and RAM. The biggest differences between them are LCD and external ports.Galaxy 10.1 has the best screen among the three, it's using AMOLED which offers exceptional colors and contrast. Transform comes in second with IPS LED, which also provide excellent colors and contrast, but not as good as AMOLED. Iconia uses standard laptop LCD, which was a concern of mine.Iconia A500 screen is actually an excellent one, excellent colors, contrast and viewing angle. Black color is a challenge for all LCD screen. The only time when I notice the black or the lack of it; is in video media. Black is showing in solid black (90% black) in all other situation.For example, I was watching Prince of Persia on Netflix stream (BTW, no frame drop issue for me, Netflix stream runs perfectly), the night scene is almost unwatchable due to the black color shows as washout gray. But its HD trailer on Youtube doesn't suffer from the same effect. So it must have something to do with how video is compressed. Maybe Netflix is using a different color gamma. Colors and contrast are nice and sharp in game, web and pdf docs.If you plan to watch a lot of movies, Galaxy 10.1's AMOLED is the best option. It's almost as good as plasma. But Galaxy 10.1 lacks of ports and has no memory card reader. Iconia A500 offers a full size USB port which can be connect to many USB peripherals.This is one slippery tablet to hold, due to its glass and aluminum backing. A case stand is a must.  VERTEKS (TM) Acer Iconia Tab A500 A501 10.1-Inch Android Tablet Multi-Angle Slim-Fit Leather Folio Case Cover (Black) is an excellent one.Lastly, I'm not noticing wifi issue that some reviewers have reported. I was able to watch many hours of netflix streaming at 50% wifi signal without any frame rate dropping issue. One complaint, it comes with a 4' power adapter which can't even reach the desk from the floor.

Knox", "ReviewID": "R3A09P380X7J5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll have to agree with what others are saying here.Pros: Easily competes with the other tablets out there, and then some. The USB port comes in more handy than I (as a non gadget geek) would have thought. For kicks and giggles, it will easily accomodate anything you plug into it. I successfully used a basic Microsoft wireless mouse with it. Also,Netflix is a big bonus. I've noticed the grainy quality when the video first starts, however I can firmly say this is Netflix related, as it also happens on my wii streaming. It involves something with how Netflix downloads and streams, and SHOULD clear up fairly quickly. My third pro is the adobe compatibility. No, this isn't Acer centric, but it is in fact something that should be kept in mind. Even with some other tablets I wasn't seeing full adobe flash capabilities (and the I pad, pfft). Without adobe, or adobe lite even, your literally missing out on parts of the internet. You'll be plagued with little squares with a question mark where the content should be. However, with the adobe update, content on just about every flash/video site appears just fine.Initially I thought even Facebook app games were just too much for a tablet to handle. But alas, after some tinkering and a download of adobe air, I had access to these games and apps as well (although, its a bit of a lag but nothing significant.)As for the cons: I'm likely nitpicking here, but this tablet certainly is not the lightest. But as I heard from another user-\"if the weight is a problem for you, you probably should work out a little more.\" In the Iconia's defense, it has a darn good reason which is the USB port. And in all honesty, it does not make that much of a difference. Sure, it can't be tossed around like a xoom or I pad, but it isn't any heavier feeling than the Toshiba thrive or Asus.I don't crave simplicity, but, the UI is fun but also a little more complex than I would like. It takes all sorts of maneuvers, holds, clicks and dras-which is fine aside from one thing-theresna very limited amount of instructions out of the box, leaving me to sit and tinker around with it.Although mice do in fact work, mine was a tad slow. I changed the battery, and it still lagged behind my movements.The keyboard is bordering on too sensitive. If I am just slightly off of a letter, it will type them both. However, I can get around that with practice and I believe there are other keyboards to be downloaded.All in all, I initially feared not going with the thrive or Asus, but I don't regret this purchase at all. I think Acer got the concept of a tablet right. Is it as functional as a laptop? No. Does it do more than an ipad or even one of its competitors? Yes.I got mine at about $370 total although at some point one could get a new one for much less. I easily would spend the average market price of 400 for this, as it might not be perfect (yes, I did experience a force close), but its probably a tablet best kept secret. There isn't any Hipster marketing Ad campaign for it, but trust me, if there was, it would probably be selling a lot more than it is now.Update 9/17/12--Something happened. I blame Android but then again I am not tech savvy. As of ICS update, and the one before (I cannot recall, a minor 3.x.x) my tablet is slow and freezes constantly. I don't know why. I have rebooted, reset, everything.

And quite frankly, it still sort of is. I was deciding between this or the Asus Transformer (mainly for its laptop like dock).Why I love this:-It runs Android and I've been an Android user since the very beginning (Yes, I was one of the first with a G1 - the FIRST google phone). Why is this a plus? It's a plus because it  means my knowledge of apps transfers to my tablet. My paid apps from my phone can also be downloaded onto the tablet for free and I know about apps such as WiFi File Explorer in which I can transfer things between my tablet, phone, and laptop wirelessly.-HDMI Port - this allows me to connect my tablet to my HDTV. Not that I really need a connection since you can wirelessly connect it to your television as well. But sometimes it's easier to just stick my HDMI cable into both devices to connect them.-A great substitute for my laptop - I have a bluetooth keyboard that allows me to connect my tablet to my keyboard (although to be honest, a USB keyboard works just as well.) The tablet's super light and the battery life lasts very long. This is great for me to take to class and take notes with AND allows me to carry my books along with me. Seriously, carrying a 6 LB laptop all day long with notebooks and other things has been taking a toll on my back. I take notes with some word like processor apps (they were free in the Amazon App Store). It's also great for reading powerpoint slides. I simply swipe my finger to move slides and it's hard to get distracted by the internet when it takes up my entire screen.-IT HAS FLASH! Flash is NOT a dead platform. Flash is wonderful - I can't imagine what it feels like to have an iPad and want to watch videos on sites like megavideo or Hulu (for free) just to be denied access. And yes, you can stream things like Amazon prime instant videos (Flash is damn lovely, ain't it?)-Android Marketplace for Tablets: Like I stated before, my knowledge of apps helps me to use this for almost everything in everyday life. I've even printed a paper while sitting inside my car outside of my house so I could run in and grab it before leaving for school. However, I'll admit. There is a CON with this. Apple's marketplace for Apps is still superior to Androids. But being a native Android user - I've seen Android's market develop over the years to become quite competitive (there's tons of mobile apps - not so much native tablet apps). It's only a matter of time before more and more apps get released. But most of the apps I have, even if they're mobile will blow up and fit on the screen. Some won't but most will. To this day, I have over 1,000 apps - I've only spent 2 bucks on all my apps.CON:-Camera Quality: The camera quality does not blow me out of the water. It reminds me of what having a camera phone 6 years ago would be like. That being said, I don't video chat on it (that's what I have a laptop for) but I have recorded lectures before on it. The mic is ok but the video quality makes it seem like I filmed the lecture with a potato.-Bloatware - there's tons of bloatware on this thing which can only be uninstalled when it's rooted.This isn't really a con, but I'd like to mention that the first tablet I got ended up being non-responsive to touch at times. I think it was a problem with the tablet itself (Amazon let me return that one and exchange it for a brand new one). I have not had that problem again.Overall, I have to say that I love this thing. I guess it's harder to learn than an iPad (or at least harder to teach my mom how to play with it).P.S. I'm not 100% sure about this but I think the screen is made out of gorilla glass?

The Iconia is a huge step up from that--it's very fast and responsive (not to mention a lot of fun to use).It's very handy for web browsing and checking email.  I recently rooted and upgraded to a custom Honeycomb 3.2 image, and with the right patches, I can now watch Netflix instant streaming.The current batch of Android tablets aren't quite ready to replace a laptop, but with an external keyboard (I use the Logitech Tablet Keybord for Android 3.0+), they come reasonably close.  I use my tablet for taking notes (even with the software keyboard) and writing my agendas for the Webelos den that I lead.  With the keyboard and the right apps, you can even view and edit most Office documents, as well.I'm really glad I bought this tablet!", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE it", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R2F39TLHGTMJ5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Android device. My first one, the Le Pan tablet, lasted less than a month. It was way too slow and couldn't multitask. Top that with constant crashing, I sent it back. Needless to say, I was skeptical about buying any tablet after that until I ran across this one. I try to base my computer buying on customer reviews, this tablet had the fewest so I took a gamble and bought it. I've only had it a few days but I love it enough to write this review, 5 star.It boots up quick enough and doesn't take long too mount the external micro SD card that I put in. About 1 minute total time from power up. The menu buttons and layout are great and easily readable.I can run far more than I ever could with the Le Pan, multitasked or not. Any games, other than the SNES AD emulator do run.Rooting the device was very easy, if your so inclined to do so. Even with the latest Acer Android update (doesn't break it). As far as Acer/Android updates, they are fairly up to date, and are only a couple sub versions below the current version of Android.Battery life could be better but is long enough. Given the horsepower behind the screen, this isn't surprising at all. Charging is quickish, considering the long battery life. The Le Pan tablet would take upwards of 4-5 hours to charge, this takes a couple.As far as weight and design, it's another 5 star. It's light given the power this tablet can unleash. The case is easily hand held and doesn't cramp my hands like a skinnier tablet does. More so it doesn't want to slip out of my hands, like the Le Pan tablet constantly did.The ability to use USB is a huge plus, I have no doubt this will be big in the future. Also it has an LED flashbulb, which can easily be doubled as a flash light using a widget or program. Helpful if your stumbling around late at night.My only con here, is that the reset button is recessed and requires a paperclip or pen to push. I don't see it being a problem unless the system becomes unstable for whatever reason.I will definitely update this review if I have any problems", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "high portability. very useful for traveller.

Speaking of software, I can see the potential of becoming better tools in the future. android OS is growing fast. Yes, some application might have few bugs on it. occasional crash might happened but I can live with it as the developer continue to release new patch. Lots of FREE apps available on the market.As for the hardware, WIFI is going strong. no signal drop for me. touchscreen material using the highest quality gorilla glass which is scratch resistant but not scratch proof. I recommended getting screen protector for fingerprint resistant.battery life is about 6 hours. GPS is another extra which I found myself not really useful if you don't have someone on your side to look into. plus the screen is a bit difficult to see under bright sun. the stock GPS software which is google based navigation is great because it provide turn by turn navigation and speak street name. the caveat is it doesn't store the maps unless you pre-cache the area before you go. If you do this, it will cache up to 10 miles radius. I found it is too much hassle. I recommended to get sygic aura GPS. it provide offline navigation, great features and fast GPS lock.speaker is okay and as expected. Just plug into your external sound system if you want to get better sound.Camera is not the highest quality I ever seen. My 2 years old sony laptop camera can get better picture. but it is pretty handy to have for example you can scan QRcode or barcode using your camera. video chat also possible.Hulu streaming currently is not available for android platform but acer said it will be available soon. You can make it possible by rooting your tablet and it is risky. I found every time android release new OS version, the patch for rooting also immediately become unusable. I would rather to wait till the official release or you can download 3rd party software that can handle hulu streaming such as playon if you don't mind paying premium service.update 9/19/2011:I bought screen protector from handhelditems for $5 bucks. Bad quality. I suggest avoid this reseller at all cost. It is cheap but the material is so thin and fragile. in my case, damage on arrival and handhelditems has ridiculous return policy. better to buy something like invisible shields with wet applicator.as for the camera software goes, I highly recommended to install lighbox camera apps. definitely stunning result. the software able to hide/fix the imperfection of the camera.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why I love my Acer A500 tablet", "Author": "D. Struble", "ReviewID": "R3COA8INHFED48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Acer A500 tablet for 4 weeks and love it.  I am new to Android so am learning its traits.  Pretty easy to pick up but there are probably nice features I haven't yet discovered.What I like about the tablet:1. The monitor is brighter and sharper than my laptop that has a premium monitor.2. Nice size for handling and viewing.3. It is a comfortable weight.  Not as bad as I was expecting from comments comparing it to the iPad.  Much, much better than lugging the laptop especially when you want to check something while watching TV.4. The virtual keyboard is easier to use than I expected.  Nice size.5. The full-size and mini USB ports.  I haven't needed to use the mini-HDMI port but I am glad it is there for future use.6. Long battery life.  Not as long as the iPad but plenty long enough for me.7. The free Kindle app.  I like this better than my wife's Kindle.  While this can't compete in bright daylight, it needs no secondary lighting for reading at night.  It offers three different viewing backgrounds, white, sepia and black.  Haven't tried it but the black might work in bright sunlight.8. THE SLINGBOX APP!!  This is sweet.  For those who don't know Slingbox gives you access to your TV/DVR anywhere there is internet.  I have used this for years on my laptop from my back deck daily and when we travel.  The picture on the Acer is more crisp than the older Slingbox t was on my laptop.  In order to use ion the tablet I had to upgrade to the newer Solo and load it to my laptop. Sling gives a $50 discount for upgrade.  Solo upgrade is $139 delivered.  The cost of the app for the tablet is $30. The Slingbox rep warned me that the app hasn't been optimized for tablets yet.  I have found it to be excellent on our home wireless.  It may lose something on 3G.What I would like to see or improved:1. I would like to be able to view two windows simultaneously as I can with the laptop.2. 3G.  I have to buy a card/drive but the upside is I should be able to move it to my laptop when needed.3. The Microsoft Office app, QuickOffice Pro, seems pretty weak from my first exposure.  I need to study it.  Hopefully it is a learning curve issue, but if the functionality is there, it sure isn't obvious or intuitive to this Android neophyte.4. More 3.0 apps.No comment on the built-in cameras.  I haven't used them yet because that is not why I bought a tablet.Bottom line:  I am glad I spent months researching all available tablets and waited until the Honyecomb 3.0 OS became available.  For what I was looking for, the Acer 500 was the obvious choice.  It has exceeded my expectations.  I rate it 5 stars.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned the Xoom and kept the Acer", "Author": "California Papa", "ReviewID": "R3IF6BZT20AWV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited a month to write the review.  I got the Acer from Amazon and the Xoom from Costco (so I could return it up to 90s day later).  I am returning the Xoom and keeping the $150 in my pocket because I see absolutely no advantage to the Xoom, and many to the Acer.  Many people have written great reviews so I will just summarize my experience.  I love it and the Acer extra features and price advantage sold me.No, this new Android OS is not perfect and I know there will be some tweaks, but I am blown away at the freedom I have of setting up 5 different desktops or device home pages.  The Android apps from the Android store proved there is more than I will ever need or want already available, and most are free.  Some did not work right and are written for phones so I just installed them.  However, everyday more come out written for the tablet OS to take advantage of the larger screen.  So software wise, I have no complaints other than I cannot watch Netflix YET but no big deal, I have a TV with internet accessable DVD player and my computers to watch those movies online.This is not a laptop but I have to tell you with the USB port on the ACER, you can plug in external storage and a keyboard if you want to do some serious typing instead of the touch pop up screen keyboard.  On top of that, I found on Ebay from China a case with a built in keyboard and short USB cord for the tablet for $30 and it is incredible.  I now have laptop capability and convenience in a smaller lighter package so when I travel now, no more laptop, just my tablet and the carry notebook like case with the built in keyboard.  Want to see that case, go to Ebay and search on Acer Iconia Keyboard and check out one that says \"Leather Case\".  I love this keyboard for fast replies and sending email.Many have listed the differences between Ipads and Xoom so I won't repeat that.  I will say they are real and I could not be happier with my purchase.  I was a little disappointed with the Acer dock in that it did not come with a power supply and did not have a separate HDMI output requiring you to use them from the tablet, but I like the remote control (something not available with Xoom) and it also makes the table a digital picture frame while always keeping it charged up and read for 10 hours or so of full use when you unplug.Last, the Xoom has its power port on the bottom which is a pain to have it on a stand and charging (maybe Motorola did that to make you but one of their two charger docks) but Acer wisely put it on the side so you can plug it in easily while sitting on any stand.  Also the Motorola one looks like it would be very easy to break though their adapter has a very long cord compared to the short one that Acer provides.  But really, I don't use the table plugged in to the wall anyway so cord length is not a problem with me.Only hardware weird thing is what I read others have experienced too.  The screen flashes on then off everyonce in a while for no apparent reason.  Just weird and makes no sense.  I am sure Acer will fix it with their first update to the OS in 3.1.So buy it and enjoy it and forget about the more expensive guys unless you need cell service.

I would have given it 4 stars cause I know they can do better in making a tablet. 1GB seems so small to me for RAM, and honeycomb needs more apps. But so far I have enjoyed this so much. It has made me use my computer less. I wasn't sure if this was just going to be a big Angry Birds Device. But for keeping up with everything this is an awesome device. I like the fact that I can sync everything I do with my phone. I also love the portability compared to a laptop.Also for business owners like me, this makes things so much easier to showcase my work.Of course there is going to be a better device coming, but this should suffice for 2 years until tablets have matured fully and prices drop.Also, comparing it to an iPad is useless, right now app-wise iPad wins.

The Acer had great reviews as did the Asus. so it was a toss up.So I bought the Acer as the Acer laptop I had for years was a good sturdy product. I have had the Tablet for a week and I learned a very important lesson. Tablets can not be updated or upgraded like desktops or laptops. They are upgraded by downloads from the manufacturer. Always make sure you have a great connection for these downloads. Because if there is a problem you will not know until too late. What happpens is the tablet will lock up and will not respond to any input. You cant format or over write corrupted files. You can only send it back and have the manufacturer fix it. No problem with the warranty. Acer does not honor its warranty with out the serial number, which can only be accessed from the settings page on the tablet. Of coarse with a dead tablet no luck. Rite down your serial number when you first start your tablet and save it in a safe place. Otherwise you better find an expert who can fix it.

I bought it based on how impressed I was with a friends ASUS tablet. While I do love my iPhone and other Apple products, I really didn't need a tablet and didn't want to spend the money on an iPad. This brought me to the Acer. I should also say this is my first experience with anything Android.Things I like:The screen size is perfect for viewing video and reading.Love the ability to put a micro SD in to expand storage.Believe it or not, this thing takes pretty good pictures and video.Of course, I love the ability to sink my gmail account with the device.Navigation is a breeze!!Very easy to adjust settings.Love using the Iconia for recipes and cooking! Perfect kitchen companion! Easy to glance down and read.Things I'm not so fond of:The keyboard is easy to use but has its downsides. For instance, I am a touch typist and don't have to look at the keyboard. On this I can only type using index fingers and constantly hit the N key when I want the space bar. No way could I touch type with it.I also find it to be a bit slow when surfing the net. Once a page is loaded, its fine. Loading is just a bit slow.I have 3 different browsers installed and they all crash at one point or another. The pre-installed browser is still the best and almost never crashes.The Android marketplace isn't quite up to snuff with Apples. I find the apps you do pay for to be more expensive and just not all that great. The free ones (Angry Birds for example) are stuffed with ads! I realize that's what makes them free but I'd like a \"pay with no ads\" option. If you are an app-a-holic, the Droid marketplace will be disappointing. Additionally, certain apps haven't converted to Honeycomb for the Android tablets so they don't come up full screen. Why are they in the marketplace?Overall, I feel that the Android OS is still young and needs refinement. This is a great piece of equipment and I'm sure as the OS updates, it will get better. If you want a tablet but don't want to spend a ton of money, this might be the one for you. I use it daily and am enjoying it so don't be misled by the rating.

You can read that in the description.Love this thing. Works FAST and very well. The 3.1 honeycomb is due to arrive next week so things should only change for the better.My wife has an Ipad and I can compare the two and I LIKE THIS BETTER. This FEELS sturdier with a brushed aluminum back.  True the Ipad is thinner, runs well, has lots of apps and best of all it works. However something I've always found distastful with Apple products is that if APPLE didn't think of it chances are you aren't getting it because of its limited expandability. Not true with Android products, and this Iconia is no exception, in fact it has great expandability with ports built in that others put only in the docking station. There is a price to be paid though, Its not as sexy looking as the Ipad. Oh, its a pretty machine but it is a little thicker and a little heavier (I didn't notice until my wife pointed it out). The screen is stunning (just like the Ipad) with nice wide viewing angles (it is an IPS panel). Works fine right out of the box. All you have to do is link it to your G-Mail account (don't have one... its simple to set up). Google has really got this down and it sets up and syncs all your devices so cloud computing is already a reality here. Make a change on your android phone it is automatically synced to your tablet and computer. Try using Google Docs. Great stuff. You can even print to your home networked printer. The games that come with it are true arcade quality (and not demo mode). Love Need For Speed. Much better than the Ipad games I've seen.The good:Lots of options.FAST!Great processor and lots of RAM (1gig vs Ipad 512meg)Stunning screenI didn't need the manual (online downloadable). I just played with it a while.Beautiful aluminum backSturdy constructionNice software with it (love some of the games).The bad (I'm really being nitpicky)Lots of fingerprints on the screen. (same with Ipad)USB port didn't support a mouse but does support keyboard. (3.1 out next week is going to change this).Found that the app for multimedia play didn't see my expanded micro card and had to download another player that did. (again this is supposed to be corrected with 3.1)Only comes with 16gigs (just upgrade with an additional 32gig and have 48 total)Acer sync though works very well but is not as simple as ITunes. But...  it allows you to tweak it more. ITunes is frustrating when something goes wrong and sometimes impossible to fix.In conclusion I would buy this in a heartbeat again. Just love it.UPDATE 7/6/2011Two updates came through yesterday and today upgrading my tablet to Honeycomb 3.1.The changes anticipated work now. The original media player now recognizes the additional memory. Now you can take those little things out of the \"bad\" list. Works like a champ. Also finding more apps changed to support tab computing. I LOVE THIS THING.Another thing: A HAVE TO HAVE APP is the SWYPE keyboard. Download and install it. You won't be sorry. It is in BETA format now (tablet version) but works great. You have to find it on the web and not in Android Market. Many of us have used the SWYPE keyboard on our Android phones.... now you can get it for the Iconia tab. It can be used as a full sized keyboard or a mini keyboard.

Try as I might, every Android phone I've had has been a huge disappointment. Sorry, Droid Heads, iPhone is king for a reason. With that said, I recently switched back to a desktop because my video and graphics work typically slows a laptop down to the point of driving me bonkers. Still, I needed something portable and convenient that also had a screen big enough for web browsing and watching streaming video on the go. I also wanted full e-reader functionality. I was leaning towards a Nook Tablet or low end laptop but the former was a little too stripped down for my needs and the latter would mean dealing with a second Windows PC (one is quite enough, thanks). Sensing that a new iPad was coming at some point in 2012, I wasn't going to drop a pretty penny on the current model and then have it outmoded six months from now. After doing a ton of research and having such great luck with Acer flat screens, I purchased the A500 a few weeks ago. On every level it has exceeded even my best expectations. It is exceptionally well made and very sleek/sexy. The touch screen is bright, responsive, colors are brilliant and images are crisp and sharp. The Nvidia Tegra2 processor is lightening fast and even though I am not a big tablet/phone gamer (I'm an Xbox guy on that front) I have been blown away by the graphics and game play on the HD games (a couple of which come free on the tablet). Some of the reviews here are outdated...Netflix works just fine on the A500 and the free Netflix app has been flawless since I downloaded it. I use the Dolphin HD browser (another free download) for a truly desktop-like web experience. If you want to have even more fun, buy a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable (they are less than $10 here on Amazon) and connect the tablet to a big screen. I use mine with a 32\" Sony Bravia and the image is eye popping. In fact, the HD image quality of a movie I rented in the Android market was as good as the HD from my Xbox, Hulu+ and Apple TV. Sound quality is remarkable for a tablet at this price point and even more incredible with headphones plugged in. The only slight disappointment is a so so still camera but I'm not using this to replace my Nikon. If you want a first class tablet for less than $400 that actually gives the iPad a run for its money, you'll be a happy camper with the excellent entry from Acer.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "One of the best tablets on the market", "Author": "M-Family", "ReviewID": "R35EEIGTTTGA4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried different tablets before purchasing the Acer.

The body of the tablet is made of a durable aluminum construction no cheap plastic here. This is a superior tablet that is well designed and thought-off; as one of the hardware features a full USB bus which is hard to find on tablets, the Iconia has really all the goodies. I tried some USB mouse and keyboards and they all worked flawless.Software:Apps are almost all free and if you need something special you might find it for a small price. There is a abundance available and I was truly amazed not to see to many errors actually very few and the ones that had some little glitches I uninstalled, easier than Windows; just drag the app to the trash-can and done.Excel, Word and PowerPoint documents are working perfect with Documents To Go Full Version from DataViz. As well desktop access moving files back and forth worked like a charm with Wifi File Transfer Pro all transfers are fast of course depending on your connection; nevertheless the Iconia was never the bottleneck all by all there were no bottlenecks. Another app that I liked is HeyWire which is an SMS text messenger all that combined with Astro File Browser and AVG Anti-virus free as well and I was ready to roll.Music - Pictures - Streaming Video and web browsing are part of this great experience and all work as well as on a fast desktop computer; amazing the way technology is moving.I would not hesitate to highly recommend this high-end Acer Iconia to anyone on a quest finding a tablet.I have no relationships in any shape or form with any of the brand names mentioned above.I'm very pleased with the Acer Iconia and will update this review because time will tell the story of consistency and reliability.Roland", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "MV \"MV\"", "ReviewID": "RH9WA94W6CAZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just one word - Amazing!

It has the NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GPU and a Multi-Touch Display.4) HDMI port (support Dual Display) uses the same HDMI Female to Micro HDMI Male Adapter I carry for my EVO HDMI output - easy viewing on any HDTV using existing HDMI cable.5) Android Honeycomb is great, and updates are OTA via WiFi connection.6) I use Google applications like Gmail, Picasa, Docs, Maps, Youtube, etc., and the it is excellent.

Having read Amazon reviews on several tablets and knowing exactly what I wanted I settled on Acer Iconia A500 and bought one with Staples $100 off coupon this past weekend.I am not a tech savvy person, but after playing it for a while after turning it on for the first time I got most of what I needed. Boy, I am very happy that I have purchased this model! It's super fast openning apps and browsing the web, no more waiting time turning it on and off, unlike those window-based laptop and desktop computers I have to wait for minutes for it to turn on and off.I have tried this tablet's front and back cameras taking pictures and making videos, and I am very impressed by its speed playing and replaying videos. Downloaded a few apps, super fast installation and as easy as installing apps on iphones. The android operating system is awesome, very intuitive and fast as you type or search things. This tablet's sound and display/picture quality are excellent! Every google app are super smooth and fast - google maps are just incredible comparing to my iphone or my garmin gps maps! Personally speaking this tablet feels light and is just the right size for me.The best part is watching films on web, with wireless connection and after installing Flash, I can watch full length films and videos just like using my laptop and desktop computers. My daughter watched her favorite segment of \"prince of egypt\" on Youtube and played a few games on this tablet, and she loved it! This tablet does all the jobs I have expected only faster and better!!!I have received micro HDMI cable from Amazon. After hooking up to my HDTV, it automatically played full screen youtube videos on HDTV without maximizing to full screen on Iconia - I really like it.All web pages picture quality on my HDTV via the micro HDMI are excellent, crispy clear, very impressive! Depending on website some videos have poor resolution and would constantly freeze up, could be buffering, signal (two bars on wireless signal), or some other problems, it's annoying. Again it totally depends on the website you use, because some films would play fairly well without issues, and youtube's videos always have the best picture quality and play smoothly. Sound quality is excellent on my HDTV via the micro HDMI connection.

Any discussions with Acer will not get you anywhere. Their standard response is that it has to be a \"warranty issue\". In which case, I would just return the tablet. The second issue which really is bad is that the tablet ships with a gray leather case that has an integrated bluetooth keyboard. This case is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. Sure you can use it to type assuming it does not collapse on you. also, if you are using the touch screen on the tablet while using this stand, you will always be touching the keyboard, assuming of course that the the tablet does not collapse when you touch it.

Overall I am happy I decided to use this one instead of buying a Kindle as the larger screen and homepage icons are easier to use for my purposes.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "OUTSTANDING TABLET!!!!!", "Author": "Ricknav", "ReviewID": "R3CZHPT35VDL4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this device for about a year now and it does everything i want and more.1st off full size USB that will play anything you plug into it (wireless mouse, full keyboard or your portable Harddrive****).2nd Micro HDMI the plugs straight into your TV and the picture quality Awesome for a tablet (crisp and looks better on TV than the tablet).3rd I just bought a wireless controller from Gamestop and it work great as i played Shadow Gun 2 mutiplayer with no issue once i configured the controls.I love this device and took a Galaxy Tab 2 back to Best Buy because it just fell short when it comes to peripherals.Apple IPAD 1, 2, and 3 just didn't measure up except for the zillion apps they have but that all cost money.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "So glad I bought it!!", "Author": "Rafster", "ReviewID": "R2UDM4A7513Y06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet a year ago (2011).  I shopped around and looked at all the stats; speeds, weight, memory, etc, etc, and I finally settled on the Acer A500, and I haven't regretted it.  I am SO glad I got this. I got the 16g and bought the 16g sd card to go with it.  It has not let me down.  It may not be as fast as the Ipad or a few of the other tablets out there, but, it's functional, durable, speed is acceptable, ease of use is outstanding.  Both cameras work very well, and I haven't had any problems with the wi-fi usage.  The battery can last me a whole day, sometimes, it charges very quickly, and streaming Netflix is not a problem as long as there's a good signal.  I really liked the USB and SD card ports.  Downloading was a breeze, but, you will have to get a file manager app to move your media from the internal drive to the SD card/flash dive and vice versa.  On the downside, it is a bit heavier than the other tablets.  It's also a bit thicker...not as slender as the Ipad, so, there's some weight.  also, there aren't too many protective covers or accessories out there for it (or there weren't when I first got it).  I started experiencing problems with the picture turning off, then quickly coming back on, but, I DO lend the tablet to my teenage son, whom I'm sure have have dropped it a few times (and the 1 or 2 times I've done that as well), so I attribute that to my clumsiness, not to a bad product.  Overall, I'm very happy with the Acer A500.  And because of this tablet, I'm looking for an Acer Laptop as well.  I rated this 4 stars.  I would of given it 5, but, deducted the 1 star because of weight.

Second, I'm not super picky, so what I might find acceptable, others might not.I got this tablet refurbished on eBay, with a bundled extended warranty from Square Trade. I got the refurb because I couldn't justify paying a huge amount of money for something that I wanted, but didn't really need.I've had this tablet for a few months, and I've really had a lot of fun with it.  In fact, if I ever replace this tablet, I'll probably get aother Acer.The following are what I consider to be the pros and cons.Pros:1.  The size of the screen is just right.  Anything smaller would feel more like a smart phone, and I already have one of those.2.  It's very speedy.  Of course, that's probably because I haven't loaded it down with pictures and videos.3.  It has the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and I love it.  In fact, I like eBay much better on the tablet than I do on the laptop. On the Tablet, the time shows up as the time in my region, not the \"military time\" that eBay shows.  That drives me crazy.  Also, it's easier to bid on the tablet.4.  Most of the apps I've downloaded, work very well with this tablet, even though many of them are aimed at a smart phone.  So far, only one live wallpaper has not done well on the tablet.5.  The screen adjusts to the light source, and I appreciate that, too.6.  With the proper app, I can send things to my printer.7.  I love the fact that it has a regular-sized USB port, in addition to a micro USB.  I've used that feature quite a lot.8.  I can access my SD card for pictures, videos, and documents.  I was going to get the Sony tablet until I found out that you can't do these functions with an SD card on the Sony.9.  I had absolutely no problems setting up my wifi and e-mail.10. I don't watch many videos on this tablet, but when I accessed Amazon Prime Instant Videos, I didn't have any problems with connecting, and the videos played just fine.Cons:1. It takes awhile to get the thing turned on!  I have to hold the power button down for about seven seconds before it comes on, and that seems like a long time.  Fortunately, it doesn't take that long to turn it off.2.  When I turn the tablet on, I never know if it will connect immediately with my WiFi, or not.  Sometimes I have to go into Settings and connect it, while other times I don't.3. I wish it was lighter, because I'd like to be able to carry it in my purse, but I think the tablet would be too heavy for that.  However, if I had to sacrifice quality for weight, I'd keep the weight.Now a few words about support for a refurbished Acer.  If you bought yours new, you don't need to read any further.I found out that Acer itself doesn't provide support for a refurb.  I found that out when I was having problems getting back into my e-mail after I changed passwords. When I called Acer, they referred me to the company that supports the refurb. I got hold of a tech who told me that I would need to do a factory reset, and she gave me a long, complex method for doing this.  When I couldn't get the tablet to do a reset, I was told that I would need to send it in.Before doing that, I did a little more digging around in my settings, and I found a button that I could click for a reset!  Why didn't the tech support person know about this easy, simple way to do it?  Anyway, I did the reset, thus avoiding having to send the tablet in, and my e-mail problem was solved. Needless to say, that experience didn't make me feel very confident in contacting them again. Hopefully, I won't have to do that too many times. If I do, maybe I'll get a better tech.  Sometimes it's the luck of the draw.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I want one for myself", "Author": "Daniel Abbate", "ReviewID": "R30FML7A2J5IO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely love this Tablet.

So this review is from the point of view of someone who is pretty new to this technology.  However, I am very happy with my tablet which I have had for about 3 weeks.  What I like:  it turns on and powers up quickly.  It connects to the internet almost immediately with no fuss in the various places I have used it. The sound and display are great.  However, the tablet is a bit heavier than I expected and can be difficult to hold comfortably while using it unless you prop it up in some way.  It is also very smooth and slick.  I am getting a silicone skin to put on it which may help with holding it and having it not slide around.  I don't know if I am qualified to judge the battery life, but I'm always surprised when I check the % left and it always seems to be smaller than I expected.  Also, I got a mini-sd card (16 gb) as others have suggested to \"double\" the storage, but be aware that you can't really move apps to the sd card on this tablet, even though I've tried more than 1 app that promised to be able to do this.  I did get a file manager app and when I have time to play with it, I'm hoping to move other things, like files and pictures to the sd card, but I haven't had a chance to figure out how to do this yet.

It was getting to the point where she needed her own computer because her course work was online.  I gave her the choice of a laptop or a tablet.  Guess what she chose?  The Android was perfect in that much of her course work was flash-based (iPad would not do).  It was a toss up between the Asus Transformer and the Acer Iconia.  They are both about the same price; Honeycomb taking full advantage of the 10\" screen; about the same functionality as the Xoom at a fraction of the price.  Iconia had the full-size USB port, ready for an inexpensive keyboard or USB mem stick.  So, that was the clincher (no additional adapter needed).The first tablet in the house.  The kid(s) love it. Freebie/apps games galore.  Honeycomb updates to 3.2; it's a pleasure to use.  Acer also seems to be keeping things up to date, cleaning up any bugs and such.  Since I've had the device for about a week, they've provided 4 OS updates.  The Iconia really feels like a quality device with well-integrated HW features.  Android is the OS to use if you really want a stand-alone device.  iPads make you go through that horrible iTunes PC app (I have an iPhone).  This was important because because I wanted to it the be a real productivity device.Many, here, have written about the nice feature.  So let me also mention a few caveats to note when buying a honeycomb device.  Well honeycomb is relatively new so there are a limited number of apps that will take advantage of the full-size screen.  When it comes to productivity apps such as office apps (wordprocessing, spreadsheet, and presentation), it falls short a bit.  There's Quick Office HD ($20), which is adequate, but I wouldn't say it's fully capable, either.  That seems to be it.  Other full-function office apps are just not up to par at all.  Most are just cheap converts from Froyo-based apps.Another thing I completely failed to consider was the printing solution.  There's no built in printing facility; in fact, it seems to be and after thought altogether. But there are several app-based solutions that require setting up another app on PC.  Then it would be able to wirelessly print through the PC.  Google recently deployed Cloud Print which will wait for vendor to adopt their protocol directly into printers, otherwise PCs are required as a proxy.  Some vendors have their own solutions, such as HP's iPrint.  But, in general, in order to do stand-alone printing, I would have to purchase one of those special printers.  Meantime, I do have to pay for an app that supports Cloud Print (maybe about $10-$15) and print through the PC.  (haven't done it yet)These shortcomings are understandable given that honeycomb/android is pretty new and I fully expected some early adopter issues like that.  I expect the offerings will improve significantly in another year.All-in-all, we are very happy with the Android tablet purchase.  It's very capable and there are enough apps and eye candy to keep us happily tapping away.Also, a shout out to our Amazon shop, Optimus-Shop, for terrific service.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I still love it after 6 months", "Author": "C.

The buttons feel solid, as does the construction and while you can see the gaps between panels, they don't feel like they will open up after the usual wear and tear. The materials are very good and the glass is solid, though prone to smudge marks.The viewing angles are not bad and better than a netbook. My girlfriend was sitting next to me on the couch and could see what was on the screen without having to lean over. The display is crisp and nice on the eyes. Both cameras are adequate, but I can't see myself using it as a regular point and shoot, it's too big for that. You definitely want a screen protector for it just for the fingerprint smudges alone. This is a problem on all tablets I've used without screen protectors.I'm no stranger to Android, but new to a tablet version of Honeycomb. It's quick and all the functions are intuitive. If you're new to Android in general, it might take a little getting used to, but it will come quick.So far 7/10. I'll be able to judge battery and video better when I have more time with it.EDIT: I have had the tablet for two weeks. So far, so awesome.I downloaded GTA III which is a very intense game and an extremely big game. This tablet handles it just fine. I have about 5 widgets running on my screens and it handles those fine whereas my phone doesn't like too many running at once. I love all the inputs. The USB works flawlessly, as does the HDMI out. There isn't too much bloatware on the tablet and those that are pre-loaded seem useful for those that want them, unlike a blockbuster app and stuff I won't use that came on my phone.I really get into GTA III and find myself pressing harder on the screen during those intense action missions. The Iconia has stood up well to my gamer abuse. This says volumes about it's construction.

Wu", "ReviewID": "R3JJA8COWMB8UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just picked this up during one of the Amazon lightning sales and I must say that my initial impressions of the A500 are very good! Like with my other android products, I decided to make it a bit more lean and maximize my control over it by first rooting it and slapping on a ROM with the bloat disabled/removed. From a student's perspective, I'll list what the pros and cons of the A500 I've found so far:Pros:1. Good ppt rendering: One of my biggest concerns about getting a tablet was whether or not it could correctly display ppt slides. Of the ppts I've downloaded so far,QuickOfficeHD and Officesuite were able to render it well and is virtually identical to a desktop version. I've seen maybe one or two formatting errors where a letter is entered on the next line. No biggie in my opinion. In comparison to a friend's Ipad2, I would say that the A500 has far fewer errors (many slide pictures weren't rendered on the Ipad).2. HDMI mirroring: This is extremely useful for sharing presentations or collaborating in a study room equipped with HDTVs. I just used a micro HDMI cable and easily put ppts and notes on the big screen for my study group to see. Officesuite even lets me use digital pens to highlight or draw on slides. I've also played a few games on the TV and they look stunning.3. Full-sized USB Port: This is mentioned so many times already by other reviewers, but I want to again emphasize that this is so useful! I have a wireless Logitech keyboard and mouse attached to a unifying receiver and it works flawlessly with the A500. I found this useful for taking notes or writing e-mails when there's a lot of text to be entered. Android 3.2 also support NTFS formatting, so I was able to easily read my 1TB external harddrive. This makes moving things from my tablet to another computer really easy.4. Excellent PDF readers available: Besides powerpoint, the next most common format I need to use is PDF. I find EzPDF Reader Pro to be invaluable and it lets me annotate using a stylus or display the text only part for easy reading/studying.Cons:1. Mediocre battery: I know it's early to judge this since lithium-ion batteries take a few charge cycles to optimize efficiency. So far though, I'm able to get through most of the day before it hits 15%.2. Tegra 2 GPU Limitations: The A500 can play all of my lecture videos flawlessly, but when it comes to HD content or MKVs, the tablet kinda gets choked up. I find it pretty time-consuming to re-encode all the HD media I have to a format that can play better so this might be a con for people with lots of high profile MKV video files they wanted to mirror using HDMI.3. Laggy stylus input: This may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. I've been trying to find a way to handwrite well using a stylus for taking notes, so far I haven't found an app that can do it very well. This might be hardware related in that input polling is too slow? Not sure, but if you want to write on the A500, it will feel choppy.Overall, I'm really happy I decided to go with the A500. It was a good price and had all the features I need. Acer says it will back the A500 and give it ICS in the future, and this just makes this deal even sweeter. Don't hesitate if you're thinking about getting this tablet, especially since Amazon gives android users a free app a day (almost all the productivity apps I have were free!).", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best tablet in the market!!", "Author": "Jinan Shah", "ReviewID": "R4RDN9NI838SD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Few things that will definitely amaze any one for this perticular tablet are:1.

It is the most affordable one out there. At $350 you can't beat that. I don't know why they don't sell the fact that you can plug any wired keyboard and it will work flawlessly (I tried a wireless one but didn't work). So they say the Asus tablet is the best because it is cheaper (no this one is) and because you can buy the dock and have a netbook (well you can plug a keyboard to this one if you like).Facts:It runs Android so you can root and change the ROM at any time so you always feel like you have a new tablet (I do the same with my Evo 4g and after 1.5+ years I'm not bored of it yet).It is a little heavier than the other tablets but its not by much or something that you will not be able to handle.Everything works great without crashing or any other flaw.The standard usb port will give you another dimension that other tablets don't offer.The display is as good as the other tablets or maybe half a step behind but not by much.The sound is little bit harder than a good smart phone.The battery life is decent, its like a phone, if you are a hardcore user, it won't last the whole day.Most of the android apps are for phones and they will just appear bigger in the tablet.IMO:I bought this because I was given a gift card.

This is the first tablet I've owned, and price was one of my main concerns.  Before you buy any tablet, you need to be aware that it's practical uses are limited.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that is somewhat of an expensive toy.  Tablets are great for browsing the web, checking email/facebook, watching movies, playing games, etc.  Just don't expect it to replace a laptop.  But in tablets' defense, there are many things you can do with a tablet that can't be done with a standard computer.Build: The first thing you notice when opening the box is the tablet has a solid feel.  It's a little on the heavy side, but it's not a complete brick.  The aluminum back feels fairly solid, and is aesthetically pleasing.  The button positioning is nice as well, but the volume rocker is difficult to pressScreen: The screen is bright and easy to view.  There are more expensive tablets with better screens, but this one isn't disappointing.Performance: The dual-core processor and 1GB of RAM is on par with even the most expensive tablets currently on the market, and the performance is great.  Apps are responsive, with no noticeable lag even when multitasking.Operating System:  Honeycomb has a very nice user interface, and Acer leaves it pretty much untouched.  But my biggest complaints about this tablet are with the Honeycomb OS, which is still immature.  *For you non-techies:  Unlike other Android OS's, Honeycomb is not open source.  This is because Google doesn't want Honeycomb winding up on smartphones.  The result of this is that app developers don't have access to the source code, and there are not very many apps available for Honeycomb.  This isn't Acer's fault, but it should be noted.  The next Google OS update (Ice Cream Sandwich) is supposed to merge tablets and smartphones together, and more apps will become available for tablets.  I would still recommend buying a Honeycomb tablet over one that runs a smartphone OS (Froyo or Gingerbread) because in my opinion, Honeycomb tablets are more likely to receive the Ice Cream Sandwich update--- which is expected to be released this year.  Also, since the user interface hasn't been tweaked all that much by Acer, the update shouldn't be that hard for Acer to release in a timely manner.Connectivity: The full sized USB, Micro USB, and Micro HDMI ports offer more connectivity options that aren't found in most tablets, which is definitely a plus. The micro SD cart slot is also a plus, and I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the 32GB version of this tablet, because the storage can be expanded if needed.Battery:  The battery life is decent, although not super great.  Unless your usage is extremely heavy, you can expect to get a full day out of it without a problem, which is really all you need.  If you're on a long excursion through the Sahara or something, without access to an outlet- look into the Toshiba Thrive.  It has a removable battery that you can swap out for a fully charged one.Keyboard:  The on screen keyboard is disappointing, as with any tablet.  The nice thing about Android is that you can download other keyboards, which are more user friendly.  I installed Swype Beta, which you can download for free from Swype's website. It's far easier to \"swype\" a word than poke at individual keys with your index finger, especially when holding tablet with your hands (as opposed to sitting it on your lap or on a stand.)Other Notes:  It comes pre-loaded with a few games, which is cool..  Acer also installed some useful apps for organizing apps and syncing media. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I'd recommend this to anyone buying a new tablet.  If you're looking for a cheaper option, Lenovo is expected to release a 7\" tablet at $199 or $250 pretty soon (called the Ideapad A1).  The hardware and OS will be outdated by comparison to the A500, but it should still serve its purpose as a tablet.  The A1 will be like the netbook of tablets- underpowered, less useful, but far cheaper, more portable and still useful for basic tasks.

I dropped it once, and one of the corners of the tablet literally opened up, but it did not do any real damage. I just squeezed it back together, and it was all good. It upgraded to ICS, android 4.0, on April 2012; it works even smoother and faster with ICS. The tablet is very heavy for something you would be holding for hours, but you get use to it and becomes a minor inconvenience. The camera is bad and not so good especial indoor lighting. Do not depend on this tablet to take the best quality photo or video. I love it.... still.Final update:(08/17/2012) the tablet is great, VERY Loyal device and durable. i here many complaints of asus tablets, and that is what i love about acer, their electronics really do last you a long time. i don't plan on upgrading to the A700, just because the a700 is actually is a step down from the a500. i will most likely upgrade when their 2013 or even 2014 or even 2015 line of tablets release.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Greate tablet", "Author": "manuel", "ReviewID": "R31K1TZ3WZPGGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's just a great tablet.Fast reaction, long life battery, and even my two year old daughter can handle it.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R6SULWH1SAUEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this tablet.

I am a huge fan of the Android system software and love my Samsung Galaxy S. That said, the best way to sum up my experience with the Acer Iconia A500 is disappointing. I kept this product for a week and wanted to believe it would work well, but there were so many small bugs and issues that I eventually returned it this morning.Here are the highlights:Pros:1. Operating system is fairly responsive and quick2. Full website capabilities is awesome.3. Gmail client works great, as does the widget.4. Several games from NVidia are fun to play and the CNN and MSNBC apps look really good on the Acer.5. Price is excellent at $450Cons:1. My biggest problem with the product was the Wifi cutting in and out for no reason. I have 3 laptops, a desk top, 2 cell phones and a PS3 that have never had issues holding Wifi connection. I even tried changing the broadcast channel and security settings to no avail.2. The touchscreen is not responsive on the edges. There were multiple times I hit the spacebar clearly within the button range and the tablet vibrated to indicate I wasn't tapping it correctly. I also had this issue when tapping buttons towards the upper corners.3. As for the system software itself, Honeycomb is most definitely an unfinished product. I did not dock my review too much because Acer is not responsible for this, but I suffered through tens of force closes, the android market is slow and, worst of all, contains very few apps geared for Honeycomb. There may be 60 or so, but the great majority of them are not worth your time.4. Other minor issues, such as the tablet weight and screen clarity not being as good as the Ipad were minor concerns, but not worth complaining about.In short, the minor bugs, Wifi problems and severe lack of apps/honeycomb issues led me to return this item.

The good things about it include expandability and openness to the world:  SD card memory expansion, and a series of ports. It's fast and most of the apps I have installed, Spotify excepted,  work well. Google voice recognition and translation are nice things to have.On the downside: The display is OK but not Apple quality. The browser wants you to use mobile phone versions of the NY Times and the Washington Post rather than the better,  newspaper-style layout offered by Apple. It's hard to adjust font size. The cameras offer fair-to-poor quality. The microphone is not great, and making phonecalls via Skype can be trying.  The software keyboards are tiring and tricky to use -- the Android version of USA International is a bummer. It's a shade too heavy,  and the metal casing makes it slippery to hold. Wifi signal can grow weak and require a reboot of the machine. My experience with the GPS has been mainly frustrating.So, it's not Ipad quality, but it does certain things the Ipad won't, and it's cheaper. Weigh the pros and cons,  and then make your choice.  For my part, I am reasonably satisfied.-----------------Further observations:  I am told there are workarounds/substitute keyboards to replace the software keyboard that comes with the unit -- I'll be hunting around in that case. I have two issues currently:1. it is hard to turn the automatic correction off, it seems to kick back in when it feels like it; this is a colossal pain when you type in a foreign language and the keyboard keeps on changing the words you intend to something else2. The implementation of the U.S. International keyboard is SUCH a pain -- you need to hold some key down for an extra time, then lift your fingers from the keyboard and touch the screen to get accented characters,  arrrgh....Another experience:  I made a short video recording with this tablet the other night, of a musical rehearsal.

Now that I've seen both, I still prefer the Iconia. The camera placement isn't perfect, but both on the Toshiba are on the way when holding the tablet in landscape. I like the Toshiba's exchangeable rubber back, but all the colors other than black suck. I also don't like the cover you have to open to access all of the ports. The Iconia only has a cover for the SD card, which stays put given all of the connectivity options.I also like that the Iconia doesn't look like anything else. Most are either iPad or Xoom copies.A few minor gripes:1. I think any tablet should come with a basic sleeve.2. The power cord is far too short3. Either a glare free screen or replaceable shield should be included. If I can add a thick shield and still get touch sensitivity, then they should be able to make screens anti glare.4. As mentioned before, I think the chat camera could have been better placed. Maybe top center, since you're more likely to use video chat in landscape.5. Maybe a plug for the Dock connector.I've had very few problems, most of which were trying to run phone apps on a tablet.

It has a 10 inch wide screen (1280\u00d7800 resolution), weighs 1.69 pounds and is 13.3mm thick. It sports the popular dual-core 1 GHz Tegra 2 processor, and has 1 GB of DDR3 RAM. All of this makes for a snappy, responsive tablet with a large, comfortable screen.In this review, I'm not going to get into all of the technical details or benchmarks. I'll focus more on usability and my impressions of it while putting it through day-to-day use. This is my first experience with the Android Honeycomb OS, so take that into account while reading my review. That said, let's get started.With this tablet, you get a set of dolby stereo speakers, a standard headphone jack, a volume rocker (which changes direction, depending on the tablet's orientation - pretty slick), a screen orientation lock switch, a micro SD card slot, a dedicated charger port, micro-USB for file transfers, standard host USB for keyboard/thumb drive, a dock connector and a mini-HDMI port for output to a TV. You also get a front and rear facing camera.The Iconia is comfortable to hold - not too heavy, but also not so light that it feels like a toy in your hands. Its construction feels solid and durable.One of the first things I noticed was that if I installed apps that weren't quite designed for Honeycomb, the Iconia did a few strange things. The screen orientation lock wouldn't engage, the screen orientation wouldn't change when the tablet was rotated, other apps would not function, etc. When I took those off and rebooted the tablet, all of those symptoms magically disappeared. One other issue that continues to exist is that when the screen is locked, it will sometimes turn on by itself. This is a known issue with this product, and rumor has it that it will be repaired when the next release of Honeycomb is out (sometime this summer). Currently that is the only issue that I have with the device.Navigation on the tablet is smooth and fast. Moving from screen to screen is snappy, and opening apps is quick as well in any orientation. The speakers sound great for the tiny little things they are. I've also encoded a few movies to play on it, which play perfectly (More on this at the end of the article).Although this tablet is Wifi only (It's rumored a 3G version will be available sometime), I carry it with me everywhere I go. Most places I go have wifi anyway, so it isn't an issue for me. I use it routinely to check news sites (I have the CNN and USA Today apps - very nice, as well as the News360 app which aggregates news from several sources), check the RSS feeds I'm subscribed to (using Newsr, which integrates with Google Reader), check and update Twitter (using TweetComb) and browse websites. It is generally easier to use than pulling out my MacBook for what would amount to a few minutes worth of browsing.I also have the Amazon Kindle app, WeatherBug, and of course, Angry Birds. All of these apps work great, and more Honeycomb optimized apps are being added to the market all the time.One of my favorite apps on this tablet is SpringPad. On iOS I used Evernote, but the developers haven't quite kept up with the Android tablet market, where SpringPad has been all over it. I use this app for notes from anything to teaching, to recipes, to things I just need to jot down so I'll remember them later. This isn't so much a plug for SpringPad (though I do love them!) as it is for the ease of use of this tablet.Another cool thing about the tablet is that Google Talk has video chat built in. So if you have someone using Google Talk in gmail, you can do a video chat with them. I've used this multiple times and it works flawlessly. The front-facing camera even tracks your head so that if you move (within reason of course), it pans the camera with your movement. Ok, so the camera is fixed so it technically can't pan. It appears it zooms in somewhat on your face and tracks your movements that way. Pretty slick anyway.Conclusion: Aside from the screen turning on randomly (it goes back off after a few seconds generally), this tablet is just about as perfect as they come. In my mind, the only downside to this tablet in comparison to the iPad is the availability of apps. The Android market is still growing strong, so I wouldn't think that to be a big problem.NOTE FOR VIDEO ENCODING: I had encoded videos using HandBrake for my Apple TV 2. They work perfectly on that, of course. When I copied those videos to the Iconia, they were jumpy, missing frames and generally terrible to try to watch. I found a YouTube video (search for xoom video encode) that details how to encode videos for smooth viewing on the Iconia. The video references the Xoom, but using the same HandBrake settings works perfectly on the Iconia.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Acer Iconia A500", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15FYKIW34US6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this tablet so far....wish there were more cases made for it however.

The 16GB internal storage is great to start out and you can expand the storage using a micro SDHC card and a USB thumb drive if you need to.Now everything hasn't been perfect though.  There are some weird rotation issues when using the rotation lock and starting up apps that require a different orientation.  I've also gotten a few force close on the Market and a few other Google apps, but that is more than likely due to the infancy of the Honeycomb.  There was also a weird issue when using the browser and locking the screen plus a screen orientation thrown in there that I had to reboot the device to fix, but that has only happened once in the extensive use and testing I put the device through since I got it.Overall I definitely recommend this tablet to any that are looking for a great, affordable tablet.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its like have a mini tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RODUY2EZ2TB1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gave it as a gift and he uses it all the time.

The wife wanted an ipad so she got it a few months later she said what the heck was I thinking. I showed her what a simple $200.00 Zenithink would do, of course in the end it was my fault for letting her buy the ipad eh a day in the life of a husband.....gotta love it!At any rate people Asus is tops in my book and the Acer is a very very close second. For the money the ipad is way low on the list and if you know anything about flash and you use it on your home PC, it's something you are very used to having right then don't even think about an Ipad. You can buy 2 of \"just about\" anything else that will do more for your hard earned bucks. So far being able to use the cloud printer and watch movies actually I'm thinking why have my laptop.

Hoenie", "ReviewID": "R2PHFCZ0T7HX42", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this Acer A500 Iconia 16g December 2011 to use with work as we use many of Google's products (mail, docs, etc). I quickly found out that there were issues with the WIFI connecting. Acer then had patches to fix the WIFI - which would not even connect. Then, Acer upgraded the tablet to Android Honeycomb early 2012. The WIFI dropping issues continued to plague this device.  After constantly battling the dropping WIFI (regardless of settings), I have stopped using this device entirely - sad too because I spent $400 on this device with shipping. Expensive mistake.Why I do NOT recommend buying this product: Constantly dropped WIFI.The Acer A500 drops the WIFI connection every time the device goes to sleep. Even if you tell it not to, it will drop it. Even if you hard code the IP address of your router, it will drop it. If you walk away from the device for 5 minutes, the WIFI will drop.  When the WIFI drops, the device becomes a \"brick\" until you can get WIFI turned back on again.The only way to get the WIFI back is to reboot the device, OR, go into Airplane Mode and back out again.Without the WIFI, this tablet bricks up. Applications will suddenly start taking up 100% CPU as they try to connect to the Internet. There are times where you will have to restart the tablet because it bogs down to running incredibly slow.As long as you use the device continuously - and do NOT set it down - you will be fine. But walk away from it for a few minutes and you'll end up with no WIFI again. And this is incredibly sad because this truly is a beautiful device. The applications run fantastically - the Honeycomb OS is great - the apps from the Play Store are wonderful. Games run like a champ on the graphics chip. The 16 gig is fantastic.But without WIFI, well, it's useless.Make sure you search the web for \"Acer A500 Dropping WIFI\" and you will see for yourself that this tablet has serious issues with the WIFI hardware and software.Acer has not fixed this tablet - they have simply moved on.

This is common to all of the Android-OS-based products.  This is a huge con as the only tablet device that allows you on an 802.1x / PEAP network out of the box is an iPad.  But who in their right mind wants everyone running iTunes over their corporate network (as is required for iPads).  Google (pun intended) this issue and you'll see what I mean.  Hopefully later releases will take care of this.- No Netflix???!  What's this all about?!  You can adjust your instant queue but there's no app out there that will let you watch a movie (again, another shortcoming of the Honeycomb Android OS).  There's an HDMI out on this thing, yet the only movies you can watch are from YouTube or streaming from your network PCs.  Again, hopefully updates to the Android OS will allow this functionality or hopefully netflix one day cooperates with Android fully.- Skype doesn't work with Honeycombe.This machine is based on great hardware but if you don't have a solid OS and basic software to do things like get on the corporate or university network to start with, because of the cons, this thing becomes a tad more than an over-priced home web-browser with a few additional functions.

C'mon Google!?Edit 08/20/2011- Now has Xfinity, though you can't watch anything on the tablet with it.  You can only control your DVR and other cable boxes.  I guess there's value if you'd like a second 10.1\" remote to add to your collection of remotes.- Now has HBO2GO, though you can't watch full episodes of anything (but there's plenty of reading material???!).  The previews that run usually error out due to a buffer issue or application error.- Still no Netflix.Conclusion: No media distributor (save for Google itself) cares about the Android tablet.Edit 10/25/11 Netflix is fully functional.  This simple fact has changed my opinion of this product from a 2-star to a 4-star.  More and more companies are supporting the Android movement.  HBO Go still has no update.  I am currently updating to the latest release of the OS on this device.  I'm hoping this will add the much-needed corporate network connectivity component to the device.  Also, I will be looking for the Amazon Instant Video application this evening.Edit 09/26/2012 Still running strong.  Skype and Amazon Instant Video work great too.  Everyone in my family is using this device more than ever as a reader, browser, communications device and entertainment device.  Still can't get it on the corporate network (windows PEAP/WEP), but can't get a windows phone on the network either.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "ACER Refurb's - stay the heck away", "Author": "Astrobuf", "ReviewID": "R382B9OKBTS994", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I purchased an ACER A500 Tablet.

The real reason why I purchased this item is because it is the only tablet that has a USB connector.  To be honest, with same price range, or a little bit higher price you can get an ASUS transformer,samsung or the xoom that has more solid body built. But all these have no USB connector.  I don't keep any files in my laptop or PC. All of it are in external hard drives just so for extra protection.  Thus, I ended up with the ACER Iconia A500.  As soon as I arrived home, I downloaded the necessary files for the android.  Having an android phone for 3 years (I had the 1st generation t-mobile my touch) is a breeze for me to download the best apps in the android market. After all are set, I connected one of my external hard drive.  There was a long pause.  I thought at first it's not compatible. But later on, I noticed that the usb_storage folder (as the android file manager named it) is loading the files. I opened the folder and yes I can see my files.  But of course android can only open files that's supported by the apps.  I thought that was really cool, but not until I used back my external HD to my laptop (running windows vista). As soon as I connected the external drive to my laptop, I was surprised because the window that normally pops out when you just attached a usb flash or hard drive did not came out. I went to click \"my computer\" icon, and I was able to see the G drive ( the drive for the external disk).  I clicked it and a window notification popped out that said..\"INVALID PARAMETERS. PLEASE FORMAT YOUR DRIVE.\" This got me nervous as I had so many important files on my external hard drive.  I immediately tried it on my desktop computer (still running windows vista) and I had the same issue.  I contacted the acer support site chat session (here's the link in case someone needs it [...] and reported the issue.  This is the ACER's customer service advise:  Govindan Sharanji: Did it get formatted while connected to the tablet?  wts: no, it was not formatted when it connected to the tablet.  Govindan Sharanji: This happens when the partition table is corrupted when accessed by different file system.  Govindan Sharanji: I suggest you to format the hard disk with FAT 32 so that the hard disk can be connected to tablet and windows computer.  As simple as that??? I'm sorry my review is so long but I think everyone needs to know this.  To make the story short, his last advise was to contact the hard disk manufacturer and immediately cuts our conversation ( and I think that's rude).  Now, I'm left in the dark.  I will update my review on this item as soon as I got an answer from the hard disk manufacturer. By the way I got a seagate hard disk.And please, if someone had this problem before and resolved this issue, please advise me.

To be very honest and with intent not to hurt Android community, so far I'm not impressed and I personally feel IPAd offers a lot more and performs a lot better as long as you keep your objective clear that you are using the unit for entertainment only and you are not trying to replace your laptop or desktop. On paper Acer has better hardware but it severally lacks in GUI and unless you have time to tweak it, it nowhere close to IPAD, IPAD beats it in every visible department like tochscreen, stability, look & feel, usage.

I got my friends to bring the Iconia over to France (it's cheaper), and can't send it back for a refund.I studied the whole bunch of the reviews,- thanks, it was very helpful. But The one question I wanted answered, wasn't mentioned: Is it worth the money?-To me, NO.When you get the tablet, it's nice to touch and to play with, but you start frantically figuring out, to what use should you be putting it?Mail, alarm clock, video recording - playing,sharing pictures, ebook reading, maps, to some- socialising,utube, games...Minuses:1.Well, out of the box it doesn't have a file explorer.2.It doesn't recognise USB storage unless it is a small size and formatted in FAT32 system. So no way you can plug in a 500 storage and enjoy your movie collection. I'm thinking about bypassing this by putting my movies on an ftp server. Pain in the back.3.To be able to perform those basic functions, the Iconia has to be \"rooted\" (look up the exploit suggested on the XDA developers forums -awsome guys, by the way!), which voids the warranty and may potentially brick the tablet. Then the apps allowing mounting other file systems may be installed.4.Difficult to connect to a Linux computer. Is not recognised/mounted. Takes some figuring out.5.To watch BBC and Hulu from France,I use a proxy service (not free), which works fine on any computer at home (we have about five,-even the cat has one). The proxy apps on Iconia fool nobody. I'm detected like a kid. Found no way to circumvent the problem yet. Oh, and proxy was working fine on Android 2.something tablet I tried some while ago. So this must be  intrinsic  to this product.6.Downloads are really sloppy.You are never sure what happens. It's true for both apps installing and ebooks (fb2.zips are really not that big to be downloading for minutes!)7.Maps work only when connected to the internet (imagine how useful it is, when you are on your way,especially it has no GPRS support)-There is a quetion in the discussions about the GPS working when disconnected from WiFi: no, it doesn't work.8.Weight. Just on the border.To have it around for reading/entertainment on the way it's a bit too heavy.9.Plays a sound by default when a new e-mail comes. The night, too. Can't turn it off yet.10.Battery life is not that wonderful. Screen pops up when on sleep mode, as someone already mentioned.Now for the pluses:1.Fabulous experience reading (recommend both FB2 reader and CoolReader), slightly marred by the all-too-brilliant screen.2.Good gmail client.3.No-hustle picture taking/sharing. Same for the video. BUT it wouldn't allow to use the camera without an SD card inserted. Funny that the device doesn't see this same card if not formatted in FAT32, but only the internal memory.Hm.4.Doesn't heat up as much as, say, my Toshiba portege (which is lighter) or another laptop.5.Screen size is good. Feel is wonderful.6.Alarm setting only takes seconds and works fine. Can set it to wake me from a 20-minutes nap, and it does it nicely.No need to make sure it will repeat the same thing tomorrow without being asked (as some smartphones have a tendency to do)That seems to be it.Overall, any small netbook running either Windows or Linux, similar or lesser weight, would be preferable: no problem with applications, faster response,  and a much bigger storage.Regret the purchase.P.S.

I have dealt mostly with Windows based system and also some with Linux.  I do not own a single Apple device, and the Iconia A500 is my first Android device. I have owned and used Smartphones with the Blackberry, Nokia Symbian, Windows Mobile OS's.  I have also owned and used a Palm TX for the last 8 years, ever since it first hit the market.  I am telling you this so you will know my technological background and the authority and experience with which I speak.Before I make you read my whole review of the Iconia A500, I will first give you the bottom line.  Here it is. If you are willing to pay $359 to be an unofficial, unpaid beta tester for the Android tablet operating system (Honeycomb) in the expectation that things will get better, more power to you.THE UNBIASED HONEST TRUTH:After fifteen years in the computer and tech industry, I can divide tech users into three group; Functionalist, Fun Seekers and Fans. Functionalist are people are not swayed by anything but how well a device functions overall. Fun Seekers are people who are wowed by shinny and new and who only care about whether their new toy can do the \"Cool and Neat\" things they heard about.  Fans are people who align themselves with a particular brand name and defend their brand with religious vigor. I am a Functionalist. I am not impressed by shinny and new or hype. I judge things for what they are. I am nobody's fan.  There are many reviews here about the A500 and the overwhelming majority of them are from Fun Seekers and Fans.WHY 3 STARS?The A500 has some great specs hardware wise and deserves an honest 4 stars for hardware.  The Android Honeycomb OS (for tablets) is still young and immature with little app support specifically for tablets.  At this point in time I cannot honestly give it more then 2 stars. 2+4=6 and divide by 2 = 3.HARDWARE REVIEW:The A500 is strong on hardware.  It is fast and responsive.  It has one USB port which is a huge plus compared to many other tablets that don't have a USB port.  It also has a microSD card slot for adding extra memory.  Personally I think it was dumb to go with a microSD instead of a full size SD card slot.  You can always use an adapter to use a microSD card in a standard SD slot, but you can't shrink an SD card down to fit a microSD card slot.  But the fact that A500 has any slot where you can add extra memory is also huge plus. The cameras are decent and do a good job of taking pictures and video.  They will not replace a good point and shoot, but they still do a good job.  The speakers could be louder, but good speakers are impossible to find even on 15\" laptops (it's a matter of physics), so for the size of the A500, I think the speakers are pretty good.  Battery life (while in use), seems to line up with what is advertised (35% sleep mode battery drain is another issue).  One weak area of the A500 is the wifi card.  In my house I have three desktop PC's, two Nintindo Wii's, a Nokia e71x and a Palm TX, that I use to connect to my wifi network. The wifi card on the A500 is weaker then all of them.OPERATING SYSTEM REVIEW:Most of the problems that you will find with the A500 are directly linked to the Android OS.  The Android OS overall is still in it's development stages.  This is especially true when it comes to to tablets. The A500 comes with Android 3.1 (code name \"Honeycomb\"). At this point in time Honeycomb suffers from smartphone syndrome. What I mean by smartphone syndrome is, Honeycomb is just a revamped smartphone OS that was modified to fit a tablet.  It is not an OS that was designed from the ground up for a tablet computer. It does an okay job, but it has a long way to go before it will feel like it belongs to the tablet platform.  At this point in time I would consider Honeycomb still to be in the beta stages when comes to the tablet platform.APP SUPPORT:Just as Honeycomb suffers from smartphone syndrome, so does the app support for the tablet platform.  There are thousands of apps available that were designed for the smartphone platform and some of them will work on the A500.  More and more apps are coming out for the tablet platform, but how long will it be for your favorite app will be available for the A500 is a toss up.MY OPINION:I do like my A500 in some ways. It feel like it has so much capability, but everyday I find areas where it falls just short of doing what I need it to do.  It is kind of like smelling a chocolate cake and seeing it, but not being able to take a bit.  At this point the A500 feel like a tablet that wants to be a fun smartphone toy, instead of a tablet that wants to be a serious, work related, computer device.  The hardware for it to be a serious work related device is there, but the OS is just to young and immature at this point.I can see where some people that like to read ebooks might like it, but you don't need to spend $359 to get a good ebook reader.  Most other things that the A500 can do can be done just as easy on a smartphone that you can carry around in your pocket, so why buy the A500 (that you can't carry around in your pocket or even medium sized purse).  I bought my A500 for someone else who ended up not needing it and I decided to keep it for myself.  I use it everyday to check my stocks, keep a blood pressure log, check the weather and maybe do some skyping with my kids (really works good for skyping).  But all of this could be done just as easy with a good smartphone.THE BOTTOM LINE:The question you as a potential buyer need to ask yourself is this; Why do I need the A500?  98% of what it can do can be done just as effectively on a smart phone or the Ipod Touch 4th gen (for those who don't want a data plan), the other 2% can be done on a much cheaper ebook reader, and it absolutely cannot replace a laptop (at this time).  So why do you need it? If your are a fun seeker who just wants the newest toy on the market, go ahead.  If you are a Android fanboy, go ahead.  If you are a functionalist like me, you might want to wait until the Android OS matures a lot.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Heavy. Limited after-market accessories.

Basically, only 1 browser tab can be \"active\" at any one time.  Further, GMail is weak on the iPad and the iPad does a miserable job of syncing my Google calendar.So, I went out and bought an Iconia tab figuring it'd be iPad goodness with Google integration.  While it's the latter, it's not the former.First, the screen is horrid compared to the iPad.  The Iconia has washed out colors, you can see the pixels as well as the wires for the touch sensor.  The screen is \"farther away\" from the surface of the Iconia which makes reading or viewing things a challenge.Second, there are all kinds of pokey, hard-edged things on the side of the Iconia.  It's very, very difficult to find a good position for holding the device without something poking your hand.  This is in \"sharp\" contrast to the iPad with is smooth and curved and feels natural in the hand.Third, the Iconia has a separate power plug.

It is not even close to being ready for prime time (serious computer work). Don't ever think it can be used for serious computer work. The default web browser is buggy and often it will just stop working and throw you out to the desktop. If you choose to use the browser, don't do anything serious with it. Just use it for playing around. I down loaded 4 other browsers from the app store and they are all buggy too, a couple extremely buggy and unusable.I come from a windows background and I think we all forget how complicated an operating system is. Android needs more time to get the bugs out. The Android OS, no matter what verion you are talking about, it not a mature OS.The GPS sensor on this tablet is terrible...taking 5 to 8 minutes to lock onto 3 satellites. And don't waste your money buying a cover as the GPS won't work at all with a cover on the tablet!The touch screen is unreliable. I am always having to reboot it until the touch screen works. Sometimes this takes 5 or 6 reboots.Android brags that they have hundreds of thousands of apps for the Andriod OS. What they don't tell you is that 90% of them are NOT made for the larger 10 inch tablet screens! And most of the apps are junk. Really. Unlike Apple, the Android apps are not checked for quality or to see that they actually work or that they don't contain malware. Every Apple app has to be checked and approved before it can be sold in their app store. No so with Android apps and frankly, it shows big time. You have no idea how many Android apps you will download, install and then uninstall! Just terrible.In short, no matter how much you want an Android tablet, no matter how much you may love Google and hate windows or hate Apple, Android tablets are simply not ready for anything but playing around and god forbid you have any important data on a web page before you find yourself back on the desktop wondering what happened to your browser session.

However that's where the similarities end. While the Acer A500 and it's Android 3.2 operating system is very impressive in terms of what it can it do, the problem is that it doesn't do anything well. The worst offense being the Android OS slow and laggy response when doing...well, anything!! The flash player does work, but it's SLOW and sometimes unresponsive. Case in point, ESPN's website. Videos take longer to launch and when they do launch the quality isn't as good as the iPad's HTML version. Then there are the apps, or lack there of. I'm not talking about quirky or specialty apps here. Even the most basic and standard of apps are missing like an Amazon for Android tablet app. Seriously, there isn't a Honeycomb Amazon app out there!!? How terrible is that? There's no New Egg tablet app, there's no Chase banking tablet app, there's no eBay tablet app, there's no Etrade tablet app. Basically almost all the app that I have on my iPad 2 are not available for my Dad's Iconia and it's Droid 3.2 OS. That is incredibly lame.As if that isn't bad enough the apps that I can find for Honeycomb are grossly inferior to the iPad 2's version. For example Bloomberg and USA Today for Honeycomb is completely garbage. They are considerably slower when starting and loading content and in case of the USA Today app's the screen format is extremely difficult to read. Oh did I mention how slow and unresponsive these apps are compared to the iPad version? Because I can't stress that enough when this Acer Iconia have more RAM than the iPad 2!Overall while I appreciate the expandable SD card storage, USB availablity, and all those cool widgets, they're meaningless unless the OS can provide me with a smooth tablet experience.

I first had a Galaxy and a Transformer (both returned) and they were very slim and easy to carry around this Acer on the other hand is bulky and heavy enought to make your wrists suffer for hours in exchange for some limited entertainment.Andrioid is wack and slow more apps do not load fast and some wont even load at all you have to go back to the ones that didnt load and refresh to get some respond (good luck).Front camera is half size since the camera is to the left instead of the middle so if you chat with someone they will see your side instead of your face you either have to turn your tablet in protrait mode or try to move to a specific area so you can be in the middle of the camera otherwise you will be to the side.The volume rocker is weak I hate the buttons they need to be pressed hard because they wont go all way down without pressure!The on/ off button is weak a piece of plastic that feels like is going to fall off when you touch it or press it! Be careful!Sometimes if you usb is connected and headphones all together it will be hard to handle the tablet because you will have all these gadgets surronding the tablet hurting your hands!!! Use a stand and free your hands when using plugs..The web browser is very laggy there will be times where it responds smooth more than others where it will run slooow this is my major complaint!!!Copy and paste are wacky sometimes copy works but paste hasn't really work for me because I tried to copy and paste a receipt from walmart to my email address and nothing happened!!!Text fix sometimes works sometimes it wont move to the specific letters or sentence you wish to change!! Failure as coy and paste!Deleting apps are a way of complication you gotta go to settings and then uninstall to me is not like ipad that you just click on the app and click the x and it removes in less than a second!!!You gotta be ready to have patience to deal with this slow machine!!On the other hand video quality is good, sound is very outstanding with dolby player, screen resolution is decent, flash is great and overall is decent but with many issues to be fix hopefully soon!!!!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "solid device but ANDROID does Disappoint me and most", "Author": "heng", "ReviewID": "R3PD2JLSS46R0Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the item is fine, solid, good for the price. i've never used Android devices before. better know how android is. grab this tablet for getting to know android. yes, it suckssssss.(sorry android). i really don't normally have time to sit down and write any product review. but mad about android now.

I didnt want to pay in to the apple cult so i decided on android based tabs. iconia got great reviews all over the internet so i thought it was a no brainer. I got in from amazon and it arrived with no problem. sure the powercord is comically short, but i was expecting that from the previous reviews. After getting this tab and already knowing the limitations of using it as is, I decided to root it. that was easy and took 5 minutes and it made me feel like i was sticking it to the man! so there I was with a rooted android tab.... the skies the limit so I thought. \"time to see what this thing can do!\"... five minutes passed, then ten minutes, then an hour, then a few hours, then a day, then a few days.... here I sit with a perfectly rooted tab, for once in my life, im a superuser :p,  and I sit in remorse realizing that it means NOTHING. its a worthless. I want to go online.... and flash only works on some sites. I try to hit up some of my regular daily sites.....and find that i have no choice but to visit the mobile version. I want to watch a funny clip from a site and whoop, the internet cuts off connection to the tab... I go to starbucks, and it still says i have full signal from my home internet (ofcourse i cant get online though).  I decide, fine, at least i can download some bootlegged movies on my laptop and transfer them over and watch them on the go..... nope, usb is a Mensa riddle to figure out. you plug it in and nothing happens. no indication that it detects a device. you go searching all over the tab to find the files, and no luck. i finally downloaded an app that picked up the usb drive, but its a mystery how to actually get them on to the tab. i can open the mp4, but then it says it doesnt play that format. all in all its a crappy trendy item that serves no purpose. what can I do with it? nothing. I cant edit office documents on it without paying for some app and then dealing with the crapy touch keyboard. id rather chew on the barrel of a gun. why did android make things so \"organized\" that nothing is possible. i basically just paid 450 dollars for a nice digital alarm clock that gets gmail (if next to my wifi router) i would love to throw this against a wall but it was too expensive. i guess ill just use it as digital pictureframe. or a giant crappy camera.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned for an iPad", "Author": "John M.

Because of this, I also have a first generation Ipad.  My first impression was \"That thing is damn ugly.\" There's come black plastic, some dark aluminum, and loads of little pieces of plastic all very poorly put together around a very poor quality screen. The design is terrible. This tablet is too wide, its thicker than the iPad 1 and the edges are at a weird angle. I just hate looking at it.  Than, when I turned the thing on and started using it, I had the terrible feeling that I was using something I found in my Grandfather's basement. Here's some specifics:  -The whole length of the bottom of the screen has this ugly toolbar. It has cheap looking icons for switching between apps and the time and the battery, It is very poorly designed and is way too big.  -The app store is a fraction of what Apple's app store is. This is because the Android app store started about 2 years after Apple's, and most of the apps are just crappy copies of ios ones.  -The keyboard has the same design as the ugly toolbar at the bottom, and it crams every symbol and letter onto the keyboard as humanly possible. Typing on this thing is a mess.  -This thing is noticeably slow, and not just \"Oh that loading icon came up for a sec\" it's more like \"that loading icon is up constantly.\"  -The icons on the homescreen are all over the place. They are very small and hard to read, and you have a few terrible choices of how you'd like them to be displayed; either in a really small grid or placed in useless categories.The fact of the matter is this: Acer's hardware and Android's software is still 2 to 3 years behind the first generation iPad. The touchscreen is dim and not as responsive. Also, this tablet bends and creaks, like a hotwheeels toy, so you don't feel like it is very secure. The android software is a clear ripoff of ios, which is why any 'advancements' it makes by having homscreens with big fancy clocks and calendars are just gimmicks. This tablet is hard to use, and if you know how to use it it is still slow and unenjoyable. I am returning this hunk of ripoff-second-class junk and getting myself the iPad 2.I seriously cannot understand how 1. Anybody would buy this and 2. Anyone would stick up for it.
