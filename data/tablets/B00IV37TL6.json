{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent, but only if you mind being limited to the Amazon Store", "Author": "callenjr", "ReviewID": "R3CWHHYLVB4Q1K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Was disappointed in buying this product as the is no access to the Googly Play store.  If you don't mind having to use a generic app for your Gmail and no direct access to other Google products such as Youtube then it's alright. Came with very limited instructions so be prepared to feel your way around.  Good resolution on downloaded videos or the tv apps that are available through Amazon.  Good for an alternative Kindle or a toy for the kids, but be prepaired for very limited battery life.  For around $50 it's an alright playtoy.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IV37TL6"}}
