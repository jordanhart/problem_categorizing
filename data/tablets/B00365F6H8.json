{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A leap in the right direction", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "RRSI97OZTY5K7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.First the good sides:This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.The not so good sides:As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.As a laptop replacement:The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "R2HWNDE1DXN1V6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The main difference between this item, and the wi-fi only version, is of course the sim card with 3G.  So, before I talk about the iPad in general, I'd like to explain my take on the 3G.3G Performance:The BOTTOM LINE:  Works good as long as you aren't using it in a moving car.  I ran an internet speed test on it and in the metro area it was 1.2Mbps down and 210kbps up, which is decent.The DETAILS: If you are doing basic computing, you will be able to be anywhere within a 3G service area to enjoy the internet.  (If 3g service sucks in your area, don't buy an iPad 3g)  Here is the only problem: when you pass from tower to tower the signal can hang as the data has to be rerouted to the new tower.  Lets put this another way.  If you are using the iPad netflix app to stream \"Kim Possible season 3\" videos to your iPad while driving at 60 MPH it will \"hang\" during the 22 minute show.  In summary: The AT&T; 3G works the same as my 3G expresscard from Verizon.2G Performance: Yes, you can use your iPad on AT&T;'s 2G EDGE network as needed.  The data is slow.  You won't enjoy it.3G setup:3G setup is simple:- press settings button, choose cellular data, press set up cellular service.- put in your *iTunes* password.  (AT&T; is \"invisible\" except for a logo.)- put your credit card into the iPad- voila! you have service for 30 daysIts very slick and takes less than a minute.  Its how it should be.Avoiding the 3G data charges:  If you are an iPhone user, and you have an iPad, you can avoid paying for 2 data plans by swapping sim cards.  Of course, you might miss a few calls while your sim is in the iPad because the iPad doesn't support phone calls.  If you have an older iphone: Older iPhones use large SIM cards and the ipad uses small microSIM cards.  You would have to cut your large sim card down to the microsim size, and put it in your iPad (you will need a needle to pop it out).  You would need to buy a little adapter (sold on the internet) to make your small sim fit back into your iPhone (so, buy the adapter first!)  But this isn't a great long term solution, because, if you want to use the iPad as a GPS in the car you will not be able to use your phone quickly or easily until you switch them back out again.  Here it is on Amazon:  Microsim Adapter for Ipad Iphone4g Convert Micro Sim to Regular Sim AdapterDO YOU WANT THE 3G INTERNET?Despite my little princess being vexed at Kim Possible hanging, the answer is yes.  Certainly, its wonderful to have the 3G access.  Everything about the iPad works better because its a bigger screen, and being able to access the internet (almost) anywhere is very, very useful for me.Now, the question begs to be asked:  why the ipad at all?I have to say I originally joined the legion of pundits who said \"hey, its just a big ipod touch\" and \"it won't replace my laptop\".  Certainly, this has to be the two most common things you hear people say about the ipad, right?  And yes, that can be the truth you choose.iPad vs. Laptop: If your idea is to buy an iPad to replace your laptop, and get an external keyboard, and a docking station, and bla bla bla... then you will be disappointed.  This is a different kind of device, and you can't put a square peg in a round hole.  The iPad is for even more mobile computing than a laptop can provide.  ***A laptop needs a desk.  But the iPad doesn't.***  Thats the point, and if its not compelling for you, then consider carefully before buying an iPad.iPad vs. iPod Touch:  To say its just a big iPod touch is not really fair.  The processor is much more powerful, allowing you to do a LOT MORE.  You also get a big screen.  And the 3g with this version.  So to refuse to upgrade from the ipod Touch is similar to refusing to upgrade from a Kia Rio on the grounds that all other cars do the same thing.But the biggest reason the iPad+3G will work for you, is that after a few weeks with it, you will want learn how to make it work for you.  You will *enjoy* using it and it will be easier to use.  You will say \"how can I change what I do so I can do it on the iPad\" not \"how can the iPad do exactly what I did before\".For an example: here is a day with the iPad.I get up in the morning, and if I'm not being lazy, I get on the treadmill.  I prop the ipad up on the treadmill while I walk.  I watch some news video on the iPad, read some email, play a game, catch up on facebook.  I'm usually not done with this after my walk, so I head downstairs.  Its like carrying a magazine, its so easy.  I bump into my daughter in the hall and show her a picture from her Grandmother, with the iPad securely held in only one hand.  While I'm eating breakfast, and shaving, and brushing my teeth, I'm catching up on a book I was reading on my wife's Kindle: using the kindle ipad app.  Then I can use the iPad when I leave the house, in a myriad of ways that I would not use my iPod Touch or Laptop.  And the iPad fits in the pocket in my car door.  Its really never in the way!So far I have used the iPad to:1) Watch streaming netflix movies.2) Read books on iBooks and Kindle for iPad, both to myself and to my children.3) Browse the internet without constantly having to use finger motions similar to \"pinch\" and \"peace\" (goodbye iPhone!).4) My kids use it as an interactive coloring book at restaraunts.5) I can control my laptop when I am away from home if something crucial comes up, as if I'm sitting at my laptop.6) Move pictures from my digital camera to the iPad very quickly and easily (using the camera adapter, sold separately).  Either for storage or for emailing.7) Listen to Pandora internet radio anywhere in the house. (ok, I can't really listen to \"Crystal Method thump thump boom boom music\" but most other music sounds good)8) I have used the internet to teach my children things when we are away from the house (Daddy, where does the word \"helicopter\" come from?)9) Watched owned or rented iTunes movies on my 42 inch LCD TV (using an adapter sold separately).The point of the above is that the iPad gives me more FREEDOM when computing, due to its small footprint and light weight.What you can't do on an iPad:1) Multitask.  You don't really need all those windows open, but, we're all used to that.2) Print.3) Use the iPad to connect to a TV and give a presentation.  When you use the HDTV adapter, the iPad screen blacks out so you can only use this for movies.4) See macromedia Flash based content online.  (a lot of websites use this, like Hulu)Steve Jobs says 1 and 2 are coming, in fact, multitasking is on the new iPhone4 so it won't be long.#4 will probably never come.  If you need to use Flash websites, then, stick with our laptop.  End of story.Oh and the battery....  The battery is consistently lasting all day, 12 hours, without a recharge.  But, its important to note that MANY USB ports will not charge an iPad.  None of mine will.  Also, my cheap iPhone car charger will not charge my iPad.  There has been discussion about this lately, apparently the charger or USB port has to actually provide the correct rated power.  Most don't provide enough power.  But the battery lasts all day for me so this is not a negative.If the reasons above don't help you make up your mind, consider Steve Wozniak's recent comments about the iPad:  \"Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.\"  No viruses.  No compatibity issues.  No wondering why your iPad is so slow (Apple vets all software to make sure this doesn't happen).  No questionable upgrades.  No cryptic errors.  All these things were things that took the joy out of computing for a lot of people.The iPad is such a simple thing.  And thats why the average person will love it and prefer to use it instead of a computer.I'll upgrade this to 5 stars if/when:1) More powerful iPad apps come out2) Multitasking 2 things at once is possible (at least web browser and word processing, or pandora internet radio app + any other app would be nice)3) Some kind of printing would be cool, although, I'm ok with paperless, really...There you have it.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch!", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R16U71KO7POLA2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a \"Kindle killer\" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term \"baby\" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an \"oleophobic\" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1\" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13\" or 15\" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring \"folders\" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a \"netbook killer\" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or \"Kindle killer\" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app \"iBooks\" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite \"iWork\" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term \"multi-touch\". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called \"Camera A\" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the \"Camera B\" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled \"productivity\" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of \"apps for that\". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Comparison Between Kindle and Apple iPad", "Author": "The Big Guy \"Super Paratrooper\"", "ReviewID": "RHP63UO3B80A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Want the long and the short of it without having to read a \"mega review\"? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far:VERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category.DISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins.PAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down.CONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner.PRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain.AVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time.SEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book.MY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there.I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Video Review: 3G iPad", "Author": "D.

I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Yes, You Will Want 3G", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R1CNZN63V4P0SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 2 iPads. A 64 GB WiFi only model which I bought the day it was available, and this 32GB 3G model which I picked up last week. They are about the same price; if you have to choose between an extra 32GB of storage and 3G capacity, definitely go with the 3G if for nothing else future proofing. I consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 iPad variants.Right now, my wife is in China with a WiFi only model. She is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open WiFi hotspot. So, she goes days between checking her e-mail. E-mail which might be critical to her business. If she had a 3G model, I could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from Chinese Unicom, modified a data SIM to a micro-SIM, and she would be getting her e-mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing.  On the other hand, her iPad is loaded with media with over a dozen DVD quality films, all her music, and a large number of family photos. This does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole Internet.3G is not quite the great deal as it was yesterday, AT&T; is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. In the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $30/month with no contract. Now you can get a $25/month deal for 2GB, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video.  Existing $30/month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal.  There are also cheaper smaller plans. Right now I'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. I have been Skyping to my wife in China, using Google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. It is very slick. I tried the 250 MB/month plan and that was just too small for what I was doing.As for the rest of the iPad, it is great. I downloaded a free novel from the iBooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. It's my preferred device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of Flash. It's mostly ads though so that's fine, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. Over time, I expect this will be less of a problem as Flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now.The glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. Typing is surprisingly OK, I can type about as fast as I normally can if I concentrate. My kids like watching YouTube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. So, I find I use the iPad several hours a day, which means I can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iPhone charged.This is indeed a game changing device, and I think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hated it until I bought one", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R3PEH4660T41H0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS.Last spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.Then last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.Then last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.So when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this \"first ever tablet device\" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity.But no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an \"outdated\" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...So I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.But I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.But I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.But I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second \"main\" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.So I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.So two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.Unboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.The drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.Weather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.The last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the \"you can't do this and that at once\" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.So I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.The keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.Screen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some \"non fingerprint coating\" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.Screen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.So then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.That's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was \"restore?\"  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.Playing with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).I grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.So I went from the initial \"What a useless piece of junk\" detractor to the \"I wouldn't live without it\" supporter.I gave them all sorts of grief for using the term \"magical\" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...  All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.And with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...So for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a bit of a toy.", "Author": "Jack Showers \"attorney, developer\"", "ReviewID": "R2LNAMQ0YWMPFD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a WiFi, non-3G version, the cheapest one; I don't need GPS and don't want to pay AT&T; any more than I absolutely have to, and don't want another monthly subscription, either.  Got plenty of those, it seems.  And, at least for now, I don't need all that storage.I'm not what one would consider a \"Power User\" of the iPad.  I use a laptop constantly, and bought the iPad a couple of months ago because it is great looking and I was curious about it and I got a case of The Wants.  I've been involved with computers since the mid-60's when I first was employed as an IBM 360 (and 1401 before that) programmer, and I've continued messing with them pretty heavily ever since, though I changed careers in the early 70's.  Over the years, I've owned (in a small business) maybe 40 or 50 desktops and laptops, including several Apple IIe's way back when.  I've always liked Apple products, but not used them due to the overwhelming prominence of DOS and Windows products (both software and hardware) and the excellent pricing of IBM clones.But when the iPad came out, I couldn't help myself.  I now pick it up several times a day and use it.  I've taken it on trips without a laptop.  Here's what I think, mostly.Pros:1. It's cool.  No avoiding it, the little fella is great looking and has that Apple minimalist approach to design that they do so well.2. It's tiny.  Well, small, anyway.  That's good and maybe bad, but it does have its appeal.3. Screen resolution seems creamy, silky smooth.  Don't know how they did it, and don't really care.  It's good.4. I love Apple's approach to WiFi....  Walking into a new place, without even the slightest thought from  you, the iPad finds an open connection and asks if you want to connect to it.  If you say yes, you never hear from it again.  Done.  If the proper connection needs a WPA code or such, it simply asks for it.  No fuss.  (It seems like Windows, which I use for hours every day and have since it came out, has never really felt comfortable with wireless networking).5. No keyboard.  Well, face it, most of the time you don't use one, anyway.  Not having it is OK.  No mouse, either, for that matter.  Good.6. Scrolling is a dream.  Fabulous.  Effortless.  Scrolling, something that simple, is probably the single thing this little unit does best.  You have to try it to understand it.7. One of my apps (I don't have many) is a flight simulator similar to MS Flight Simulator.... X-Plane.  It allows pilots to practice instrument flying, so I got it.  VERY cool.  No joystick foolishness.  You must rotate the iPad itself like you would a yoke and the airplane turns or climbs or descends, or whatever.  Way easier than Windows products to do the same thing.8. Pilot friends who use other apps for charts and such love it, so I would guess that all graphics applications work pretty well on the little system, though I haven't tried.  Oh, yeah, Google Maps and Earth and such look great, too.  Apple always has done graphics well, so no real surprise.9. Ditto for video.10. Battery life is great.  Days on end at my level of usage.11. My Blackberry has a cute feature (maybe everyone has it, now):  When typing an email address or URL, when one presses the space bar, the OS converts it to a @ or a period, whichever is appropriate.  The iPad takes that to another level....  There is a \".com\" key that enters that when pressed.  A small thing, but more helpful than one might think on a device where typing ain't as easy as using an IBM keyboard.Cons:1.  It's hard to hold and easy to drop.  Needs a shell or something to protect it; that makes it as big as a netbook or small laptop, anyway.2. Can't keep several \"windows\" open at the same time to switch back and forth.  Not a horrible issue, because you can get back to a previous window relatively easily, but sometimes you'd like to have both open at the same time or be able to switch with a single click.  If there's a way to do that I haven't found it.3. Hotmail and Gmail don't work like they do on a laptop.  Or on a Blackberry Storm2, for that matter.  I don't know the issue, but I can't seem to find a way to send a new email (though it's easy enough to reply).  I'm sure there is some app or setting to fix it, but I really don't want to be troubled with that.  I just want it to work.  Like the way WiFi does.  (Since I wrote this, I actually went into the email setup and set it up; it works, but I would prefer to use Hotmail and Gmail as pure web based apps rather than something more akin to a cell phone feature, which, of course, it is).4. You can't print from it. I've read that there is a wireless printing feature in the next OS.  Waiting to see.5. When working with it in your lap, either in a chair or a recliner or bed, a laptop is just more well suited for the job.  The iPad has to be held up, and, the screen is lower, so you are craning your neck more.  I don't use a stand to put it in.  Things like that and the case to put it in detract from the advantage of small size, so you might as well use a small laptop which will make you happier in the long run for this sort of thing.6. No keyboard.  And don't tell me they make a keyboard for it.  If I have to buy that, I might as well get a laptop.  Typing on the screen is a trip.  If you use the virtual keyboard holding the iPad in the \"landscape\" position the keyboard is large, and a little awkward to span the keys with your thumb.  So, you end  up turning the iPad up to the \"portrait\" position where the keyboard is better suited to thumb-typing.  I haven't tried typing in the traditional way (\"touch typing\")....  I just reach for the laptop.  I'm using my Lenovo to type this review.7. OK, here we go....  No Flash.  Now, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I don't understand this.  Every now and then (pretty often, actually) some video will come up and the iPad will tell me that it doesn't do Flash. (Happens frequently on sports and news sites). I never even knew what Flash was before this issue came up.  Well, Apple wants me to go to iTunes to download their app that will let you view Flash files.  OK, y'all, why didn't you just put it in the iPad from the get-go?  I just want it to work.  Yesterday, I wanted to watch a video of a Tropical Storm in the Caribbean, so I clicked on the link to go get Apple's app.  Then I had to cycle through a few pages on iTunes.  Heck with it.  I just used the laptop (which has a larger screen, anyway).  There's a saying: \"People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes. \"So, what's the upshot?I like it.  I'd buy it again.  No, I wouldn't wait for the Android competitors to come out.  Well, I am curious about those and might get one of them, too, just to check it out.  But, the WiFi-only iPad is a nice, polite little computer.I do want to say this, and it's one of those potentially inflammatory things, but I don't mean it like that....  It's more of a toy than a tool.  If I am really in need getting things done....  Spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc, it's really hard to beat the tried and true Windows laptops that are available everywhere and are dirt cheap and fit in with the way things are done and the formats that are used throughout the business community.So, sure I use it.  This morning (a Sunday) I've been using it....  looking at airplanes for sale (daydreaming) and checking out a few football forums and generally surfing the web.  So, if this review seems a bit too negative, that's not really intended.  I like it.That said, a would-be buyer needs to understand what it is that he is getting, and what that is, is something of a media machine that requires you conform to Apple's way of doing things, a very good little web surfboard and a pretty neat little toy.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "People Who Actually Use iPads Tend to Like Them - A Lot", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R1CQWBNZ65EW9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone.[Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it \"used too much power.\" The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]In my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.This is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer.You have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)The speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything.Video playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.Third party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever.As for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).Be careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.It goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.As for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h.264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.If you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.This is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.If I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.I don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.In summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fast, Gorgeous, but Heavy", "Author": "Daniel G.

With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone.Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate.Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view.Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size.Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected.The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right.I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device.I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen.Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading.Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books.But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach).And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly useful and convenient", "Author": "SteamaZon", "ReviewID": "RT09YBFAX8XKB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The PAD fills that nebulious space between a notebook and a smartphone.  Smartphones offer the ultimate in portability plus a camera and the ability to place calls.  Notebooks offer a reasonable amount of computing power plus an expectation of portability especially in the 13 to 15\" screen size areas.However, smart phones are very difficult to use because the screens ARE so small. Web browsing , reading and responding to email are a chore. Notebooks provide all the functionality of desktops except expandability and usually video cards required by high end games are lacking.  But even though they are transportable, for many simple functions that such as email and web browsing, they can be cumbersome to set up and take down.  Any larger screen size than 15\" and its unlikely it will leave home.  The cost of laptops has fallen considerably over the years and from being primarily a business tool, laptop owners use the machine as their primary computer for personal use.  The laptop is unobtrusive, can be moved from room to room especially if wireless internet is available, and does not have the dearth of cords and junk that seems to easily collect around an embedded laptop.  Still, in spite of its portability, many people would just rather leave the laptop behind if their travels do not require work specific needs.Sensing a need for an email machine, web browser and the ability to run regular programs should the need arise, the computer industry introduced the low cost NETBOOK. There was certainly some interest in these machines as they allowed a very convenient way of checking email and web browsing while traveling around town without the bulk of a laptop.  A NETBOOK could literally be folded up and placed in a purse or cargo pants pocket.However, consumers soon noticed limitations and annoyances about the NETBOOKS.  Durability was in question.  Cheap production meant a cheap product which easily broke down.  Installs of software had to be downloaded or an external drive hooked up to it. The screen was small and especially for older eyes, hard to read and make out was was being viewed.NETBOOKS were still computers and required all the maintenance of one: anti-virus had to be installed / updated or else it was susceptible for infections by any type of badware.  Startup programs had to be monitored to insure \"too much junk\" was not loading or its already slow boot times would be further impeded.  Many programs ran sluggishly, creaking along primarily on ATOM processors.  The Windows 7 Starter edition was a crippled version of Windows 7, lacking functions and the ability to run certain  programs which ran under \"normal\" Windows 7, diminishing some of its expected capability.Though the NETBOOK could be taken anywhere, its optimistic battery times were usually half its advertised rate under real world operations and begged still for the presence of a desk or other table like furniture to set up upon for proper control and use of the cursor.And then Apple announces the iPAD, a tablet style computer.  Tablets existed before and many of them were just morphed Windows machines into the tablet form factor with styluses that often found their way into toilets, sewer grates, and dog maws.  And a Windows tablet is typically priced 20 to 30% higher than a corresponding laptop.  It seemed a little overkill to check email and web-surf.Few guessed how well the iPAD might sell. SuperGeeks decried the lack of a true USB port, camera and the fact DOSBoX could not be installed nor a game controller, let alone a boot configuration into Linux.  They foresaw little use for such a device and predicted its utter failure.  But since its release a little less than a million a month have been selling.  Granted the Flash, Python, MySql, sed, XCode, and Linux demographic were entirely ignored; but the habitual e-mailers and Websurfing crowd was not.  And especially at these two tasks, the device excelled. Add in some other useful tasks such as e-reading, to include comic books (previously a chore on a PC or even Mac with incessant mouse / key scrolling / zooming and clicking), and some games with various other programs and the iPAD became an overnight sensation.At once other companies began to announce various tablets of their own.  Microsoft and HP each announced products based on Windows 7, but bailed when it became apparent their technology and Windows could not deliver what they originally envisioned.  Other companies instead decide to work with the Android OS, already in use on phones and scale-up to tablet seemed much more promising.This is all fine and good, a summary of this slice of industry from my viewpoint--so HOW does the PAD benefit me?1.=The iPAD is available NOW (though not on Amazon at a reasonable price YET).  Announced products that are canceled or have uncertain release dates are of little use.2. = The iPAD is unbelievably portable and unlike a smartphone, the screen quite readable.3.= I have not read a comic book in years.  This allows a small collection available at all times.4.= The entire works of Shakespeare are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.5.= Scads of translations of the Bible are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.6.= The Quran available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. Jewish friends may be upset  because they don't see the Torah's Icon, but remind them the 16 translations of the the Bible's first five books is the Torah. And FREE. Also the type can be enlarged.7.= If  WiFi is there, the WEB is there.8. = EMAIL is very easily accessed, ALL ACCOUNTS.  If one has multiple accounts, the iPADs interface makes it easy to monitor them without going around to various websites to log in and out of them9.= Drawing / sketch apps allow direct sketching on the screen.  Previous technology required cabled Wacom tablets or a Wacomized computer with propitiatory stylus.10. = Artists often make use of reference material to better paint or draw an accurate representation of an object.  Researching on a computer usually requires the expected Google search (or library visit in the olden days).  Once an image was found, it had to be added to a paint program, resized and printed out then taken over to the work area. The iPAD  allows one to go to Safari, pull up an image, save it, then go into the photo album and resize it for easy display viewing while it is being painted or drawn paint it.  Other pictures of various subjects can be switched over to easily.  The iPAD's size and the fact it has no spill vulnerable keyboard, makes for an easy unobtrusive. insertion next to an artists work area.I give the product 5 stars less one for, well I'm REALLY trying to knock it down one star, OK maybe for the lack of a USB port for printing to my non wireless printer, and perhaps some nuanced things like the included NOTES text program--no re-sizable fonts, or that I cannot delete spam without opening the email first.  But it is really hard to deduct that star.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy an iPad yet!", "Author": "C.

I went with the 16 gig wifi only model as I didn't want to shell a lot out of pocket and the bonus barely covered the cost.  While I like the device from a \"coolness\" perspective, I have found that over the past month of use that the lack of flash support makes the device nearly useless for effective web surfing.  I would estimate that nearly 80 to 90 percent of run of the mill sites use some form of flash that makes them crippled on the iPad.  Try going to any of the national chain restaurant websites, (fFriday's, Chilis, Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings) and it's likely that you'll end up not being able to view much if anything.  Many sports news sites or general new sites have huge holes in their pages where flash is supposed to be running.  Even with all the other nice bells and whistles, and the hundreds of thousands of apps available, this one drawback makes it tough for me to recommend the iPad to someone who expects a full web browsing experience from a portable tablet based device.  As for use as a laptop replacement for business purposes, the options in the app store for MS Office compatible software for editing word, excel and PowerPoint docs are quote broad, but not a single one let's you edit in any form that is close to the full blown desktop software, especially PowerPoint which I use extensively.  Logmein Ignition picks up the slack however in giving me access to my work laptop when I am away, albeit it's tough sometimes positioning the mouse on the laptop's screen accurately.  It will allow me though to leave my laptop at home on short business trips as long as I have wifi where I am.  I am going to add on a MiFi hotspur from one of the major carriers to allow me access anywhere rather than having gotten the 3G version, which allows me to pick the vendor of choice and upgrade to 4g or whatever newer technology comes out.  The lack of cameras is glaring considering all android based devices are seemingly coming out with them in their first gen offerings.  My hope is that e next gen iPads have dual cameras to support FaceTime and other video chatting software.  I also hope they work something out with adobe so that flash support comes to the iPad.  Without it, I am definitely leaning towards an android based device as an \"upgrade\" from the iPad because viewing the web is to me what these devices are supposed to do well and the iPad falls way short of acceptable.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "No ATT Service anywhere if your billing ZIP doesn't have 3G", "Author": "Mac Fan", "ReviewID": "R12HQMALGJ3BLI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When the iPad 3G became available it seemed to be an ideal solution for us to use when traveling away from our home in northern New Mexico.  We knew that ATT 3G service was not available in our immediate area, but that was not important because we planned to use the iPad either with the WIFI in our home and or when we were traveling to a place with 3G. Because we could get a data plan on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment it seemed workable.Unfortunately, when we tried to sign up for ATT service before a trip to CA, we found a glitch in both the ATT and Apple plan.  iPad software will not allow users in an area without 3G to sign up, as determined by the billing ZIP code.When we called ATT and asked how to get around this problem, we were told that the only way was to apply for a credit card with a ZIP code in an area with service.  When I suggested that was a nutty suggestion, the ATT representative told me that the problem was really Apple's and gave me their contact number.Apple, of course, immediately told me that I should contact ATT as this was their problem.  When the Apple representative learned that ATT had no reasonable solution, Apple admitted that I was out of luck for using the iPad in the way we wanted.  It is impossible to believe that neither Apple nor ATT had encountered this problem, but ATT service really seems unavailable.As a result, iPad 3G buyers in areas without 3G coverage in their billing ZIP code end up with a larger, and much more expensive, but fancy version of an iPod.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "WiFi abysmal", "Author": "Jochen Lauterbach \"jochen157\"", "ReviewID": "R29WAYP3PQNPH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The IPad constantly drops my WiFi connection, both at home at at work, that works just fine with three Windows 7 laptops and one Macbook.

So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it \"magical\" and \"revolutionary\"?Well, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!--Overview:I really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.--Hardware:There's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.The processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.Battery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.I have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.Just a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.--Web Browsing & EmailTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.Even on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.--The ApplicationsThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The \"Numbers\" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.--iBook Store/ReaderThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).--I really wish it had...I really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube.A camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.--The Accessories:The iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize.I really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.The iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.If you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).--A note about iPhone OS 4:Apple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year.Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent multipurpose device", "Author": "David C. Walls", "ReviewID": "R1F7NKJBQLVB4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In this review, I compare the iPad to 5 other devices I own, use, and love: the Sony Reader, the Amazon Kindle 1 and 2, the iPod Touch, and a laptop.  As you likely know, the iPad fills a niche that is between an ebook reader or similar device and a laptop or netbook.  Although there are an enormous number of apps available for the iPad, it definitely does not have the full range of function of a laptop. For example, I use my laptop for programming using MS Visual Studio, web development with Dreamweaver, and graphic work with Photoshop and Illustrator.  The iPad can be made to do a little bit of all of these functions, but for any large or complex work of that nature, a full-scale computer it the right device.With that said, I find a similar distinction between my smaller devices (the ebook readers and the iPod touch) and the iPad.  I love my Kindle(s) and will not give them up, however, the big advantage I find in the iPad over those readers is the larger size and the additional functionality.  The Kindle is still my preferred device for reading ebooks that were created as ebooks, but I now use the iPad for reading pdf documents. If you have ever struggled with trying to load pdfs onto an ereader, I strongly suggest you try the iPad.  For most pdfs, there is not even a need to use one of the many programs that help squeeze them down or trim their margins, etc.  Most pdfs can easily be read at their native size on the iPad, and moving the document or zooming slightly can be accomplished much more easily and quickly on the iPad as compared to the ereaders.The screen on the iPad is, frankly, better than I expected for reading.  After nearly 30 years of working with computers, I instanly loved the eink display (as in the Kindle, Sony, etc.) the first time I used it.  It still provides a better visual image for reading than the iPad as long as you have adequate lighting.  However, the iPad screen is as good or better than the best monitor I have used.  It tends not to give much eye strain even after extended periods of reading.  Of course, it is backlit, which is good and bad -- good because you can use it in most situations except for very bright light, e.g. direct sunlight.  The bad it that when you are reading, you are also looking directly into an artificial light source, and, eventually, that will cause eye strain for just about everyone.The iPad also has many other functions that it performs very much better than ereaders.  For example, it makes a very sericeable web browser, with the *big* exception that it cannot display flash videos or animations.  It also does not support MS Silverlight (an environment similar to Flash) as of February, 2011, although one never knows what will happen in the future.Finally, I have found the iPod Touch (and equivalently, the iPhone) to be a very hand device that I can easily carry in my pocket that provides some ereading capability, some web browsing capability, and the ability to run numerous apps, albeit on quite a small screen.  The iPad does all of these things, barring slipping into my pocket, and does them better.  I still carry the iPod in my pocket for quick access to my contacts, my calendar, my task list, etc., but as soon as I am indoors, the iPod goes away in favor of the iPad.  One last point with respect to the iPod Touch or iPhone vs. the iPad -- the former devices have a mirror-shiny finish on the back, which is beautiful when you take it out of the box, but it is absolutely impossible to keep it scratch-free without using some kind of protective cover.  So, with those devices, no matter how careful you intend to be, your choices are to keep it in a cover or live with scratches.  The iPad, on the other hand, has a matte finish on the metal back.  I have no dooubt the it, too, will accumulate tiny scratches if left uncovered, by they are much less likely to be seen and to diminish the lovely design of the iPad.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Glad I didn't wait", "Author": "Richard Stone \"Unity New Thought\"", "ReviewID": "R3FC7E8UCA0Z9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought long and hard about waiting to look at the next generation of the iPad, and at the competitors that are coming out. However, I decided to go ahead and buy the iPad now, partially because I hate to wait for anything...What I've learned so far about the next generation of the iPad is that it will have two cameras, a flat back, even better resolution, and it will be faster.Two Cameras: First of all, I can't imagine using this large (for a camera) as a camera, especially since I have both a Nikon DSLR and a Nikon point-and-shoot. I will use the iPad for a lot of things, but have no need for it to be a camera. I do see the use of the camera with Skype or some other such service, but I have that capability on my desktop computer and don't use it, so I don't think I would use it on the iPad either.Speed: I don't doubt that it will be faster, but the iPad I have is so fast, it's hard for me to see the advantage in waiting for one that's a little bit faster. I also understand that much of the speed will be used to run a high-resolution screen which probably will negate any apparent gains in operating speed.Resolution: I also don't doubt that it will have a high-resolution, but again, the resolution on the iPad I have is so high, I have doubts that I would be able to tell the difference.Slimmer Size: slimmer is better, but my iPad is quite slim as it is, so once again I didn't think it was worth waiting for.Other Models: There a lot of models that have arrived already, and will be arriving in the near future. However, if the iPad versus other brands turns out like the the iPhone and iPod versus other brands, they won't match the refinement, ease-of-use, and overall exceptional quality of the iPad. I have a Droid X and I like it a lot. It does everything I wanted it to do, and I'm satisfied with it. However, the Droid X is a Dodge Viper, mean looking and loud, while the iPhone is a Mercedes, sleek, powerful and efficient.The iPad comes out with a new model about once a year. The second-generation model will have incremental improvements, but the third-generation coming out about a year will likely have major improvements. The model I have just might wind up on eBay if that's true.One further comment on waiting for the Next Great Thing, if you do, you'll wait forever because there's always something bigger, faster, and better coming down the pike.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A seductive device but not for everyone", "Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R2V0CP3XZ4X2ZJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really drawn to to the iPad after playing with it at Best Buy. I had been waiting for a long time to see what kind of Android tablets would come out but finally gave up on hoping for one that would have the same responsive interface as the iPad and received one as an early Christmas present.I'm an art student and the thought was that I would be able to use the iPad to take quick color sketches and play video games on the go without toting my entire compliment of materials and a laptop around. In theory it seemed much better than any kind of tablet PC alternative since its small enough to go everywhere but big enough for me to see what I'm drawing. In practice though it really didn't work that well for drawing, even with top rated painting apps and a stylus. So lets break it down into pros and cons.Prosportable- not as portable as an iphone but small enough that you can stick it in your backpack or purse and take it most places.3g- you're not likely to find a better deal for no-contract 3g service even with the 2 gb cap.interface- lets not forget the sweet responsive interface, the primary reason that you're probably thinking about buying an iPad and the main thing that sets it apart from a netbook.Reading- at least for reading an ebook, the iPad is much more comfortable to read on than a laptop or netbook. the page flipping animation as well helps to capture that. Though the advantages over an actual paper and ink \"book\" seem to be negligible. It can hold a large number of them, and really, how many books do you plan on reading in any given day anyway?Games- lots of fun games right at your fingertips, most of which are very inexpensive.ConsGames - lots of drek right at your fingertips, most of which tricks you into wasting between 1 and 5 dollars on it.viewing angle- being flat, its really hard to see the thing and type or let it rest in your lap without some sort of stand or keyboard attachment. If you're going to get a keyboard attachment for it though... why not just get a netbook for half the price.functionality- the iPad certainly has all the pieces parts to be as capable, if not more so than a standard netbook but its locked down under the oppressive rule of itunes.  While many things are much easier and more streamlined than on a regular PC, other relatively mundane tasks, like transferring files or signing pdf forms, will have you endlessly trudging through the app store.  The phrase \"there's an app for that\" is truly a double edged sword.SHINY!! as appealing as the shiny surface is in photos, people will think you have some sort of condition when they see you bobbing around trying to peer around your own silhouette while trying to watch a movie on the thing.cost- this is a big one, at least for a student like me. The thing isn't cheap.  Realistically you can get a pretty good laptop for the cost of an iPad, even the cheapest 16 GB one, yet you can't get anywhere near the same level of functionality out of it.BOTTOM LINEI had one for 27 days, for the first 2 weeks it was the greatest, most useful device on the planet. The next week I complained about how my wrists hurt from holding the iPad up to play angry birds and. Then I converted a bunch of comics from cbr to cbz and then to epub for the iBooks app because the cbr reader app sucks. Then I just went back to regular ol' paper comics. On the 27'th day I realized Lenovo was having a year end sale on laptops and I could replace my defunct laptop with a core i7 machine for less than I paid for the iPad. Luckily Target has a 90 day return policy and let me take it back without even asking to keep the 15% restocking fee. I got cash for a present instead and spent it on something useful.Keep in mind, no matter how sexy it looks, its still a little computer and like every other computer it's going to p**s you off at some point.  If you MUST get one, get it from some place where it's easy to return, take it for a test drive. If you're like me and you find that it's beginning to spend a significant amount of time on the shelf, take it back.

Simply put there is nothing magical about it. I have been using a windows-based tablet since 2003, and it has more advanced technology and capability than apple's 2010 Ipad. The biggest paradox is that despite people calling this the apple ipad tablet, it's not a tablet at all, you can't take hand-written notes on it. The one thing that would have been able to define a new category of device would have simply been that. Furthermore there is:no camera,no usb ports,no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),the on-screen keyboard is not practical,the screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,no card readers for your photos,no flash support for websites (rendering 50% of the web useless),there are wifi issues (connections dropped),the screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,no multitasking supportridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)it's very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)it will set you back $600 (the price of a full-featured laptop)I could go on for a while but I'll just stop here. What is frustrating is that Apple obviously has the technology to include these things easily, so it was purely a short-term business decision on their end. For the moment, they are blatantly exploiting certain consumers' willingness-to-pay for the ipad. They are taking advantage of their brand recognition and marketing power to extract revenues from a purposely made sub-par product. The only way to stop this type of behavior is to either stop buying bad products (sounds easy but people aren't always rational), or wait until competition kicks in over the next six months. I hope this business plan doesn't come back to bite them in the end, in my opinion they are definitely playing with fire on this one.On the plus side because of these omissions, it's simple (a grandma could use it), it's fast (but this is because it doesn't run a real operating system) it has ok battery (9 hours) and it's thin (although not light, you will get tired of holding it after 5 minutes).In one sentence: You're paying $600-1000 for a semi-portable web-browser which gives you access to about 30% of the web.Hope that helps you make up your own mind, I returned mine after 48 hours.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great device, some seriously rough edges", "Author": "C. Franz", "ReviewID": "R2V9CCYVREDATA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I returned the iPad to Apple store today", "Author": "odamae", "ReviewID": "R24BZGVLRVUYWW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I jumped on the iPad craze and purchased a 32GB on launch date- I was excited about this device as a way to read books online and to surf the net.

I do not have this problem with other wireless devices and the signal is always strong/excellent.

When I first bought it, I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, and for the first month or so it languished, just a huge version of my beloved iPod Touch. Too heavy to use as an e-reader. I love the keyboard but not for writing long or multiple emails. And then slowly over time I started to find uses for it, until at this point I would miss it very  much if I didn't have it. It's a tedious process to find the apps that you want and will use, but it's worth taking the time to search. Everything looks so good on this thing! I keep it by my bedside and use it as a quick reference device after the primary computer has been put to sleep in the living room.

Much like a giant iPhone/iPod Touch, and in fact, if the iPod Touch had 3G and was 4x the size, I don't think you could tell the difference.The device shares the same OS (or a slight variation of it) and most of the iPhone/iPod Touches built in apps (although some are slightly modified such as Mail and Contacts to better fit the large screen).A great touch is that it runs MOST of the iPhone apps. Most? not all?? No -- some apps (I've figured out the hard way) are designed for iPhone only and will simply NOT WORK on the iPad. Be sure to check apps ahead of time to avoid disappointment! Emulation is decent, giving the option of either \"boxing\" around a 100% sized screen or \"2x doubling\" which fills the iPad screen. You either get the best quality at a lower size, or a full screen at a lower quality - a poor tradeoff (also, running iPhone apps at 4x their intended size looks very odd in some cases -- skype turns the iPad into a 10\" phone display that looks like one of those joke remote controls they sell with the 4\" buttons). iPad apps make much better used of the available space, but so far those apps are behind the iPhone counterparts that have been in development for years (and usually cost a bit more!).One big disappointment of running iPhone apps on the iPad are that they don't run the same! Photo editing apps, for example, save all photos at 640x480 on the iPad (but full resolution even on the original iPhone 2G). To edit photos and keep them at full resolution you need to use iPad specific apps (which again are not up to the point of iPhone apps).Much like the iPhone, almost everything needs to be done through iTunes (transferring movies and music, updating, syncing), so those of you who hate the program will need to just suck it  up for this one (even on my newer quad-core PC iTunes is a big resource hog, so I understand the pain!).The 3 sizes available (16GB, 32GB and 64GB) are before formatting - you get about 59GB usable on the 64GB model (which is expected if you've ever purchased a hard drive). Unfortunately there isn't any other storage option available, so if you buy 16GB and need more you'll need to delete stuff to free space.Overall speed of the product is very nice - I only have the original iPhone (2G) and with all of the updates over the last couple years it's really slowed it down. The iPad is blazing fast now, but I wonder how long it'll be before OS updates slow it down and you need the the 2nd generation iPad to get that speed back. Also, a big problem with the iPod Touch are that updates cost between $5-10. Will the same hold true for the iPad?The device is great for movies.. sometimes. It's closer to a 4:3 (fullscreen) aspect ratio than the iPhone (widescreen) so widescreen movies WILL display black bars (and those 2.40:1 movies like the Matrix will be mostly black bars). Movies will also quickly fill the iPad (coming in around 1.5 - 2.5GB a piece).Sound is a bit better than the iPhone, but still in a very poor position (one speaker, located at the bottom right of the iPad) - You'll want headphones for this thing.Wifi is nice, but what about away from the house? the option to even get 3G is another $129. On top of that you need to purchase a monthly plan (fortunately no contract!). Unfortunately, just a month or so after release, ATT has killed the option for Unlimited 3G and replaced it with a 2GB cap (you also have a 250MB plan available for a few bucks less). People who purchase the iPad by 6/7/2010 will be able to purchase the Unlimited plan but will only have the 250MB/2GB plan available if they cancel the unlimited plan and want to sign up again).A big disappointment are the included accessories. You'd expect something to come with it for the outrageous price it costs, right? No case, no dock, no headphones. Just a USB cable and wall adapter. Expect to cough up way more than necessary for a dock, headphones, case, etc.. I went with the A-frame for Ipad and Belkin F8N277tt Pleated Sleeve for iPad - Black , both very nice accessories.A great thing about it is being able to use the web without a computer. No more booting up the PC or bringing the laptop out of standby. The iPad is 'always on' and just takes a click to use it. That's the big selling point for me. The downside is that you lose all other functionality of a PC and have to resort to using available apps (more $$).A bit selling point for me was the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit - being able to plug my DSLR into it, download photos, edit them using iPad apps and then upload them to flickr from anywhere! Problem is, the kit is more $$ (why not just add a USB slot to the thing?), the memory card adapter is SD only (not the popular Compact Flash found in DSLRs, so those people (myself) will need to plug a USB cable from the camera to the iPad camera kit to the iPad to download photos). More stuff to carry around!There are some very cool apps on it - I love being able to hold movies on a larger device than an iPhone. I love being able to put all my photos on there. I love being able to browse the web from anywhere. For that, I give it 4 stars.A couple last disappointments - the things a bit heavy (1.5LBs) and hard to angle anywhere. Trying to watch a movie and hold it isn't fun, and the stands aren't perfect (or usable in all situations). It's also big -- a little too big! Unlike an iPhone which can always be in your pocket, this thing needs its own bag that you have to bring with you.It's much like cameras -- a Point & shoot gets the job done and can go with you everywhere. A DSLR does a much better job, but being so bulky you can't take it with you all the time.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Am I An Elitists Because I Love My iPad?", "Author": "Vincent E.

For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the \"Apple iPad\" does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?I was enamored with the \"Apple iPad\" the moment is was announced because I saw the potential in the portable e-book reader that not only offered more memory than any other device on the market, but also offered up a full color widescreen display, Wi-Fi or 3G wireless, access to hundreds of applications, a web browser, music player, GPS address book, calendar, e-mail reader.I know, I know, it lacks support for Adobe Flash as a fellow iPad elitists recently pointed out, but I don't miss it.  There has only been one instance where I could not play a video on my \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi;\" that to me does not constitute a crisis, nor does it diminish the considerable functionality the device brings to the hand.  And, I know, I know, the device does not multi-task, but the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is not a computer it is an e-book reader that also does other functions.  I have a laptop and desktop if I want to multi-task.The iPad 64GB Wi-Fi FactsThe Ultra-Portable, 1.5lbs (1.6lbs if 3G is installed) \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick \"iPad\" you'll find the screen lock and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The silver-bodied \"iPad\" can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR is also provided.The 9.7-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The \"Ipad\" is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.First ImpressionsI really, really, really, like my new Apple \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi.\" Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public like I did today!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.iBooks the e-book reader that is specially designed to work with the \"iPad\" is not preloaded unto the device, I had to download it from the iTunes Store; not a big deal.  Once downloaded e-books can be download either directly (through iBooks) or via iTunes.When I connect the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" to my computer and launch iTunes, it automatically sync's the two transferring any e-books I may have bought into iTunes.  Conversely, any e-books I purchase via iTunes are synced with the \"iPad\" automatically.Hands down, the Apple \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (699.00 for the Wi-Fi 64GB; hey its $100.00 more to add 3G), but I think it is well worth the cost.  I wanted 64GB in order to have room to download app, music, e-books, and images without concern about running out of space.  This is especially true since you cannot add memory to the \"iPad.\"So far the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.

And yes, it is over-priced.PLUSES+ Display is bright and sharp. A joy to behold.+ Compared with a traditional laptop, it is and feels quite lightweight, and therefore convenient to carry.+ Flash memory means that it wakes up in a matter of seconds.

No more pecking awkwardly with your fingers.+ The more powerful processor means that it performs perceptibly better than the iPhone 4 on similar tasks.NEGATIVES- Light though it is, it is still inconvenient to use it for extended periods of time in your hands. You will need to place it on a surface at some point.- The lack of an in-built stand means you will have a terrible time viewing the screen in a brightly lit room. You will need to buy a third-party accessory.- The iTunes software is a frustration-laden nightmare to use. Version 10 does nothing to improve matters. If you have multiple Apple devices, managing them effectively with iTunes is next to impossible. Knowing which apps are syYou never know when a right-click is available, where it is not, when to use drag-and-drop, and when to use the menu. Needless to say, it is the weakest link in this chain.- The lack of a right-click gesture.- The lack of tooltips and the equivalent of mouse-hovers. You get so used to hovering your mouse over a link or text or image and seeing more information about that markup that you sorely miss it on the iPad. Especially when browsing. You sometimes feel like you are taking a step in the darkness when you click on a link that you don't know what it is going to lead to.- The automatic content orientation from portrait to landscape does not work quite as well or as expected. If you place your iPad on a flat surface and then rotate it by 90 degrees, the iPad, most of the time, does not automatically change the orientation of the content. You have to pick up the tablet and hold it at a slightly tilted angle, of say 30 degrees or more, for the content to reorient itself. Minor quibble.- You need to connect the iPad into a wall outlet to charge it. Evidently you cannot charge the iPad by connecting the USB cable into your laptop.- The closed, walled world of the iPad. No Flash, no Java. Yes, you can use your browser for most things, but if you want to use apps, then the iTunes stores it is. Yes, the store provides some assurance of safety and protection from malware, but this closed worldview is a regressive one, and reminds one of Microsoft's attempts in the 1990s to wall off its Windows users from the internet. Microsoft failed then. Apple could well fail now.- Price. The iPad, even at its cheapest, at $499, feels overpriced. You can get full-featured laptops for that price, with more RAM, more hard disk, a bigger screen, a physical keyboard, USB ports to plug in external devices into, no limitations on Flash or Java, your choice of software to install, and more...The FutureConsider this. A laptop with Flash memory and without optical drives, if well designed, could weigh just as much as an iPad. Innovate a bit more and provide a sliding keyboard so that you can use a physical keyboard when you want to, and which also allows you to place your laptop on a flat surface with the screen tilted, and you have an iPad competitor.What Apple has managed to do is bring an unprecedented level of architectural integration competence and a very viable third-party commercial ecosystem to the world of its devices, in the form of the iTunes App Store. This, more than anything else, will prove to be a formidable barrier to competition.

I've never really owned many apple products and have always been more of a \"PC guy\", but I decided to try the ipad out and have now owned the 16GB Wifi version for 3 months. There has not been a day that I have not used it... I guess that means I would have to be counted in the \"love it\" group.Yes, the ipad has it's flaws - which undoubtedly have been covered in great detail in the other 150+ reviews, so I won't go into much detail about them. Yes, I wish it could handle Flash, multitasking (which will be added with iOS4 this Fall), and it could definitely use a camera (or 2). Yes, it's basically a big ipod touch and a netbook would be more powerful, more capable, and seem to make more sense.Despite these short-comings, the ipad has a convenience factor about it that makes it extremely appealing. Being able to pick up the device and have it turn completely on in about 1 second is something no netbook or computer can offer. Being able to lay in bed and hold the ipad like a book while surfing the web, watching movies, playing games, reading magazines, putting together a document for work, shopping, etc. is fantastic and just wouldn't be the same on the tiny screen of an ipod touch or while having a netbook laying on your stomach. Perhaps soon some android tablets will offer what the ipad does and more, but as of yet, no other tablet/netbook even comes close to offering the convenience and appeal that the ipad offers. The interface is extremely smooth and I've become addicted to shopping in the curated app store. It's much easier to navigate and find apps than in the cluttered android marketplace. I've even found that I love some of the games offered - something I never imagined myself using the ipad for.As for the Wifi vs 3G debate, I can only say that I'm pleased I went with Wifi because it rarely leaves my house. Even if I do take it somewhere else, there is usually Wifi available and if not and I need 3G access somewhere, I have my phone. I'm equally happy I went with 16GB, because I haven't even come close to filling it up even with a medium sized music/video library and tons of apps.As for the ipad vs a kindle - I've owned both the DX and ipad. I love both, but find myself using the ipad more just because of the wide variety of things to do. The kindle does have the advantage of the e-ink screen. If my eyes feel \"tired\" or if I'm in sunlight, the kindle is definitely what I reach for. I've found myself using the kindle app on the ipad a ton though. It's fantastic that I can buy books from amazon and keep my kindle library on the ipad. I do wish amazon would sell magazines through their kindle app like they do on the kindle though. There are other options on the ipad like Zinio, but I feel it's an area that amazon could really thrive in.A device that I haven't been able go a day in the last 3 months without picking up for hours on end deserves no less than 5 stars in my mind. The ipad hasn't replaced my computer, but it has opened up a new area in my life that I don't think I could go without now... okay, I could but I don't want to.

Nine months later I sold it on eBay (a woman in Russia bought it). Why? First, iPad is for consumption, not for producing any content. At the time I did not have a notebook, and I need to send, not only receive emails. iPad has no keyboard and is bad for this. Even after I bought the external Bluetooth Apple keyboard, it was still way too cumbersome. Second, the Wi-Fi reception is not sensitive - Apple Macbooks get much better signal at the same hotspots; I have compared. Third, Wi-Fi alone is not enough. One needs the 3G/4G connection now and then. But this means paying ATT for a second service on top of my iPhone. I refuse. iPad should allow the iPhone to be plugged in to share the 3G network. Fourth, it is cumbersome to get files into the device, needing either iTunes or email. This is inconvenient.Fifth, I discovered I just don't like a touch interface. There, I said it. With the iPhone, it's clearly necessary but for a bigger device, I prefer keyboard and mouse. Touch on the iPad is imprecise and often does not respond immediately. Often necessary to press a spot several times to get a response, or it will not accept input. Frustrating and I'm mystified why more people don't complain about this. The good things about iPad include the long battery life. The iPad is wonderful for many purposes - schools to replace books - but it's not for everyone.********Update added June 2011. After selling my first iPad, I bought an iPad2 recently to try again. I like it better this time, partly because I now have a MacBook Air also and no longer expecting the iPad2 to be something it's not such as a platform for typing memos. I just use it now to read email and the news in bed, and to read journal articles and magazines. And to carry photos. And for Facetime. This is what it's designed for. Also, the iPad2 is slightly thinner which does make it noticeably easier to handle and the software has been smoothed up. I still feel a bit ripped off that I can't share the 3G connection between my iPhone and iPad; after all, I cannot use both at once so why not use the minutes on the device in use at the moment? Also I would REALLY like to see a USB port to read files on a USB drive. Finally I would like to see the iPad integrated with the MacBook; one would detach the display and it would switch over to being an iOS device. Maybe Apple will offer that someday. Modular devices with integrated services would be much better for consumers. I'm raising the stars rating.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy decision", "Author": "Robert C.

Sure, it's not the first tablet out there, but this year all anyone can talk about is a tablet, what's better, why to get an iPad, why not to get an iPad... I'm not sure when all the Apple hatred started, for me it was a lifelong obsession.  I grew up on DOS, moved to windows 3.11... I hated apple on principle.  I had an epiphany one night as I struggled to use my windows laptop and finally discovered that all those great things a windows based pc can do... I never use! So I switched to apple. My iMac replaced my unrelisble desktop.  My iPhone then replaced my irritating blackberry.  Then my iPod nano replaced my buggy zine (and iTunes replaced the ever changing nightmarish zine software - seriously, the original version was perfection MS, but alas). I had but one problem, my laptop.  I didn't want to do the full on laptop thing, since apple laptops have one of the same problem as all other laptops... Battery life.  For me, my laptop comes out when I travel, or want to window shop in the living room, but otherwise it gets put away in favor of my far superior desktop.  What I wanted was a laptop that I can pick up and go with.  Here is the iPad.  Me and a few friends got iPads, and now we have them all the time.  None of us ever carried around a laptop with us unless we were traveling.  Now, we have them at all times.The question for many is: can it replace my laptop.  The real question should be, can your laptop replace your iPad? I see far more iPad wielding corporate soldiers in the coffee shops now days, snickering at the laptop relic holder that runs in to plug his laptop in, not sure if he put it on sleep or power save mode before he left the house.  No, my iPad can't do more.  It can't play world of Warcraft or command and conquer.  But do you leave the house to do those things... No? Then why do you want your iPad to do it? Sure the iPad has games, but unless your a card game addict, it's only there to keep you busy for about a half hour while you can't do much else. Otherwise, I challenge you to find something I can't do.  Don't bring up flash, it was a sore issue at first, but since I found out either the anti iPad people are lying to me about the need for flash, or I just get lucky, I have found 1, yeah that's right 1 site that I don't get to play with, and it was just doing a search for a homework assignment and I found the site to be bogus on my desktop... Oh well.  HTML 5 is here and it's kicking butt. Flash has been on the edge for almost 4 years as devs looked for better ways to do Internet... And the iPad has ushered the revolution.  To think that this little device changed the Internet...I have complaints.  The first is that I am addicted to this thing.  It goes everywhere with me from the garage (how to vids) to the bathroom (why not watch a little Netflix or YouTube while I... Er... Download).  The second is that it is missing some things. It needs that camera on there.  IPad video chatting should be a next big step.  I want an sd slot for this thing, rather than be forced to shell out extra money for the bigger drive. The last thing I want is a screen lock switch.  It is funny to look at a photo and turn the photo to a different angle to look at something , only to have the screen adjust back to how it was in the first place.The best things... Simplicity, durability, longevity.  This is what makes it so much better than a laptop.  Simplicity makes it lessaggravating than a standard computer. You would be surprised at the durability of this thing (my 5 and 6 year olds play games on it all the time).  But the most significant factor is the longevity.  The advertised 10 hours is a lie.  I have not charged mine in two days, and I use nearly every waking hour.  Movies, airplay, dictation, games, everything... It's at 33% right now.  As a consumer I would have never even thought about an iPad if my laptop could go on batteries this long, I could have dealt with the frustration and blue screens all day long if I had power.  The iPad lasts forever. That is the number one selling point to me.  You will be surprised to see how much you can do if you don't have to plug in all the time.All this being said, if you can afford it... Get it, if you can't, sorry.From my iPad", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Complicated to Review, nice product, depends on the future & Apps", "Author": "BruceK", "ReviewID": "R3UC053Y6SW0S0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my iPad about 2 months after they came out and I had a chance to see it operate at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA.  Surprisingly after having bad experiences with other palm type devices and the Kindle, I found I liked it.For a \"Window to the Internet\" which is the main use I found for it, it works fairly well.  A major problem with the iPad, and a major problem with all computers and the Internet, the WWW, is the display size.  Many web pages are not designed with any kind of logic or order about the screen.  For example, I find the blogs I read to be just slightly too wide to adjust comfortably on my iPad screen so that I do not have to scroll horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling for each line is what needs to be avoided.  It is possible to read things on the iPad just fine, but not if they are in a window that is too wide for the text size.  Ideally a newspaper column width where the text can be expanded and vertically scrolled is really idea.My favorite App so far is the Kindle reader for iPad.  Conspicuously missing the text-to-speech facility on a real Kindle, it is a visual only reader.  I do not like that there is no way to number the pages, but the Kindle experience is much better on an iPad than it is on the Kindle. I always say that I would more often want to read in the dark with a back lit screen that I would on a beach in the bright sunlight with monochrome e-paper.  The Apple reader I can do without.  I suspect that Apple and Amazon may partner to change the face of publishing, Apple in H/W and Amazon in distribtuion and content management.Which brings me to the frightful mess, but getting slightly better, that is iTunes.  The iTunes interface is ... well, honestly, terrible.  If you go to the ITunes store it is so slow and impossible to negotiate that they think only when someone really needs to buy something and knows what they want would they use it.  I buy audiobooks from the Apple store that are not available anywhere else, but I hate the experience, and the reviews and customer feedback is not helpful at all.My main App for fun is the online Backgammon game which I really enjoy being a backgammon fanatic.  The finger taps often seem to misregister ... I don't know if that is the problem of the iPad hardware or the program, but it has provided a lot of entertainment and brain stimulation.In general though the Apps are terrible and underwhelming, and following the trail of ITunes the App store is awful.  There are so many apps and so little or none useful feedback on what is good and so much disinformation that I just do not get anything that is not free.  I need a audio recorder App, but there are so many and the ones I have tried are clumsy and irritating.There is hardly anything to just take notes with.The email client is not that great and has the same problems as the Apple desktop OS version.All the Apps are so stripped down there seems to be no good help for any of them and most try to be too cool or cute.  I just want a simple interface to jot down some notes sometimes, or to record audio at a meeting or in some situation that I want to remind myself of something.Despite all the drawbacks, I believe the iPad is going to succeed despite itself.  What is lacks in some aspects can be made up for in multiple ways.  For example people complained about the lack of Flash, which I don't care about, but then ABC and other websites have some up with their own Apps to watch video on.  I watched episodes of \"Lost\" on the iPad and it is fantastic.  I am disappointed that Hulu.Com wants to charge a subscription for their content,but I guess they have to compete with NetFlicks.The Skype application works too, so you can use the iPad as a telephone, clumsy as it may feel.  I do not have the 4G3G ... whatever G is the one that is sold optionally with the iPad, and do not miss it.  The object was to get something fast, versatile, relatively cheap and easy with no recurring costs ... and for that I love the iPad.I carry around about 180 audio books that I have ripped myself as well as some music and stuff I bought from the iTunes store despite it's faults.  All in all this thing is a great tool for many things.  I recommend the Ipad to people who invetsigate it and find they can use it.  Don't buy it just to be cool, it really is a tool, and as such it can be very very useful, and will be more so in the future if Apple can get some of the faults out of it.The one thing that sticks with me is the impression one gets of Apple when one enters the Apple world.  I have an iMac, iPod and an iPad now.  I never bought Apple before about a year ago, but I like the UNIX OS underlying, and the ergononomics and ease of use.  My 24\" screen iMac is just a joy to use.  My iPad complements that along with the Ipod ... BUT, Apple makes some some bad design choices and they refuse, maybe out of arrogance to fix them or do anything about them.  This is my on worry about the future of the iPad ... bad management decisions can kill a product dead even if it is a great innovative idea.Oh ... then there is battery life.  In all the months I have owned the iPad so far I have only once or twice gotten the battery down to about 40%.  For me, I find there is no danger of running out of juice and the battery life is really great.  After using the iPad most of the day one day I fell asleep listening to an audiobook and woke up in the morning and the thing was still going.One other thing that makes the iPad so wonderful is that companies and groups are making use of it too, as I mentioned above with ABC.  NPR has a fantastic app that lets you run through all the news in the last few days ... or weeks ... and then add the audio stories to a playlist.  Then you can set the thing going and create your own content for hours.  When companies perfect this webcasting thing like NPR this will be the way of the future, and a device like the iPad will the way to access it.I do wish the iPad had a camera in it, GPS would be nice too.  A better mail client also.  Multitasking is supposed to be on the way later this year, although I find it is not really a problem the way it is.  Bugs are fixed fast, and there are improvements as well ... so all in all I have to give the iPad a 4/5 ... which I mean to be close to the 5 than the 4 ... this is a really innovative product for those that can use it.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad: I Knocked It Until I Tried It", "Author": "Michael Profit", "ReviewID": "R1XD9BUP838DUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the iPad was unveiled in January I initially felt very underwhelmed. The famed Apple Tablet, seemingly under production for a decade and now finally revealed, felt like a letdown: it ran the iPhone OS rather than Mac OS, it lacked sufficient hard drive space, and the on-screen icons were too small.Nonetheless, my curiosity remained at launch day, and I began to take a more serious interest based both on user reviews and my own personal needs. Trying the device out further solidified my interest, and this past weekend I reserved one and picked up my 32GB, Wi-Fi only model 24 hours later.The iPad fits my needs pefectly. I wanted a simple, consumption-oriented device that would allow me to watch my iTunes content, surf the internet, and would have access to applications that would further enhance it. The device would serve to supplement, but not replace, my laptop, would allow for instant access to the aforementioned features, and would be used daily. The iPad does all that for me and much more.Here are a few of my favorite features.Video looks superb; I've uploaded movies, TV shows, and video podcasts to my iPad, and each plays in high quality and without any hiccups. I particularly like the interface Apple selected for the video application, as the cover art for movies and TV shows is displayed in vibrant color; the video description feature, appearing to the left of the cover art, is a nice touch as well.While watching video on the iPad I'm left only with a thin screen to hold, which elicits a much more comfortable viewing experience with less mass to deal with. Though I've only watched a few videos, I much prefer it to watching video on my laptop. Audio, too, is great, both without headphones (mono) and with (stereo).Safari, the iPad's internet browser, is what really sold me on the device during my first hands-on. It's been said before, but viewing an entire web page at once, without the need to zoom in and out, is incredible. Both text and pictures look sharp, and pages render quickly thanks to Apple's custom processor. The \"Bookmark Bar,\" a feature that can be toggled on and off in Settings, appears underneath the address bar and is a feature not available on the iPhone due to screen size limitations. I've found this to be really useful, and have added all of my bookmarks to it which allows for quick access to my favorite sites.Like the iPhone, however, page refreshes have become a nuisance when switching between tabs. I've grown used to it through browsing on my iPhone, however with such a large device I'd hoped it would be less of an issue. It's not significant enough to detract from the overall browsing experience for me, but it is something to be aware of for those who like to have multiple pages open at a time.Lastly, apps. The App Store has become a huge selling point for Apple, and it's hard to ignore the numbers Apple proudly boasts in its ads. I've uploaded both iPhone and iPad apps to the iPad, and both types play great. However, the difference in quality between the two is staggering, and I'm left reluctant to upload any more iPhone apps to the iPad. While the scaled quality of an iPhone app isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, it's difficult to choose an iPhone app over an HD iPad app after experiencing both.Unfortunately, iPad app developers capitalize on this fact and subsequently charge many times more for iPad apps. While the price difference may be worth it to some, for others the lesser quality iPhone app will likely suffice.To conclude, the iPad won't be for everyone. The steep price can be difficult to justify for those who may not have a well-defined place in his or her life for a tablet device. Further, those hoping to get more features out of the iPad than the device offers may be disappointed in its functionality.  For anyone considering the iPad, defining when and how to use it can help to decide if it's the right purchase to make.

It eliminated me having to carry my laptop with me everywhere i went. Lightweight and fast! I opted for the 3G which is a feature that i couldn't do without. The ability to be online anywhere i go (almost everywhere i go) makes it easier for me to keep up with emails from work and up to date with the news while im on the train. I would recommend buying a nice case for this. I got one from apple for $50 and it was well worth it. Avoids scratches and gives you a better feel when handling the unit. 16g is plenty for the average user based on research i did online. The 32g and 64g are more the for people that need to download big files and a ton of songs and movies. A good tip would be try not to have all your emails directly on your ipad. Instead try to use a website that links you to your emails. This will avoid you taking up memory with emails saved on your ipad. I have added Skype to my ipad and im able to even make phone calls now. Just wish this came with a camera!!

By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.By the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.For me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough.As to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.The iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook.On the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.My iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.

He described how he walked around the office with a block of wood to help him imagine what it would be like to carry and use a working PDA.  We have all walked around with a legal pad or something like it.  I think the Apple designers did this, too.  But with a little more awareness than most of us have.  The iPad is the result of this awareness.  I wangled mine at the beginning of this Christmas week and have had a few days to carry it around.  Here's what I think:The main advantages from my point of view: - Screen size.  As big as a piece of paper--not cramped like my iPhone screen. - Weight.  Just like a legal pad with a cover.  Maybe just a little heavier. - Keyboard.  Big enough to type with two hands.  Two fingers, in my case, but still... - Apps.  All iPhone's supported, with 2x mode for those that don't adapt to the big screen. - Convenience.  Type notes, documents, dissertations anywhere without setting up a laptop. - Newspapers.  I didn't think that screen size mattered for news apps, but it does somehow. - Web browsing.  As good as a desktop; better than iPhone special interface apps. - Pictures and movies. Wow!The minor disadvantages: - The size.  No complaints, but it is less convenient to carry than my iPhone.  Well, of course it is. - No split screen.  I really would like to have two apps side-by-side. - Not a laptop replacement.  This is fine--but don't kid yourself.  Keep your laptop. - Not an iPhone replacement.  Not small or convenient enough.  Also no phone. - Too shareable.  Unlike an iPhone, which is clearly personal, people feel free to borrow it.  Grrr! - Too pricey.  Worth it, but just barely.  Somebody at Apple is very good at figuring price points.I'm glad I got it and I don't think I will change my mind.  I think I will keep using it to write on the metro, in front of the TV--like I am now--and other places where using the laptop doesn't quite work.

It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have \"Facetime\" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!).

Fantastic!There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).Valid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.NOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).AND, you can delete any media files after playing them.

It is such a pleasure to have around, and already we depend on it. We especially enjoy playing games on it, and my kids can check their email and Facebook pages while we are out and about. I have Pages and can word process with ease using the Apple bluetooth keyboard. I like how the MiFi bundle that Verizon offers turns the iPad and both of my children's iPods into internet ready devices anywhere we go. I can even use the MiFi on my Macbook Pro. Obviously the key danger is exceeding one's data plan, and I'm not sure how far 1 gb ($20 plan) will get me and my children in one month. We don't use the MiFi all that much. Mainly it's for quick checking.If you haven't bought the SD card reader and USB port, do so, as this will improve the versatility of the unit.I am disappointed that this device lacks a forward facing camera for video conferencing. Hopefully future models will include one. This is the main reason I am not giving it five stars.I wear bifocals and haver poor \"near\" eyesight.

The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a \"third device,\" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for my son with autism", "Author": "CK \"Cathy K\"", "ReviewID": "R1QG94ZVV9P93C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it.

This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.On the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with.

I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list.Despite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it.When purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time.In the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't \"drag it everywhere with me\", since it is too inconvenient for that.It is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?Update: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer \"pages\" and \"numbers\" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent.

Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make \"ingame\" purchases.

Although I initially balked at the purchase price, I've got to say the iPad has been worth every penny! I've used a PC for work since the early 1980s and customarily spend upwards of nine hours a day in my home office using a computer to write and crunch numbers. So why did I need an iPad? I'm glad you asked. No longer bound to my desk in the evenings and on weekends, the iPad allows me to sit comfortably anywhere there's Wi-Fi while I browse the Internet, listen to music, view photos, access funny videos on YouTube, check out what's happening on Facebook, play games, etc. But my favorite use of the iPad, by far, is being able to read books. Whoever developed eBooks is a total genius! Sometimes I buy eBooks, but more often I borrow them from the public library. Whenever I happen upon an unfamiliar word or read about an interesting or exotic destination, I can quickly switch from reading the eBook to opening a page on the Internet to research it further. A competing tablet boasts that it can be read in full sun. While it is true that bright sunshine prohibits the use of an iPad, we should all be spending more time in the shade anyway! The iPad is a comfortable and easily portable size (approx. 7 \u00bd\" x 9 \u00bd\") and weight (just over 1 lb.). The colors on the glass screen are clear and brilliant. Playing games uses up more battery life than reading or browsing the Internet. That said, charging the iPad is simple and quick. Syncing the iPad with my computer is also easy and quick. There are thousands (and thousands) of apps available through iTunes - many are free. Sound quality isn't the best if you want to watch a movie, but it's possible to boost the sound with a secondary purchase of amplified speakers. The iPad is just as intuitive and nimble as you'd imagine an Apple product would be. I love being able to control everything with finger taps and swipes. Using the iPad is so easy that...well, my 83-year-old mother can do it! (Sorry, Mom.) Overall, this has been the best gift I've given myself in years!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "What WIFI issue?", "Author": "Angel Wing Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1B8ZD5R3FW411", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, what wifi issue?  The only hesitation I had in buying an iPad was from reviewers that commented that the iPad dropped wifi constantly.  I can only speculate that Apple has fixed the issue.  It has worked perfectly, right out of the box on my $35 wifi router, and I've taken it to numerous hot-spots and friends houses where it has worked perfectly!  It sees the wifi, asks if I want to join, I press one button, and I'm going.I didn't spend the money on 3G, and haven't missed it once.  BTW, 32GB is proving to be plenty, unless you want to keep more than about 10 movies at once.  You can keep tons of movies in iTunes, and then just select/deselect and re-sync if you want to change the movies you have loaded, so it's not a pain to manage.Other positive notes: - Touch sensitivity is incredible.  If you use other touch devices, be prepared to be frustrated when you go back to them after using the iPad.  Apple has perfected this! - Screen clarity, resolution, image 'depth', anti-glare, readability from all angles - all these are spot on.  As far as I can tell, it is unscratchable! - App store is tons of fun - just imagine it - find it in the App store - and within a minute you are doing it! - The onscreen keyboard works great!  I had real doubts, but I am a total convert. - Despite other comments to the contrary, this is a fabulous device for doing real work. Apple has sold itself short on downplaying the iPad's ability to handle real-world work.  For example, Apple should get a real Msft Office app right away.  Current apps can be somewhat error-prone.  Apple needs to establish a line of certified professional-grade apps for real work (when you can't tolerate a crash).Room for improvement (note, despite these, I still gave it 5 stars!):In general, where Apple falls short is where it stubbornly refuses to even bend an inch on its \"principles\", all three items below fall into this... - File sharing (or lack thereof) is my principle frustration.  Apple has locked files to the apps, so there is no file management system per se.  In general this is not a problem, until you want to do some real work and share what work you did on the iPad with the rest of the world, or your other computers.  IMHO, what Apple needs is a web-based file sharing environment where apps like Pages (or that full-functionality Office Suite I'm waiting for), can seamlessly pull docs, edit them on or off-line, and then sync.  Then, you can access the same docs from your PC and just keep working.  Google Docs is on the right path, but they've put too much effort into the community file sharing/editing functions and skipped right past the more basic need people have for sharing docs between the various types of hardware/software that they own personally.  All of this is software based, so no reason Apple can't work it out in due time.  The iPad instructions tell you to use the iTunes app to share files - WAPITA!  Forget that, I just email them back and forth, which the iPad has made really easy. - Apparently Apple and the maker of Flash Player can't play in the same sandbox - shame on both of you - I'm taking a toy away from each of you!  As a user, you are likely to find several web sites that you enjoy that the iPad won't work well with because of this.  Frustrating - unacceptable! - Despite a really good on-screen keyboard and touch editing, arrow keys would be REALLY HANDY!!!! Once again, Apple won't bend on it's phylosphy.  But admit it, nudging the cursor one or two letters to the left/right/up/down would be so much quicker/easier than that little magnifying glass (which I really can't see over the top of my finger).So, I've rambled on longer about my minor 'dislikes', than my major 'loves', but that's because I care!Awesome product Apple - positively amazing in a first-of-its-kind product - but you've got some work to do if you don't want competitors to fill in the minor gaps and run past you.

With the endless option of apps I've been able to joint notes (I can't read my handwriting) and email them out immediately after the meeting. I use EverNote - which syncs to my mac laptop, my phone and my pc at home.I can download brochures and show them to clients - or convert some projects into PDF to share (good read app - i just drag and drop it in itunes and sync to my ipad)The color quality is ridiculously sharp. The ability to zoom in and out is helpful.I've stored photos to show off my kid - a very high tech brag book.This machine is FAST. Insanely fast. Netflix streaming works great. I've read books (it's hard without the screen protector to diminish some of the glare).I have an external keyboard that I can sync with a bluetooth- but it seems silly to lug that and my ipad to a meeting when I can just bring my macbook. The keypad on the ipad is not bad. Although I do feel my shoulders tense after a few hours of typing off it.The iworks apps are great to view your projects but I had some issues with a Pages doc that had a lot of photos. It wouldn't load and after hours of frustration, I converted it to PDF and used that to show the client what the doc looked like.Back to the babysitting:If you think you will have a kiddo touch your precious ipsd - then get this:Moshi iVisor AG for iPad - WHY?? It takes 10 minutes to put on (including reading the direction time and NO PESKY AIR BUBBLES) and will save you the agony of finding a GIANT scratch and not sure to cry or kick yourself for not getting a screen protector.There are endless apps for kiddos. My son (2) is learning numbers, flashcards. If I tell him I want to see a choo choo, he knows to go into his folder, find the right app, and pop up the flash card to show me. At first (he was 1.5) we needed a stylus for him to be able to click through and do what he wanted but his hands have since grown and he doesn't need it anymore. The drawing apps are amazing - no mess and no waste of paper. It's easy to do a screenshot to save his work and he can start on other projects. It's impressive how quickly they learn. He knew instantly to swipe to get what he wanted to see. (Make sure to set the keypad lock and SET IT TO AIRPLANE mode when your kid has it - this will allow them to play the games w/o sending unintentional emails or making app purchases).If I had to pay for this, I would still get it now. It's been a great education tool for my kid and has eliminated stacks of paper in my work bag.

The iPad has quickly become the center of my child's learning day.  He colors, learns to count, writes letters and numbers, reads, and completes puzzles.  He also watches cartoons on Netflix, which is great because this allows us to keep him in the same room with us and not have to be subjected to watching Noggin every night.Most of the apps (except for ebooks) take us a few days to teach our son to navigate.

Zhou", "ReviewID": "R2M9PAG16QXA0G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi there! I have just recently received an ipad, and for the most part, it is absolutely useless, for me at least.Let me tell you a bit of my background, I am a college student with a part time job. I have a powerful desktop and a semi-powerful laptop. My laptop has about 9-11 hours of battery life (asus ul30vt, $600). It also have 2 graphics card, 1 for hardcore gaming, and 1 for power saving, very intuitive. I also own a Mytouch Slide smartphone. My computer background is slightly advanced. Below is some aspects important to me (college student).General Use:The Ipad is for the most part useless to me. My laptop is only $100 more expensive, but much more useful, and it only weighs 3 pounds, with about the same battery life. I'm not trying to advertise for Asus, but just comparing laptops to this ipad. At home, I use my desktop most often. At school and work, I use my laptop for notetaking and serious work. On the bus, I use my smartphone for various stuff. The only time I find myself using the ipad is when I am in the bathroom taking a dump, or on bed watching videos (early morning or late at night when I am too lazy to get out of bed). It actually works fairly good on bed because it doesn't overheat, it is always cool. My laptop always makes my blanket too hot after a while.Battery:If the ipad came 2 years ago, it would definitely be the best gadget ever because of the insane 10 hour battery life, but nowadays, many netbooks and laptops offer that amount for much less.Gaming:I find the games on the ipad fairly dull as I am much into hardcore games like Halo, COD, starcraft, etc.Use-abilityMostly everything the ipad can do, including ebooks, I can do on my laptop. The pros of the ipad can be experienced for novice to casual computer users. The ipad OS is very simple and clean. It's also very smooth. However for my generation, computer is a very big part of our lives.Apps:Because of all the apps, the ipad can be used for a lot of different things. However...you have to have the money. Yes you can jailbreak it, but that's the same as stealing.Keyboard:Speaking of which. The ipad keyboard is not bad. However, to type correctly with minimum error, you have to look at the keyboard because you can't touch type with the virtual keyboard, and also you have to lift you palm away from the keybaord because the slightest touch can make a letter click. The auto correction system is OK, not great.Portability:The ipad is only 1.5 pounds, but it is as big as a netbook. Which means, I will have to bring a bag or backpack. May be useful if you carry a medium sized purse that you can fit an ipad in (but this is for college review).Price:I got my ipad used (mint condition, 16gb wifi) for $400. You can get a brand new 16gb wifi for $450 on Craigslist fairly easily. It is NOT WORTH it to buy a 32 or 64gb version because Apple overpriced the upgrade. I mean...come on, $100 for such a small upgrade? no wonder they don't offer removable memory, so that they can force people to buy the bigger memory. Also a 3G chip shouldn't cost $130 to upgrade.Performance:The OS is very smooth, but I did find some lag. A few times it just froze, it wouldn't register any of my touches.Multitasking:simply doesn't have it, should wait for the 4.2 upgrade. I use AIM for instant messaging, and if I press the home button, it exits out of AIM. It doesn't sign me off immediately, but it also doesn't tell me if I received a new IM or not. I have to go back into AIM to see if anyone replied.Social:For the most part, college students will view you as an Apple fanboy, which is NOT a good thing. For our generation, we tend to favor variety. Apple products in general are very strict and linear.People who may want to buy an ipad:1. don't have a long battery life laptop or netbook2. not technologically experienced, casual users3. casual gamers.4. all about the apps (if you can afford it).5. travel alot.6. Have the money.7. don't need multitasking.People who will regret buying an ipad:1. have a all-around laptop with great battery life2. no empty niche for ipad3. hardcore gamer4. touch-typist5. Video chatting is a normThis is just what I feel. 3 stars because it is an OK product. Yes it is smooth and very nice to hold, but not really what I need, or even want. I am looking to sell my ipad because it doesn't fit any niche in my life. However, like I said, the ipad will be perfect for people who needs an extremely portable device with great battery life. But then again, you can always buy the Asus 1005pe netbook (12 hours of battery) for about $280. or my Asus UL series for about $600. (yes i LOVE asus, they are the best laptop/netbook company, check them out, much better than HP, Toshiba, Gateway, Acer).

The chief one is multi-tasking.  I can now click the home button twice and a bar will appear which lets me choose other functions.  I choose one and my screen is visibly swiped for another.  Also, internet radio, like my Pandora app, will now continue to play if you leave to use another function of the iPad.  Prior to this, the music stopped playing when you left Pandora.  I now have a mute button on the side and the fix position button is now on the multi-tasking bar.  I've added a few more ereader apps and, as an ebook reader, I use the ipad all of the time.  It is as good for magazines and full color art books as it is for text books.  I have not discovered any downside to this update yet.  It of course still does not play Flash but I don't think that will change as Apple is opposed to Flash. My original review appears below:I use this every day and all day long.  I read all of my books on it.  I watch tv shows and movies on it--I have not turned on a tv set since the day it arrived. I listen to audios on it. I have no problem using the virtual keyboard and can write my emails just fine on it.  I look at my Picasa albums on it. I listen to audiobooks and music on it.  I surf the web.  Then there are the apps....oh, boy...the apps are something to get lost in.  I play scrabble against the computer on it, ditto gin rummy.  I play my crosswords on it and it downloads all of my New York Times ones. I have art history apps so watched art ones, beautiful images, while waiting for a nerve wracking CT scan.  In fact, I get so absorbed in my iPad that I am somewhat irritated when \"tourists\" want to bother me and ask me what it is and what I'm doing on it. However, my natural enthusiasm takes over and I find myself showing them all of the things I am doing on it.My husband got one after he watched me with mine for a few months.  He gets lost in it for hours every evening.  He has a few quibbles about the iPad.  His biggest one is that it doesn't play Flash.  However, I think his problem is that he doesn't realize that if he used Apps properly that he wouldn't even have a need for Flash.  I certainly don't.  I don't need it for my Crosswords, for example, because my App handles all of my crosswords brilliantly.When I listen to all the complaints about the iPad, I think it boils down to that somehow the iPad is not the macbook in iPad form.  I don't need another Macbook!  I have a macbook, an iPad and an iPhone and frankly there is nothing else I need.  What one may not do best, the other does.  At home, where I spend most of my time, I am surrounded by all three.  When I go out, I take the iPad and iPhone.  I used to take the Macbook too but that is rarely necessary anymore.

I also cannot load music or photos from my computer library.This problem with iTunes seems to be affecting a lot of people according the Apple techs I've dealt with and the web forums I've read. If you are planning to buy an iPad, make sure you can sync it to your computer before you buy it. Install iTunes and take your laptop down to your local retailer and ask them sync it to a demo iPad in the store. Otherwise, you may end up like me.So far, my experience has been ugly and stressful. It's disgraceful that in Apple's rush to get this product to market, they wrecked the iTunes sync capability for thousands of customers and tens weeks later they still have not fixed it.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Versatile", "Author": "mrnikkel \"Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R253FG9KPOA7CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.Let me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.A few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.Another example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.One more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.Those are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.Sure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice.Update: I want to add a few of my thoughts on how the iPad compares to the Kindle as an ebook reader, since it seems particularly pertinent in an Amazon review.  I've been using the Kindle app on the iPad for a little while now, and I've reached a point where I'm using each device in more or less equal amounts for reading.  Overall, I think I prefer using the Kindle.  The screen is easier on the eyes; the battery life is significantly better; the size and weight feel better in my hand; and size of the iPad's screen just feels a bit too large for reading large portions of text.That said, the iPad is certainly a capable reader in the right circumstances.  In particular, I use it more than the Kindle when I'm in bed at night because the back-lit screen means I don't need a reading light that will keep my wife awake.  Also, I've been using it more often when starting a new book.  Navigation of the store is much easier and downloads go much faster than on the Kindle due to the WiFi.In conclusion, I'm certainly not going to get rid of my Kindle now that I've got an iPad.  There are simply too many situations where I prefer it over the iPad for reading.  That said, if I didn't already own a Kindle, I think it would be much harder to justify buying one as well as an iPad, since the iPad does serve as a capable ebook reader in most circumstances.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great device, some seriously rough edges", "Author": "C. Franz", "ReviewID": "R1A8H1O2KF6WDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Refurbed 1st gen ipad", "Author": "Quest1951", "ReviewID": "R3OQIJJ78PBMZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first entry into tablet market so I wanted something less expensive to try to see if we would use it.

I got this after my laptop failed on me and I went to get a warranty replacement.  My main reason getting an iPad is that it was light, easy to carry around and the touchscreen was easy for me to use.  For me this is very important due to a physical disability that limits my range of motion and limits my hand use, only able to grip something pretty light.A laptop was awkward for me to move around and difficult to carry if I was using my manual wheelchair.  I don't have the money for a second gen iPad, so, I went this one.  I've had it for about a week and couldn't be happier with it and the ease with which I can use and move it.  Like some of the other reviews have said, it does have it's limitations, especially since I do a lot of photoshopping, which has always been best done on a desktop for me anyways.Other then that I use for school, I go online, and for my books for school, regular books (the iPad makes it easier to read books and newspapers because I do not have to mess with pages nor try to keep the book open), the touch interface does not require a ton of pressure and the swipe to get though falls within my range of motion perfectly.  I would drop stuff trying to press buttons bore while I tried to balance and work a mouse too.I'm not sure about writing a full document, such as I would for school, yet as I ran out of money to purchase the program I'd need to write it then export it as a .docx (format required for my school).  I have even gotten Dragon for speech to text on here and it works better (so far) then my version on my desktop.

Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called \"gold rush\" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery. As I have already mentioned, e iPad as a device is not perfect, but it makes an excellent companion and you'll soon find your laptop collecting dust.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "COULD BE BETTER", "Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R37YLECAFFOIKZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9\" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection.You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad review for PC users", "Author": "Deej", "ReviewID": "R10I30NBTLDC96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17\" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads \"Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding\". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads \"not charging\".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest \"Batman\" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17\" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed \"OMG\" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted \"OMB\".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word \"gay\" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good start, but not there yet.", "Author": "Jon R", "ReviewID": "R15QF8PUI8E79B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad 16GB 3GS", "Author": "K.

As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me. Other user's experience may vary. Whichever way you decide, good luck with decision!", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a satisfying device, with a few minor drawbacks", "Author": "L. Vang \"lhvang\"", "ReviewID": "R1V3Q1N2V8JCV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14\" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Changed my life", "Author": "Langston", "ReviewID": "R19I2T06DTEDRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look, this isn't a laptop. And it changed my life. Just as a laptop probably changed many people's lives in the past, including mine, this little guy really changed a lot.I'm in college so I needed something to help me stay more organized. Also, I am in a lot of online classes and I needed something to surf the web with. This is perfect. The IPad 32 has just the right amount of memory and just the right amount of features. I bought Pages for it, and it works BETTER than word. My father and I still can't get over the ease of the IPad. While he is on his laptop trying to figure out how to attach a photo in an email, I'm ten steps ahead, laughing while he fumbles with Windows. I love it.Their are some draw backs for those people who need ALL features of a laptop. But for me, it;s great. I can upload my photos from my SD card in SECONDS with my Camera Attachment. I can edit home movie with my ReelDirector app. There is just so much. The app world is SO huge and the prices are so small that you don't have to worry about spending too much. And that's the best part, the cost of apps. For example, Pages, the word app, cost me $9.99. Word for instance can cost over $100.00 in a suite. It's just great. If you can afford it, get it.

Goodheart \"Heartfelt\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0VPRYFVYXQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking \"Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99.\"  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a \"go back to your previous app\" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.

IT IS NOT A \"SPECS\" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A \"SPECS\" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.Having said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!It is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook.On top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.  Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "No FLASH - The Real Reason", "Author": "J. Douglas \"A Gamer\"", "ReviewID": "R1VJOR4L4KGL17", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Steve Jobs states that 'FLASH crashes and is buggy on the iPad'. Instead of blaming Flash, Steve, just admit that the problem is with the iPad not being able to handle Flash, and not t'other way round. The processing power of the iPad is just fine for most things, but it's just too slow for full-on Flash applications and movies. Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue. Instead of delivering a product that you'd fully enjoy using, the only thing on Steve's mind is 'How much can we squeeze out of the punters on this one?' Okay, he's in business, and profits must be made, but if the profits are more important than user satisfaction, why should anyone feel any kind of loyalty to such a brand?If you've already bought the first-version iPad, you may love it, but there will of course be countless others who'll feel cheated not far down the line, when a much more powerful version is launched. Apple play the same trick time-after-time. Release the Basic Version, and when all the hype and sales start to slow, release a much better version that should and could have been released in the first place. This is because Apple knows that those who bought the basic version are so in love with Apple, they will happily fork-out for the better version too. One user - two sales. Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way. Style over Functionality.Steve; beef-up the processor, include a camera, memory slot and I/O ports, and stop this childish excuse for an excuse for not including Flash.

And by now, we have all heard the tales of people who have never used a computer (including Senior Citizens and the autistic) whose worlds have been opened up and expanded by the intuitive comfort level of the iPad.\"Back in the day\" - my Commuting Gear included a briefcase/backpack, 2\" Daily Planner, Cassette or CD Walkman, associated Cassettes/CD's, a Book, and current magazines, plus any necessary files, etc... for work, and later - a 15\" laptop.HEAVY - even as late as 2007 !TODAY - Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Notes, iPod/Music, iBooks, Newsstand, iBooks (again) are all = iPad !Files are now PDF's - which I store either in the iPad's iBooks App, or on a USB Flash Drive.The Original First Generation iPad does have a slower processor than current models, but for most day-to-day use (including video), you will not notice any difference in performance. It will successfully support all versions of iOS through iOS 5.1.1The 64 GB capacity is what I would recommend to anyone who has a \"healthy\" music or video library already in iTunes. While books, magazines and apps are relatively small in size, they WILL \"add up\" and you'll appreciate the small investment in the extra storage capacity so you truly can \"take it all with you.\"On the other hand, I would only recommend investing in the 3G Connectivity if you are a commuter who is not regularly within range of a Wi-Fi HotSpot. I owned my iPad for almost a year before activating the 3-G, and that was only when Wi-Fi would no longer work on my local train. If you do choose the 3-G option, be VERY mindful when using the 3-G. Use \"Settings\" to turn it on ONLY when Wi-Fi is not available, and be conscious about what you do while on the network. Streaming Video, File Downloads, etc.. will quickly BURN through any Data Plan. If you are mindful - you will be able to get by with the smallest $15/month data plan (...but even that adds up to apx. $200 a year....)I would strongly recommend the \"skin tight\" Original iPad Case, which SECURELY and elegantly holds the iPad, and the \"book cover design\" affords privacy from (potentially) prying eyes of the commuter sitting next to you, or you can fold it back behind the iPad itself.

It was indeed the iPad 1st gen I wanted, but was again used.  All iPads can be tracked.  A new one has a 360 day warranty, this one had only a few days remaining. It had also been repackaged and sealed in a manner not used by Apple. If I would have wanted a used Apple I would have purchased a less expensive reconditioned Apple from their site, which also provides a 360 day warranty. The price I paid was not that of a used iPad although less than a 2nd gen. Many buyers do not live near an Apple Store and would assume their product advertised as \"new\" to be new.

I thought I might use this device occasionally to read an iBook or watch a video.  I was wrong.  I use it ALL THE TIME.I've been using Apple laptops ever since I got out of college because I like bringing my computer around wherever I go or watching TV while I surf the web.  After buying an iPad, I'm looking into replacing my laptop with a Mac Mini and making my iPad my primary computing device.  If you think about it, what do MOST of us use our computer for MOST of the time?  Surfing the web, checking email, organizing pictures, listening to music and watching videos.  The iPad can do all these things.  Even those who use their computer for more \"serious\" activities (word processing, music recording/editing, keynote presentations) will find that iPad can do all those things as well, though you may have to actually purchase an app to do some of those things.  In addition, this thing is GREAT for travel.  Bring this on a plane and you can watch a video or read a book.True, the iPad will not REPLACE your laptop/desktop for most people, but you will find that you end up using your iPad instead of your computer for most things.  You will still need your regular computer for the large hard drive and flash videos (at least until Apple fixes that in an iOS), but you may even find that you prefer your iPad for things like email, Facebook, and the web.Without using an iPad 2, I can't really make many comparisons to the two models.  I haven't really wished my iPad had a video camera because I can't imagine holding this thing up to take videos, and I have my computer and iPhone for Facetime.  I can see how a lighter weight might be nice, but I haven't really found this device to be all that heavy.Bottom line, don't think of the iPad as an extra little toy that Apple came up with just to make a few more bucks.

The speakers actually sound pretty nice and I have no problems using it as an e-reader as some reviews led me to believe I might. The device has come in very handy for my purpose. I use the 3G but i could probably have gotten away with not having it now that there are mobile hotspots and cell phones can be used as hotspots. Nonetheless, I have the ability to connect seamlessly by 3G or wifi. Also, the battery wears down a lot faster than i expected. It lasts a few days on standby but when it's in use, you'll see the charge disappear quickly...it's not the worst but it's noticeable.I think that it's a great buy now that a brand new 1st gen is almost obscelete, especially by the major retailers, and selling for less than wifi only 2nd gen.

I first purchased the iPod Touch which I found to be a wonderful product, but I had really wanted to buy the iPad, but couldn't really afford. Even the iPod Touch stretched my budget. As I got to know my Touch, and all the things it could do, I was very happy with it - but the screen was just too small and limiting. I could browse the web, but spent a lot of time pushing the screen around to be able to read the page. After a few months, I set out to look for a larger device, a tablet. Going for inexpensive, I selected a 7-inch Android device (the Archos 70 Internet Tablet) Archos 70 - 8 GB Internet Tablet (Black). While I found this tablet very good in it's own way, and liked the small size and weight of it, with an improved viewing area, still I realized the Android world currently has some serious limitations. The biggest limitation was the Android Apps Market is so much smaller thatn the Apple App Store. I set out to try to find the Android equivalents of the apps I had on the iPod Touch, but there weren't many. Apps like Dragon Dictation for example, or Netflix, aren't yet available for Android. On the other hand, the Android gives you a lot more control of the device, so you can buy different lauchers which make the experience different. I liked that I could add up to 32GB memory using a SD card, and there was a USB port available which allowed attaching a mouse, keyboard, etc. You can also access the Android device file system, side load apps through the USB connection, and in general experiment with a lot more configurations. But I also didn't like how the Android had the home screens, like the iPod, but you had to go into a app \"drawer\" to launch the apps (although you could also copy them to the home screens as needed). Then there was the battery life - I was finding the Archos running quickly through the battery, like getting 5 hours on a full charge (this may be a defect in my particular Archos, others were reporting more like 8 hours of use per charge). What finally did me in however was when I could no longer access the full Android app market. There was a work around (short of rooting the device), which worked for a while but then stopped working. I could no longer get the most recommended and productive apps. So I searched again, this time looking seriously at the iPad. This was just about the time the iPad 2 came out, and we began seeing the original iPod get discounted - $100 discount at Apple's stores. I saw the iPads on Amazon and found a 64GB WiFi only iPad for a great price, about $300 less than the original price. So I bought it.I really should have just bought the iPad in the first place! Trying to save money, I actually wasted close to $800-$1,000 (including accessories). I gave my wife the iPod Touch, and the Archos tablet sits collecting dust. I am quite thrilled with my new iPad. I don't feel the iPad 2 had enough additional features to spend the extra money, and I figure I might spring for an iPad 3 or 4 or 5 some day in the future. THE BEST THING ABOUT THE iPAD 1 OVER THE iPAD 2 IS THAT ALL THE ACCESSORIES FOR IT ARE BEING DISCOUNTED AT AMAZING REDUCTIONS! As an example, I just bought a case that was orignally $50 for about $16. The case is wonderful and exactly what I wanted. I also bought the Rocketfish keyboard case on Amazon Marketplace for $25, these are still selling at Best Buy for $99 (admitedly, the case was sold as used, but it arrived in perfect condition, complete in it's original box). The keyboard in this case is full size, and the iPad snapes into a little recess which holds it in perfectly.Anyway, many things have been written about the iPad so I'll just highlight the Pros and Cons as a summary:Pro's:-Wonderful bright, colorful screen (the Archos Android tablet is dull, lower resolution, and washed out by comparison)-Ability to browse web sites, read books, scan magazines, and see full-screen apps without having to read tiny print, or scroll around constantly.-pretty light weight (I rarely have to hold the iPad without support)-Design is superb and the device feels solid and well made under apparently high standards of manufacture-my iPad did not have any light leakage that was complained about in its early production, and apparently is a problem with early iPad 2's-it downloaded all my music, videos, and apps from my iPod Touch through iTunes.-the touch is amazingly responsive, a just incredible experience - the Archos tablet was a mess compared to the iPad, hesitant, inconsistent, non-responsive-The Apple app store is amazing. If there's any reason to go with iPad or iPod, the app store is it! There's very little I think of and can't find. For example, I bank at a small, local credit union and thought \"I wonder if they have an app?\" and there it was! I have Netflix, Dragon Dictation, etc. I also like how I can print from the iPad using Print Central application, right to a non-wireless printer attached to my Windows PC.-Availability of accessories is great, and did I mention accessories are greatly discounted for the original iPad?-Tons of free apps! (Android also has a lot of free apps, but again, poor apps selection in general)-iWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) is a good selling point, I hope Apple keeps updating these programs, making files more exhangable for instance.Con's:-I don't like the Apple \"benevalent dictator\" control, requiring iTunes, and making the app developers jump through hoops to meet their rules. They got rid of the excellent VLC player (which auto-converts many AV formats saving a lot of time and work) because of their rules. They make developers remove links to the developer web site for apps, which is often helpful for getting information or trouble shooting. This seems petty to me on Apple's part, even somewhat paranoid.-I don't like the absence of Adobe Flash when searching the web (although there are a couple browsers that do display Flash animation and videos - I use Puffin for this). This is not a deal-breaker though, since there is an app for you tube and more web sites are using HTML instead.-I don't like how I have to go through iTunes to download my own music, videos, etc on the iPad (although I understand IOS 5 will fix this limitation)-I partly think the iPads are on the expensive side, although after using one for a while, I do think they're worth it. Still, it would be nice to have them cost less in the future.-Less control over interface and configuration than Android devices (although I like the iPad interface, so no urge to change it).So there you have my thoughts. I wish I would have just bought the iPad in the first place, but live and learn. If you're considering the Android devices versus the iPad, I hope my thoughts have been helpful. I really think the Android devices will come to a point of maturity in a year, maybe two. But there are a lot of users who swear by them and really prefer the customization level, and the freedom from the Apple restrictions. It's just that right now the iPad is the best tablet out there at any cost, in my humble opinion.

After you get an iPad, you will think that turning a laptop on to watch an episode of Mad Men you downloaded from iTunes will be silly.- Magazine and newspaper delivery: Looking at what organizations such as the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have done with iPad, this is a very serious contender for becoming the de facto way of distributing content currently on paper. I don't think Kindle (sorry Amazon) can match it.- Casual internet use: You just want to read [...] on your lap while you're waiting to aboard your plane, or just want to relax on the sofa or on the bed reading stuff online. iPad is perfect for that, and it also makes you wonder why people bring their laptops to bed.- It will help many senior citizens get acquainted with technology and will make them lose any fears or intimidation they might have about computers.\u00e7I don't think iPad is by any means a substitute for a laptop, but it will inspire users to confine them for mere productive activities.

It's a cool toy, and if you've got money to spend, go for it.

The ePad revolution is coming and before the end of qtr 2 it will be in full swing. Even MS$ is sending out a new lossleader soon. Android will populate most of the new pads with the MS machine running \"windows 7\" (for ePds)? Who knows how fast this bohemoth is going to run. Right now is a bad time to buy an ePad. Too many are already shipping and you'll see them at your local cell phone store at first. Samsung had 2 tablets available for 6 weeks and then abadoned them for upgraded models. Does this give you any confidence in what you're buying today? Talk about turnover. Where will Apple be by October? The iPad 4 probably. Just my opinion- I may be wrong.......But lets talk about MY iPad. Black, 64GB, Wifi, built like a brick and never, ever screws up. I have it with a soft poly rear shell covering and the 'OFFICIAL' APPLE LEATHER PORTFOLIO for travel. 10 hours of battery life? - you betcha! And thats hours of browsing time. I also read books, magazines, daily paper, etc.. Battery still running strong. Can't kill that battery. I have a dock and a bluetooth keyboard for use in zero-G times. Also works great when the seatbelt sign comes on. THERE IS NOTHING THIS BAD BOY CAN'T HANDLE! I thought I had lost my geek mojo before buying this iPad but I was mistaken. Nobody will ever take my iPad from me. It put the cool back into computers for me. It came with few goodies but the iTunes AppStore is crammed with more and they are all reasonably priced too. I found a couple of overpriced progs but 99.9% of them are spot on for the cost.In fact more than half of them are either free or the obligatory 99 cents. Some of the free apps are big name apps when the iPad is acting as a conduit to a source of data such as the NETFLIX APP.  I am a bass player and the combination of the IK iRig and the software to really perform some amazing signal mods on the output port before hitting the bass amp are phenomenal. The iPad does close to zero latency throughput of bass in-->mods-->bass out . The hardware was $50 and the software about $40 so far. Just an example of what you can do with an iPad and $100 worth of software/hardware. Real time processsing makes this a great live instrument setup for either bass or lead guitars. Of course other instruments such as an electronic keyboard could be thrown into the mix with endless possibilities. I guess that's another point to make. Maybe on the weekend I want to go hiking - well my iPad can hold any downloadable usgs map and keeps me from getting lost.That's pretty important where I live in Tucson, Arizona. With my maps I know where waterholes are, pitches that are too steep to traverse without roping in, etc... I just haven't seen another ePAD that can come close to what I have in mine, albeit the 3g phone would be convenient at times. And I'm just scratching the surface of my iPad. I've owned it for 12 months and maybe it's time to pickup a new iPad2 but honestly, the only new feature on it that I would use is one of the camera's. I would probably spring for the 3gs model too.In short, given whats on the market now and how well I know my iPadI think I would be better off holding on to my iPad1 and see what the iPad3 looks like whenever it comes out. A couple of the Android 3.0 models make the iPad2 seem bulky and thick so I'll be checking them out too.Oh - I almost forgot. Don't buy the official leather portfolio from Apple - go to a dense foam notebook holder instead. The Apple prodcut is just too inconsistent.

The battery life I have experienced with my iPad is nothing short of excellent. I can easily get 10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged. With the Wifi turned on, the battery does drain faster than with it off, but this is typical of any mobile device I have used. Synching content via iTunes is a simple, fast, and enjoyable process, just like synching to an iPod or iPhone. Apple definitely has the best user experience of any electronic item category that they offer product in, and the iPad is no exception. There are apps designed specifically to take advantage of the iPad's screen size and you can also run all the iPhone / iPod Touch apps on the iPad in either their native screen size or 2X to fill the screen. There are some excellent apps available, many for free. Games are a lot more fun to play on the larger screen versus the small screen on the iPhone and iPod Touch. But I particularly enjoy using the Netflix app to watch movies anywhere I have wifi service. I also use the free computer program Handbrake to import my DVDs into my computer. It is then just a simple drag & drop into iTunes to allow synching these movies to my iPad.The only accessory I have for my iPad is Apple's iPad Case Apple iPad Case (CASE-ZML MC361ZM/A). The fit is excellent and the cover folds over the back to create a wedge shape that is great for standing up or laying down on a flat surface angled towards you. I also had purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield protector for the screen, but upon opening it I discovered that I did not like the texture of the material. I feel the Apple case provided enough protection and I have zero scratches on the screen to date.Some people have complained about the lack of a camera on the iPad. But once you hold one in your hand, I think most people would find the inclusion of a camera to be something that they would not use. I believe the size of the iPad would make it awkward to use as a camera, so for me its not a missing feature. If there was a front facing camera, I could see potentially using the iPad for video chat / conference, but again I have the ability to do that with my iMac and phone.Overall excellent product.

I was a skeptic myself, but after owning apple products the past two years, I knew the company would live up to my expectations.  It is in no way just a large iPhone.I purchased the iPad 32gb wifi version and quickly began loading apps and movies. I also jail broke my version and am writing this review on the iPad itself!So far, I've noticed that the iPad is extremely efficient.The safari pages load quicker than my iPhone 3G and the apps open very fast.The clarity is unbelievable.  I think it's even clearer than my MacBook!The battery life is impressive.  I know it will withstand my 5+ hour flights from Boston to LA.  I watched a two hour movie this evening and played around with it for an additional few hours and my battery is at 56%.I was surprised at how great the volume level actually is. I expected it to not be that great, but when I was watching the movie earlier, I did not use headphones and found the sound quality perfect.  Additionally, the iPad does not emit any noise when processing.Apps:I just dropped a lot of cash on my iPad so I am not willing to spend money on apps yet.  I've explored the free ones exclusively.iBooks has me wowed.  Apple offers an array of free novels to meet anyone's taste.  Classics are my liking and I've loaded at least 15 of them.  You can bookmark your pages and skip chapters or browse.  I was impressed by how easy it is to read on the screen as well. I've never been a fan of reading on a computer, but this app opened my eyes to another world. I like having the ability to change the font size to meet my needs.Bloomberg did a great job of creating an app that offers financial news and personalization. I can track my stocks, track indices, and listen to podcasts.  I can't think of a more informative app out there.Installous. Everything your little hacker heart desires.  If you like installous on your iPhone, you'll appreciate it on your iPad.***********Edit:  Downside found!  Charging this device can be a pain.  I just hooked it up with a USB to my work computer (PC) and, the top right hand corner reads \"not charging.\"  Apple's website states the following:\"Some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad. When this occurs the message \"Not Charging\" appears in the status bar next to the battery icon.\"Be that as it may, other websites are claiming the Ipad still charges even though the screen states otherwise.

Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called \"DocsAnywhere\" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad 64gb....

You have to measure the functionality of your technology with the price that you're willing to pay and I have to say that neither the ipad 1 or 2 is worth what apple is charging. With all of the problems and glitches of the ipad I personally wouldn't pay over $300 for it. If you don't believe me go online and search problems with I pad 1 or problems with I pad 2. The problems that you see are not fictious their real and if you buy the ipad you better be willing to do some troubleshooting. Some people have problems with the wifi, but me personally, I had problems with it syncing to itunes . You should know that any old usb port won't work with this device you REALLY need a USB 2.0 port that is directly linked to the motherboard of your computer, and even then it won't charge directly from your computer. You will need to plug it into the wall. Secondly I must tell the reader that you need to watch your accessories . Even though some cables and card readers say that they work with the ipad the ipad is so finicky that they may not . I have a card reader that was supposed to work with the ipad, but it doesn't hence it must be sent back.All in all I have to say that the ipad isn't perfect, but it is over priced my advice would be to buy it used if you really must have one and to get the higher amount of GB (32 or 64) as you can easily run out of space. I bought mine used (for about $300) and it didn't have a scratch on it so it was pretty much new . I got the charger and all the paperwork that came with it, so I had some help, but not nearly enough. My advice to you would be to get used to the sites that offer Ipad fixes before you buy and to anticipate problems. THIS DEVICE IS WAY OVERHYPED AND NOT PERFECT.Well that's it to summarize get it gently used, anticipate problems and glitches and don't pay over $300. Trust me when the problems come (and they will) you won't feel so bad. And definitely get on those apple web sites that offer fixes. I was able to get mine working with their help and I'm glad that I looked them up. They saved my sanity. And watch your accessories sometimes they work and sometimes they don't . Just make sure that you don't pay through the nose for something that you can't even use.Good LuckP.S - If you are the type of person who is not tech savvy the ipad is probably not for you. This is definitely for the person who knows their way around the net and who knows what they are doing. The ipad was not my first tablet and i've learned that when picking out a tablet reviews are definitely key. This is still new technology so you can't expect it to be perfect.

Yu", "ReviewID": "R2F7N6QCDI3H7E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Now that I've had my iPad (1) for 2months, I can comment on what I like/dislike about it.Background; we have iPod Touch and iPad, no iPhone.The likes: it's great for kids, to play silly games.I have a 4-yr and a 7-yr. They like playing the silly games on iPod Touch and now iPad: AngryBird, Smurf, etc.It's lightweight to carry around - but much heavier and bulkier than my Kindle. Just better then most laptops.That's about ALL we like about iPad.The dislikes?- slow, toooooooooooooooo slow to navigate the web: without multi-tab support; switching to another browser window and it would Always RELOAD. since it's slow, this makes the web surfing extremely painful. Hence I'd say surfing the web with iPad is useful ONLY when there isn't a computer around- want to load your favorite song/video from flashdrive to iPad? First, you HAVE to have another computer (eh? is not iPad supposed to be a computer replacement?)!!! Then, you HAVE to install and use the iTune software. Thirdly, even though everyone is now all too familiar with copy-paste, syncing content to iPad from computer can NOT be done via copy-paste -- I haven't fully figure out how (WHY would anyone with 10+years of computer experience have to FIGURE out how to copy-paste???), but it's a HUGE pain in the A**- if you have multiple iPads, and worse, an iPad plus iPod Touch (or iPhone), then the pain to sync content is multiplied: eg, you want some contents to be only for iPod and some only for iPad -- there is a LOT of work you need to do to achieve that, otherwise, iTune syncs ALL your content to whatever device you have connected to your computer.- it does NOT have a DVD player. Sure there is a LOT of contents online. but, what about the DVDs we bought and/or borrowed from the lib? My kids have lots of them, and we just cannot all cramp on the bed with the kids and watch DVD on iPad - but we can do with our computer!!!- typing is extremely slow and annoying: without a keyboard, this makes it useless in doing any serious work (or to type a review like this - I'm using my Windows laptop to write this review!)- small screen: it IS nothing but a bigger iPod touch. It's not big enough for 3 kids to watch something together!- battery: I NEVER get anything close to 10hr - never more than 6hr!!! (which is very good compared to to what any laptop/Windows - but WHY pay a premium for something that is useful for nothing but the \"cool\" games?)- the power cord is TOO short: most of time I use my laptops, I have them plugged in. I want to do the same with iPad - but can NOT do. THe cord supplied is TOO short. So the only want to use iPad is to (fully) charge, use up battery, then back to charge...==> the problem is, when you want to carry it outside, either you carry it half-charge (since it's been used for a while), or you must wait for hours for it to charge before going out, AND you have to charge even when it's only half depleted - significantly reducing battery life (on the up side, your beloved Apple can sell your authentic batteries to make more money, which enables them to create more Fancy stuff like iPad for you to spend even more $$ on...)When compared to a normal laptop, iPad is anything but one - in fact, it is NOT one and you MUST have another computer to make your iPad (more) useful!In summary: will NOT recommend iPad. It's nothing but a bigger iPod Touch.Get it if...- you're satisfied if ALL you get is a bigger iPod Touch- all you care are just the AppStore games/apps- you can figure-type really fast and prefer not to have a real keyboard and/or type with both hands- have too much $$ and won't mind to have another potentially useless toy lying around (think of the Legos you spent hundreds of $$ on - after first use, have you ever played again?)Do NOT get it if- you want an iPad to replace your laptop -- this is BIG NO NO- you want to use it for regular web surfing- you want an iPad whose battery can REALLY last 10hr -> it will NOT- you want it regularly used for watching video- you prefer typing with both handsRecommend:try out some i3 or i5 Windows laptops with 5+hr battery life, relatively light weight, and around $600.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Longer Envious of the CSIs Finger Swishing", "Author": "Abbey's mom", "ReviewID": "R3D03MS3VTTA52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How do I love my IPad, let me count the ways!

(Some of the moments when releasing a product before engineering was done with it, notwithstanding.)However, I see the iPad as an offering where Apple attempted to get back to basics and fully accomplish a \"design cycle.\" I'm impressed with the power and options of this machine. The clarity of the display and the intuitive nature of the touch screen were drawing qualities. I was up and running, and I mean effectively, right \"out of the box\" with just a few probing \"trial and error\" type checkouts. The \"pop-up\" touch screen keyboard is very good, for the size of the unit. I was pleasantly surprised at that. I got the iPad case, turned it sideways at an angle, and find I can type with relative speed (not as fast as a full size keyboard, but very quickly and adequately for the light, quick notes and composing I am doing on it.) As I've played around, I have seen other features come up, asked myself \"what does that do?\" and figured those out as well. One day I'll go back and review the instruction manual.But, where the notebooks were designed to fill a niche of portability, lighter than a laptop, but still with internet access and some minimal functionality, I see the iPad coming from the other direction, filling that same market segment.It's an iPod on steroids!I do see it replacing a couple of my devices. My calendar and contacts are going on, and I can see myself retiring my PDA. The music and media features will replace my iPod. And, the 3G feature I activated and found to be very useful on a recent vacation trip to stay connected, so no lugging my laptop through security on business trips.Nope. No speaker phone. I'll still need to carry a cellular phone. Otherwise, this would be the one-stop shop. As it is, that is notable to me as a drawback and a slice where a blackberry or other access-enabled device might still be a viable alternative.Just downloaded my first movie. Maybe I'm premature in writing this review. But, I expect that to be impressive as well. So, overall I rate it positively.

Mork", "ReviewID": "R16ANZKIMVPMXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Devices like this make so much sense for the kind of light computing most of us do when we're away from the office.  And for reading, looking at pics, doing email, etc. this thing rocks.But it drives me crazy that Apple has waited so long to update this to iOS 4.  The iOS 4 features - which have been available for *months* on the iPhone - will finally bring multitasking, the ability to resume applications where you left off, and folders to the iPad.  These updates are merely small conveniences on the iPhone - which you use as a computer only for short periods when you're out running around or whatever.  They're extremely important to the iPad's credibility as a device which you'd like to use as much as possible instead of lugging around a laptop or being chained to a desk.  I still use the iPad a lot if I'm going to be focused on one application for a long time.  But life is often messier than that, so I actually end up switching to my much-too-teeny-tiny iPhone more than I'd like because it's got more flexible functionality.Devices like the iPad are definitely the way forward for light computing, and Apple has done a great job on developing this product.  But it's not quite done - it's pretty freakin' irritating that Apple has taken so long to meet this obvious need to update to the greater flexibility of iOS 4.2.p.s.  The only other thing I'd change is to up the resolution of the screen to iPhone 4 levels.  Don't get me wrong, the iPad's display is gorgeous.  But the nature of the device is that you hold it *closer* than a laptop.  Resolutions that would be really great at laptop screen distance are a bit grainy at handheld distance.  Which means that you feel like you're reading on a computer instead of looking at something that looks like a printed page.  I've noticed that although the iPhone 4 has too small a screen to read really long books comfortably, the crisp text resolution makes it more comfortable than you'd think for reading.p.p.s.  I couldn't give a bleep about a camera/facetime.  Kind of a cool concept, but until our nation has much faster broadband, it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Yes, my experience is that AT&T; is the pits - slow 3G, slow home broadband, and truly stone-age customer service.

I mainly got this because I can't wait another 2-? years for my job to decide how they're going to let us carry electronic publications. The iPad works great for that function, especially using GoodReader which I find to be superior to iBooks in a number of ways.So far I haven't been disappointed using it as an internet device in my home and offline in most other places. Overall it is basically what you expect: an oversized iPhone with similar features. Web pages look much better than they do on the iPhone, but there's still no built-in flash support. Angry Birds is a lot more fun on the iPad's big screen.One thing I don't like is the email presentation. It basically uses the same iPhone-sized strip overlayed on a full screen message display. There's no way to just be looking at your inbox or other folder; you have to always be looking at an email. It's a minor annoyance, but different than I have my email setup on every other system including the iPhone.I was also surprised to learn that the iPad is still on iOS 3 (so much for my research). I spent over an hour trying to create app folders on the device and in iTunes before I realized the iPad doesn't have that ability yet. I'm disappointed with the number of apps that expect you to re-buy just to increase the resolution enough that full screen looks good. Most apps like that I continue to use in the small, iPhone-size window that opens by default or I put up with pixellation and hit the 2x button. I didn't realize how quickly I'd gotten used to iOS4, but now it's annoying when I click a link on one website that opens a new window, and upon returning to the original site it has to completely reload instead of saving my previous position. Hopefully iOS4 will be out this month for the iPad and it will function more like my iPhone.If you're going to throw your iPad in a flight bag, I recommend the Otterbox Defender case. It was covered by the tax savings I enjoyed by purchasing from Amazon instead of Apple. The case offers a lot of protection, but like its iPhone cousin makes the ports less accessible. You have to remove the back panel to access the charging port, and not all headphones are able to reach into the headphone jack. My wife and I wanted to watch a movie together using a y-cord, but it wasn't able to fit without me removing the top half of the case.Overall I'm pleased with the unit so far. I could have waited for another solution (Google Pad, maybe?), but as Apple's already big in our lives and my work is likely moving to this unit, it was the best choice for me. If you're thinking of buying an iPad, I don't see why you'd buy anywhere but Amazon. Their list prices match the Apple store, but they add no tax or shipping charges.

It is not going to replace my laptop (MacBook) in work related activities, but it is going to replace it in fun-related activities. After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5\" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it. A lot of critical things that were mentioned here are true: I wish the screen was not glossy, and I wish it was lighter (but lets be realistic - it is way lighter than all laptops and quite a bit lighter than most notebooks), and I wish it could play Adobe flash videos. This is pretty much it - I don't see anything else that bothered me about this device. And there are tons of things that make me happy about it: a beautiful screen, quick response, external speakers (I really missed them on m iPod Touch), and as mentioned before - instant on.Looking back, I really feel that a lot of negative reviews that I've read did not make much sense - this device should be judged for what it is, not for what it could have been..", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad is a paradigm shift", "Author": "Boom Box Hunter", "ReviewID": "R3FSZT65RUB470", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just putting in my two cents, but this thing is amazing.

Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Old Old Generation", "Author": "Eric Shepperd", "ReviewID": "R23FAGOQ9UIK8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product had dings on it and it was the very first apple IPad.

I have owned it for a little over a year and the thing is pretty much trash.

I thought it may of been a glitch such as it just freezing up while turning it on that one time. Just to test it out, I forced it off and did a cold boot and it stayed on the Apple logo for hours. I tried plugging it up to iTunes (which is awful too) and tried to restore it. I put it in recovery and attempted to restore it. Right now, it has 4.2.1 and it tries to update to 5.1.1 (which is the latest). It extracts it and tries to update and every time, it gives me the error 3194. I was reading what the error means and it said to update iTunes (which I'm on the latest version). It also said it means it's not eligible for the update (which it is because iTunes downloaded it for me). At that, I was going to try and call support. I went through and was trying to get support and it would not give me support and kept on telling me to buy a support lane. Honestly, if Apple broke my iPad, I should get support free of charge.

Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.The iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.On the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in \"competing\" with iPad.This is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that.

No. I'm not being pessimistic; she really has better things in her life to do. She's 76! I can't even adequately explain the concept of windows and menubars in a way that makes sense to her. Not to mention she has tremors and has a difficult time holding and accurately directing a mouse. I could get her an iPod Touch. I love mine, by the way.

It started in NYC (as all great stories do) and I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say I was purusing Megan Fox pictures - the classy ones - on my new iPad and Tony Blair's PA who was in NYC visiting friends was on the subway sitting next to me. He happened to look over my shoulder - and well, thanks to my gleaming new iPad we hit it off! We went for drinks downtown, partied till the wee hours and 24 hours later voila I'm tumbling in Swiss down feather pillows with my iPad at Davos!Well with the iPad in hand (I leave the case off, it can get kind of smudgy but really a lot classier than those dull plastic looking covers) we dined with Tony (BTW Berlusconi's got nothing on the Tone) and really beat the bush about how to solve the whole getting broadband WiFi out to the poor. We were on to something but then Tony started getting antsy. His PA (BTW his name is Geoffery) leaned over and whispered in my ear that Tony was allergic to asparagus (huh). Well apparently the Tone likes his asparagus but it gives him the itchies in his buttocks (something about the antibodies attacking his hemorrhoids and inflaming them and then bam! he's scratching at 'em like the devil).Of course this was not good news as we had planned a \"party\" back at Tony's hotel suite with Berlusconi (aka Bert). The Bert was bringing the champagne (primo stuff) and Dmitri (some Russian dude) was going to bring his iPad and bunch of \"secret\" apps. Well, I'm not one to miss a party especially on someone else's buck and decided to take action. I took out my iPad cleanser (see above re smudges), sprayed it generously onto the $50 special cleaning cloth I had purchased (I tell you that cloth works magic - I once cleaned my laptop screen and it wiped out the entire drive!). With as much British decorum I could muster I discretely passed the sopping wet cloth across the table to Tony Blair. Not even a quizzical look - he knew instantly - grabbed the cloth and swiped away! There was that winning toothy smile and a couple of shots later we were back on track and solved the whole WiFi issue!Well as you probably figure the Party happened. Bert brought the champagne and his assistants (to - ahem - pop the corks), and a few choice cigars. Dmitri showed us his iPad apps (he's sooo much cooler in real life, though it was weird his secretary Vladimir kept calling him and telling him to get back to his hotel room...) Anyway, we partied all through the next day's sessions, pretty much trashed the room.  During a lull in the mayhem, Tony pulled the iPad cloth from his pocket (well it wasn't quite that elegant, he had to reach under the bed and pull his trousers out from underneath the bottles of booze, but you get the point, and yes I did see the 'rrhoids), handed it to me and said \"Davos 2012.\" Cool.
