{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nexus 7 Updated", "Author": "D.L.C", "ReviewID": "R2TPE6S6DPRB7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google \"Meenova.com\" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google \"Install Flash On Nexus 7\"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10\" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like \"do I need an umbrella today?\" Ask \"Weather forecast (your location).\"Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri \"what are you wearing\" gets her to say \"Why do people keep asking me that?\" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the \"NAvFree USA\" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying \"in 100 meters, turn right.\" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for a reasonable price", "Author": "sidroy", "ReviewID": "R1JUOLVBTVKIPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update:---------Google just announced a newer version of Nexus 7, making this product obsolete. Some of the highlights are -  - A nice bump in the screen resolution - 1920 X 1200 (323 ppi)  - A 5 MP rear facing camera  - Ships with Android 4.3, which has a restricted profile feature that can be used to block in-app purchases and limit access to content.  - The usual improvements in processor, memory, weight, speakers, wireless, etc. You can find the details on the official website for Nexus 7.  - The 32 GB model is $269 now. $20 extra for the new model is well worth it, in my opinion.Full Disclosure:-----------------Let me state upfront that in the last 3 years, my wife and I have purchased 4 iPhones, 4 iPads, 1 Mac Mini, 1 Apple TV and 2 Macbook Airs for ourselves and extended members of the family. I cannot review this product without comparing it to the iPad 2, which I've been using for the last year and a half.Motivation:------------We have an 18 month old son who needs to be entertained with videos and apps while he's being fed and we have an upcoming trip to India during which we'll need to keep him busy during the flight and transits. Here are our requirements -1) We needed a tablet that is more portable than the 16 GB iPad 2 that we currently have so that it's easy to stuff into my cargo pants or jacket and pull it out quickly when required.2) We needed more than the 16GB storage to store his favorite videos because we may have intermittent access to WiFi, at least 32 GB.3) When he's not using it, I would like a tablet that's easy to grip for long hours of reading.Choice:--------Based on these 3 requirements, I restricted my choice to the iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 32GB.Here are the reasons I decided to go with the Nexus 7.The 32 GB iPad Mini was almost $195 ((429 - 249) * 1.0825) more than the other 2 when you include CA sales taxes. It is at least half an inch wider than the Nexus 7 which makes it slightly harder to grip if you have small hands like me. The areas where it's better - slightly bigger screen, iOS app store, rear camera were not that important to me since we already have an iPad 2 and I don't shoot photos or videos with tablets.I chose Nexus 7 over Kindle Fire because I use a lot of Google services and wanted a tablet with a more open ecosystem. I can read Kindle e-books and listen to music using the Amazon Cloud Player on the Nexus 7. We have a Netflix subscription so the loss of Amazon Instant Video was not that important.Review:---------Here are the things that I liked about the Nexus 7 -1) Jelly Bean (4.1) is really good. I had played with Android phones and tablets before and they used to lack the smoothness of iOS. I think it's pretty close now.2) The higher resolution HD screen is great for reading and watching videos.3) If you are heavily into the Google ecosystem, it's a breeze to set it up.4) Android in general is more customizable with widgets etc.5) I was able to download most of the iOS apps that I use frequently with some exceptions. More on that later.6) I liked the auto-update feature on Android. It's an option that you can tick while downloading an app. It automatically downloads updates to that app.7) I liked the notification system and realized why iOS decided to replicate it.8) I also liked the shortcut for looking at running apps and a simple flick deletes them.9) It is easier for my son to hold compared to the iPad 2. He also has a habit of pressing the home button and exiting the app on the iPad 2 and then complaining about it (he's only 18 months old) but fortunately he can't do that on the Nexus 7.Here are the things that I thought were missing -1) There are fewer tablet optimized apps on Android. The quality of apps on iOS for iPad is definitely better. Flipboard was good on Nexus 7 but Zite lacked the polish of the iPad app. NYTimes was good. The usual games like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope were more unstable and crashed a few times. I installed Talkatone to make calls through Google Voice and it worked fine. The usual ones - Netflix, Skype, etc. worked fine. I noticed some lag while using Zinio to read the National Geographic.2) I'm still not used to the Chrome browser on a tablet. It seemed to me that accessing bookmarks on the iOS browser is easier. I found all my bookmarks already synced on my Chrome browser but accessing them requires multiple steps.3) It is slightly heavier than the iPad Mini but not by a lot. The iPad Mini is still ahead in terms of external design and looks but the cost mattered more to me this time. I may have paid $100 more for the iPad Mini because of the iOS app ecosystem advantage but $195 was a very high premium for an optional device.Conclusion:-------------The Nexus 7 is an excellent device irrespective of the price but the price makes it easier to appreciate it even more. If your requirements and expectations are similar to mine, I would strongly recommend it. I bought this product from Office Depot but I felt that the review might help others make a decision.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cream of the crop.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Shanti\"", "ReviewID": "R34LVWG6JUTUBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fist off this is not an Amazon purchase. Sorry Amazon, but it was cheaper at my local department store. Second, I will not compare this android tab to a ipad!!! Thats just stupid, IMO. Oranges and apples. One thing is all apple stuff cost more for comparable products. I dont buy over priced apple products.Ok as for the Android tabs, this one is a winner. The new processor is lightening fast!!! I multitasked, played Netflix, and loaded the thing and its speed held great. Its touch is very responsive. Its res is great too. For the buck, 249, at most department stores and electronic stores, it beats the competitors. The only way to get better is to pay more.There is no expansion slot but with 32 gigs its not really needed. You can Mini-USB it to  pc for file transfer with no prob.It rotates to landscape with no need for an app.Jelly bean is a winner and all new Androids have it so that doesn't need a review. The tablet is made well. It feels sturdy in the hand. The off button and volume are located nicely on the side but toward the edge so they dont get in the way.Its a small tablet with a small voice so sound isnt great. The speakers are tiny and dont carry much.But...plug in quality earbuds and the sound is great!!! MP3's sound the same as on my Sony MP3 player. Streaming movies are clear and sound fine.The tablet streams youtube and netflix with no problem at all.There is no rear camera. I dont know how the front facing camera is because I never use it. I didnt buy it to take pics nor to use it as a webcam.Being a google approved product apps are not an issue. Once you change your permissions in settings for other apps, it excepts Amazons apps too.The battery is good. About 3-4 hours video streaming, heavy web surfing and downloading, a good 6 with web off, playing games and reading. (Turning off the auto brightness helps save battery. Indoors I keep it adjusted to extremely low and only manually crank it for outside.)In sleep mode, I don't know how long the battery last as it barely moves after hours of sitting. I haven't had it sleeping long enough to compute it. It moves a little sitting over night but not enough to matter.Wifi is great!! Gets a full signal from my router better than my xoom. My xoom will have a partial full signal icon while my nexus has a fully filled signal icon, at the same distance from the router. It finds the signal quick too when I turn it on after having it off. No lag.I like that its uses mini to reg USB for charging as any phone AC charger works too. No need for special cords. It also charges connected to a netbook, laptop, or pc.The feeling in your hand is nice. The back isnt slippery, it has just a little bit of grip(texture), enough to help hold yet be smooth, but not slick. I never feel like it will slide out of my hands. Its weight is fine to me. Not so light it feels like hollow cheap plastic junk and not to heavy it feels like a brick. To me its just right.So for 249 and the processor it has and the gigs....its a big bang for the buck.I cant find anything neg with this tablet.If you want tv hook up and a ton of extra frill then plan to spend a lot more money for a tablet pc like the larger xoom, thrive, or galaxy. For the basic 7in tablet, this one beats the rest in the line. And no, Android doesn't support flash. Thats an Adobe issue not a product issue. As for apps, between Amazon and Google Play you can find anything. You just have to know how to look for them in the store app.And unlike kindles, and cheap end tablets, and all pc's, no bloat ware and no in your face ads on the out of box system.So I recommend the google nexus7, 32 gig. Its just a really nice, well layed out, well made, fast running tab.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome -- while it worked", "Author": "C. J. Puckett \"chelseacharming\"", "ReviewID": "R3PNDGPF8ZN5SY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the past month, I have owned two beautiful, zippy, but ultimately defective Nexus 7's.The first worked very well for about three weeks. I enjoyed it. It handled everything I threw at it, the screen was vibrant, the battery life surprisingly good, etc. Then one day it had a meltdown. Understand, I was very gentle with this thing. I never put it loose in a bag or dropped it or even set it down hard, so I was quite surprised to turn it on and see the screen go haywire (I'd describe it as multicolored snow.) It never recovered and I was forced to return it. I then bought a replacement from my local OfficeMax, and it did the SAME THING right out of the box. If you google \"Nexus 7 Won't Turn On,\" you'll see that unfortunately this is a common problem. The factory reset does nothing, and if you open the back to poke around, you'll void your warranty. I can only assume that it has some serious hardware issues, and until these are addressed, I'll be trying my luck with another tablet.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is this the Next-generation of Computing?", "Author": "Tomi", "ReviewID": "RUOTWUX2G5VX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this product with Saturday delivery, because I was spending my Spring break in New York, and wanted this prior to my leave. I lost my iPod touch 5th generation in a cab a few days before;I became very sad and wanted to find a replacement, one which I know wouldn't be lost or as light. In this article, my goal here is to not provide a \"full\" nexus 7 review, but to allow you, the reader, to see several angles to it's use and why it could be a good product choice.The day of purchasing this, I also looked at the iPad mini and a few other tablets. I have used the Mini before, however the price of this, which is about $20-30 cheaper than Apple's choice, provides me with twice the storage and a 3G sim card slot. (more on that later) So, the iPad mini was out of line, though I can understand why some might find Apple's interface a bit simpler.I did not want to buy another iPod Touch, because I realized how light they were. While this could be an advantage for some, I realized how much easier it is to lose one. Personally, the Nexus 7 is a great product for the purpose of having something you are aware of all the time. It is light, however not light to the point where you cannot feel its existence in your pocket. While it will not fit in standard jean's, it will fit in a jacket or a larger article of clothing. For me, I keep the Nexus in my winter coat pocket for now, and as spring approaches, I will most likely find another place for it. The advantage to this is that you don't always need a backpack for carrying it, and you have the luxury of a larger screen.I chose the 3G version for many reasons. When looking at pricepoints, this is only a little bit more expensive than the 32 gig iPod touch 5th gen, and that could be thought of as a more direct comparison. Having 3G means that I don't always have to find a Wi-Fi access point, and can easily access information anywhere I am. For example, I used the voice search feature of Google Now to find a taxi in down-town New York easily, all without having to fish out a Wi-Fi spot.I went with T-Mobile for 3G service. For $25, I have 1.5 gigs of data, which could be thought of as unlimited, since T-Mobile will throddle you down to EDGE speeds (about 384 Kbits/sec) after you go over your limit. While At&t; has better coverage, the data plans are more expensive and can end up being quite costly, especially since it is charged per gigabyte you go over.There is no sim that ships with this tablet, but it is unlocked. It does have \"4g\", though this is *NOT* LTE - 4G here indicates HSDPA+ speeds, which is more like 3.5G (at least that is how the status bar reports it). Still, these speeds are great for even watching Netflix or streaming higher quality Spotify. EDGE is not as good, but can suffice if you're out of your data cap.As I stated, the 7 inch form factor is portable enough to fit in a pocket, yet the larger screen does allow for better web viewing and more space than a 3 or 4 inch device. The battery life is also excellent. I was on a 12 hour trip back home, and listened to Spotify the entire way through 3g;When I arrived, my battery life was at 21%. Admitedly, using Chrome feels more like browsing on a desktop thanks to the design and layout, though the smaller screen can be a bit limiting for full-screen website content. I also have an iPad 2, and compared to that the iPad feels super large now. Still, if all you want to do is casual web surfing, this is a great device, with enough screen real estate to facilitate most pages. The hardware does not feel cheap at all for what you buy. While it is plastic instead of aluminum (which are what Apple products are made of), it Is very nice and firm plastic. I also like how the device does not get cold when you hold it in your hands after not using it in a while. Aluminum, while could be seen as sturdy, does get cold quickly and tends to stay below room temperature.I find using Android to be more comparable to a computer experience than iOS is. You can customize it more with what you want on your home screens, and apps themselves support more functionalities. Take Spotify, which supports queuing on Android but not on iOS, a feature which is also present in the PC version.I do see potentials for this great tablet to one day replace most aspects of computing. Because it is a Nexus device, it has the advantage of getting the latest Android updates right away. You can certainly tell that the quad-core processor is very fast, and performs really well with opening apps quickly.Overall, this is a great Android tablet, and the best for what you spend. It Is cheaper than the iPad mini, and has 3G, double the ram (1 GB instead of 512), and double the storage. It is also bigger than the iPod touch, and includes 3G, making it a bit more enjoyable for movie watching and using it as a computer-type design for work. Consider getting a Bluetooth keyboard, should you wish to get actual typing or work done, though.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great 7in tablet!  (if you have the time to root!!)", "Author": "gadget-o-holic", "ReviewID": "R10RNVPDMLFF9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overview:=============================================For a bit of background, I've owned several android phones, iPhones, iPads, etc...  I've owned the original nexus phone, HTC EVO, iPhone (1, 3gs, 4s, and now 5), iPad 2 and 3 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version.  Right now, for mobile devices, I own an iPhone 5, iPad 3, and Nexus 7.I was interested in the Nexus 7 because having owned the Galaxy tab 7.7 (and consequently selling it) I wanted a tablet to use as a carry around tablet that's light and easy to handle.  The Nexus 7 perfectly fits my needs... it's reasonably fast, easy to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and clear.  I believe this is the best 7 inch tablet on the market as of right now.  The iPad mini will probably sell more due to it being Apple but this Nexus 7 definitely holds its own.  Also, as an FYI, I bought my Nexus 7 at Sam's Club... much cheaper than Amazon at least for now!The Nexus 7 compared to Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version=============================================Overall the Nexus 7, in my opinion, is superior to the Galaxy 7.7.  The only areas where the Galaxy 7.7 may out do the Nexus 7 would be in the screen and the fact that you can get a 7.7 with an option to use it as a phone.  That being said, the positives of the Nexus 7, for me, far outweigh the better screen on the 7.7 and the ability to use the 7.7 as a phone (which would seem pretty silly to me anyway)...The Nexus 7 positives:=========================- much easier to hold in one hand- easier to read because text is sized more appropriately (on stock software)- battery appears to last much longer than my 7.7 while idling- receives updates to android instantly while with Samsung you'll be waitingThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 WiFi+3G P6800 16GB Silver Unlocked GSM Tablet - International Version positives:=========================- better screen on the 7.7... blacks are much blacker to those who care- ability to use the 7.7 as a phoneNexus 7 compared to iPad Mini=============================================As others have mentioned before, comparing the Nexus 7 to an iPad mini is like comparing apples and oranges since they are separate ecosystems/etc...  I'm not going to get in to the pro's and con's of Android vs iOS, but if you had to compare the two tablets just from a pure usability perpective, I'd say that the Nexus 7 edges out the iPad mini slightly (for me) because the Nexus 7 is slightly easier to hold with one hand compared to the iPad mini.  When I hold an iPad mini in one hand, my fingers struggle to get all the way around the device to where I feel like I have a comfortable grip.  With the Nexus 7, however, my hand fits around it perfectly and I feel like I have a good grip on the tablet even with a Blurex Ultra-Slim Case for Google Nexus 7 inch Tablet -- With built in Multi-Angle Stand (Tangelo) + Premium Screen Protector Film attached to it.Nexus 7 Pros=============================================- Great one hand holding (with my hands), even with a case attached- Awesome for gaming (I play Shadowgun all the time)- Easy to root... you may not do this but I highly recommend it as it opens up a ton of possibilities like using the tablet with a playstation 3 controller for gaming (via SixAxis Controller app) or using the tablet with an OTG cable to attach flash drives/etc for more storage- Instant updates to latest android software... it took forever for Samsung to put out even ICS for the 7.7 when I had it- Great battery life!  I've used my tablet with light to medium use for the better part of a week without having to re-charge itNexus 7 Cons=============================================- Not too many compatible chargers... iPad chargers won't work with it and many chargers are hit and miss... if you get one, make sure to keep the stock charger close by.- You won't get ALL the advanced features with this tablet without tinkering with it, which can be a pain for some people...  rooting takes time and so does getting the other 3rd party apps working for using the OTG cable.  This is somewhat expected with android devices for me though...- Have to side load many apps since they are listed as not compatible in app store (nba game time, hbo, etc...)CONCLUSION=============================================I've been very happy with my Nexus 7!  I patiently waited as rumors swirled around a 32gb release for the Nexus 7 and I'm glad I did.  Many of the games/etc can take up a lot of space so having the extra internal strorage space definitely helps out.In any case, if you have time to root your Nexus 7 and tinker around with it a bit, it'll be like having a PS3 AND Media Player on the go!!! With the use of the SixAxis Controller app, I can use a PS3 controller to play many games from google play, and with the use an OTG cable and apps like stickmount I can attach flash drives or hard drives and load my music and movies on them.  While the iPad will always have it's place for me due to my heavy investment in to the iOS ecosystem with itunes match/etc, I'd never be able to do half the things on it that I do with my Nexus 7 and for that I highly recommend it!!!UPDATE (11-12-2012... many comments about expandable storage so updating with instructions)=============================================I noticed another reviewer say that there is no expandable storage.  Out of the box, yes, there is no expandable storage as there is no micro sd card slot but there is a way to get expandable storage!!!  Please see below for instructions...Instructions:1. Root your device  if you want to use Paragon or Stickmount...  (use google for this as there are many instructions out there on how to do it in less than 15-20 mins)2. Install Paragon exFAT, NTFS & HFS+ (requires root), Stickmount (requires root), or Nexus Media Importer (no root required as another poster commented)... I use Paragon personally as I need access to HFS+ drives (mac).3. Get a less than $2 OTG cable, you can attach ANY USB flash drive or hard drive.  I got this one. eForCity Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter Compatible with Google Nexus 74. Use any flash or hard drive and plug in to your device5. Paragon and Stickmount should automatically recognize the drive and mount it6. Use any file explorer or media player to find your files... each app will mount in a different place but generally somewhere under your sdcard mountI have my Nexus 7 working with a SanDisk Cruzer Glide 128 GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ60-128G-B35 and Uspeed USB 3.0 Card Reader 8-in-1 for SDXC, SDHC, SD, MMC, RS-MMC, Micro SDXC, Micro SD, Micro SDHC Card - support UHS-I combined with Transcend 128 GB SDXC Flash Memory Card (TS128GSDXC10E).  That's over 256GB combined of extra storage!!!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's near perfect.", "Author": "Max Harry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2J4HUZSEC01OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be a bias review about my experience with this tablet.This tablet is now my favorite Android device (until a better 7\" Nexus come along). It used to be my Nexus phone, but with this tablet having the same stock Android experience on a larger screen, while still being relatively portable gives it a much better usage experience. It's slim and not too heavy so I can hold it using one hand for a lengthy amount of time, which is more flexible compared to a 10\" tablet or other 7-8\" tablets that are too wide to hold with one hand. Now the only thing I use my Nexus phone for is making calls so I don't have to spend more money upgrading my phone.STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE ON A 7\" HD SCREEN:The 7\" formfactor of this tablet is perfect when being paired with Android 4.2. I feel Android 4.2 interface is not designed best for 10\" tablet yet, however it work just right for a 7\" screen. The screen is 720p and the pixels are just small enough so fonts are sharp, it is possible to do extensive web browsing and reading on this tablet.With a clean stock Android OS, it's better optimized for performance so the interface feel much smoother and faster than competing tablets with the similar spec, which tend to come with skinned overlay and bloatwares. This tablet is more for people who like to fiddle with their device and customize it the way they like. If you know exactly what apps you want to install and how to customize your Android, it is much more flexible than all the competition.Some people will complain about lack of microSD slot. There are couple of ways to deal with the limited storage issue. Google Music have a cloud feature to let you store and stream up to 20,000 songs. For videos, you can easily create a UPnP server in your home to stream videos from. For example, install XBMC to your PC, add videos to your library, then enable the UPnP server feature. You can also buy an Asus router that have UPnP feature, enable it, then connect your harddrive with videos to it. Lastly, on the Nexus 7, install \"XBMC for Android\" or \"VPlayer and its UPnP plugin\" to stream the videos. Make sure you Google for the official \"XBMC hardware accelerated test-build\".LONG TERM VALUE:When you buy a Nexus branded device, it means you will receive the latest Android updates directly from Google and sooner than all other non-Nexus devices. Google will support the software for a long time. Technically Google only promised to update a Nexus device up to 18months from its release date, but more likely if the hardware of that device is still capable, they'll continue to update it.NETWORK INFO (read before purchasing):-Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" (P3100), this device is not capable of making direct phone calls (you will have to use VoIP apps). It's still possible to get network data and do text messaging.-If you intend to use this tablet with T-Mobile, you'll have to use their 'Mobile Broadband sim card' with the plans available for it. However, using a T-Mobile prepaid (phone) sim card will not work as there will be no data, only texting will work.-Right now, if you're in the US and want to get a data plan for this, T-Mobile Mobile Broadband plan probably the best choice if you get good signal in your area. T-Mobile have gotten rid of contract plans completely, ie. the official T-Mobile store and website do not provide any plans that require contracts. The Mobile Broadband $40 option will get you 4.5GB of 3G and throttle down to 2G after that, with texting and tethering. In the future the Mobile Broadband plan should also cover LTE (however the Nexus 7 is not compatible with LTE).-T-Mobile also offer a prepaid option called Monthy Pass, but I highly do not recommend this since it do not offer good value compared to the Mobile Broadband plans. For example, the $35 Monthly Pass option only give you 3.5GB of data, with no texting nor tethering. Also since it is in the \"prepaid tier\", you will get lower priority in cell towers connection, in other word your download speed will not be as fast.CONS:-NO TV-OUPUT: There isn't a dedicated microHDMI port nor MHL support so no chance of physically connecting it to a TV.-SCREEN QUALITY LUCK: My previous Nexus 7 WiFi unit have a great screen, but this 3G unit I received have very obvious graininess and color banding.-NO REAR CAMERA-Not full USB OTG out of the box: You can connect mice and keyboards, but to mount USB flashdrives you'll need root. Various other Asus tablets do have full USB OTG support out of the box.Note: A minor issue when I received it, it had no charge and the only way to turn it on was to charge it for a while, then hold the Power button for over 10seconds. Some people also suggested plugging it to a charger while holding Power + Volume Down buttons.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product, but an important warning!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2X7AQQX475A09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 is incredible! It is super fast, maybe faster than my laptop, and incredibly user friendly. Also the battery life is almost too good to be true. It reports about 8 hours of solid use and I must say that so far I haven't seen less than 12 hours. I don't play games or stream videos constantly, but I use a ton of apps and web browsing, so I was incredibly surprised by how well it stands up. I also recommend purchasing a SquareTrade warranty for accidental damage. I got a 3 year plan for like $80...well worth it when you consider how easy it would be to drop this think down some stairs or in a puddle.One important warning: The seller I purchased mine from did not include the AT&T; SIM card. If you buy directly from google, it comes with a free SIM card with an app to activate a wireless plan. The seller never said they were or were not including it, I just assumed it would be included. Just a fair warning to others!Pro Tip: Try downloading Pocket. It is an offline web browser that lets you save web pages for viewing offline. I particularly like Cracked.com, and this is the only offline web app I could find that properly saves their pages.

And boy was I NOT disappointed!This is a beautiful tablet and has everything one would want or need in a tablet: speedy processor(s); beautiful screen; easy to maneuver once one gets the hang of it (I am a former Ipad 3 user, and have more familiarity with the Apple OS). Android is a bit different, yet similar enough to pick up the basics quickly. I now am totally familiar with it and proficient in its operation.Yes, it's smaller than the Ipad, and that is a beauty and a curse. It is very lightweight and easy to hold for long periods of time. I have a bit of trouble seeing the screen at times, due to aging eyes and the sometimes-tiny print that can appear on some websites. Still, this thing is a beautiful creation, and I bet Google sells a ton of them.One advantage is that the Android OS updates almost instantly once Google releases it. Carrier devices (those sold by Verizon, etc.) can take weeks, months...or never...because the carrier has no interest in helping you prolong the use of your current phone...they have an interest in getting you into a NEW unit. I have already had two updates; first to 4.1 and now to 4.2.In fact, I have become so comfortable with the Android system I have moved to a Android-based phone (a Samsung Galaxy Note). For a former Apple guy, this is huge.All in all, this is the best small tablet in my opinion.

We are still happy with our old Fire and our newer Fire HD but we are happier with Nexus 7, our third 7\" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for about the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive. I am sorry but I can't yet compare the Nexus 7 with the mini iPad because, while I did play with one for a few minutes, I didn't have a chance to test-drive one for any significant period of time.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest.+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core= 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on both- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on NexusNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM so 16/32GB should be sufficient for most of us. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore (they both have it but, of course, the Fire's implementation is much better because that's basically where you are most of the time you are using the Fire= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.2 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. There is no doubt that it will be upgradeable to future versions, at least for the next couple of years. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android will ever get a major Android upgrade even though Amazon may tweak it a little from time to time.+ Chrome, most other Google apps. Chrome happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.2 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature. Our daughter has been using the new Fire HD ever since launch and she's used to it by now.PRICE (advantage Nexus)The Nexus 7 is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration especially when you consider that fact that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using both a Nexus 7 ever since launch and the same is true for the Fire HD. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a clear personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Android Tablet and a good value", "Author": "M.

I also own an iPad3 and I used to own another Android tablet, the SKYTEX SX-SP715A4 SKYPAD ALPHA 2 ANDROID 4.0 TABLET 4GB WEBCAM ALUMINUM CASE which was a dismal and slow tablet compared to the Nexus 7. In fact I was so disappointed in Android because of my experience with the Skytex tablet, that I swore off Android. That was until the release of Android 4.1 and the rave reviews it started getting. Then Google releases the Nexus 7 hardware that also stepped up the game. I took the plunge and am happy to say that Android is now up to the task and this is coming from someone who's been using IOS in iPhone's and iPads for a few years now.The closest real competition to the Nexus 7 has got to be the new iPad mini (which is not Android. It uses IOS6) and I suppose it's fair to put the Kindle Fire HD in there too although it is not a \"pure\" Android experience. There is one big advantage that the Kindle Fire HD has over the Nexus 7 though and that is the ability to play Amazon Prime Videos. You have to jump through hoops to do that on the Nexus 7. It is possible but you must download a Flash capable browser such as Firefox Beta and you must also install an appropriate Flash apk. I've done this and Flash will now play for me quite well. Who knows what security breaches are being introduced by using a less than current version of Flash however... so this \"solution\" is not for the faint of heart.I do not think it is fair to directly compare the iPad Mini to the Nexus 7 because they are different in many ways, not the least of which is the Operating System. The Nexus 7 uses Android (Jellybean as I write this) whereas the iPad uses IOS6. Suffice to say that having used both and having enjoyed using both, they each have strengths and weaknesses.The Nexus 7 has a very nice form factor. The case is not as substantial as some other devices but it is a nice case and has a somewhat textured and grippy plastic back. I prefer the textured surface over something that is more smooth and slippery. If you are using a third-party case then the tactile differences become less of a consideration. The Corning glass screen is a gorgeous, seven-inch 1280\u00d7800 high resolution display. It is bright and sharp. The screen is surrounded by a thin aluminum bezel. Very nice looking. When you grip the Nexus 7 firmly and give it 'ol \"lets see if I can twist the case\" it may creak just a bit but overall feels pretty solid. Not as solid as an iPad Mini, but remember, it's a whole lot less expensive than an iPad Mini too.As for processing power, the Nexus 7 with its quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor gives some muscle to video playback and overall performance. I notice very little sluggishness or stuttering due to being under-powered. There is even a rather robust 1GB of RAM in the Nexus 7. You also get bluetooth for extra versatility in throwing sound to bluetooth speakers and a whole lot more.Initial setup of the Nexus 7 was easy. It walks you through the process as you can see in my video review. You'll get the most utility out of the Nexus 7 if you have a Google account and begin using all the various Google services... Google now ties all of their services together and the Nexus 7 makes it really easy and fun to use them.A new feature that works exceedingly well is the Google voice search function, The Apple IOS equivalent is SIRI. I believe that the Google version has a better, more natural sounding voice and it is quite speedy. It's very useful.Every aspect of the Android Jellybean operating system is vastly improved over prior versions. Google has finally got the performance of Android up to the level of competence that can really compare favorably with IOS. I'm sure it will only improve as time goes on. Apple still has the lead in number of apps but Android has most of the major bases covered and the Android app marketplace is expanding rapidly. I would say that the number of apps available for Android vs Apple is no longer an important consideration on whether or not to get an Android tablet.Streaming video is wonderful, I don't get any stuttering and the display is beautiful to behold. Even the sound is not too bad given that it is a 7\" tablet with little room for a speaker. Yet it produces sound that is fine and when you plug in headphones, it's awesome sound.I'd suggest getting the 32GB model since there is no memory card expansion slot on the Nexus 7. So if you get a 16GB model and run out of space, you're stuck unless you go with a USB OTG solution. At least with the 32GB model, you've got more memory to begin with and you don't have to mess around with attaching anything external. The Quad-core Tegra 3 processor makes the tablet feel really speedy. Screen paging is excellent and I do not notice any appreciable stuttering or slowness in navigating or app launching.The Nexus 7 is a significant step forward for Android tablets. The OS is stable, more powerful than ever and performs smoothly. The version of Android now shipping with the Nexus 7 at the time of this review is v 4.2.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet as well as most Bang for your Buck.", "Author": "stu", "ReviewID": "R4JJM5ZLHMO6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Google Nexus 7 32Gb last week. It is amazing. I already had a Kindle Fire first generation and was ready to upgrade my device. I did my homework and then went to look at the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire 8.9 and the Nexus 10 and 7 and the Ipad Mini as well. When I tried the Larger Tablets, I didn't think they were portable enough for what I wanted. I was used to the size of the Kindle Fire and liked it.  I tried the IPad Mini but I didn't like the speed and display resolution of the device. Maybe when Apple upgrades the Mini with a faster processor and screen resolution, it would be worth the price, but I feel it is too high and not a good value now. I then tried the Nexus 7 32GB and fell in love with it. It has all the speed you want and amazing resolution. It did not hurt that is was the best value as well.I have always had Android Phones and am very familiar with the platform. As I use Google Drive for work, I felt that the Nexus 7 could also be used when I need a smaller device for work. I am able to put presentations on the unit and share them when I do not want to take out my computer. I can also get all of my Kindle Books via the Kindle app. It is the best of both worlds.

Good luck folks.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "It Just stops working, whenever it wants? Next one was great 4 six months. grrr", "Author": "MuseGlance \"MuseGlance\"", "ReviewID": "RWBFV231CY4E5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Modified below.  I was very excited to try the new mini type tablet. Traded in my HTC EVO for the IPhone 4 this last phone renewal. I was sad to be without my Google apps. I love evaluating all operating systems, so when I decided to get a smaller tablet to fit in my purse, The Nexus 7 with Jelly bean sounded like the way to go.I have been a techno geek since the Timex 2K and have always updated my system quite frequently. I got this at Walmart, a nice 32K one, so I would stop maxing out memory for my audible books and apps; and I gave my husband my large IPad 1.This has a beautiful little screen and I downloaded an adorable fish animated desktop that moves with the menu. Very impressive. Got a fabulous case for it that I will add the link to eventually here on Amazon. I confess I was lost initially with the new operating system, still trying to figure it out actually, but attribute that to my inability, not the system. Got on Google Play and bought a tv series season and was enjoying watching those during down times... However...I have had it since Dec. 7th 2012 it is now Dec. 25th and it has stopped mid video, with more than 25% power still on, and the screen goes black. It looks totally dead? I press the on off button to see if I can toggle something but there is no way to know if I just turned it off, or turned it on, because there is no action visible on the screen.The first time it did it. I was ready to take it back in thinking something must have broke inside?  Then I picked it up a half hour later and it came back on and appeared to work fine. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it was uploading an upgrade or something that took the system down.Tonight in the middle of the Google play series it did it again ...twice? Push buttons like crazy.. wait.. try again... then it came on? The little circle went round and round and then it said the processing system is not responding do you want to wait, report or discontinue. First time I waited.. second time I thought I would discontinue and try rebooting. It is once again dead.. totally dead.. no sign of life.. not just the app, or the connection but the tablet.. a piece of metal and glass.I love new giggie-gadgets, but they have to at least pretend to work.  As much as I have already bought games & movies I am going to have to take this back. I don't know if I got a bad one or this is a ubiquitous problem with the new operating system.So beware. Not everything is perfect. SighI got a replacement , and there was a world of difference!!!Apparently I had got a bad one. This connected perfect and fast, downloaded all my former apps within a half hour. So what took me days on the old broken one zipped thru.So far I have totally enjoyed this and not sorry I replaced it. Will check back in in a few weeks if anything has changedApparently the bad one was a fluke.It is mid April 2013 and I love the Nexus, lots of apps tons to explore. I changed my review from 3 star to 4 star. Didn't give it 5 star only because of the first very demoralizing broken one, but if this was truly just a fluke... this item is 5 star.---- Aug 10, 2013Ok I have now had this since December. The bad one, then exchanged for a good one and guess what. The same exact thing is happening. DO NOT LET the battery run out all the way. Now when I try to charge it, I will see it come on then it tells itself it is powering off. Thought maybe there was an update. Later it came on, then off, then on.. all during the time it was suppose to be charging. I took it off the charger and it is dead. I can't awaken it.

I still have not heard from a supervisor and will be sending it back to them for the 3rd time.  I really wish I had an ipdad mini...UPDATE 2/19: They found my Nexus after 7 days and it was repaired withing a few hours.  When we got it back after a 7 day shipping, no kidding, it had the same problem!  I think they may have just sent it out without any work.  I spent 45 minutes waiting for a supervisor who said I should mail it back (for a 3rd time.) When I asked about her supervisor, I was told that they just weren't available and maybe I could hear from them in 2 days or so.  $250 and it is a paper weight.  I want to cry that I have wasted $250 for nothing.  I have owned this for 84 days and it has worked for 34.  This is the only product for which I have ever left a negative review.UPDATE 2/13:  I shipped my Asus back to the repair center, and Fedex says it was delivered 6 days ago.  No one at Asus can find it. Anywhere.  What a mess.  The guy said sorry, but they have a lot of tablets to repair.  I bet they do...UPDATE 2/5:  So after paying over $20 with insurance to send the nexus back, I received it and the original problem had been fixed.  However, while fixing it, they damaged the wifi connector. (This is something I found several instances of on the web.) Prior to the \"repair\", I could use the nexus all over my house, and even say 2 of my neighbor's networks.  Now, I can only use it if I sit next to the router.  Also, they have an RMA Status page to check how your repair is going.  Mine never showed up as having been received even though I had delivery confirmation.  I will be shipping my nexus back to Asus again today.  Again, buy an ipad mini.ORIGINAL: I would have written a glowing review during the first month like so many on here but then the tablet got a black screen while using it. After trying to get it to turn back on for more than an hour, it powered up. Then I couldn't see anything but the battery icon charging. After another hour, it restarted but it no longer would charge when the unit was on and still won't. The touchscreen periodically stops working as well. Now I have to send it back for repairs which take 14 business days plus transit meaning that I will be without this for almost as long as I have had it.If you google \"nexus 7 won't charge\", you will see tons of people are having this problem after they have the unit for a month or two.

If you're considering buying a nexus, please don't be scared off by the negative reviews. Many of them are about 'problems' that aren't even really problems at all.First, I'm giving the nexus 4 stars because it's fantastic, but the battery charges painfully slowly and the charge doesn't last as long as I had hoped (I'm spoiled by my iPhone which goes for days). The only other negative I can think of is that it is, in fact, an android tab (of course, this is personal preference only)... I hate android, but I'm also a college student and simply can't afford an iPad. This was the next best thing. Seriously, that's saying something. This tablet has incredible functionality, is lightning fast, has a great display, and is the perfect size/price. Goes right into my purse and isn't cumbersome. Easy to use for those of us with tiny hands, and feels well built and durable. I especially love the rubberized backing. A nice amount of memory which makes expansions unnecessary, and its always good to have a device from each side of the fence so you aren't missing out on anything :)Some people are writing negative reviews about their tablet not powering on, and they then assume it's useless, awful, and must be sent to a repair center far, far away....No. This is PERFECTLY NORMAL. You have let your battery die. The tablet is in deep sleep. Charge it for an hour and then hold down the power button for... Oh... About forever. Really, it was about a full minute before mine finally decided to wake up, and I had to try it several times. It'll do all sorts of scary stuff, crackling screen, blank screen, etc. All you need to do is charge it, then wake it up (painstakingly), and then it will work like new again. You can find this answer on the FIRST PAGE of results from a Google search for 'My nexus won't turn on'. Lesson to take away from this? Don't let your battery die while the nexus is powered on. Turn it off if you won't be using it for awhile.Also, your headphone jack isn't broken. The jack is really strange, but it works. You have to push the headphone cord in until it clicks. Yes, it will feel like you're going to break it. Keep pushing, I promise it will snap in and work beautifully.Please note: Asus customer support is useless. They will not tell you these things, they will tell you to send it in for repair. The guy I talked to was probably the most useless CSR I've had to deal with outside of AT&T.; I guess this is another negative, although unavoidable anymore... Any customer service is bad customer service when it's all been sent overseas. You want to talk to someone who speaks English? Buy an iPad. Otherwise, you're going to have to troubleshoot on your own.To summarize, this is a great tablet for the price. It has some quirks, but all you have to do is ask Google. There is always someone out there who knows the answer. These are NOT faulty devices... They just have faulty owners. Ironic though...

I looked at numerous reviews of the Nexus on Youtube, as well as videos for its two primary competitors, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, and the store-centric Amazon Kindle Fire HD.  In the reviews, the Nexus 7 consistently rated as a better tablet than these two other competing tablets, which influenced my purchase decision.  The Nexus even compared favorably to its pricey cousin, the iPad mini.  I didn't want a larger iPad sized tablet because of the bulk, and I really didn't want a tablet that was primarily a conduit to an online store.  I don't plan to buy much in the way of movies, TV shows, books, games, magazines, newspapers, and apps.  Instead, I prefer to transfer my own content to the device, utilizing its 32 GB flash drive (even though only 28 GB of it is useable).I have indeed successfully transferred content from my PC to the Nexus, and the transfer process itself was handled easily with the USB connection, where the Nexus was treated as just another drive.  At first, most of my videos wouldn't play on the device until I discovered the existence of a free app on The Google Play Store called \"MX Player\".  After I installed it, all was perfect...or almost perfect.  All videos, regardless of format are playable with MX Player.  Yet, when many videos play on the Nexus, they stutter every few seconds, which is a problem that was mentioned on one of the Youtube video reviews.  The fault does not lie with MX player, because this happened before I installed that app.  Apparently it's caused by an annoying internal Nexus problem which I hope will be corrected in a future update.Many of the notable features of the device rely on the wi-fi being turned on, and this really drains the battery.  Google's claims of nine or ten hours of battery life are somewhat exaggerated, because I'm lucky if I get five hours of usage per every three hour charge, even with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off.  But I have to admit that those five hours of usage are a joyful and surprising delight.The Nexus uses the Chrome Browser to access the web, and it works just fine.  Surfing the web is a breeze, and it's easy to pinch and flick your way through a web page.  Gmail also works great, and there is a separate app for Youtube.  It's not much of a surprise that the Google Nexus is geared to all things Google, and having a Google gmail account really is a necessity.  The Nexus comes with many default apps, and my plan is to try them all and delete those that I won't use.  The Nexus presumably has better screen resolution than the Kindle Fire or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and it also has the latest version of Android, called \"Jellybean\".  This is good to know, but there are a lot of operations on the device which are still a mystery to me, and I can attribute this to the fact that this is my first tablet, and my first experience with Android.  I'm a Windows guy, and it's a challenge to let my fingers do the walking instead of using a mouse, and to type on that tiny on-screen keyboard.  Many of these new features and operations encountered in the Android realm on the Nexus beg for explanations which are not covered in the Nexus User Guide, and there is no support chatline to ask for quick answers.  The Nexus-Android Forum has been some help, but this device is very slow in yielding all its secrets to this Android newbie.But having said all that, holy mackerel, what a machine!  It is oh so sweet to use, and it is so very glossy looking, and so sturdy and solid to the touch.  I have to ask, how on earth can they sell something with all this versatility, functionality, and miniaturized technology for such a low price??  Even the packaging it came in is top quality, with a great functional design.  With the exception of battery life, this little machine is truly an outstanding device.In addition to the free \"MX Player\" app mentioned above, I've found four other apps which are very useful, and three of the four additional ones are also free. \"Groove IP lite\" allows you to make simple and clear (wi-fi) phone calls, tied to your Google gmail account, and the calls are totally free.  Microphones and speakers are built in to the unit, and the sound is clear and crisp.  There is an app called \"Camera Launcher for Nexus 7\" which allows you to take photos and videos with the 1.2 MP front facing pinhole camera.  While this tiny camera is primarily for use with Skype, the photos and videos captured with it are really quite good.  An app called \"Kingsford Office\" allows access (with editing, no less!) to Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF documents either saved to the Nexus, or in your cloud storage. All four of these apps, as mentioned, are freebies.There is a fifth useful app (for sale at the Google Play Store for $2.99) called \"Nexus Media Importer\", which, in conjunction with a small USB OTG adapter, can display content from a USB thumb drive.  So who needs an SD memory slot?  The Nexus doesn't have to be \"rooted\" to utilize the adapter and app, and in theory, you can also attach peripherals, such as a mouse or keyboard, to the adapter.  In my opinion, all of these apps and the adapter should be part of the Nexus package.There are many native features of the Nexus that impress me, but two of them stand out.  The first is google search with voice, which I've tried, and is quite remarkable.  You can ask google search any search-type question in your own voice, and it answers instantly in a female voice which is very human-like, and it usually displays a diagram of the item asked about.  In a YouTube comparison test between Android's voice search and the iPad's Siri, Android won hands down.  And when it can't answer the question in voice, it displays the google search responses.  The second feature that impressed me is the \"Type text by speaking\" feature.  As you speak, it types what you speak on the screen.  And if you enunciate clearly, it does so accurately.  Of course, this technology has been available on PC's for years, and I even owned such a program, but it was very inaccurate.  To see it run accurately on a small tablet is very impressive.Bottom line:  This is an extremely remarkable and versatile little machine, with features and potential up the kazoo.  It is a sweet, sleek, and classy device, and like I said...almost perfect.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love at first power up", "Author": "J. W. Mullins", "ReviewID": "R1M5OFBJZPI8QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my Nexus for almost a year now. And even though I loved it the day I received it I wanted to wait before reviewing it so the 'new tablet smell' had worn off. As a comparison we also have a Kindle Fire HD and a Ipad 2 in our household. And while I'd prefer not to I don't think I can write a proper review without a little comparison to the other two.There are two major reasons I went with the Nexus instead of the Kindle or Ipad, price and Android. At the $200 mark the Nexus offers a lot of bang for the buck. It is thin, light, has good storage and a wonderful touch screen. And while I am not an Apple hater perse I despise Itunes since I use Window computers not MACs. I don't like the lack of control over my OS that I'd have to accept with the Ipad.Ease of moving files. When I want to watch, listen or read something on my Nexus I just plug it into a computer and drag the file onto the Nexus. No software required, no file conversions, no constant Itunes updates. As an example I watch a lot of .avi files on my Nexus and all that was required to do so was drag the file into the movie file folder. Then a quick download of MX player from the app store and I was good to go. I'd often had a headache converting media files on the Ipad and was amazed and thrilled by how easy it was to do on the Nexus. I've found that the Kindle Fire also offers a very simple process similar to the Nexus.Apps, so many apps. Apple has many times the apps as any other system and many are amazing quality. They have a QC process for apps to be added and thus more control that the Google store, that is undeniable. The top of the line games, apps and the like are often developed for the Ipad first and updated more often than for Android. That said I've been able to download free apps to watch every video, any music file, comics, books, and PDF files and had no issue with the Nexus. I do mostly use my tablet for social media and regular media with some web browsing. So the 'lack' of apps in the Google store is a none issue for me. It also means I have access to some fun games and apps that people have developed and don't want to go through the headache of getting approved through Apple. One thing I'd like to note is that while the Kindle App means you can download pretty much any book, you are limited when it comes to magazines/periodicals. Many are only available on the Kindle and if you are wanting to replace your paper magazines with digital versions the Kindle is the way to go.The touch screen on the Nexus is fantastic and I've never had an issue navigating screens or apps. That said there is just no way that the Nexus can compare to the Ipad at this price. The quality and the resolution are great, but with a side by side comparison the Ipad wins hands down. The Kindle Fire is very similar to the Nexus.Control. I love the level of control I have over the Android OS. I can essentially customize it however I want. When I plug my Nexus into my computer I have complete control. This doesn't make it complicated, as its easy enough to plug and play if you want to go that route. But it means for those who wish to you can customize everything from your home screen to your storage and settings. I don't like to pay money for something and then not be able to do what I wish with it. I hate even more to be locked out of software on a system that I own. A quick google search will show the vast amount of possibilities that are inherent with the open source Android system and the massive amount of support that Google offers for it.All and all the Nexus is my tablet choice hand down. While we have many tablets around the house the Nexus has become 'mine' and I use it far more than either the Kindle or Ipad. I do far more reading on it than expected. Couple with a set of Bluetooth headphones I also use it for my gym times instead of my Iphone. I can fit it in my pocket and the battery life means continental plane travel is a none issue for it.

I knew Google was coming out with the new, improved Nexus 7 and read about the upgrades that the new version would have. Since I'm not much of a gamer and already have the Kindle 8.9 32GB tablet, I figured that saving ~$100 over buying the new model suited me better. Plus Amazon is a super source for cases and screen protectors, which exist in quantity for the old Nexus as opposed to having to wait a few weeks for accessories to appear for the new version.As soon as I received the Nexus 7, I read online that Google had the Android Jellybean 4.3 for it on their developers' site ready to go. I downloaded it and found a program to install it, since I figured it would be a few weeks before Google rolled the update out over the air. My Nexus 7 came with Android 4.1.2 and when I went to upgrade it to 4.2.whatever, it said it was Up-To-Date. Yeah ...right! Well, I learned that upgrading most Android devices is a little more work than upgrading my original Kindle Fire, Kindle Touch and the Kindle 8.9 HD. Amazon has spoiled us Kindle people ...but I'm glad I learned the procedure to manually upgrade an Android device! That was a few intense hours well spent!I did manage to load a few apps on it - before I wiped it, when I did the upgrade, so I don't know how much better Jellybean 4.3 is, versus the older versions, but a few people have said it's made their old Nexus 7's a little perkier and the screen looks a bit more colorful. I also have a Lenovo A2107a 8GB and this Nexus 7 can run rings around it! It's like comparing a 10 year old Yugo to a new Corvette.My advice to potential Nexus 7 buyers - if you can get the old Nexus 7 32GB model for under $199 and you're not a gamer, but just need a general-purpose tablet ..then go for it! If you're a gamer, or just need to have \"the latest and the greatest\" get the 32GB new Nexus 7 and enjoy the 1080P screen and faster processor. All those people that bemoan both the new and old Nexus 7 not having an SD slot, just remember ...there isn't much other than music, photos and PDF's that you can put on it anyway!

I looked at the iPad Mini, but could not justify paying nearly the same amount for a much smaller tablet so I decided to look into Android tablets. I first considered the Kindle Fire HD, but it seemed to have a more closed ecosystem for an Android tablet. So I looked at the Samsung Tab 2, I really liked the features, but having 3G data was important to me, because I used my old tablet for both media consumption and communicating. I looked over \"no-name\" brands, which looked good on paper, but most of the companies I never heard of and sinking $200 to $300 into a product without knowing the company did not appeal to me. Then I heard about the Google Nexus 7 and checked them out. The specs looked good to me; the graphics, the processor, the most current Android version, and Google just released a new model with 3G wireless data. And being pure Android, it had the open ecosystem Android is known for, unlike iOS and to a lesser extent the Kindle. I also had good experience with other Asus products so I took the plunge. I've been very happy with it. My first forray into Android has been very positive. I was able to find all my Chinese apps I used on my iPad and still use on my iPhone, and installed them on my Nexus, they work fine, in spite the Google Play message telling me they are not compatible with the Nexus 7 device. I really liked that I could work around that restriction, which would be much harder to do on iOS. The 3G works as expected, so I can stay in touch anywhere (provide it has coverage) And the battery life is very good. Over all, I am happy I took the chance and gave an Android platform a shot (but I still also like my iOS devices haha).Some issues which might bother some people and even be a deal breaker. There's no front camera, not much an issue for me, but I know others will insist on having one. No mini-SD slot, and I would have liked to have one on the Nexus 7, but still, on balance, the lack of SD was out-weighed by the other features in the end. Cellular data is only 3G, and I realize some people will want full 4G if they go with a cellular-enabled tablet.

They were just horrible, it was quite a nightmare.Oh yes, I also find the navigation/traffic isn't as good as what I have on my TomTom GPS. I thought I'd be replacing my TomTom with it, but I don't think I will.Pros:Price -- $299 from GoogleFunctionality -- Great!Voice recognition -- Works fairly well.Cons:Google customer support is horrid.On occasion it is a little laggy when responding to finger presses.I'm taking away one star for the terrible customer support service I received with an issue that should have been very easily resolved.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO BUYERS REMORSE!", "Author": "Robert York \"maintain_composure\"", "ReviewID": "RQ6TFXJDLIYZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A quick background: I own an iPad2, Blackberry Playbook, Surface RT, and Kindle Paperwhite. I bought the Nexus 7 32Gb with cellular 4G mainly because I own a Samsung Note 2 smartphone. The Nexus 7 was $299, without 4G it's $250.I am not going to compare it to any of the others except the iPad2 and iPad Mini. The Surface RT is not a valid comparison. The Surface RT is a productivity device with a full version of Office and a very cool keyboard/mouse combination. The keyboard snaps in and doubles as a cover. My daughter now uses it for school and loves it.If you own a regular size iPad, the Nexus 7 takes a few days to adjust to. The 7\" form factor at first feels small for a tablet. However, once you start using it you begin to appreciate its portability and fantastic screen resolution. Now for the comparison to the iPad Mini.Pro's:1. Android 4.2 OS. It is the crem-de-la-crem (IMHO). I like it better than iOS.2. Quad core processor. For comparison, the iPad Mini is only a dual core.3. Screen resolution. The Nexus 7 is HD, the Mini is not the Retina (HD) display found on the regular sized iPad.4. Apps. Very much in line with Apple. I like some of the Android apps over Apple. For example, the Kindle app on Android is far superior to Apple. Apple does not allow you to purchase publication from the Kindle app... inexcusable.5. Google play for videos and music. It work really well.6. 1GB DRAM. The Mini only offers 500Mb. The Nexus 7 is a little speed demon!7. Batter life. 10 hours. Nice.8. Standard micro USB charging port. The Mini uses Apples proprietary charging port.9. Price! The iPad Mini, with far inferior specs, is $200 more than the Nexus 7.  If you get 4G, the Mini is $250 more than then Nexus!  That is difficult to justify.Con's:1. No rear facing camera. I NEVER take pictures or videos with a tablet so this is a worthless feature to me.2. No memory expansion slot. 32Gb provides plenty of space but a built in microSD slot would be nice. The Mini does not offer one either.3. No HDMI port. You can buy an add-on to hook into a TV if this is important. The Mini also does not offer a built-in HDMI port.That's it for now. I will update my review after using it for a month or two.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rock Solid Device That Just Works!", "Author": "D. Huynh", "ReviewID": "R13YZBKK9GSV08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like to think of myself as a tech savvy individual but when my family and I got together to celebrate my dad's big b-day this past January, I soon realize, I wasn't so.  You see, my older brother and sister both own new iphones, my niece and nephew both have ipad minis. And as of January, my dad now has the newest ipad 4.  While in contrast, I'm still rocking a 2007 Motorola Razr as my latest tech device.  Don't laugh, please.  Well, that's technically not true, I did purchase a new laptop last year, but it's nothing I would consider carrying around or deem to be portable.Well, after playing around with the ipad minis and ipad 4 during the get together, I realize how much I have been missing out. As mentioned earlier, I have a new laptop that I purchased last year which I love, but with a tablet, consuming media and information is so much easier and fun.  Was a tablet a necessary item to have?  For me, no, but's a great way to kill time and a heck of a lot of fun and in many respects has made my life easier.Well, shortly after, I made it my mission to get a tablet for myself.  I knew what I wanted - something in the 7-8 inch form factor.  My budget was set for $300 which left my options for mostly android tablets.  Also, I wanted to purchase my tablet at a brick and mortar store so that I can return the device in the event I had any issues.After doing some research, I settled on the nexus 7.  I decided on getting a nexus 7 because it was a Google device which meant it would get the latest os updates first.  Also, the device is stock android which means it does not have any added skins or modified OS (operating system), ie, samsung tab & amazon kindle, I'm talking to you.Display - 7 inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1280x800 and a 216 ppi (pixels per inch).  For me, the resolution is quite good.  Could it be better? Sure, but on a screen of this size, I think it is just more than fine.  Nice wide 178 degree viewing angles.  It's great, especially, when you need to show something off to a few friends.  The device has 350 nits of brightness so if you plan on using this outdoors in bright sunlight, it will be a struggle.  Keep this in mind.Battery Life- 4325 mAH (Google claims up to 8 hours of active use)  In my test of mix use: video playback, gaming, web browsing, emailing and e-book reading, etc - I can get about 7-7.5 hours with wifi on.  I have my screen brightness set at half way, I also have a live wallpaper and gps and wifi on, but bluetooth is turned off.  Your usage will vary depending on settings, of course.Appearance - The tablet has an understated look which I think is quite sexy.  There are only two physical buttons on the entire device which are located on the upper right hand side on the back of the tablet.  The button closest to the top is the power/sleep/wake button and sitting below it is the volume rocker. Once the device is powered on, you have 3 touch buttons which sit on the bottom center of the screen.  From left to right the buttons are as follows - back, home button and recent apps button. And the back of the tablet is constructed of a perforated rubberized non-slip material.Form Factor - I think a tablet in the 7-8 inch size range is nice size for carrying around when you are on the go.  I tend to wear cargo shorts mainly and my tablet fits nicely in all my front side pockets.  I'm not going to lie and say doing some things on this tablet is all that wonderful compared to a full size laptop, ie, browsing the web, for example.  On a device of this size it take a little getting use to but is very do-able once you get use to it.Performance - This tablet is sporting a 1.2 ghz processor with a Nvidia Tegra 3 cpu which helps to keep everything flowing nicely.  In addition, the latest OS - Jellybean with its project butter makes everything run smooth and effortless whether it's switching between apps, running graphic intense games, browsing the web or whatever your heart desires.  This little tablet can handle it.  Every app that I was able to download from the Google Play store just works.In summation, I really love this device and do not regret getting it one bit.  Yes, it is with its faults - no micro sd card slot, rear facing camera and no micro hdmi out but I knew that coming into it and those factors really didn't concern me all that much.  I was more concern about buying a solid device with decent hardware that could last at least a couple of years without being obsolete and also be reliable.  And I found that in this device.  If you do plan on purchasing this device or any device for that matter, I would recommend also purchasing a screen protector and a case for protection.  Thanks for reading and if this was in any way helpful, please fee free to give it a thumbs up.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet - workhorse", "Author": "Lectrichead", "ReviewID": "R2K3S1Q1JV8OWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So this year I decided to pick myself up an Android tablet at some point.  I needed to learn the `meats and potatoes' of Android, not just how to use it.  And I needed something hackable and customizable that I could both learn more about Android on as well as use in a practical manner.A Galaxy Tab was my first choice but the Nexus moved to the forefront after a bit.But it's only drawback was the lack of an SD slot. And I felt that this was a major drawback for sure.As these things goes, it happened that after the Nexus had been out for a while a simple dollar (or less) microUSB-to-USB (OTG) cable solved the lack of an SD slot problem.  With the Nexus Media Importer app, the cable, and whatever memory card reader or thumbdrive you want to plug into it - now it can have the ability to transfer data this way and overcome this limitation.This had been the thing holding me back from getting one, for the most part (as well as the money - I'm frugal), and while I had been prepared to buy a Nexus 7 after Xmas my wife beat me to it and picked up one for me, the 32GB one.So I have been using the Nexus for awhile while waiting for the cable to be shipped (which took taking quite some time as it's coming from China); well, I found that I really didn't miss it a bit.  With the various ways and apps for connecting to cloud storage, as well as using my own server, AND using the very excellent, very highly recommended (by me!) Airdroid app I don't miss not having an SD slot at all.Someday I know I'll really need to be able to transfer something via a thumbdrive or plug an SD reader into it - once I get the cable, but for now I don't miss it.  Likely two of the situations where I WILL need this kind of access might be while I am at a customer's and need to transfer something from a computer to the tablet (though I can do this with the Airdroid app anyway) or if I need to access some pictures off one of the sd cards from one of my cameras, like if I'm on vacation or something.I might even find myself taking a vacation or trip without my laptop.  <GASP>  (Sorry - I don't get this attitude of wanting to go technology-less on my vacation.  I'm not stressed out by technology, and I know when to turn it off, and I want to enjoy my vacation in every way possible.)It's possible now, as this Nexus comes close to many of the things I use my laptop for.  And as time goes on I find more useful and comparable apps that brings it closer to my laptop's abilities.  I think there's going to be a need for using my laptop sometimes, but I'm seeing less and less that I need the Vaio for the more I use this tablet.And as tablets become more powerful, and can access more devices (like keyboards and mice) the laptop will likely move more into the pervue of the desktop.  I see more and more people eschewing buying desktops and instead using laptops as their primary computer.A semi-side note here - the cable for plugging USB devices in came in the mail while I was in the process of writing this review.  Ecstatically I opened the package, plugged it in, and with the help of the USB app I was able to access thumbdrives, an SD reader, my Canon EOS Rebel and Canon A570 as well as my Canon digital camcorder directly with the Nexus.  No trouble, no fuss - no taking the memory cards out of the cameras, etc.  I also was able to plug a USB mouse into it and it works well.It's very easy to set up, and whether you like Google or not it's good to go through the process of setting up a Google account for syncing and backing up the tablet.As soon as you use it you can see right off the bat that the quad-core CPU and 12 core graphics chip pumps out a very smooth graphics experience, no matter what you are doing.  I will be able to show website demo's and photos and graphics to customers much easier than with my laptop.  Sure, smaller screen but easy to transfer stuff to their desktops for my serious perusal, with things like Airdroid.And it also has a \"stealth\" fifth core that takes over when there is less CPU demand and conserves power. I have noticed that if I'm just reading a book or doing something fairly passive with the WIFI and GPS turned off; it may show that I have two days worth of power.But it quickly drops when I do things like actively using the browser, typing with the keyboard, etc.  Still a pretty good battery life, not quite as great as the hype on the Google Nexus Page and I think it should be better.  Much better.  Or maybe it's just mine.  I have seen some suggestions that some are better at power conservation than others.I'd suggest it has a lot to do with what you have running.  It's so easy to allow EVERYTHING to give you notifications  but each of those things is checking the Wifi at intervals and using your power so considering turning notifications off on some stuff.  Usually you can just swipe the notification area down and touch the notification and access its options or menu to turn them off. The NFC allows you to \"bump' or at least hold the device very near another device with the ability to transfer data.  I haven't actually tried it, and mine is inside a (cheapo) flip over case folio-style so I likely won't be giving this a shot.  But cool from what I have heard.WiFi reception seems to be real good, I live in an old house with 21 inch thick stone walls in one section, and more modern stick-built walls in the rest.  It seems to penetrate the stone quite well, though understandably at a lower signal strength.  But my other routers takes up the slack and pumps me back up to a good signal.  The Nexus switches seamlessly between the routers quite nicely, despite a slightly non-standard overlap of the router.It's a little awkward taking pictures of anything but yourself but it can be done and the pics are fine at 1.2 MP.  It would have been nice to have a rearward-facing camera.Using the tablet is a pleasure - it's fast and smooth as an iPad/iPhone/iPod and everything seems to work well.  Graphics and the screen are crisp, super-clear and clean.  So nice.  I won't go into speeds and such as I have yet to do any hardcore gaming - not really something I'm much into.Though, of course, so many apps want to leave you notifications, which slows your tablet and eats your battery, and of course for those who are a bit paranoid there are privacy issues when EVERYTHING pretty much can access your private data and location, etc.But a quick click on these notifications by swiping down the notifications section (top-right) and tapping them usually gets you somewhere where you can access a setting to turn off notifications.  This is one thing I don't like about the Android OS - the notifications are very pushy (pardon the pun).  But this is the fault of programmers, not the Nexus.I also keep the GPS and Bluetooth turned off unless I need to turn them on.  Like for mapping programs it's nice to have the GPS fired up, of course!I do occasionally have a crash and a time out in Google Play, but this is likely no the fault of the tablet and has more to do with our Virgin Mobile MiFi crapping out often - the only Internet we can get here (outside of dial-up).The Nexus' casing itself has a nice feel to it, the plastic has almost a leather or porous feel to it and is nicely non-slick (despite looking like it is).I won't go through all the installed apps and the stuff you normally would download, except to say it all functions nicely, smoothly, and many times seamlessly together.  If you want to use another app for defaults for various uses it's easy to set up, same as on any Android device.Widgets are nice, but I find that I don't really use them - it's nice to be able to see the weather at a glance but I'm going to click it any way for more info.  So I've kind of turned off the widgets I had tried out originally.  I like the screen space.Also love Jelly Bean's ability to make nice little IOS-like folders.  Excellent, easy (just drag n' drop), quick.Jelly Bean has some nice improvements over previous Android versions, like the task list and the swiping away of programs you don't want to run any longer.  I find I like Android more and more, and being based on LINUX (there's even going to be a mobile version of LINUX coming out sometime, from Ubuntu - but you can also try different flavors of LINUX right now n your Nexus if you like).The voice commands for Google Now work incredibly well.  With our home Dolby Surround Sound cranked it couldn't quite pick up everything I said, but that's pretty extreme - under normal circumstances it's amazingly accurate.  Ask Google a question and you'll probably get the answer.They keyboard is pretty standard, with predictive typing.  And I'm just getting into using Gesture Typing - swipe your finger over the letters you are typing without lifting your finger.  It seems incredibly fast, though takes some getting used to.  Lots of potential there.The screen itself is Corning\u00ae Fit Glass - which is not quite the same as Gorrilla Glass unfortunately, but it is very scratch resistant.I installed Flash on the Nexus 7, and it works well for me.  At least in my testing but a friend has told me that games don't seem to run correctly on it.  Which is too bad.There's some great apps out there.  And I find the tablet is very much becoming a replacement my laptop in some situations.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Added a star: It's a good value for what it is, well-priced, Android needs more and better-functioning apps", "Author": "Random1040", "ReviewID": "R14CPUUYQDYCIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the new 32GB version and started out with a mild case of buyer's remorse, but I'm warming up to it a bit more.[This was updated 11/24/2012. I'm adding a star to the review, after doing more research on other Android tablets, and updating a few other points, finding a few more uses, and reconsidering how the price fits.]First let me say that I looked at every option in existence [now a bunch more in person], and the Mrs. owns an iPad 3. We each also have laptops, and I own a ridiculously well-equipped desktop. At the end of the day, all of the current generation of tablets have shortcomings, and many have strong points. Of all of them, the Nexus 7 and regular iPad (3rd or 4th generation) are the best bets, though the Kindle Fire HD has a place. Let me just boil the review down easy here:The good:1) The N7 has a great build quality so far as I can tell. Everything from the shape to the textured rubber back makes sense. I don't hear any electronic noise listening to music with headphones.2) Jelly Bean [old and new version] run smoothly and are a clear improvement over past Android builds.3) The display looks really good. Not quite iPad3/ipad4/retina good, but close enough to not miss it during daily use.4) It's a great reader, and both Google's books and the Kindle app work like a charm. Google's app especially.5) Facebook, music, especially Google Play, also great. The stock email app, not so much.6) [NEW] As I student I use a flash card app which working nicely. Input info on a standard computer, and sign in on the N7. Any tablet can do this but extremely useful.7) The price is excellent, relative to what other tablet makers are offering. [Don't even bother with the iPad mini if it's on your possibilities list... if you're going to pay that you might as well just step up to the iPad 3 or 4 and enjoy the nice screen]The not terrible but could use work:1) Lack of apps. Don't underestimate this! I'd heard but didn't fully appreciate how bad it was. I had this dream of subscribing to my favorite magazines and newspapers and enjoying them in a nice format... not to be. The selection is pretty weak, though 3rd parties can aggregate them a bit even if they're a bit clunky. Another app I like on the iPad is Amplitube, which lets you simulate guitar pedals and amps as you plug your guitar into it (works well). No such animal on Android yet.2) Like most readers, it feels a little heavy. Or maybe not heavy, but a little awkward compared to a book. And my thumb always want to touch the spot that changes a page. Seasoned tablet people can probably ignore this, and in fairness the N7 is still better than most competing tablets I saw. Reading off a full size iPad3 is awkward as hell.3) A lot of missing features: no expandable storage, no HDMI are big ones. For the 32GB I wouldn't sweat storage unless you're a complete app pig and insist on keeping a huge media collection on the device (instead of one of the popular cloud services). HDMI I miss more, would be nice to be able to line out to a TV with some video content, but no dice.4) As with Apple, no Flash support. There are workarounds, but the two I tried didn't work out. I appreciate that Flash is dying (and it should), but there is still content out there that uses it.5) EDITED: Recharge not too bad. It was very slow using a different power adapter for whatever reason, the one it comes with does a decent job when run into the wall.6) Screen is a fingerprint magnet with a lot of glare. Plan on applying a film for that.7) The power & volume controls are a little too subdued the way they're placed. Minor point.All in all, it's a solid & well-built piece of work if you can use it. It's probably ideal for someone who uses public transportation and needs to pass the time with a device I'd call half reader, half toy. Provided you own a computer, TV and basic smartphone, this device will probably be redundant for you. If you're buying it to read bestsellers, read Tweets and fling some Angry Birds, [or study flash cards!] you'll be happy.Android' app ecosystem is the biggest concern here. And what they do have are often buggy or blown-up phone apps that are poorly optimized. There seems to be minimal development from publishers thus fewer magazines available. Tried out an app for Ms. Pac-Man, part of the screen is cut off. The Comcast/Xfinity remote control app is okay but gets stuck if you go to On-Demand. The 4.2 Update broke HBOGO (HBO's app that lets subscribers watch content). Just a ton of problems like that.

The only advantage is visual space (on the tablet, almost 1/2 your screen is covered when typing on the surface whereas typing on the keyboard you can still see the whole screen.)

If you are looking for a long term usage review, or a review from experienced Nexus users you will have to search further.Background:My main purpose for acquiring the Nexus is to replace a Kindle Keyboard E-Book reader; the Kindle is a very nicely designed reader but does not offer color.  I wanted a device which would allow me to read technical manuals and follow color schematics, diagrams, etc.The obvious choice for a Kindle Keyboard replacement would have been the Kindle Fire HD, except that nearly everything I read noted that the operating system on the Fire (Android) has been customized to make the device the best Kindle it can be.  For the same price the Nexus 7 offered Android in a more open configuration, thus allowing more choices when customizing the device.I chose the 32 gigabyte model over the 16 gigabyte model because (a) the extra storage was \"only\" a 25% increase over the cost of the base model and (b) I was (and still am) not quite certain what I will end up storing locally on the device and wanted to maximize my option.I did not purchase the Nexus from Amazon, I purchased it at a local computer store because I wanted a \"hands on\" look at the device before purchasing.Setup:I found the original setup (not to be confused with customizing) the Nexus very simple.  I had my wireless router set to broadcast the SSID (the name of the network), and the Nexus located the network without issue and logged in when I supplied the network key.A Google account is required; I already had a Google account and the device had no problem logging into that account once I supplied the necessary username/password.Customization:E-Reader:I downloaded and installed the Kindle app, which registered the Nexus in my Amazon Kindle account.  At that point all of the books which are in my Kindle library became available on the Nexus.  They did not automatically download, rather they are shown within the Kindle app as \"archived\".  The archive is searchable and clicking on a book then downloads the book into the local storage of the Nexus.  Of course one must have a Wi-Fi connection in order to download books, given that this review is on the Wi-Fi model of the Nexus.The screen of the Nexus, unlike the Kindle Keyboard, is back lit. I have had no issues with eye fatigue, etc. reading books on the Nexus (and I gave it a pretty good run through, since for me this is the \"killer app\" of the device; if the e-reader had not worked well the device would have been returned).One caveat - the Kindle Keyboard is lighter, and has controls for paging up/down on each side of the device - thus making it easy to read one handed with either hand.  The Nexus 7, having a touch screen, requires that the page be turned by swiping one's finger across the screen, from right to left to move forward and left to right to move backward.  This makes reading one handed problematical.The Kindle Keyboard has excellent characteristics for reading outside in the sunlight; I have not yet tested the Nexus 7 for reading outside because that would not be a deal breaker for me.  I rarely read outside in the sunlight.It should also be noted that books on the Keyboard Kindle can be organized into \"Collections\" for easy organization.  That feature is not available on the Nexus (nor on the Kindle Fire HD, as far as I am aware).Email:After confirming that the Kindle app would work well enough to replace the Kindle Keyboard I set up Hotmail.  Although I have a Google account my primary email account is through Hotmail; I use Outlook 2010 on my computers and sync contacts, calendar, and email through Hotmail.  I wanted to have the Nexus sync to that data as well.  Following the on screen instructions after clicking on the E-Mail icon setting up Hotmail was a breeze.  I did not have to manually configure the ports or other settings, the Nexus automatically handled the setup once the username/password was supplied.I've confirmed that making changes on the Nexus syncs to Hotmail, and thus back to Outlook on my computers.  Note that 'contacts' data is shown under the \"People\" icon on the Nexus; modifying or deleting a contact in \"People\" syncs back to 'contacts' in Hotmail.  Calendar and mail, of course, sync as well.Anti-Virus:I installed the AVG Anti-virus from the Google Play Store.  I have some experience with AVG (I am a retired I.T. technician) and their freeware version installed easily, performed a scan quickly, and there are not any overly onerous screen ads.Printing:I installed Google Cloud Print on one of my home computers and following the prompts registered all of my home printers (I have a home network comprised of several computers and printers).  I then installed the Cloud Print app from the Play Store on the Nexus, following the prompts, and sent test prints to an HP LaserJet printer.  Printing was very quick.  Note that Cloud Print allows one to print documents but there is, as far as I have been able to determine, no \"Print\" directly available from E-Mail.  However this is, after all, a \"24 hour\" review and I have not extensively investigated the possibilities of Cloud Print.Edit: 2/14/13 - I found that the computer upon which Cloud Print is installed needs to have the printer \"owner\" logged in; otherwise the HP LaserJet did not print, the job was held in the queue, even though the computer was powered up.  The printer is networked, not connected directly to the computer; the problem seems to be the way Google Cloud Print accesses the IP of the printer.  I resolved this situation by making a Kodak Hero 7.1 ink jet printer the default, and setting up \"Cloud Ready\" printing.  The Kodak software coordinates with Google to give a direct path to the printer, removing any computers from the mix.  I confirmed by turning off all of the computers from my home network and sending a print job to the Kodak from the Nexus; the job printed almost immediately.  I recommended that if one is looking to print from the Nexus on a regular basis that a \"Cloud Ready\" printer (there are many) be used if possible.  Brother Corp has a printer:http://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-2270DW-Compact-Wireless-Networking/dp/B00450DVDY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=70H9A6UDQYQN&coliid;=I266I6ACMF5T49that comes with it's own version of such printing, but I do not own that printer and so cannot verify that it will print from the Nexus independent of computers.Microsoft Office:Office 2010 is installed on all of my computers and is my 'go to' resource for documents.  Obviously Office isn't going to install on the Nexus. I installed Kingsoft Office, a free app from the Play Store, and tested by opening an email attachment which was in Word format. There were no issues, with the caveat that Kingsoft generated a message that there was no suitable File Explorer installed on the Nexus.Edit: 2/3/13 - After installing Google Cloud Drive on my laptop I created an Excel file and saved it to Google.  I opened the file on the Nexus using the Kingsoft Office, edited, and uploaded it back to Google.  When opened on my laptop the changes were in place.  If you need more details on the Kingsoft Office capabilities I would recommend \"Googling\" the software and reading the reviews.  I do not expect to be creating complex documents or spreadsheets on the Nexus, but it is heartening to know that there is some level of document sharing/editing/creating available.File Explorer:Following the message from Kingsoft Office I installed the app ES File Explorer, a freeware app from the Google Play Store.  It installed easily and works with Kingsoft.Google Plus:I set up Google Plus but have not investigated the application.  One can only do so much in 24 hours :-) .Games:I am not a huge gamer; I installed Hearts from the Google Play Store and tested. It works similarly to the Hearts game installed on Windows 7.  Screen rendering of the cards is excellent.Maps:I set up Google Maps, allowing the device to find my current location.  Screen resolution is excellent.  I have not yet used the Maps/GPS other than to install the app.Movies:\"Ice Age\" came licensed on the device; I spent a few minutes watching the movie and the screen rendering is excellent.  The sound is acceptable - but note that \"acceptable\" is totally subjective.  The speakers are on the back side of the Nexus, which is not optimal.Overall:I am well pleased with the Nexus after a day of setup and usage.  While it is obviously not a laptop or even a netbook I think that the device does have possibilities for not just the consumption of content but also the creation of content.  The screen is excellent, the range of apps (while not equal to the number of iPad apps) is extensive and growing, the processor is quick to respond and the price point competitive.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "beware of screen flicker problem", "Author": "D.

I bought a Nexus 7 instead and, while I liked my Fire, I prefer the Nexus 7 in ALMOST every way. Below are some comparisons I've made between the two devices. Which one you end up with largely depends on what you want the device for, but here are some considerations.Android versus Kind-of-Android: As my Fire review attests, I took to Amazon's heavily 'skinned' Android more than I thought I would. But with the Nexus 7, you get Android Jellybean in all of its fullness. The Kindle Fire is the easier to navigate device, as the homescreen is basically a carousel of recent items and a list of categories (apps, books, games, movies, web) that you can select. But the Nexus 7's Android is fully customizable with the traditional five home screens you can use to place apps, widgets, bookmarks, and the like. Full Android takes some learning (ICS is more intuitive than prior releases, though), but if you want customization, Nexus beats Fire. I should also mention the internet browsers. With the Kindles, you get Amazon Silk, a fairly slow browser (yes, it markets as fast, but it is slow by every measure) whose biggest selling point is text-rendering. With Nexus, the default browser is Chrome, but there are some other great tablet-optimized browswers like Puffin and Dolphin; while none of them have text-rendering like Silk, a few are flash-enabled, allow private browsing, and some other stuff that Silk does not allow.Reading, Listening, and Watching: I use my tablet largely as a media consumption device, and toward that end, Amazon is second to none. Those of us locked into Amazon's ecosystem of books, movies, and music will do well with the Fire and its integration into the Amazon universe. Buy a book or album, it shows up on your device (or your cloud). Have Prime? It is easy to stream Prime videos straight to your device. But here's the thing: you can do a lot of this (except for streaming video) on the Nexus, as Amazon's apps are freely available on the Play market. The two things you will (kind of) give up are the robustness of the kindle ebook reading experience (text-to-speech, for instance, is only available on kindle devices) and streaming Prime movies. Of course, I said \"kind-of\" give up because you CAN stream prime movies on the Nexus 7 via a few Flash enabled browsers that you can find by doing a web search. Oh, and as far as ereading apps, you are not locked into any one provider on the Nexus: Google Boooks, Nook, Sony Reader, Mantano Reader, Aldiko - it is all easily available on the Play market (where with the Fire, you have to go through a fairly tedious sideload process).Tablet Hardware: Okay, here, the Nexus 7 is the CLEAR winner. In honesty, the Fire and Fire HD just strike me as somewhat cheaply made (and the Fire is just bulky). The Nexus is not only an inexpensive tablet, but a really pretty and solid-feeling one as well. It is lighter than the Fire (by a lot) and HD (by a noticeable little). The screen is just better on the Nexus than the HD (even though the specs are roughly the same), and the Nexus is DEFINITELY faster than either the Fire or HD. The two areas where I think the Kindle does have the advantage hardware-wise are that the side bezels are thicker (more room for your thumb to grip the front of the device in portrait mode), and the speakers (Fire and HD have stereo speakers that are very good quality, while Nexus has one speaker that is light and tinny).What each has that the other doesn't: The Nexus is more of a serious tablet than the Fire. It has features like Google voice search (like Appple's Siri, but more polished), Google Now (sort of a personal planner), and GPS. None of these are available on the Kindle Fire.On the other hand, the Fire and HD are great media consumption devices: on the devices, you get text-to-speech for most kindle books, whyspersync (where you can buy the book and audio book combo and have the kindle sync them so that you can switch between the two), and streaming of Prime video (per above, a big awkward on the Nexus). While not particularly a feature of the Fire or HD, I should mention that Amazon has phenomenal customer service for these devices, while Nexus customer support is spotty.Really, it comes down to what you want. As you can see, both devices have features the other does not have, but for my money, I still prefer the Nexus on balance. It is a more solid tablet (remember, my Fire HD's hardware encountered problems, which isn't normal, but it isn't abnormal). And it is a tablet that, unlike the Fire and HD, do not seek to lock you into one content provider. If it is available on the Play market, I can get it. And the Nexus's Google Voice and Google Now features are surprisingly helpful.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good stellar product from Asus/Google", "Author": "JDeltree", "ReviewID": "R37RYJTCIRTTX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being my 2nd tablet and 2nd tablet from Asus as well.

When compared to my asus transformer prime which was more of a fragile shiny 'statement' tablet, the Nexus 7 still stands out tall. 7 inches seems perfect for a tablet. I doubt i would ever be going back to 10 inches. The comfortable build you get as well as stock android jelly bean makes this tablet an addictive piece of tech. I have not been able to put this down since I received it. This is a 3G model as advertised and everything came sealed and neatly packaged (as expected) in 2days after I placed my order. Note however that this does not come with the capability to text or make phone calls out of the box. There are some 3rd party apps for text messaging as well as other options which would require root access. As for phone calls, I am yet to find any suitable means of getting regular network gsm calls to work. The apps you find only help you make voip calls - a solution i'm not interested in.

I recieved it as a gift, but after a month of use I felt that I needed to tell others about it.I have played with an ipad, a samsung galaxy tab, and a kindle fire so I know my tablets pretty well.I use my Nexus to play games, stream videos, surf the web, and take notes during class, and these are some observations that I have made.PROSHardware- The Nexus 7 boasts extremely impressive hardware including a 1.2 gHz processor, 1gb of ram, and (in this case) 32gb of storage space.Android OS- The Jelly Bean Android OS is amazing, smooth, and works well with the 7in tablet design. For me switching from iOS to Jelly Bean felt like taking the training wheels off of my bicycle. At first I felt overwhelmed but after a day I was able to figure out the OS and am now able to operate it with ease. Jelly Bean is extraordinarily customization since you can find several different customization apps on the Google Play store.Google Play- Apple boasts that it has the largest selection of mobile applications in the world. While this may be true, the Google Play store also has a large selection of apps that allow you to do anything from playing games to streaming TV shows and movies. All of the more popular apps (angry birds, facebook, netflix, hulu, skype, etc) are there.Size and build- The 7in size of the Nexus 7 is perfect for the person who is on the go often. You can easily slip it into a purse or a bag, even with a case, and you can hold it easily with one hand even if you have smaller hands. People tend to complain about the \"rubber\" back of the tablet but I happen to like it. It doesn't slip when its on a desk or table and feels nice and solid in your hands.Battery Life- My nexus can last a couple of days of use even with light video watching. Sometimes I can get through an entire day while only using 20% of the battery (though usually this sould be a day of pretty light use).CONSLagging- Sometimes the tablet will lag quite significantly. A quick restart fixes the problem thoughThickness- Not a problem for me, but some people prefer a thinner tablet. The Nexus is a little thick, especially compared to an iPad.No rear camera- Personally I never plan to take pictures with my tablet when I have a nice phone handy. However it is good to know that the Nexus does not have a rear camera. It does have a front-facing camera that can be used for video chatting.CONCLUSIONIt you are looking for a 7in tablet that will last you a while, look no further. I would definitely recommend that you buy the Nexus 7.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Trend Setter and Game Changer", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UUW9W3LQDD44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like all those things which has proved the greatest Steve Jobs wrong or even has potential of doing it.

(ii) Touch devices with stylus dead on arrival: Galaxy Note proved it wrong. (iii) Who reads books? First Kindle proved him wrong. (iv) Tablet of smaller than 10 or 9 inch screens are of no use.AND THEN COMES NEXUS 7 TO PROVE HIM WRONG AGAIN.IN SHORT ITS GAME CHANGER OR TREND SETTER, AFTER THIS DEVICE, SMALLER SIZED TABLETS MIGHT BECOME FASHION AND GO HEAD TO HEAD OR EVEN FAR THAN THEIR BIGGER BROTHERS.MARK MY WORD : YOU WILL USE LESSER BIGGER SIZED TABLETS OR LAPTOP FOR THAT MATTER ONCE YOU HAVE IT.IT'S ALWAYS MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ONES RATHER.Now please proceed to the detailed review of this great device (this deserve it)1. VERY BEAUTIFUL DEVICE: SIMPLE, SLEEK, SEXY AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS LIKE APPLE DEVICE MINUS ALUMINUM IN BACK FOR HALF OF THE MONEY.2. MOST PORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO USE AND CARRY. BEST FOR CASUAL USAGE: Its just like novel which you can put in pocket and use it any convenient position. Nothing beats it in this regard. People are using it even for serious work.3. VERY POWERFUL.4. VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED OPERATING SYSTEM equivalent to iOS but more powerful, flexible and customizable. It puts YOU IN COMMAND and don't let you feel helpless or dumb. You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI (Buy any micro USB to HDMI adaptor). I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART.

Lockwood", "ReviewID": "R1RKYAQ6DD11Z9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The main points that led me to purchase this tablet were:1. Price2. The amount of memory3. The fact that it is a Nexus 7 means that my operating system will always be up to date.Within minutes of turning the device on and connecting to the internet, it was already starting to update the OS. It was all automatic, all I had to do was watch while it rebooted a couple of times. First it updated to the highest version of Jelly Bean, then it rebooted and updated to KitKat 4.4.2. I was concerned that there might be a performance hit, but I am not noticing anything like that at all. I read that some users have had problems updating this Nexus 7 2012 up to KitKat. They experienced a slow down in the operation of the tablet. Perhaps they should have done a factory reset before the upgrade. The slowdown problem that I read about seemed to have to do with a cache that was left on the system at the time of the upgrade. A factory reset would have deleted that, as well as any other legacy files.Because of all of the security issues with outdated operating systems and software that have been happening lately, I came to the decision that I will no longer buy devices that will be left hanging without official OS updates. Windows and Apple both manage to do this for a reasonable amount of time after purchase.  So why can't Google force the device makers to do this, at least for the first few years of ownership?  Until this happens I will not buy Android phones or tablets that are not supported by Google. Phone and tablet makers who are not willing to help extend the life of our devices and keep our data as secure as possible by giving us the latest operating systems should not be supported in my opinion.This tablet is on sale at Best Buy this week for $149, saving ~$100 over what the 2013 Nexis 7 with 32 GB would have cost me.  There will come a day when it will start to feel sluggish, when that happens it will be time for a new tablet.

But for a larger Dobsonian you might be able to attach it directly to the tube and use it as a crude spotter or for push-to guiding.I researched iPads at first since they seem to be the most common and reliable but was not happy with how quickly Apple obsoletes its older products. I used some astronomy software on an iTouch but Apple won't allow updates to download to it since it is an older version. A fellow astronomer on Astronomyforum.net suggested I try a Nexus tablet over a cheaper droid device. I'm really glad I listened as really feels nice in the hands, durable and quick as it needs to be. The 32GB is ample to load up several DVD quality movies and the Wifi moves these back and forth in minutes.Unfortunately instead of using this for AP I wound up getting distracted with the great variety of tasks it can accomplish. It is really nice being able to take this out for a quick visit to a news site, Panoramio, Foursquare, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Its like having a fully functional computer that you can jam into a fat pocket!My biggest use so far has been loading it up with movies or TV shows to watch since I have a long commute for work. The portability of the Nexus 7 beats any portable DVD or Blue-ray player and the battery lasts longer than that I have owned. Its also nice being able to load up several movies and not have to swap discs. The device is also fully capable of streaming Youtube, Hulu etc when in WiFi range. If the screen isnt big enough for you, you have the option to Chromecast these videos to any HDMI (Television) device on your connected network. Getting files onto the Nexus is very easy, you can either plug in a USB to micro USB (Wish they had used mini or full size USB as the connector seems flaky). Since Droid has such a wide variety of software available you can also download a file browser such as ES Explorer and copy these over your network (or the Internet) via FTP, or Samba etc.Google is able to offer these durable top notch tablets fairly cheap as they are trying to get their name out. In other words, it comes preloaded with Google apps, works great with Chromecast etc. Another nice thing about being a Google product is that it gets the firmware updates before other devices! These updates usually take 3-4 minutes to install compared to 3-4 hours for a similar firmware update on my Surface RT. Unlike the Surface and possibly the iPad is that Droids allow you to choose your internet browser, Mozilla firefox (can sync favorites and history with your desktop), Internet Explore or Google's own Chrome.The learning curve to using these (my first tablet) is pretty quick. These are not my first tablets ever as one vendor shipped me a Surface RT for $75 (instead of a scratch and dented 2012 16GB Nexus 7). I thought the Surface was a heck of a deal until I started using it. The new Metro interface and Windows 8.1RT has all he unfriendliness and bad aspects of the past versions of Windows including being a real resource hog. I do miss a regular keyboard but for light use, the screen keyboard is sufficient. In fact, my wife liked it so much I wound up buying her a Nexus 10 for the 2013 Christmas season.The biggest drawback with the Nexus 7 will likely be charging issue. If you Google this or look at some of the other reviews you will this not an uncommon problem. I believe the Nexus 7 has a small chip inline with the battery and for some reason it decides to charge at a really low rate. This seems to be exasperated when the battery is really low or dead and you plug in the charger. If you unplug the charger from the wall and plug it back in a few times during the charge cycle it usually seems to clear this up. If this is the case Google could easily just make a charger that cuts power briefly once an hour and this would allow the chip to work with some battery behind it and hopefully make the right decision about how much current to draw. Or better yet, why not have a charge light on the charger to let you know you its drawing 2a? This used to happen often for me even though I am a daily charger (my Treo 650 that I still use runs on two charges a  month) often to get annoying. The docking base they sell for it seems to have cut back on this and I have only had it not fully charge overnight once on me.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best part of my life.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "ROHMQIJASDNZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Nexus 7 (2012) for 7 months now, and hands down, it's the favorite thing I own.

My brother found the tablet and put it on the backpack. I told him to throw it away, and that had no chance to the thing work again after all that time inside the water.Well my friends, once more I was wrong,Today, almost two months after the accident my brother gets home saying that have a Xmas gift for me.Surprise!!! It`s my Nexus!He told me he put it on rice few hours after finding it, and last week he decided he would give the tablet a try. So he opened it and spend 4 days cleaning the dirty from the inside. And when he finished:Tadam!!!My nexus is working perfectly!!! He didn`t replace any piece, only cleaned it.I can`t tell how amazed and happy I am.I even baptized my nexus Michael Phelps for being such a great swimmer.All my books, apps, musics and pictures are there. Saved like if nothing had happened, just waiting for me to play.Now, yeah! My brother did an outstanding work, he should be hired for a huge tech company, but only a great product could survive more than 12 hours under the water.Besides being my personal 7 inch hero, even before the accident I notice that the touchscreen is great (better than IPAD), the voice response is super cool (I love ask google to google stuff) and the size is perfect. I really enjoy reading on it, and I am the old kind of person who still buy paper book.Before buying it I was worried about space, but I never get even close to my limit of 32gb, and I have a cable that allows me to connect my pen drive on it.So if I can tell anything about this tablet is: My best amazon purchase!I Would recommend it even for Steve Jobs.PS: Real costumer, real history and real fishes were swimming around the tablet under the river.PS2: My car didn`t get such a great review unfortunately.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not reliable at all, worst device every owned", "Author": "Leigh", "ReviewID": "RSHQD41UIHLT0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I bought the Nexus 7, there have been two Android updates, first 4.3, and then 4.4.

With a touch-screen, such simple matters as selecting text to cut copy or paste can be <<< utterly maddening.>>> However, these routine tasks become easy, even quite pleasant, with a decent external mouse and good external keyboard. Good peripherals take up very little briefcase space and really make the Nexus 7 an excellent road-warrior.

Spend $200 for a spare tire, professionally speaking? Sure.)

El Cheapo went to its' grave with nearly all my files...thankfully, TF/MicroSD Cards are fairly cheap, and interchangeable with other Android devices, so I was able to transfer those to Old Reliable (an earlier-version Android device I had purchased last year). I then turned to my Facebook Groups, asking what would be a suitable replacement for the A10 Allwinner that had just died. The overwhelming majority said \"Get A Nexus 7.\" Well, I was understandably hesitant...after all, it was relatively expensive ($250+), but the features were far better than the cheap knock-offs (1280X800 display, NVIDIA GeForce Video Processor, a *QUAD-CORE* processor, long battery life, wi-fi, etc.) Well, truthfully, I didn't get much farther than \"NVidia\" before I decided this was going to be my next tablet, as I have NVidia graphics processors in both my desktop and laptop computers. The 32GB internal storage was a real bonus, as was the USB OTG feature (I suppose it has a SATA SSD that could be expanded, but I'm not going to crack the case to find out). The OS is incredibly easy to use...if you've used an Android platform for a few months (or years), it won't be hard to adapt (unlike those incredibly confusing iProducts).I've not used all the features as yet (such as the camera) as I'm still restoring my previously-purchased apps to the device.The one big downside I can see (so far) is the inability for this tablet to accept standard or micro SD Cards. Whether this was intentional, or an oversight on Google's part, I don't know. Perhaps this feature could/should be included in future Nexus Devices.Overall, I'm happier with this new tablet than I ever was with my old El Cheapo. I've loaded music onto it, and am listening to Meat Loaf's \"Hits Out Of Hell\", with all the clarity of the best of CD Players. I think I'll download Skype next and have a chat with my brother in California...EDIT, 5/23/13:Another Amazon User (Kinchas) suggested getting Nexus Media Importer, as did many other Nexus Users. I have to say, that has been one of the most useful apps I've ever used. I still think Google's choice of not including an SD/Micro SD slot is a terrible oversight, but with Media Importer, you're not limited to just a few measly gigs of storage (it was able to handle a relatively small 1GB thumb drive with all my Mythbusters pics on it very well), but, potentially up to the terabytes range...and I do have a 3TB drive not being used. I also like the tablet's ability to use wireless storage drives, like the Kingston Wi-Drive. Granted, you have to set it up like a wi-fi and download the app, but once that's done, it works great.Another downside I've found is the USB port itself. There's only the one micro USB port. Sure, it's very useful for charging or transferring files (both at the same time if you connect the tablet to your computer), but if you want to charge the battery *and* use an external storage device...well, that could present a problem. Perhaps a second USB port would be beneficial.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Becoming one of my favorites!", "Author": "Judy L.", "ReviewID": "R1UFJXD331W9KF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At this point in time I have a number of tablets including a Kindle Fire HD 7\", a Mini iPad, a 10\" Asus TF300, and an iPad 3. The Kindle Fire HD was my first 7\" tablet. I got it because it was relatively less expensive than most of the other 7\" tablets, and I wanted to see if I liked the 7\" vs. the 10\" tablet. As it turned out, I really like the size of the 7\" tablet because of the portability, and it's less weight to hold for reading. Next I got the iPad Mini. I have to say that I love the iPads. Even though you are tied into iTunes for downloads, the applications seem to be more fully developed than most of the comparable Android apps, and the latest version of iTunes is really handy for organizing apps, music, etc, and can also be used to organize apps on the iPads. As many reviewers have already stated, comparing the IOS system of the iPads and the Android systems is like trying to compare apples to oranges.Even though I wouldn't part with my iPads, I do enjoy the Android devices. I posted a review of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD shortly after I got it, and before I got the other 7\" tablets including the Nexus 7. I love my Mini iPad, but I wanted a 7\" android tablet. When I found out that the Nexus 7 was made by Asus, I was immediately intrigued because I have the Asus TF300 and have been impressed with the Asus tablets. I considered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, but after comparing the specs with those of the Nexus 7, decided that the Nexus 7 was the superior tablet.Having had the Nexus 7 for a couple of weeks, I have found that it is very similar to the Asus TF300 as far as quality, setup, and operation. Since the Nexus 7 is Google oriented, it has a sidebar on the right side that contains primarily Google links, and on the left side of the screen there is a bar for the voice Google search. I don't have a problem with this because I use many of the Google services. Aside from this, the home screen and other screens are completely customizable. Folders can be set up to group applications, and they can be placed on any of the multiple screens available. The system is very fast and responsive. I haven't gotten into rooting the system because I haven't had a need for it. I don't think the risk is worth the possible benefits.As for charging the system, it doesn't require anything special. If you have a mini USB to USB cable, you can connect it to any A/C adapter that you have that takes a USB connector. I use the same cable for charging my phone, the Nexus 7, my keyboard, and my mouse. It does not require a special charging cable as many of the other tablets do.As compared to the Kindle Fire HD, the Nexus 7 has much more flexibility, and is much more customizable. The screen of the Kindle Fire HD cannot be customized as  far as showing applications that you have available. The Kindle Fire HD has one screen that shows a turntable of apps that you have used, and they are shown in the sequence that you used them. If you try an app and don't want to use it on a regular basis, you have to remove it from the turntable. There is no organization other than the sequence that you open apps. If you remove an app and want to use it again, you have to go to the list of installed apps to find it. The same is true for videos, music, and anything else you may have on the tablet. In addition, Google android apps are not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. So apps used are confined to the Amazon world. The Nexus 7 can use both Google and Amazon android apps.The only downside that I have found for the Nexus 7 is that not all Google android apps are compatible with this tablet, but they are for my Asus TF300 tablet and for my phone. This may change with future updates to software. I did buy this tablet with the AT&T; sim card, and bought it directly from Google because the price was less than the Amazon price. I would highly recommend this tablet for anyone looking for a versatile and high quality 7\" tablet that doesn't have a huge price tag.UPDATE!!I have had the Nexus 7 for a couple more weeks, and it is still one of my favorite of the tablets that I have. It has all of the flexibility of the Asus TF300 tablet and the size makes it extremely portable. At least for now, this is one of the tablets that I wouldn't part with. The Nexus 7 is compatible with both Google apps and Amazon android apps. Whereas, the Kindle HD is compatible only with Amazon Kindle apps, and not even all of them. The apps must be specifically compatible for the Kindle HD. I also find it curious that the Kindle app for reading books is much nicer on the iPads and android tablets than it is on the Kindle. You would think that the Kindle app on a Kindle tablet would be superior to what it is on other tablets.

So, decided I should modernize and get a tablet.  I DID NOT WANT A SMARTPHONE.  Why? Because when I need a phone, it better work.  Smartphones (and the Nexus) need to be charged daily and face it, if they are being used heavily, they may need to be charged during the day.  I live in an area that is decidedly rural with lots of cellphone dead zones.  The plain old cellphone gets way more reliable connection and battery life in this environment.

This has actually improved my health as I can move from one position to another easily and reduce my incidence of migraines from sitting in one position for too long.I have read these reports about slowness as the Nexus ages.  What I'd like to know is, how many apps do these people have on their devices?  Did they pay the extra fee to get rid of the ads?  Are the apps polling all day long for updates?  Because I'm not seeing these problems.  I regularly check to see what is running and if an app is constantly running when not being used, it may go on the chopping block.  Same with ads.. They better have an ad-free version.  I also check permissions for the apps before I download them and I prevent auto-upgrades to recheck what new permissions are being added each time.  Ripped Facebook off because of its increasing privacy intrusions, in fact.

After a week or so, it seems to be holding up and doing what it is supposed to do and that seems to be that it keeps running.  Before my purchase, I read a lot of the \"one-star\" reviews and finally decided that most of the negativity was due to over expectation and stupidity rather than bad luck.  I have been waiting for my Nexus 7 to summarily quit on me but so far, it is going strong.If \"battery problems\" arise, I know they will be caused by the possibility of a loosened connector and can easily be repaired by opening the case with a guitar pick and correcting the defect.  Apparently, if you mishandle your Nexus 7 and knock the battery loose, it is possible to dislodge one of the battery connectors, causing it to become intermittent and/or disconnected altogether.By reading many of the \"fixes\" for this malady, I have come to the conclusion that one of the battery leads is a trifle short and if the battery shifts, the connector is pulled loose.  NO BIG DEAL!  My take on this is that, like all OEM's, ASUS buys their components from various souces and does final assembly at one or more of their facilities.  In all likelihood, the original design was flawless but as battery technology improved, the newer batteries became slightly smaller and the locations of the connectors changed.  Thus, the battery was held in place by some double-stick tape and one of the battery leads was just long enough to be able to do it's job.  Again, no big deal, and I figured that IF I had this problem, I'd just open that puppy with a guitar pick and take a look.I like to take stuff apart anyway and tightening connectors is just part of normal maintenance so far as I'm concerned.  If needs be, I can lengthen the offending lead, resecure the battery etc.. And then, I know how to replace the battery when it actually does poop out.In a few months, if nothing catastrophic happens, I'll add to this review and probably upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  Naturally, by that time, the new Nexus 7 equivalent will be out, with all sorts of better bells and whistles.  If I like the Android system, I will consider getting the newest hardware but I'll keep my present Nexus 7 for a back-up, knowing that I can take it apart and keep it running.Besides loading a slug of \"aps,\" I did upgade the software to 4.2.2.1, and it was a piece of cake.  This was probably because I decided to order my Nexus 7 through Amazon, paying an extra $10, just to be sure that I got the most recent hardware issued from the factory.  I like factory upgrades and Asus is good at keeping them current.More to follow.UPDATE!:I've given it another star - for longevity, not features.My wife has not been able to kill our Nexus 7 yet.

Fewer is better and read those \"permissions\" carefully.  These \"Apps\" both free and costly, can really screw up your device, and your life!

I am mainly comparing this model to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, a 7\" with 8 GB storage, but with an expansion slot.  I recently acquired the Galaxy model, and reviewed and returned it.  Recent builds of the Android operating system do not make good use of storage expansion.  You may not install apps to it, and many apps which write data cannot be configured to write to it.  While you can use the storage to copy large media files, I felt that the 8 GB available for apps was too limiting.  so I returned the Galaxy and acquired the Nexus.The Nexus is a near ideal 7\" tablet.  Android runs beautifully on it, with apps opening noticeably snappier than on the Galaxy.  The processor seems faster and the screen resolution is higher.  Additionally the rear of the unit, with a kind of a textured rubber is friendlier for holding the unit.  I don't want to be too disparaging of the Galaxy, as it is a strong and capable unit.  I just feel that the Nexus is better.  (As I write this, there is word of a Samsung Galaxy 3, so the market is rapidly evolving).The Nexus has the latest version of Android (Jelly Bean), and can be set to automatically update the OS and any apps in the background.  Wifi performance has been excellent.  Netflix and HBO streaming video run very well, and it is, of course, an excellent ereader, supporting the Kindle app and others.  The unit has stereo speakers, but for any serious listening, you will want to use headphones.  The audio volume through the speakers is low, and even through headphones it doesn't get really loud.

I am writing this review on my MacBook Air. I own an iPhone5, and have an iPad Third Generation. I bought this tablet over the iPad Mini after much contemplation. I needed a smaller tablet that is more portable for my job. I'm in retail, and frequently I need to look up products online for customers and was growing tired of having to walk to a desktop computer with the customer in tow. I was a little leery of Android from all the reports of malware that is reported on the web. However, I bought my sister a Nexus 7 for Christmas (she was VERY specific). I only handled it once, but I was impressed with the fluidity and screen resolution. After a few weeks, I asked her if she liked her tablet. She was so excited to tell me that she was very happy with the Nexus 7.This tablet is very light weight. It feels great in your hands. I do recommend getting some kind of case or shell for it because even though it is textured on the back, it does feel at times like it might slip out of your hands. Android Jelly Bean 4.2 comes standard, and my oh my have they made headway with this OS. It's fast, sleek and smooth. It opens programs rapidly and has a beautiful interface with each. I do suggest that you download Avast! mobile security. It is free, and it also happens to be the top rated tablet anti-virus/malware software currently on the market. I did heavy research before my tablet arrived. One great thing that I have noticed with Jelly Bean is that there are fewer apps that run in the background automatically as in previous versions. I still use Task Killer to shut them down to conserve battery life. Speaking of which, I have been able to get almost 7 hours out of a charge of surfing the internet, playing music, etc. The tablet comes with a free HD movie, Ice Age, and I suspect it's to show off the beautiful screen resolution. Some people think they need a 10\" tablet to view movies, but I've never felt like I was squinting to watch anything.Apps. They are great. I love Google+, Pinterest, and Instagram. Gmail also runs great and has a simple yet intuitive interface. There are of course the others, such as Facebook and Twitter. I don't personally use Twitter, but I did take a peek at it, and it's quite beautiful and crisp. There a several games that render beautifully on the tablet. I also like the Evernote App, it comes in handy for work and also for my other half and I to send grocery lists to each other.Bottom line: If you want a very portable tablet that is fast, powerful and beautiful, this tablet is the one for you! I paid $270 plus a $59 two year accidental drop, spill and damage warranty from SquareTrade that guarantees my tablet repaired or replaced in five days or they'll pay me $300. I've done my research, and they are the real deal. They receive excellent reviews from all the tech websites such as CNET, Techradar, Android Central, etc. This would be a great tablet for a teenager because you wouldn't have $600 in an iPad for them to break it or loose it. You can also encrypt the tablet to protect your data if you have sensitive work information. I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad hardware quality", "Author": "Erick Houli", "ReviewID": "R11D28DB1GYRYU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had the tablet for a few weeks and found out today that the Microphone is not working, after Googling (isn't it ironic?) these Nexus 7 have been known to have this issue, I bought it through Amazon marketplace, but can't return it because of Adorama's policy.Be my guests, google for Nexus 7 microphone's issue.Other than that, I think is a nice offer for the price, but Google needs to raise their manufacturer's requirement standards, the Nexus 7 has been out for a few months and the issues should've been sorted out.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet with issues", "Author": "J.

That tablet was far worse.  I was ready to give up on ASUS altogether and wait for the Tab 3 later this month but after realizing I am still basically waiting for Jelly Bean on my Galaxy Tab Plus in vain simply because Samsung left us to twist in the wind, I decided not to wait for the Tab 3 and gave another Nexus a try from a different vendor altogether.  Wow! What a difference getting a good one makes.  I don't know what was wrong with the first two that I tried but this one is MUCH better.  The screen is clearer and the whites are not as dingy or yellow.  So far, there have been no problems for two weeks now and Android has upgraded three times since purchase (Take that Samsung).  I don't want to jinx myself but I finally have a winner Nexus 7.  The reason I won't upgrade my star rating is because ASUS has wildly inconsistent quality control issues.  The first two Nexus 7s I tried were awful but they were from the same vendor and had similar serial numbers.  The third was from a different vendor and has totally different numbers and best of all, works! It shouldn't be that big of a crap shoot to get a decent ASUS tablet.  Out of the three ASUS Nexus 7's and two ASUS TF300's I've tried the past month, these were the results: Nexus 7 number one exchanged due to severe screen flicker, Nexus 7 number two returned for refund due to failure to charge, TF300 number one was exchanged after developing two very noticeable mura spots (looked like two glowing white orbs), and TF300 number two was returned after developing dead pixels the second day.  It also had significant backlight bleeding that I was willing to overlook, but not the dead pixels as well.  Finally, Nexus 7 number three is perfect so far.  Not to toot Apple's horn but facts are facts.  I've purchased five iPads, at least one from every generation, since its initial release and not once have I had such problems with them.  If you can get a good one, the Nexus 7 is a great tablet.  ASUS, please get your Q&A; together.  There is a fine line between value and cheap.  If the quality is that shoddy, may as well buy one of those cheap knock-off tablets.--------------------I recently purchased a 32 GB Nexus 7 to compliment my standard iPad for those times when I don't feel like holding such a hefty device.  First, the form factor is perfect.  It fits perfectly in one hand and I love that there are only two buttons, power and volume. The rear has a bumpy matte plastic finish that makes it easier to hold without it sliding.  I figured with the specs and for $249, it was a steal.  Then I turned it on.  The first thing that disappointed me was how warm the screen color was.  If you have nothing to compare it to, it looks acceptable if not a tad washed out; however, when I placed it next to my wife's Galaxy Tab Plus, it was no contest.  Her tablet was much brighter, more vibrant and displayed much better looking pure whites.  By comparison, my whites looked dingy with a yellowish tint and colors were more washed-out.  Despite less than stellar colors, the 1280X800 display was more sharp and crisp than the Tab.  I noticed that the colors on the Nexus improved a bit after the screen had a little time to burn it, although they were still no match for the Tab, even with the tab's lower resolution.As far as performance, it was a mixed bag.  I have to say I honestly expected better.  For instance, Subway Surfers runs flawlessly on my iPad 3 but stutters at times on my Nexus. Now, I realize the iPad 3 has a better GPU, but the Nexus was only marginally better than the Tab as well.  The Nexus even rebooted spontaneously on me a couple times for no reason during tasks.  That leads me to my biggest problem with the device, too many quirks.  Other than the random reboot, the first Nexus I had was okay.  I was perfectly content to keep it until the screen started randomly flickering.  I first noticed it during gaming but noticed it in other areas as well.  I'd have flashing horizontal lines across the display.  I subsequently exchanged it for another Nexus 7.The second Nexus was much like the first but with noticeably less flicker.  I was actually enjoying it for nearly a week until the battery completely drained during use and I attempted to charge it.  I had previously charged the device once before but the battery wasn't completely drained during that initial charge.  It was down to roughly 2%.  I plugged it up and it charged fine.  This time however, I plugged it up and instead of the charging icon, the unit booted.  I figured it was normal because my iPad and iPhone also boot after charging a few minutes with a completely drained battery.  However, it booted to the main screen, the low battery alert sounded and the device shut down again.  I again mistakenly assumed this was normal and that it just went dark to charge.  However, it rebooted again, and again, and again....  Each time it rebooted, the main screen would display for a few seconds, the low battery alert sounded and it rebooted again.  It seemed like it was getting just enough juice to boot and then shut down, only to repeat the process.  I allowed it to do this for roughly 10 minutes, hoping it would eventually get enough juice to end the cycle and charge normally, but it didn't.  I then scoured the Internet for answers and was shocked by the number of users reporting screen flicker and charging issues.  The weird thing is, although I came across a few random bad reviews of the tablet from users during my research before purchase, I did not encounter the staggering number of reviews specifically related to my same issues until I typed the exact symptoms into the search engine.Needless to say, I followed the advice I found in an Android forum and booted into the boot loader and allowed it to charge a bit in there.  Once I rebooted, it charged normally.  I wanted to see if I could duplicate the issue, so I again allowed the battery to completely drain and attempted to charge.  So far, I am unable to duplicate the issue.  I honestly feel all these issues are tied into the latest Android version 4.2.1.  Many people are content to keep finding solutions as new random problems arise or they are sadly beyond their return period (I saw quite a few posts filled with buyer's remorse) but I don't have time for all that nonsense, so back it went.  Last year I was furious with Samsung for taking forever with their Ice Cream Sandwich updates and that's how my wife ultimately ended up with the Galaxy Tab Plus which was originally mine.  I now see that it's best to hold out until the developer is absolutely certain that the software is ready instead of releasing half-baked updates.  When you have pure Android, you get the most recent updates faster than anyone else but you also get all of the early adopter issues that go along with it.  In any event, I returned the second Nexus 7 and won't be trying a third.  I was tempted to exchange it for a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Plus, but I understand the Tab 3 is rumored to be just around the corner.  So I'm going to wait it out for now and stick to the big old iPad.  I'm honestly not interested in the Mini at the current price and prefer a small Android tablet.The Nexus 7 is a promising and very capable small tablet.  I personally know several people who own it and have experienced no problems.  Maybe I'm either unlucky or too picky but I don't want to keep rolling the dice and hoping to finally get a unit without issues.  Without the flakiness, I'd probably rate it four stars, with the one star being knocked off for the poorly calibrated display.  However, taking my issues with two separate tablets into account, I rated it as highly as I feel it deserves based on my personal experience.  Depending on the release date for the Nexus 7 second generation, maybe I'll see if I have better luck with that model. That is assuming I don't have a Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 by then.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stay Away", "Author": "badger1", "ReviewID": "R2L9RAV0NBSL7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After four months of use, battery life is abysmal.

Not even a factor in the decision any more.Given that, this tablet does have its advantages over the more expensive Apple counterparts. These include the ability to customize the way it looks (without rooting). This can of course be done on Apple devices via jailbreaking, but I never recommend hacking a device unless you're completely dissatisfied with it. If you want more of an apple themed lock screen, there are some downloadable from the google play store. If want a live wallpaper of swimming koi that you can scare away with the flick of a finger, then you can have it. Overall I think the aesthetics of more recent android versions are better than many iOS features these days.Pros:-Approx. 6 hours battery life on non demanding games-One of the cheapest tablets on the market!-32GB space. I have over 2300 songs on it and there's plenty of space for all the games and videos I want-Great Wi-Fi range. I've seen this one mentioned before and it holds true with my Wi-Fi-Small enough for comfort, large enough for decent viewingCons:-Lower resolution than the full sized iPad. This isn't really an issue that I've found comes up, but there you have it. (still beats the more expensive iPad mini by a fair margin)-Low volume. I've found that a lot of my music isn't as loud as I'd like (probably too loud honestly). This hasn't really been an issue, but something I'm nit picky about because I'm an audiophile sometimes.Well there you have it. If you want to save some cash and get basically every feature you could find on the iPad mini, then get the nexus 7. I do have to make note of the potential upcoming reveal of the \"nexus 2\" though.

I own a Galaxy Nexus knew I wanted the \"pure\" Android experience. I chose the nexus 7 over the NExus 10 because I thought I would use a 7\" tablet more than a larger one. Plus for the price is was a great deal.For those looking at small tablets and are considering an iPad Mini, give the Nexus 7 a try (unless you're already committed to the iOS camp). The Nexus 7 gives up some screen space and the great Apple design/build quality but you save $180 (for the 32GB models). That's is a pretty substantial savings. Go to your local Walmart or Staples and give one a try; you never know!Anyway, I've been using this tablet for a bit and here are my impressions so far:Pros:-Price!-Speedy-7\" size ia a good balance between screen size and portability-Comfortable and easy to hold-Jelly Bean is a great OS, very customizable-Wi-Fi reception seems better than most smartphones I've used-The dimpled back cover is a unique design element-Screen is crisp despite the modest specs-Guaranteed to get the latest and greatest OS updatesNeutral:-Speakers are adequate but not great-Build quality is adequate but not great-Screen color/contrast/brightness is average but not great-No rear camera does not bother me-Battery life seems fine but not stellar (lots of variables however)Cons:-No SD card slot-No MHL video out-No notification light (probably to save on costs)This tablet walks the line between price and features/quality very nicely. My only real complaint (and this isn't just Google) is the lack of an SD card slot. I know Google just wants us to use their cloud services but I've love to load up all my music and videos for trips. You can always use an OTG cable and a flash drive, but that is much more cumbersome.However, for the price, I can overlook these relatively minor flaws. This is a great product for the price and I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a small tablet.

(And that's a good thing, compared to some of the vender-customized versions.)  I bought it for some development work and for trying out different operating systems.  I think the future of such devices is to have a choice of OS's, just like you can have with a laptop; so the important thing is how hackable is this hardware?  The Nexus 7 happens to be popular for that sort of thing, so you can choose between various versions of Android and other Linux distributions such as Mer with KDE Plasma Active, Ubuntu with Unity, and Bodhi with Enlightenment.  I'm sure more are on the way.  I installed TWRP and the multirom hack to be able to choose the OS at startup (via the touchscreen even).I also like that it feels solid, and I like the rubbery feel of the back.  The display is really beautiful too, and high enough resolution.  Maybe it's not \"retina\" but it still looks better than last-generation tablets, and it doesn't tax the GPU the way a 2k resolution display would.  So considering the Nexus 10 is so hard to find right now, maybe it's OK to wait until the next generation of GPU before getting a retina Android tablet.  The microUSB port has host mode, so you can plug in such things as keyboards, USB sticks and so on via an adapter (not included but cheap to buy).The minor downsides I've found so far:- no microSD slot.  32GB is enough, but it would still be nice if it were expandable.- the desktop dock is hard to find and costs too much- there should be a keyboard which attaches to the tablet and uses the 4 gold-plated contacts rather than using bluetooth, and basically converts this tablet to a laptop.  But nobody has made it yet.  Instead you can buy a bluetooth keyboard which is the same size, props up the tablet when you are using it and and acts like a screen cover when you're not.- there could have been a Wacom tablet with a stylus like the Samsung Galaxy Note series has.  It's too bad only Samsung is doing that so far.  But then again this one costs half as much.  When the 8\" Note comes out, I suspect it will be quite competitive.- the accelerometer shows up under /sys/bus/iio but NOT under /dev/input.  It's still possible to work with that of course, but not treating it as an input device makes it less straightforward.  Of course this is not Google's fault or Asus' fault, just a Linux driver idiosyncrasy that is consistent between Android and all the Linux distros I've tried so far.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wondeful tool", "Author": "Javier C.

The Nook was very restrictive about what I could install and it seemed that they went to great lengths to dumb down what an android tablet could do.That is definitely not the case with the Nexus. I still use it as a reading device, but now it has pretty much become my main computer. I've been building my own computers and writing software since I got my first Atari 400, but now I rarely sit down at my desktop, anymore. In fact, when I do use my desktop I am usually controlling it from my Nexus. There are some tasks, like video editing, that are easier to do from the desktop, but I've become hooked on working from this little monster.I have resisted getting a cell phone again, but I'm able to text for free using Google voice. I'm also impressed with all the text to speech and voice command apps that are built into the new android jelly bean os. I have never used Siri, but it can't be as accurate as Google voice. No, it's not 100%, but darn close.The only criticism I have is with the WiFi version. I understand that you need to install a SD card for the 4G version in order to get access to a network, but why remove the slot from the WiFi version. 32G is a lot of storage, but storage space is something you can never have too much of. I tried to load my music collection onto the Nexus and ran out of space. My workaround is to put it on a big flash drive and connect it with an OTG cable when I want to listen offline. Not a perfect solution, but it works when I need it. I would rather be able to put it on a SD.Bottom line, though, is that I'm extremely impressed and very happy with my Nexus 7.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Tablet at any price.", "Author": "aqcrc51", "ReviewID": "R7BDEJNAMIQ0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 is simply put an amazing tablet.

The main purpose was communication - sending and receiving emails, making phone and Skype calls, browsing the internet, Google drive, and connecting to various financial and non-financial services.  All of these functions can easily be performed on a smart phone, but I wanted a bigger screen.  My first disappointment was that many  service apps do not work on N7 so I could not even download them.  As far as calls are concerned, the only application that to my knowledge allows making phone calls from N7 (as opposed to redirecting calls to an external phone which is pointless) is Talkatone and it crashes regularly, about every time I try to use it.  Skype seems to be working OK, but does not seem to support Bluetooth connection.  The touch screen keyboard is a step down from previous versions of Android or Ipad, as it does not have a \"pop-up\" display of letters being touched, it merely highlights them which is difficult to read.  The speaker sound quality is rather mediocre comparing to Ipad. Another annoying feature is that the synchronization function indiscriminately imports every email, phone number, or spam sent to my Gmail or Skype accounts, so my address book is littered with hundreds of totally useless entries or multiple entries for the same contact.The \"upgrade\" to Android 4.2.1 that Google pushed was a disaster - the device became more sluggish in response and crashing from time to time, and Bluetooth stopped working properly - a problem reported by many users.  Google technical support is a bad joke, a complete waste of time as all they send you is surveys how they are doing.  They are doing terribly.So to sum it up, the functionality of N7 is lower than that of my smart phone that I bought some 3 years ago for half the price.  The only functions that work seamlessly on N7 are email, net browser, and Google drive, everything else is at best so-so or outright bad.  Bluetooth does NOT work at all, so this device is useless to anyone who plans to use this function extensively.  It is not a big deal to me, I can use a corded headset, but it is disappointing.  I do not own an Ipad but many of my friends do and they seem to be happy with them.  I wish I could say the same about N7, but unfortunately it gives me mostly frustration and so-so service.

Google play messed up replacement, refused to send another device and refused to give my money back. Credit Card company had to intervene to rescue my money.

Sold it again.None of my devices were manhandled or dropped.

Some is expected, but it has been worse than I hoped for from a Nexus device. If these were the only problems I\u2019d probably give 3.5 stars.HOWEVER, (this is going to be a ridiculously long story skip to the summary at the end if you want)maybe 5 months after I got it, the OS wouldn't boot. Just the X showing forever, restarting the bootloader didn't help. After calling and chatting, Asus agreed to take it back. They sent the RMA form, but no shipping label. Then I had to convince them to pay for shipping, and they caved reluctantly, said they would 'make an exception'.It takes them a month to turn it around. The confirmed that all they had to do was reinstall the OS, no hardware work, and it took a month. Fine. Whatever, it was working again.2 months later the OS stops working a different way. It keeps throwing up Android System errors more and more often, so I try a factory reset (standard fix) but it won't even get through the device setup because the system errors keep popping up and preventing it. So then I go through the same process as the first time - call, chat, RMA, chat again to get them to pay for shipping (this is Feb 10th) I send it back (note: perfect physical condition, just OS problems).After a couple of days I get the confirmation from FedEx that it has arrived at Asus in Texas. 5 days go by, I hear nothing and the RMA status online still says 'waiting' or something. I chat online, the guy says he'll flag it as urgent (which they already said they would before I sent it since it was the 2nd time it broke and I\u2019ve already been without it for a month). Next day I get an email saying it's being shipped back unrepaired because it was received broken. They don't call me or email me to find out if I sent it that way or if it was broken during shipping.I get it back a couple days later and there are multiple cracks covering the whole screen. Maybe it broke during shipping, maybe the tech dropped it on the floor and let it sit there for 4 daysI call Asus and chat with them, and they tell me there\u2019s nothing they can do because they received it broken. I already know that FedEx isn\u2019t going to talk to me about it because I wasn\u2019t \u2018the shipper\u2019.So then I file a complaint on Asus\u2019 website (3/22). This is when I start documenting all of the ridiculousness.On 4/1 I started a chat since I had gotten no response, in the complaint system it still just said that it was \u201cIn progress\u201d, like it had for the last 10 days since I filed it. They tell me that their system is down and they can\u2019t look up anything.Mind you, Asus has set up their systems so you can\u2019t contact anyone directly, so every time I contact them I have to tell them the whole story or tell them to go look up my file then wait 5 minutes (ignoring the initial message it sends at the beginning: \u201cHello Andrew Stevens, thank you for contacting ASUS support. Please give me a few moments to review your information. I will be with you shortly.\u201d and I wait 5 minutes and they know nothing about my case).So I suggest that they contact me when their system is back up. He says that\u2019s a great idea. Guess what, they don\u2019t. I chat the next day, 4/2, their system is back up.They train these people to be closers. Not customer service. They say whatever they need to get out of the current chat session and on to the next one.In this chat session then on 4/3, 4/4, they tell me they\u2019ll escalate the case, they\u2019ll have their supervisor call me and they\u2019re very sorry but Asus doesn\u2019t do replacements and there\u2019s nothing they can do. I don\u2019t get any calls, no help at all. They also tell me I should file a claim with FedEx. I tell them I already did (repeatedly) but FedEx told me (as I expected) that they would have to deal with Asus for the case since they were the shipper. The Asus rep finally tells me that the shipping claim will be handled by \u2018someone at corporate\u2019 and he can\u2019t give me a phone number, can\u2019t check on the status for me, and can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going to happen.Also on 4/4 they finally respond to my original complaint:\u201cI apologize for the issues you are facing. As Nigel had explained we had received thetablet with physical damage that was not reported to us in the inital contact whenrequesting an rma for your tablet therefore we had returned the tablet unrepaired toyou.\u201dand that\u2019s all\u2026.no help at allFinally on 4/7 they call me (outside of the hours that I told them I\u2019d be available, with no call back number) and tell me (once again) they can\u2019t do replacements so I should send it back in and they\u2019ll request to replace it. They don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ll email me the RMA form or a shipping label, they just leave it at \u2018send it back in\u2019.So I chat again on 4/8, I didn\u2019t have to convince them to give me a label this time, but I did have to ask for it.I send it in, they receive it on 4/15.I get a call on 4/22 saying the motherboard and screen have been replaced, and they want me to pay for return shipping. So I don\u2019t care at this point, I\u2019ll pay the $7 or whatever.It\u2019s now 4/25 and they still haven\u2019t sent me the form to provide my payment information for shipping. So who knows when I\u2019ll get it back and if it\u2019ll actually work then.SUMMARY:DON\u2019T BUY ANYTHING FROM ASUS", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Lawrence J.

I actually found this tablet much cheaper than here on sale for $149.00 from that grouping website if you know what I mean.  For that price, I couldn't resist getting this.  Yes I know it is last years model versus the 2013 version but since I am getting this for mom who won't stress this tablet out with any kind of high end applications or music or things that like, for the different in price from the 1 year old version and the new, it was worth it to me in savings.  Since I wanted to check this tablet out and get is setup before giving this as a gift to make it easier for her, I opened it and got things set up.  Initial setup was pretty easy and basic, with choosing the language and email and your Wi-Fi, pretty simple stuff for anyone with basic computer skills.  The most time consuming was the system updates, with the tablet coming with version 4.1 on board but having to be updated three times individually to get the latest android operating system that is currently available (Jelly Bean) I believe.  Not sure why you couldn't just update to the latest version without having to update incrementally.  That would have frustrated someone like my mom who wouldn't have had any idea how to do that.  but never the less once that is complete, the use of the tablet seems very simple and straightforward like most android style tablets.  For those like me, who are not necessarily looking for the latest and greatest to give as a gift, I will compare the new nexus (2013) versus this model (2012) version so you can decide for yourself whether the extra expense is worth getting versus this model.This Nexus 7 had a three-piece layered design, boasting a textured backplate, grey plastic middle and Gorilla Glass front, the 2013 model has a single-piece smooth chassis that wraps around its glass front which for some may make you feel that the 2013 feels a bit more high end.  The 2013 Nexus is a bit slimmer and weighs a bit less than this version although in my opinion, not significantly so.When it comes to software the 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7s are all but identical, with upgrades to the latest 4.3 Jelly Bean version of Android available for both.  Now whether the 2012 version will continue to receive updates that remains to be seen, of course you could also say that next year with the 2013 version.  Like all electronics these days, no matter what version you get, you are almost always out of the loop within a couple years.  But for now, to get the same operating system for a cheaper price, this is the better deal.This Nexus 7  1280x800 HD, 216ppi display is decent but the 2013 Nexus 7, has a 7in 1920x1200 1080p HD 323ppi display which definitely means the new version has a brighter crisper display versus the 2012 nexus.  A definite advantage to the new Nexus but you do pay for that in cost.The 2012 Nexus 7 is fairly powerful, with a quad-core Tegra 3 processor and with this model having 32 gb of storage space.The new 2013 Nexus 7 has a quad-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor.  Although the new version is a bit speedier, for someone like my mom, who will do basic internet surfing and not be playing any heavy duty games, there will be little difference in performance and both tablets will do well.  If you are getting this for a gamer, then the 2013 version would do better for that.The 2012 Nexus 7 only has a 1.2MP front camera designed purely for video calling versus the 2013 Nexus 7 that has a 5MP rear and 1.2MP front camera.  Considering I have a hard time getting my mom to use the digital camera I bought her a couple years ago, the camera difference is not of great importance to me.  I personally would prefer a regular quality digital camera over using a tablet or phone anyways for that purpose.The  2013 Nexus 7 has a smaller battery at 3950mAh versus the 2012 Nexus 7  with a 4325mAh battery.  Granted the power management is better on the 2013 Nexus 7 model but  the 2012 model does a decent job at lasting an adequate amount of time.This  2012 Nexus 7 comes with 32GB version and you can get an comparable 2013 model with a similar amount of space but aside from the difference price per gigabyte is a better deal with the 2012 version.Granted the 2013 version is an improvement overall from this 2012 version but this 2012 tablet is a good tablet overall and should serve the purpose for what I am getting it for, which is a senior who has little internet and computer experience.  If you find the deal, like I did at 149 then this is worth getting for someone like my mom as they don't need the latest and greatest.  My biggest challenge with this tablet is not the specs but is teaching my mom how to use it and getting her to use it so that she doesn't get frustrated and make it a coaster for her coffee.

And you can tweet and find the closest Starbuck's or Costa's on it to boot, though given the form factor you will of course have to hunt and peck. Its major limitation is the rather scanty 32GB of internal storage, not much even by media player standards (more on that below).If, on the other hand, you have actual work to do, and want to use this device as a tablet computer, you'll probably be unhappy with it. The really big problems are the 32GB internal storage, lack of an SD card slot and the exclusive use of the MTP/PTP protocols for USB access to that internal storage, with consequently severe constraints on the ability to synchronize your own files to/from this tablet to any other machine. The first two might have been bearable (which was my calculation when buying the device), but the third (discovered only after my purchase) turns these limitations into a handicap. There are partial solutions to the problem (e.g. Nexus Media Importer, Dropbox, Stickmount, Samba, MTP mounting and a few MTP synch utilities, etc.), but many of them are tediously interactive (i.e. resistant to programming/scripting), none of them are completely satisfactory, and the less inadequate ones will all require rooting the device.I'm using Samba & Stickmount and thanks to FunkyFresh and Chainfire can probably live with it for a while, but I must say my encounter with the Asus/Google Nexus 7 has started me wondering about getting an actual tablet computer like Microsoft Surface or some other device that has been designed to support more than personal entertainment.

On top of that, I rarely even try to get it to work anymore, which is disappointing given that it's been only two months since I bought the first one and it clearly has potential.As a note about all Nexus 7s (not just mine), Bluetooth is a little messed up. Things it should pair with it won't. For me specifically, that's my Bluetooth speaker, which I would be very annoyed about if not for the stuff that follows. I know the tablet is cheap, but this is just not right.The first one I got essentially gave me the middle finger whenever i tried to use the internet, whether that was browse in Chrome or stream through Hulu. Given that I bought this device to essentially be my TV (Hulu Plus and NHL Gamecenter, primarily), this was a significant problem. It simply refused to connect to one of my routers and while it would connect to the other, that's as far as it ever got. Note that I have an Android phone and two laptops, none of which have a problem with either router.I bought a second unit to make sure it wasn't just me. Turns out it wasn't. The second unit worked as I expected it to work, connected to the internet, browsed, streamed, everything. I returned the first one and then the day after the return period for the second one, the second one stopped booting. I eventually got to the \"dead Android man\" and internet research told me this could only be fixed by sending the unit to ASUS. This was a relatively easy process (though not free, which annoyed me) and ASUS did exactly what I expected them to do, return a different unit to me (confirmed by serial number). I'll give them credit for being fairly quick and not giving me much hassle when I first contacted them, though I told the rep straight out what I had done, how it hadn't worked, and how the internet said it needed warranty service.It's been a month and I now have a third unit. This one is back to the Wi-Fi issue I had with the first one. I'm planning some more tests to see what I can do because I really want this to work. Like I said, I have an Android phone and this is a nice size for a portable TV (or TV replacement, in my case). I have a stand-case that will prop it up on my desk. I did actually get the third one to get online for about an hour before I took a plane trip and was able to rent and download the 7th Harry Potter and watch it on the plane. That was very cool and confirmed that I wasn't crazy to try this. Too bad I can't do it again.EDIT (05/09/2013): I did go back and try to make it work. For whatever reason, I didn't have to do anything. The only persistent issue I have now is that sometimes I need to actually stop apps that stream content, put the device to sleep, and wait 30 seconds or so. After that, I can turn it back on and stream content again. It's a little annoying, but it at least works. I do use it regularly and am finally at least happy I spent the money on it.

The screen looks great.  Sound isn't bad at all.But there are things I don't like.  One problem is that you can't log out of gmail.  This is probably the most noticeable problem with using a smartphone OS for a tablet.  You don't share your phone, but a tablet is something that not every member of a household might have.  It's a perfect thing to leave on a coffee table that anyone can pick up.  While I'm happy to have other people use my tablet to surf the web or check their email, I don't want them having access to my email account or the ability to download apps without a password.  It's an example of Google not seeming to understand why anyone would care about privacy.  There are paid apps that will put a password on other apps, but they all seem to be laughably easy to get around, even accidentally.  Even if they worked well though, this is a problem that shouldn't need an app to solve.The other thing I hate is the battery life, especially on standby.  It seems like this thing always needs to be charged.  I tested it recently: I fully charged it and then left it on standby without touching again.  It was dead in less than 48 hrs.Another problem with the battery is that you can't easily close programs. You have to go through an indirect force closing process.  If I'm going to be on a long trip, I'd like to be able to squeeze every minute out of my battery, but the Nexus makes it hard to do that.Final annoyance: the home button isn't a physical button but a virtual one that's always on.  It's really easy to accidentally brush that button while playing a game.  That gets annoying.I don't hate the Nexus 7.

Well, the 7\u2033 size is perfect where it isn't too small or too big. I don't like 10\u2033 tablets because they just feel big and clunky. You are probably wondering what's under the hood, why not an iPad Mini, and is the screen nice?The Nexus 7 is powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipset which is one of the most powerful on the market. Directly competing with Apple's A5x chipset in their iPad 3, the Nexus 7 is extremely powerful for a 7\u2033 tablet. This tablet has a whopping 16 cores, a quad-core 1.3Ghz CPU and a 12 core Geforce ULP GPU. The tablet CPU has a fifth core that is dedicated to running in a power saving mode during times of low processing needs. That is one powerful tablet. The Tegra 3 chipset allows for some of the most advanced graphics seen on a tablet as well. Games like Dead Trigger, Dark Meadow, Zombie Driver, and a few others optimize their games for the Tegra chipset adding extra effects and higher FPS. The tablet has 1GB of DDR3L RAM rather than DDR2 RAM which is in both the iPad 3 and Mini and it twice as fast. The Tegra 3 chipset is even more powerful than the iPad Mini and iPad 3 with the Mini having a single core 1Ghz CPU and the iPad 3 having just a dual-core 1Ghz CPU. Even the ULP graphics chip is more powerful than the iPad 3\u2032s with 416Mhz. If that doesn't impress you...I don't know what will.Asus just stopped producing the 16GB models so only the 32 are available now, but that's fine. 16GB really isn't enough space anyways, but there is no expandable storage options. You can use an OTG cable and a USB stick, but most people won't know to do that. 32GB is plenty for games, movies, music, and books. I have over 30 games on my tablet and still have plenty of room. I found the battery life is pretty decent for a such a powerful device. Running high graphic games you get about 3 hours and everything else will last you most of the day, but that's with Wifi on. With it off it is probably 30% less power consuming.The screen is gorgeous. Being better than the iPad Mini with a 1280\u00d7800 resolution rather than 1024\u00d7768. It also has double the ppi at 216 rather than 163 for the Mini. It also is 16:10 aspect ratio rather than the Mini's 4:3 aspect ratio so it is a widescreen tablet. The text is crisp and and images are sharp and vibrant. You won't be disappointed watching high definition movies or games. I also found the screen to feel very nice to touch and my finger would just glide across. The tablet is also fitted with scratch proof Corning fitted glass, also known as Gorilla Glass to some. The glass is alkali-aluminosilicate sheet glass which is the best out there right now. On the back the device has a bumpy, leathery texture which makes holding the device easier. I love this texture and feels so much nicer than the hard plastic of other tablets with their sharp edges. You also don't have to worry about setting it down and scratching it up. The whole device just looks so sleek and smooth.The tablet comes stock with android Jelly Bean 4.1, but as of a week ago the new 4.2.2 update is out. Nothing else to expect software wise other than a great Google Android OS experience. However, if you're a gamer check out Nvidia's TegraZone app to get started on what games were specifically designed for the Tegra chipset. My only complaint is that there is no rear-facing camera. Just a front facing 1.2MP camera for video chatting. However, most people don't use their tablets for taking pictures (unless you are one of those iPad people)Overall, the Nexus 7 is one of the most powerful tablets on the market, and the most powerful 7\u2033 tablet you can get your hands on. With the 12-core chipset, bright vivid screen, and sleek design, any hardware fan will want this tablet. For the low price of $250 for 32GB of storage...nothing beats it! Once you pick this up you will realize why it was chosen as 2012\u2032s best tablet.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really nice tablet", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R57INWQ4EEODF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really nice tablet, Works really well for seeing videos, readings papers/news and playing games.

I did a fair amount of research on tablets before ordering this Asus/Nexus 7.  For me, when buying a smartphone or tablet/computer type item, it comes down to just a few basic features: battery life; screen resolution; size; overall memory (internal/external GB) & RAM & GH speed with core type; the operating system; price; and the company reputation.  Considering these main features, it was between the Kindle Fire HD & this Nexus 7 2012.  They are so much better than Apple or Samsung.Anyway, I chose the Google Nexus 7 because the price was right, the reputation & reviews good, & I have Android Smartphones & love them, so there is no getting used to a different operating system.  And, you get a really good deal on this older model, which comes with Jelly Bean 4.1.  The 1st night I had it, it upgraded to Jelly Bean 4.3, which is great...then the next day it upgraded again to the new current Android Kit Kat 4.4.  My \"old model\" is now brand new.

Without Prime, the KFHD loses its place in the pantheon of pads.  It is not as versatile as a true Android pad.  I do miss the excellent audio of the KFHD and I believe it was a bit more responsive to the multi-touch.Yet, the Nexus 7 rocks!  With a less restrictive environment for the user, the capabilities and choices open up immensely.  I have had a blast with the Nexus 7.  It has been a smooth transition from the KFHD and I like it much more.  So with the 7 you can get the Amazon apps for reading, ordering etc.  Plus, you get the Google Play store and better integration of the Google family of apps.  It was a great decision and I recommend anyone wanting to jump on the special deals (145-160) on the 32gig Nexus 7 to do so.

It's really the perfect little tablet for media consumption. The screen is also a great size for games, it handled Angry Birds, Candy Crush and the other addictive games in the last year and a half without a problem.More recently I'd been using it as a kitchen clock and web browser to look up recipes and letting it sit on the Nexus 7 dock when not in use. This is when I started noticing that it would restart every so often, about a month of this and now it comes up with a screen asking for a password to decrypt the tablet. After searching the problem Google help told me this was a common problem and that Android couldn't read the SSD and thus assumes that encryption is turned on and asks for the password. Sometimes restarting it again brings it back to normal, other times not. It got worse and worse though to the point that now it restarts every 30 seconds loading the home screen and having several apps crash. I did a fresh restore back to stock Android, deleting all my information, as Google suggested. This seemed to work for all of about an hour. Now it's back to restarting non-stop. At this point I've had the tablet for 16 months. The original warranty was 12 months and the problems starting creeping up around 14 months. I was planning on getting more Nexus 7 tablets and even have a larger ASUS android tablet and 10\" ASUS Windows 8 tablet but after this I'm not buying another ASUS product again.

I was so frustrated by our crappy local radio stations and again, I am too poor to afford iPods etc. This is so great. The 7 inches factor makes it truly portable - in my purse!I love this machine. It has changed our lives. My husband can sit right next to me while I am sewing or reading and he is watching rap music videos, or police car chases - his other favorite. That kind of noisy video sound in the house puts me on edge. It makes him so happy, I like to watch him watching his favorite videos.The machine is sleek and light.

In most respects, I believe it is an amazing alternative to the over-priced iPad mini, but not everything is perfect.First, and foremost, I am not happy with Google's involvement in assisting with government tracking of internet usage. This, in and of itself, is a huge reason why I hesitate with anything that bears the Google brand. Now, for some out there you're okay with this, and that is fine, but the issues with the Nexus 7 are a bit more than just political affiliation.This brings me to my second problem. When we think tablets and pictures, we get all giddy with excitement over the concept of being able to take pictures and not need the phone or a standalone camera. However, the Nexus 7 (this has been corrected with the newer Nexus 7) only has a camera on the side of the screen. Yep, every front-facing picture you take will be taken blind without a view of what you are taking a picture of. To top it off, the system doesn't even come with software to run the camera. I have never understood why they would do that. But, it isn't a sticking point, you can go online and get some free software from the Google Play Store and it is taken care of.Really, I would recommend the Nexus to someone who likes wi-fi web surfing and playing games on the tablet and that is about it.

The Tegra 3 processor works very well for games, unlike my other tablets it does not lag whatsoever even in the most graphic intense games. The graphic quality is amazing and much better than most others.  My Note 2 processor may be a bit faster but in games the quality and optimizations are superior due to it having NVIDIA in the mix, NVIDIA has the best hardware\\software combo.The body is great! It's a lot lighter than any other I've used which is really important when you're holding it for hours reading, etc...Taking pictures with a tablet is a bit foolish however, the front camera is perfect for Skype and such. The back is made of a tough material which can withstand a lot of punishment, it won't be damaged or scratched. You won't have to put up with ugly scratches which are usually apparent on tablets made just to look nice.I've put it down without a case on many different surfaces and there isn't a scratch on it.The seller I received mine from gave me one that looked brand new.The Pros:-Very light and thin-Bare tablet that's just a tablet without unnecessary add ons which barely work and just creates bulk.-Materials are tough and allows you to just drop it anywhere without worrying.-Hardware is great, gives the performance you want and the battery life you can only dream of. With the passive 5th core, it consumes very little power while still running all your background apps.-Very cost efficient for what it is, affordable new technology.-From Google, full access to all software-Very easy to hold and fun for playing games/watching movies.-Can be easily rooted which is one of the most important features.-Future proof with the ability to sync with smart tvs allowing you to display your screen on a tv.Cons:-No microsd slot, however with an Otg cable you have an USB slot available for flash drives and game controllers to be used.-Extra unused space could've been used to make the screen bigger or the unit smaller.-Speakers are in the back which defeat the purpose, also not very loud.-Wifi doesn't have the best range I've seen but definitely not bad either.-Requires extra hardware just to add some much needed memory and port.Overall for a tablet it has just the right amount of space for apps, books and a couple games. Light weight and easy to hold, let's you have it in your hands all day. You won't want to put it down. It's a simple tablet that's just a tablet, perfect for doing what you need to do with a tablet.

The thing really works well on the plane, stays discrete.For performance - hardly any hiccups, I've had a few glitches and reboots required, but no more than my others.Maybe my favorite thing is the swipe to type - it work's very well.  I can go about as fast as I want and it usually picks the right word, and it has changed my idea of the tablet handicap for composing text.The most functional, value added part of this gem is the built in true GPS.  I'll confirm that it works just fine, with no wifi.  I took it across the US and across the UK and found the GPS never had an issue getting a signal.

The screen is bright, clear, and sharp; sensitivity is top notch; and although the speakers are small they crank out enough audio that you can watch movies and hear what the actors say. The Nexus has a big beefy CPU and as such can play most Android games and play movies with nary a stutter. And it runs the latest flavor of Android, making top of the line web browsing and all the newest features of the OS available to you. Compared to where the 200-ish tablet market was a couple years ago, the Nexus is a huge leap forward and can compete favorably with other, far more expensive tablets.The bad: Asus had to trim a lot of fat to make such a good tablet so cheap. There is no HDMI out for watching movies on your TV, there is no rear camera and the front camera is only really suitable for video chat, and there is no micro-SD slot, so you must make do with on-board storage or network storage of some kind. None of these are dealbreakers, but it is disappointing that these features, which are available on many cheaper tablets, are absent here. That said, I don't use these features, I didn't miss them, and the Nexus is great otherwise.There are two extra features the Nexus DOES have that bear mention: it has pogo pins so you can sit it in a charging dock for fast charging with no plugin, and it has a magnetic switch that puts it to sleep when you close a magnetic case (sold separately by assorted makers).Overall, the Nexus is a top-tier tablet offering an unparallelled Android experience, but you will need to go further up market for higher grade features. If you don't need them then this is your best bet bar none.UPDATESeveral months down the line we are continuing to love the Nexus. It has great audio for watching a show on the couch with our older son, the screen looks great, and it starts cleanly and quickly. I can't speak to battery life because we use it very heavily- it is now an alarm clock in addition to its other duties as a television, facebook portal, and gaming handheld- and it is almost always on. One thing I have noticed- and this is true for ALL Android devices- is that if you have a lot of apps that run while the tablet is asleep it charges very slowly. The real test of charge speed is with the tablet totally off, in which case it charges very quickly. It also installs system updates very quickly, as we recently found out.Still totally pleased as punch with this purchase.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it", "Author": "jayashankar", "ReviewID": "R19OZJO51T1XCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you to the seller for a quick delivery.Took some time to verify the device and its working awesome.Loving it and slowly migrating from PC to Tablet for daily use.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "Yam", "ReviewID": "R1QYL29X8TUS36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "amazing android tablet that works smoothly with a great screen and performanceand of course for a very good price", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like a Mini Laptop", "Author": "Iris E.

No restriction on movie formats it can play, so no need to convert movie files.4. I can connect my flash drive or external drive to it. For this, you need an OTG cable and an app like Nexus Media Importer.Screen resolution is quite good, though not as sharp as the iPhone's or iPad's. However, the processor must be superior to the iPhone's or iPad's because downloads are much faster. I've downloaded magazines I subscribe to on these devices and the Nexus completes this twice as fast.Battery life is about 9 hours of regular use, about half if playing games or watching movies. For the rather cheap price, quality is very good. Build is nice and solid with a dimpled plastic back. There's no rear camera, just a 1.2MP front facing one, but I'm fine with that as I always find it silly when I see people using tablets to take photos anyway. You can geotag photos by downloading an app like GeoTag Android's buddy which is free.

It's fast, sleek, and powerful. The myriad of apps available on the android market and the smoothness of this tablet makes me want to take it everywhere! With a MoKo Slim-fit Case for Google Nexus 7, it looks kind of like a small Bible which I'm used to carrying around anyway. With the Bible app, I don't even have to bring my leather Bible anywhere.I love sitting down, reading, browsing, listening to music, and playing games with it. I have notebook apps for school, planners, calendars, and more. I considered buying an Ipad mini because I don't want to carry large devices (might as well carry a laptop), but when I looked at comparison videos I saw that the Ipad mini couldn't really be carried with one hand like this baby can. This feels really great in the hand and once again, it looks great! It looks like I'm carrying around a small book and can even fit in big jeans pockets or pretty much any jacket pocket. For ladies, it easily fits into any size purse. It also beats the Ipad mini in price by about $100. It even beats the price of most smart phones! I haven't tried it yet, but I heard you can even use it as a phone, albeit a big phone. The stereo quality isn't very good compared to the speakers I have hooked up to my laptop (Insignia NS-PLTPSP2 2 Piece Speaker System), but that's to be expected.Pretty much my only complaint of this device is the lack of a back facing camera. That means, if I want to take a picture of something I have to turn it around and look at it from the side... which is kind of awkward. Still, most people have smart phones or actual cameras for pictures so it wasn't really a deal breaker for me.Anyway, this is a great product and I am one satisfied customer!", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "My go to tablet now", "Author": "F.

All of my apps are at the fingertips. The resolution is outstanding in watching Netflix movies in HD quality. Viewing photos are equally a very good quality. I leave most of my music in the Cloud for listening and keeping my HDD freed up for more apps. The sound quality is equally impressive. The HDD is 32 GB, which is plenty big enough unless you are planning to store large quantities of music or videos. If so, invest in Cloud Storage. If you're looking for something with 4g service, this is not for you. For a simpler Wi-Fi connection and 3.0 Bluetooth, this is outstanding. I own an Asus laptop that I have been using for nearly 7 years without a glitch. The product name spoke for itself to me.Overall, I love this tablet. I am sure there are others who may disagree. After reviewing other reputable tablets, I kept returning to this one. Many boast of a 16 GB of HDD space at or around this price.

First the size is great, if you're worried about 7\" being too small, it's not; for media consumption it's perfect; for reading in bed, perfect.  Even for use at work taking notes using a blue tooth keyboard it's perfect.  Mine runs well and is super fast.  The screen is fantastic and it's a good looking quality tablet.For personal use and media consumption I think it's about the perfect tablet out of all that are on the market right now; even watching a movie on it is fantastic.  Use Google Media Importer app and a Micro USB OTG cable and you can connect a thumb drive or even a wireless mouse so there's almost no data limit anymore.  It's simply a fantastic devise all the way around.  I'd highly recomend the Bamboo Solo Stylus and the MoKo slim case; those two accessories are absolutely perfect for this unit.The only thing I've noticed about this unit is that it's very slow to charge, even using a wall outlet and when I run Netflix on it, it's not perfectly smooth 100% of the time like it is on my Ipod Touch.  Every once in a while it'll skip for a fraction of a second; I'm talking once, maybe twice in a 1/2 hour.  Also, it may \"buffer\" a bit more often than I noticed on an Ipad Touch or Ipad.I think this is the perfect \"one tablet to do all\" devise, however, if I was getting a tablet that was mostly for business/work, I'd still get the larger Ipad and match it to a keyboard / case from Clamcase.The other advantage about the Nexus 7 is the cost; it's SO much cheaper than the Ipad!!Gideon", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "buen producto", "Author": "Alejandro Blanco", "ReviewID": "RSEVXNV3O1YCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "producto recomendado, en el poco tiempo  que he disfrutado de el me parece que tiene buena resoluci\u00f3n es f\u00e1cil de manejar y velocidad adecuada para revisar los archivos.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android tablet", "Author": "Rogue Elf", "ReviewID": "R3RCQR6KEXV18D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was the Kindle Fire (1st Gen).

It's a \"nice to have\".  Again, everyone will have a different opinion on this.This is my first tablet.  My primary usage scenario is to have this device in my room (hotel or home) for quick checks of e-mail, news, etc. in a format that is more convenient in terms of screen real-estate than my phone.  Plus, good for taking to meetings and out-of-office activities where I am carrying a bag anyway (phone is all I take when it's just what i can carry in my pockets) and a full laptop is overkill and/or not appropriate for the style of meeting/event.I have this set up as an (expensive) digital alarm clock when I'm not using it, and I can quickly grab it when I need to.  Used it on a flight to see a movie, do some light reading on it, and mostly use it for short e-mail/browsing sessions.  Also convenient to have it for maps.I'm a Google user so it was natural to use Android with its strong connectivity to my Google account and settings.  I use iTunes for music, but this is not primarily an entertainment device for me (I have a nano iPad for my portable music for workouts) so that was not a factor.I think the price/feature trade-offs on this device are excellent. Not paying iPad premiums, but getting all the functionality I need.  Have yet to find something I want to do that doesn't have a free Google Play application/widget ready.  Wifi is great (I have a myfi for mobility if I need it) and so far, this is definitely fitting the bill for me.I'm not \"religious\" about this - I'm sure there are many good alternatives including some with features I would benefit from.  But so far, this is exactly what I thought it would be - even finding myself using a bit more than I thought I would... we'll see if that lasts once the \"new toy\" energy wears off....In terms of this specific device, my only negatives are:* I find the buttons (volume and power) to be not ideal to press, especially now that I have the device sitting inside a protective case that I bought.  The buttons are accessible, but I have to \"work\" to press them.* Would be good to have a camera on the back so I could use it to take pictures and not just for video-conferencing.Other than that, no issues so far... very happy with it.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Kyle B. Kennedy \"D-OveRMinD\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q1FDKZ6TZ403", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my iPad 2, because we are just so invested in Android.  My wife has a Galaxy Note 10, my 5 year old daughter has a Galaxy Tab 7, I have a Galaxy Nexus phone, and my wife has a Galaxy SIII phone.  We have a Macbook Pro and an iPad2 as well.  I liked the smaller size of the Tab 7, especially when sitting in the airport or on the plan or in bed, and I like the \"pure\" google experience without the Samsung, HTC, etc overlays and skins.  Plus the Nexus line gets updates before anyone else.  And finally, this uses a STANDARD micro USB port instead of the proprietary connectors like Apple and, yes, Samsung use.When I took it out of the box, it immediately downloaded and installed Jelly Bean 4.2.2...yes, 4.2.2.As far as performance, I really expected a tiny bit more out of the Tegra 3 on games.  Normal stuff like Pulse, Freely, Chrome, Touchdown, etc all run super fast, all at the same time.  But games like My Little Pony, when there are tons of items on the screen, tends to hitch a bit.  Not enough to kill gameplay, but it's noticeable.As for accessories, I HIGHLY recommend the desktop dock and the car holder, both of which I bought from Amazon and are perfectly built for the Nexus.  The desktop dock is a custom snug fit, while the car adapter is slightly more generic, will fit the Nexus perfectly, but won't fit items like the Tab 7.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NP7R7Shttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8ST36", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good or better than expected.", "Author": "Mark Twain afficionado", "ReviewID": "R294SBVB6OD3S8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nexus 7 I received 5 days ago meets or exceeds my expectations.  The screen is sharp, bright and clear, providing excellent images, videos, and text.  I was especially pleased by the clarity of the text, as my principal use for the tablet is reading e-mail and news articles.  The touch screen is sensitive and responsive.I experimented with the GPS function on a trip over a known route, and it was quite accurate, once I had figured out that activating it involved settings in two different locations.  I have not used the tablet for a long enough period to fully evaluate the duration of the battery charge.One factor in my choice of the Nexus 7 was that it uses the pure Android OS, and it is not tied to a particular eco-system, such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble.  Although it ships with the Google Store installed, I easily added the Amazon Store to my apps, and also installed the Kindle reader app.I was concerned about memory limitations, since there is no slot for an SD card, but I read about the use of a USB OTG cable, and ordered one when I ordered the table.  I have used this to view and load photos from my camera memory card.  The lack of a slot is not a drawback.I would recommend this tablet to anyone with who wants a small, light, easily portable tablet for browsing the web, reading news articles, and e-mail.

In terms of what you get for bang for buck there is nothing that even comes close. Here is a brief breakdown of the device:Screen: The screen is very clear and sharp. It is set extremely close to the glass (closer than the iPad screen), I personally have a preference for this as it gives the screen the feelings of looking at printed material. The 215dpi means the screen is one of the best on the market.The screen is very responsive to touch, and is almost frictionless.  The downside is the slightly large bezel on the side of the screens, but you will find this on most screens.Battery: I get around 4 hours out of this with intensive use (majority of which is playing graphically intensive games, such as Chaos Rings and Shadowngun). For general web browsing and video watching it will last a good whilst longer. It usually fully charges in under 2hrs, though will take longer if you charge from your PC usb port.Performance: There is nothing negative I can say about this devices performance. It runs every current top-end game without hitch, and can happily multi-task with the game still running. Load up Shadowgun, and then switch to YouTube to watch a video without so much as a pause.Scrolling around the interface is very smooth, though occasionally may pause if you have a load of widgets that need to pull live information from the Internet.Finally: A top end device for an almost budget price, what's not to like?", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It follows me around the house.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2Q51LUCXWAJPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initially, I hated the thought of tablets.

I am not an Apple fanboy by any means (I own 6 high-quality Android tablets/phones and am a mobility administrator for a billion dollar a year company so I touch hundreds of devices), but I prefer the iPad and iOS products both on and off of corporate networks. These are built well, but the Google Play Store is like a free-for-all. At least iTunes screens their apps thoroughly and you don't have to worry about your devices' integrity/security like you do with Android/Google Play.I bought two of these. One for my 9 and one for my 5 year old so they would stop fighting over my iPad. Guess what.......they still fight over the iPad. These tablets are great for them, but without influencing them or saying anything (obviously I'd rather keep them off of my iPad or my Surface RT tablet), they still flock to the iPad. I got these for a good price otherwise I would have purchased the iPad minis for them. I got 2 of these for $520, so I couldn't go wrong. $329 for a low end iPad mini is a little expensive.*** Update ***After less than a year of use, one doesn't allow charging anymore and the other is broken (my son's fault). So now I use the broken one's battery and charge port so that I can keep my 9 year old's tablet running. The charge port on hers is junk and I have only used the provided charger to charge it.

In that time I obviously have come to learn how to work with the OS, and have bought apps I'd like to not lose by switching to some other platform.  I've worked with the Android environment long enough to know what I like and don't like about this tablet.Pros:- Responsive- Good modern specs (good CPU/Ram)- Google keeps it up to date with the latest android versions.- Slim enough to fit in jeans pocket.Cons:- No camera other than front facing.- No HDMI output.- No cordless recharge (like in Nexus 4.)- Battery life could be longer.- Sometimes having it in jeans pocket rubs the power button which turns the screen on in your pocket.After using this since Christmas (it is 2/22/13 now) I can say I don't want to go back to a version of me that didn't have a tablet.  Ever.  I take this thing everywhere and whenever I want internet, I just use FoxFi on my RAZR Maxx.My RAZR Maxx has great battery life, so I'm spoiled.  The tablet has pretty darn good standby time, but the battery will drain noticeably while watching movies or working with the tablet a lot (bigger screen must take more energy.)Accessoris:- I got myself a pair of LG HB-730 Bluetooth stereo headphones.  Watching Netflix in the office has never been better.- I have bought case from Manvex which isn't perfect, but Manvex has great customer support.Conclusion:I think if this thing had a camera and HDMI out it would be an easy 5 stars.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase but I do have a few reservations that I feel are worth noting below.  Just so you all know where I'm coming from, I own the iPhone 4, a MacBook Pro, Mac Pro Tower and a Mac Mini.  I'm pretty well invested into the Apple world and would have gladly gone iPad but I didn't like the high price and the way Apple hijacks all your media to run through iTunes.  Turns out it was not as tricky as I feared it might be to break away from Apple.PROS:GREAT PERFORMANCE - The tablet is fast and responsive when I'm playing games or watching movies or surfing the web. This is a zippy little machine that can hold its own.BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY - very vibrant colors and good contrast.  I've been reading the Steve Jobs bio on here and it's a real treat! Some of the free game apps (such as Temple Run and Fruit Ninja look amazingly vibrant and lush)GOOD APPS - I was concerned about this one because Apple dominates in this field, but my needs are pretty basic: I wanted it to watch/listen/read media and maybe play some games.FORM FACTOR - It's very comfortable to hold/grip although I wish it was a little lighter.FLEXIBILITY - I love being able to plug my Nexus into my mac (any Mac) and open the home directory of the machine using the basic Android File Transfer Program.  No need for iTunes syncing/multiple libraries or being slave to what's available on Kindle - it's a drag and drop operation!PRICE - For the current price of the 32 GB Nexus, you can pick one up, a case and a stand and some apps and still come up well under the lowest price for the iPad Mini.CONSWEAK BATTERY - This is definitely the most disappointing aspect of the tablet.  The performance from the battery is poor even when it's in sleep mode!  If a full charge lasts through a whole day, it's doing well.  Just keep in mind you'll want to carry a separate cable or charger.NO HDMI OUTPUT - As a media guy, I'd love to use this to plug into someone's TV as a video player.  It's pretty lame Google nixed this feature in favor of their \"Nexus\" product (which I'm not going to purchase - it's more than the tablet itself!)NO SD SLOT - I did purchase the OTG cable but it's kind of lame to have to plug in a loose cable to expand your storage.  I'm not too heartbroken about this tho - 32 GB is a lot and as I mentioned, it's easy to move content on/off the machine.WEAK SPEAKERS - They can perform OK in a quiet room at home but out in public or a semi-noisy room and you will need to work out an alternativeOn the whole, it's a lovely little tablet that is a great foray into the 7\" tablet game from Google.

Kindle books? Yup. Go to YouTube and do some research and within 15 minutes you will have a nexus 7 that can stream flash video, play amazon videos, etc. I use this for everything now. Be sure to buy SwiftKey keyboard app and the right cover. I bought a bluetooth keyboard but SwiftKey is so good and Google voice to text is so accurate i don't use it much. anyway, the n7 exceeds my expectations in every way.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "very  good", "Author": "Heitor Temp", "ReviewID": "R1QYQA6W300M4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Google Nexus is a very good tablet.

I had read a lot of reviews on the Nexus 7 and I had a few reservations. The Nexus 7 offered a better processor, a better screen, and a newer version of the Android operating system. However, it did not have the ability to upgrade the storage and it did not have an HDMI port like my Acer had.I looked at lots of alternatives, including the Acer Iconia A110, a Samsung Galaxy, and numerous others. But I kept coming back to the Nexus 7. For the money, I could not get a better tablet. So I went ahead and bought it. And I am very glad that I did.With 32GB of memory, I am finding that it will be quite awhile before storage becomes an issue. And just as I suspected, storage vendors had begun to introduce portable hard drives with wireless capabilities. The argument for not adding memory expansion option to these tablets was that you could (and should) store most of your data in the cloud. So the portable drives with wireless in essence become a portable cloud for your tablet.The screen on this thing is sweet. You can easily use it for reading or watching a movies. The picture is sharp, clear, nicely saturated, and very responsive.One of my favorite Jelly Bean Android features is the ability to create folders. On the desktop of the tablet, drop one app icon onto another and it creates a folder with both apps in it. I use this to keep related apps easy to find and use. For example, I have a folder for my network tools (I am a network geek by trade), a folder for my news apps, one for my social media apps, etc.The sound on this is pretty good, although I have one complaint (and I am not alone in this): the placement of the speakers on the bottom of the unit puts all of the sound on one side when in landscape mode. Since most people will watch movies/videos in the landscape orientation, this is a pain.I also wish they had not put the power button so close to the volume control buttons. I can't tell you how many times that has resulted in me shutting the screen off instead of turning the volume up or down.In spite of these couple of complaints, my Nexus 7 is by far my favorite tech gadget.

The emulators run smooth and there is no lag with the controller. Only problem I have is disconnecting the controller. Every time the controller is paired with the device, the keyboard function mysteriously disables. When I go to turn off the controller the keyboard still won't pop up unless I restart the device. I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the keyboard issue. I think it may be a glitch with the nexus because the lemon did that too in addition to all the other problems it had.Overall the nexus 7 is worth it for the money you pay.

I've also used other tablets by way of friends and clients, such as iPad 2 & 3, Galaxy Tab 2 7.0\" and Galaxy Note. This Nexus 7 is by far the best I've used. While I loved the drawing capabilities of the Note, the resolution is the same as the Nexus 7, so the pixel density isn't as good. Anyway, my Nexus 7 has been fast, responsive and problem-free for the couple of weeks I've owned it. My only issue, albeit minor, was when I first opened the package and noticed that one corner of the backplate had not been completely snapped into place. I gave it a quick pinch and all was well. But it did leave me wondering about quality control at Asus, especially after my horrible experience with the Transformer Prime. Despite that, I continued on and soon began wondering why I hadn't bought one sooner.I'd always thought that 7\" would be too close to my Galaxy Nexus phone's 4\" screen and thought, \"why bother?\" And after using the Transformer Prime, 10\" seemed perfect. But now that I have the Nexus 7 in my hands and using it a LOT, I understand why it is so beloved. Part of the reason it works well is because the most popular 10\" tablets are the same resolution as the Nexus 7 (although that is changing rapidly) and so you are getting the same real estate as a 10\" tablet but without the bulk. I can hold this thing easily in one hand and if I put a case on it, will still be able to hold it the same way.I've ordered a case and waiting for delivery, but not even sure if I'll use it at this point.

I'm biassed towards everything non-Apple and I will happily compare it to an iPad, because people need to know that the extra edge you get on those over-priced Apple products, you don't miss it once you go Android...so therefore what's the real plus of buying into the i-hype?K, enough about Apple: the Nexus I got is a 32GB, seriously could not conceive of getting less storage but now that I know it is expandable using the media importer app, I will be trying that out- on to things I love:1) Capacity (using a small low cost cable) to connect either a keyboard or a mouse or anything that has a usb connection basically...not that I've tried to connect much else than the keyboard or mouse. Anyone who's typed on a tablet knows it's a pain if you want to type a lot of words, so being able to connect a real keyboard is an amazing plus. ASUS why did you not do this with the EEE Pad?2) It's a much more manageable size so portability is great compared to my EEE pad. I can take it almost anywhere without adding too much to my load.3) Has almost everything I had on the ASUS EEE pad, in terms of apps that it came with, and the rest you can DL from the Google Play store, so that's great.4) Long tapping for a paste button seems easy here compared to my EEEpad5) Transfer of files via the usb cable works great, and the files can be read even when the message pops up that they may not be readable. I can watch mp4, avi; read pdfs, txts etc6) The \"Play\" music app works great, possibly better than it seemed to in my EEE pad...but of course it would be great if I could figure out how to import playlists instead of having to re-create them.7) Bluetooth - so I can connect and pair and share among other devices with Bluetooth, also possibly connect a headset, but haven't tried that yet - gold!Dislikes:1) Has no pre-installed library app...i checked and double-checked...some people mention this elsewhere online, but this is one of the first things I looked for because I loved \"MyLibrary\" on my EEEpad and have tried to find it for other tablets but it's apparently exclusive to ASUS - and specifically to the EEE pad, because they neglected to put it on my Nexus and it's not available to download. Why?!! It's an ASUS app, Nexus is an ASUS product!! If not for Aldiko, (the free version) and Moon Books, I don't know what I'd do...see now I have to use two apps to do the job that one app did for me previously on the EEE pad, and that is a major fail, imo!2) When I first got it, it seemed to overdo the backspace button action a bit, whenever I clicked one two many times, I'd end up deleting everything I typed without hope of retrieving it...it doesn't seem to do this much anymore, thankfully, but it was a serious flaw in the beginning.3) As mentioned before - there is no micro sd slot (this to me is a no-no) - what's so difficult about including one of those? It's good that there is an option to expand via the usb import cable, but would have been nicer to have it built into the device.4) How do I connect to my TV...? No visible way I can see...no other output ports. If someone can tell me how this will work...like the hdmi output on the EEE pad, that would be great.5) (Added July 2013) I downloaded the Nexus Media Importer app for $3.99 and tried to use it immediately, but it told me something about my license not being recognised. This lasted the first few times but I eventually got it to work. If you ask me, I think they should make the media importer freely available, and if need be, ASUS should subsidise it, because it is their fault there is no way to import media or expand the memory.Note to ASUS: I am getting into the Samsung tablets now, and I will have no compunction in calling a spade a spade...if the Samsung outperforms Nexus, then it will be my new favorite tablet and that Nexus will be the last ASUS product I purchase.Feb 2014 update:The tablet is really starting to have more \"incidents\" where I have to stick a pin in what I think is a reset \"orifice\" ...really not sure...never looked at the documentation to see if there was a reset thingy...but anyway, the tablet didn't come on for two whole days until I stuck the pin there...so I guess that must be it...It also is running out of memory after 14 months...I tend to download things I like so I can watch on my tablet...so now I have to remove some of my stuff to external media and use the media importer app more often....", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "powerful android tablet", "Author": "Shimon Harel", "ReviewID": "RX7J851W4VCTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Nexus 7, I find it exactly the right size, very comfortable to hold in your hand, it's performance is excellent,very fast response, the screen is great to read from (not like a dedicated reader, but very sharp) it's light weight makes it easy to handle without a table and it's Android, what more do you want?", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet ever", "Author": "HerbstFam \"HerbstFam\"", "ReviewID": "R1S0YKT39KOQNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get it.

We had no technical problems of any sort. Google maps awareness feature is very good, it keeps track of our interest and GPS location and it takes entering only a few characters for perfectly relevant search results to be displayed. Jelly Bean improved voice recognition to a level where we now always talk to the tablet rather than type. Auto updates are terrific, it it nice not to be dependent on the cell phone carrier.This is our second Android tablet. We also bought a Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet a few months before Nexus 7 became available. In this review I will compare the features of these two tablets.The big difference between the two tablets is that Nexus 7 always runs the latest version of the operating system. This is because Google is pushing out regular updates. My Galaxy is still on HoneyComb 3.4. I purchased it through Verizon and they are slow with the OS updates. Why does it matter? (1) Some new features available in Jelly Bean OS are really nice (such as improved voice recognition and Google maps awareness features) (2) Eventually more and more applications will not be compatible with the old OS.Nexus 7 does not have a cellular capability. Galaxy 7.7 has this capability, but we did not purchase a data plan. Instead we use the cell phone as a hot spot if there is no WI FI available. The only time this was an issue was when we traveled internationally without having an International cell plan. Outside US we managed by hovering near venues that had free WI FI.The size of the device was one of the major considerations when we were shopping for both tablets. I wanted to have a tablet that would fit into my purse, so I can have it with me anywhere without carrying another item. My husband wanted a tablet he can stick into his pockets (pants or jacket). 7.7 inches works well in my purse, but does not fit his pants pockets. 7 inch Nexus, however, in its neoprene sleeve is a perfect fit for the pockets. I am attaching a collage of 3 photos. Photo #3 shows Nexus 7 going into a pocket.7 inches is also just the right size to use in the car as GPS. It has a bigger screen that our Garmin so it is easier to see the map. My 7.7\" tablet is a bit too big to use as GPS as it covers a more of the windshield and creates a bit of visibility issue. To navigate we use either Google Maps or Sygic. The reason we use both is that Google Maps requires a WI FI connection and in some rural areas of Vermont and Maine where we often travel there are areas with bad cell coverage. Sygic, however, works from its own maps and does not require a WI FI connection. See photo #1 shows Nexus 7 running Sygic navigation as we drive.The speaker on Nexus 7 is not very good. We notice this particularly when we began using it as GPS as we could barely hear it. However purchasing a blue tooth speaker solved this problem beautifully. The sounds now is loud and clear.Nexus 7 has no Micro-SD slot (by comparison Galaxy 7.7 Tab does have a Micro-SD slot). However, we resolved this issue by attaching a USB flash drive to Nexus by purchasing Nexus Media Importer app (which currently costs $2.99).I like that I am able to purchase apps from different sources such as Google Market place as well as Amazon. If I want to dable in writing my own mobile apps, I can do so using my own PC and free Eclipse platform with free Android development plug-ins (either under Windows or Linux) without any extra investment. If I wanted to develop apps for iPad I would need to buy a Mac, since I don't own one already.Google's Jelly Bean really improved voice recognition for searches. Under Honey Comb and ICS the search results sometimes were hilarious, especially if tried searching on foreign names, but update Jelly Bean made a significant improvements in voice recognition and now my husband only talk to his tablet. It gets it right 99% of the time on the first try.Nexus 7 has a front facing camera, Samsung Galaxy has two cameras (front and rear facing). None of the cameras are as good as our other cameras, so we don't use them much.Galaxy's AMOLED display is brighter and more brilliant than Nexus. Neither one of us sees any difference in sharpness of text. The higher contrast does make Galaxy screen easier to read in the sun. However, Galaxy 7.7 cost was almost three times as much Nexus 7. Is the screen three times better? No.We use both tablets on daily basis. I listed pluses and minuses for both. For me the most significant difference comes down to the lack of timely OS updates for Galaxy 7.7. So if I had a do-over I would go with two Nexus 7 devices. Nexus 7 has been reliable, helpful, and fun to have.Ali Julia review", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "love my nexus!!!", "Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "R15C8I57YSTT9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I had gotten this sooner!

I love that I'm not boxed in with a manufacturer's version of Android -- I get the vanilla Android as Google intended it. I also am not boxed in my only being able to read Kindle or Nook books. I can read either, since I've installed both apps on my tablet. It sits nicely in one hand while I'm reading and has a small enough screen that reading isn't a pain (I didn't want a 10 inch tablet because i feel the screen is way too large).

Normally, customers would be able to at least turn the device on and use it for several days before everything went straight to hell. This was not what happened with my product.As much as I love the fact that with the Nexus 7, you get the MOST bang for your buck, such issues are rather unacceptable for such a great product. Considering the price is relatively steep (upwards of 280$), this product should not be having such issues. In terms of the fixes I have seen on the internet, a few have mentioned holding the power button for approximately 30 seconds, attempting to enter into cold-boot menu, ect... In the case of my product, I plugged the item into an AC adaptor and saw the screen flicker on. Afterwards, the screen remained black. At first, I thought this was normal and would take some time... About 25 minutes later, I eventually concluded that the item was indeed defective... The item would not even enter cold-boot as I held down the power button and volume buttons.All in all, I'm terribly disappointed with this buy and would not recommend purchasing this product online or at all even.

The problem with the reset is that it will not reset to anything, it just keep saying 'Unfortunately the setup wizard has stopped.'So I wanted to return to Pricesmart, but the manager says that Pricesmart is not responsible o there is no warranty if you update the operating system, they cannot receive it or refund it.So I guess that this product is useless.

I have an Apple iPod Touch at the moment, and while I was pleased with the product, I decided that the iPads were a little too pricey for what they offer, and were mostly marketed based on the name. It was then that I stumbled upon the Google Nexus. I've always been impressed with the good name of Google and the services they provide and after reading several good reviews I decided to go with the Nexus.I can safely say that I was very impressed with the product. For the first three months I loaded up some apps from the Play store, copied over some videos and music and basically used it as my primary computer, including contacts and calendar. I stored lots of photos and other documents and carried it around all the time.Then, a few days ago, after shutting it off it would not boot. It would constantly stay on the \"X\" logo and never go past that. I tried resetting it many times, searched the forums for answers and then called Google. After some diagnostics over the phone they told me that there was nothing they could do and to call ASUS. I then called ASUS, and after an hour of pressing this button and that they told me we needed to do a factory reset and wipe the device. I shuddered and agreed and then went ahead. After wiping the device completely clean of everything I had on it, restoring it to factory settings, we tried to reboot it and the same thing occurred. It would get to the \"X\" and go no further.The telephone support then told me I needed to package up the device and send it in to be repaired which will take roughly three weeks, IF they have the parts. So after spending over an hour packaging the device, taking it to the post office and having it shipped out, here I sit without a tablet.At this point, only three months after purchasing the device, I have now lost all of my data, spent  over $300 + shipping costs (which I had to pay) and have nothing to show for it. Also, having spent 2.5 hours on the phone and another hour packaging and shipping the device, not to mention the time I spent trying to boot it back up myself. The best case scenario now is that they can somehow fix the device and send it back, basically a refurb, and then hope that it will work correctly and is worth going back and reinstalling all of my apps and data from the beginning.Before this experience I always viewed Google as a quality company and I highly recommended the Nexus to my friends and family. In light of this experience I am not impressed. I will consider this my last purchase of any kind with the name Google or Asus, and the first of many complaints to my friends and family of the poor quality of Google products, and its services.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA Seems Common Problem", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R2B295OX04U5DA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered the 32GB Nexus 7 for a Christmas present for the wife.

Driver", "ReviewID": "R364WL7AY1C75O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For background - I have had a budget Android tablet and several Android phones for personal use, and I have an iPad and an iPhone for work, and my wife has a Nook Color, so I am well-versed in mobile technology and capability.I've had this tablet for around a month, and overall, I quite like it.  I got it primarily for web-browsing, ebooks (via the Nook app), and games, with some light productivity, mostly around the house.  I had expected to continue to use my mobile to listen to music at home, and to check Facebook and email, since it's \"pocketable\" and I have it on my most of the time.  As it turns out, the Nexus, while not something I'd take out with me running errands, fits nicely in a front pants pocket, and I find myself using it almost exclusively as my mobile device while I'm at home, for everything but phone calls.Here are the details:Pros:*The screen is amazing - very crisp, with deep blacks, great viewing angles, and accurate color representation.  Coming from a Super AMOLED screen on my phone, I was a bit worried, since this is a basic ISP panel, but it's awesome.  Touch response is quick and accurate as well.*Super-quick quad-core CPU - this had taken almost everything I've thrown at it with little slowdown.  Oddly, Facebook sometimes gives it pause, but most people I know have some problems with the Facebook mobile app.  Installs apps super-quick after downloading, and loads them up quickly as well.*Smooth, fast graphics - I can't believe how good the graphics are getting on tablets these days.  No complaints - 3d games play smoothly, with very little lag or stuttering.*Super-quick Wifi - I have a 25Mbps Fios connection, and this tablet maxes it out, even over wifi-G.  Downloaded a 1.3 GB game in a few minutes.*Jelly Bean 4.2 interface - Smooth animations, and I love the widgets available.*Swype-like keyboard in 4.2 (you might have to upgrade out of the box) - I got hooked on Swype on my Samsung GS II phone, but was worried about how it would work on a tablet with the larger screen.  While the keyboard isn't actually Swype, but rather an Android-stock knock-off, it works very well. Only complaint is that the function to add words to the dictionary after manually spelling them out is not always available.*Media - video playback is superb, due to the great screen, and the sound is decent-ish without headphones.  Plug headphones in, and the sound is great - not distorted, with decent dynamic range.  Netflix works great, as does Youtube, Vimeo, and other streaming apps.*Form factor/feel - despite minor issues with build quality I touch on below, this is pleasant to hold.  Enough heft you know it's not a cheaply made device, but not too heavy, with a nicely textured rubber back.  The closest thing I can compare it to is the Nook Color - the rubberized back makes both devices easy to hold, although this has a glass bezel, so it gets thumbprints easily.  No worries - the glass cleans nicely with a cloth, or in a pinch, the tail of a t-shirt.*Battery life - lasts from morning to night, while checking email, web, Facebook, etc., watching Youtube videos, and playing lots of games (usually Angry Birds or Minecraft).  Easily lasts 12 hours of light-to-medium intermittent use throughout the day.*Standard Micro-USB port - THANK YOU!  So many tablets these days use proprietary charging/data ports, so this was very refreshing, and since I have several high-current USB chargers, I'm not lacking for places to plug this thing in, when the battery finally does die.Cons*Build quality - as I mentioned above, there are a couple minor issues.  For one, there's a plastic trim ring running around the device, that has a bit of flex in it.  And due to this, it appears the glass on the left side (viewing it in portrait mode) is pushed up a bit.  This is only an illusion - the plastic trim ring has warped a bit, so that the edge of the glass is exposed by a hair's breadth, where on the other sides of the device, the plastic trim is raised above the glass ever-so-slightly.  If I'd spent $500 on this, I might have returned it, but it's acceptable given the price.  Although I do hope Google/ASUS do change this bit of the design on future revisions, as I've read about it in other reviews.  This is what I docked the star off for.*No SD card - worth noting, but since I knew this going in, I didn't dock a star.  I know Google/ASUS wanted to charge a premium for extra storage, but come on - microSD ports wouldn't have added a lot of cost, and wouldn't have required much space.  This was a very Apple thing to do.  That said, 32GB is a lot of storage, and with so many cloud services supported, I mainly only need the local storage for games and to sync Google data.Some apps I'd recommend:Spotify - the best streaming music service I've tried, the app works great on this tabletGrand Theft Auto Vice City - if you liked the original, it will be a blast form the pastMinecraft PE - Minecraft, on a tabletAngry Birds Star Wars - best Angry Birds game so far, IMOGoogle Drive - If it's not already installed (can't remember) get it - this is a great little content creation tabletNook for Android - great reading app, and it works with ePub format, unlike the *other* ebook vendor's reading app (cough, cough)Marvel Comic reader - I'm not a huge comic fan, but after reading a couple free issues, this is the way comics should be readUnified Remote - great remote app to control your PC, with mouse and keyboard capability, it's an awesome app for anyone with a home theater PC who doesn't want to drag out a full-size keyboard.  Get the free version for basic mouse/keyboard/media capability, get the full version for several dozen apps, including every flavor of media player/center, file broswers, power, etc.  My favorite Android app hands down.Advanced Task Killer - lets you easily and quickly shut down background apps, either from a menu, or with a one-touch widgetES File Explorer - easily navigate local storage, and also browse UPnP networked storage.  I use this to pull down movies off my server.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for your Buck", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R1MO9FEBAOVRZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll be honest, I never saw myself owning a tablet, but honestly I felt this one was a bit too good to pass up.Pros:- Cheap! If your not buying off of Amazon, you can find this tablet at $230.00. It's one of the cheapest on the market.- 7 inch display- Gripable back- High resolution screen- Very fast- Runs Jellybean 4.2 (comes with 4.1)- Updates now allow for keyboard swiping- Compact, able to hold in one hand- Good button Locations (on/off and volume are located at the side)- No crashes, can handle multiple apps running at once- Little to no heating, even when extremely active- Great Battery life- None slip air pockets on back- Google now, Sbeam, and other awesome features- HTML Browser- Has 32GB of Flash Memory- Has 720p video (comes with a quality cap that you can break with an app to get the full potential.)- Has 1 GB of RAM- Has GPS- Has Blutooth- Weight is .7 lbs and is well distributed- Scratch Proof Corning\u00ae Fit GlassCons:- Auto correct is sometimes dumb.- No USB port- No SIM Slot- Poor speakers- No back facing camera- front facing camera has poor quality (1.2 MP). The Video is 720P, haven't tested it yet.- No Flash Support- No Radio (can stream online radio)- No GPRS (Cannot connect to 4G, 3G networks, though there is a Nexus that can)- No EDGENow something I love about this tablet is the screen resolution. 1280x800, it has better image quality than the iPad Mini. The Nexus 7 has 216 ppi compared to the iPad Mini's 163 ppi, overall the Nexus 7 has a higher density pixel display. My uncle, who works for Microsoft is envious of it's quality display when compared to his iPad Mini (he hates Microsoft products). The display has a contrast ratio of 908:1, which is very excellent. It's really too bad that there aren't amazing speakers to go with this amazing display, and that's the devices's greatest failure in my opinion.The speakers are soft spoken, and when raised too high emit some weak strained audio. They work, they get the job done, but when it comes to watching some Netflix in bed, I get out the headphones. Otherwise they're okay for the on the spot you tubing and what not, they just could be better is all. Here are the stats on decibels:Loudspeaker Voice 68dB / Noise 65dB / Ring 75dBAudio quality Noise -69.8dB / Crosstalk -72.1dBThe keyboard is pretty intelligent and smooth. There have been updates since it's release and one of them included the swipe keyboard. It works really well. My only complaint is that occasionally it auto corrects something oddly, but that's not something an update could easily solve.Now for me the camera wasn't a very big deal, it's primary purpose I assume would be for skyping. If I'm planning on a skype session, I would probably bring the laptop out. So I don't think I'm ever going to really need the camera. The camera genuinely sucks though, it's pixally and could have been a lot better. Still, I suppose when Google made it, they weren't really intending the user to take high quality photos with their tablet. I'll give them leniency here, since it's a fairly useless feature on a tablet anyways.The Nexus 7 runs on 1GB of ram, and has a Tegra 3 Quad-core processor. Basically it runs very fast. It has yet to freeze up on me, not counting when a crappy app crashes. It can run multiple apps with breeze and smoothly transition through them. Apps load very quickly, as do webpages. Boot up is a matter of a second or so. I love how the unit doesn't overheat, ever.There are two very large copper heat sinks that surround the tablet that give it this ability. I've used this tablet throughout the entire day with multiple apps open, streaming videos, playing games, and it only gives off a mild warmth.The system software itself is amazing. Jellybean works splendidly and is indeed very buttery. Transitions through apps are very graceful and pleasing to the eye. I personally like the color layout the system has (black and a particular blue text). The navigation is very easy to figure out and the tablet is very easy to use. There are a lot of system adjustments you can do, and my personal favorite feature is the message for the lock screen. I have an if found message, being the forgetful person I am I thought this was a nice touch since I don't want to sharpey my name on the device. One of the greatest featues of Android, in my opinion, is the ability to customize your device. There's a nice array of widgets out there, that and some neat live wallpaper. Unlike the iPad Mini, one Nexus' display could look vastly different than the next one, while the iPads only differ in background and App choices. The system is very simple and easy to use, very user friendly.When it comes to browsing the web I've heard a few Flash complaints, since it runs HTML. There are several ways to get around this, but I thought I would just mention that no, the Nexus does not come supporting Flash. The Nexus 7 runs an HTML5 browser, and I haven't had any difficulty with it.With 32 GB of space, you have some room to upload your favorite songs and movies, store some pictures. For $230.00, this is a great amount of memory. Honesty, its a steal, have a look at other tablets and their storage vs. Price - price range.The battery is long lasting. One charge lasts throughout the day on heavy use. Using it lightly, it can last well over 100 hours. This thing is very efficient battery wise. The only thing that drains the battery is the GPS for obvious reasons. Streaming movies, I'd estimate it would last around 11 hours. I've read somewhere that this has to due with it's quad core, and it's extra core. This extra core only runs while it's in sleep mode. This alone helps vastly improve battery life, that and the quad core makes the Android overall very efficient.Finally the design of the tablet. For some, the rubber-pastically like back may be unattractive, to me it's a plus. It prevents slippage, and while the iPad Mini's backing looks more attractive, on cold morning I'd be afraid of shattering it on the floor. There are small indentions all over the back of the Nexus for the purpose of creating more friction. It's supposed to allow a firm grip, even if your palms are sweaty. The face of the Nexus looks very sleek, it doesn't gather much smudge and is very simple to clean. I think the silvery lining around the edge of the device adds a nice touch as well. The face of the screen is made with Corning\u00ae Fit Glass, which is scratch resistant. I have yet to get a case for the device, but from what I can tell, there aren't even light surface scratches.Also just a quick bit about Corning\u00ae Fit Glass, I'm guessing it's a Corning\u00ae product. Asus is using Corning\u00ae Fit Glass in all of its newly announced products. Earlier Asus stated that they would be using Corning\u00aeGorilla\u00aeGlass2 in all of their 2012 products, so I'm not what's really going on. I'm assuming it's a Corning\u00ae product because the title is capitalized, \"Fit Glass\", on all of the product descriptions, other people assume it's just scratch resistant glass that Corning\u00ae fitted for Asus. Whatever your take on it, the glass has so far proven resilient for me, so they are probably using the same technique for making the product as they have for Gorilla\u00aeGlass, or better.Here's Asus' statement on it: \"ASUS TruVivid technology with Corning\u00ae Fit Glass for improved color clarity and scratch resistance.\"Overall I love this tablet. It's certainly the best bang for your buck. It looks like quality, it feels like quality, best of all, it is quality. I enjoy the size, and feel the 7 inch screen is just right. I can hold this tablet comfortably in one hand, and could even fit it inside my pocket. It's the best deal out there when concerning price and quality. Comparing it to my Uncle's iPad Mini, I'd say it can do everything his can do, only cheaper. As for the Kindle Fire, it's nothing compared to a tablet running full Android with access to the Google app store. I've looked through the Amazon App store, there's such limitation on which apps can be used, it puts a limitation on the device itself. Kindle Fire is much too Amazon based for me, and I like the more open ecosystem that Google's Nexus 7 has to offer.*I haven't tried this out for myself, and quite honestly am not certain how to go about it, but the Nexus can run game streaming...

The nexus 7 ,which I purchased for my parents, started having the common \"power down\" problem that has been so commonly cited for this tablet with the first few months.

This is after showing a status of 'repair in progress' for weeks so it doesn't make sense how the status became customer-induced after they had been working on it.

After a lot of research and comparisons to tablets such as the Kindle Fire HD, I went with a Nexus 7.Pros:-The 7\" form factor is really good for reading, which is what I primarily got it for. I can hold it comfortably in 1 hand. The faux-leather backing is also comfortable to hold.-Android Jelly Bean is a big improvement over ice cream sandwich.  I had owned an android phone for a couple years in the past before switching to an iPhone, but it's been a year or 2 since I've used it, and they've made some improvements. Ironically, I feel like they improved it by making it even more like iOS. There are some key differences, as Android has widgets, and has different ways of doing some things. While I guess a couple widgets are useful, for the most part, I don't really see the need for them. I tend to just go into apps instead of viewing widgets. Closing open apps is easy, and faster than iOS.-The Google apps that come pre-installed are well designed. I already use many Google services, so setup was easy. Google Now is also well done.-The screen. While the screen is not on par with Apple's retina screen, it is still very nice, and better than most/all of the other non-retina screen tablets currently out there that I've seen.-Google Play. Being able to stream music from Google play is nice to have.-Price. This thing is a realy good tablet for the price.-It's a Nexus/Google tablet, so you'll receive some future OS updates. I don't trust any non-nexus Android devices, as most hardware manufactures just abandon releasing updates for most of their products.Cons:-Lack of apps. I knew this was going to be an issue ahead of time, but it's a bit more an an issue than I expected. First the amount of quality apps available for Android is really not close to the apps available for iOS. A lot of the news apps, guitar/music apps, and toddler apps my daughter uses etc are just not available for Android. Some popular apps seem to just be behind iOS. For example, the Facebook app is pretty much the app that was on iOS about a year ago. The biggest problem is that very few Android apps seem to be optimized for tablets yet. They're mainly phone-apps blown up to fit a larger screen. Being that I mainly got this for reading (and chose it over devices like the Kindle Fire because I do want the additional functionality), I'm not overly concerned with this, but this could be an issue for other people.-Swiping is not as smooth as I'm used to on the iPad. Swiping from side-to-side simply isn't very responsive. I'm not sure whether this is a function of the device, Android, or both. Vertical scrolling seems to lag a bit in some apps, but nothing too bad.-Android Jelly bean is very good, but does not have the same attention to detail as iOS. I've noticed a bunch of small things...such as background images that come with Android not even filling the full screen; I've gotten an 'applauncher' error message a couple times already; and there are some other things they just don't work as well as they should in some cases (ie, moving the curser in Chrome).-Web Browsing. Web browsing can be a bit cumbersome due to the 7\" size. Unlike on a phone which loads mobile versions of many sites, and large screen tablets which load fill sites, this loads full desktop sites, but the screen size can make sites it a little tough to navigation without zooming in and out.-The Google Play store. While Google has made some good improvements with Google Play, the Apple App Store is simply much easier to use and find apps.Overall, its a great tablet for the price. I like the 7\" size for portability, and for reading for long periods of time. Android is still not as refined as iOS in my opinion, but it's getting there.

Google also charges my credit card for the replacement device until Google receives my defective device. Couldn't they just mail me a Sim card?The Google Support call was good. I talked to an English speaking person that sounded like she was from the USA. I really dislike trying to have a support conversation with someone from Mexico or India or any other foreign land.

No Sim card was included. Please see my video. I called Google Support and they did promised that I would receive an email from a Support Specialist within 24-48 hours about getting me a Sim card. Why can't Google just mail me a SIMS card?03/11/13 On Friday afternoon, I stopped by the Woodland, California, AT&T; store to see if they would give me a SIMS card to use in my Nexus 7. They had one but they wanted a $36 activation fee. I declined. When I called Google support on Friday, I was promised an email from Google Support Specialist within 24-48 hours to resolve this matter. It has been over 72 hours and I still have not received and email from Google Support.  I am looking forward to Google resolving this issue.03/12/13 Called Google Support today to find out what is up with the Sim card since I did not get the promised email from them. Google Support suggested that I go to a local AT&T; store for a Sim card and they said I was supposed to get an email to do that on March 10. I did not get the email. I explained that I already went to an AT&T; store and AT&T; wanted an activation fee of $36 for the card. Google said that the activation fee must be paid even if I got the card from Google. I told Google that the sales person at the AT&T; store said that I would not have to pay the activation fee if I got the Sim card from Google. Google Support said that all they can do is to send me another Nexus 7 with the Sim card. So, here we go again with another replacement process.03/12/13: Email exchange between Google Support and me: I called AT&T; and they will not set up a prepaid account without the Sim card that should have been provided with my Nexus 7. In order to set up a prepaid account I would need to have the Sim card that I paid for from Google. AT&T; suggested that I return the Nexus 7 for a refund because I am not being taken care of properly by Google in this matter and buy a tablet through AT&T.;I have been back and forth all day with Google Support. They finally figured out that I have to return the Nexus 7 for a refund and then wait up to 14 days after receipt for a credit to my account and then I can order another Nexus 7 with an AT&T; Sims card.

Don't get me wrong, I used to be a big fan of Apple's nano, their touch, and the iPad, but I've just gotten so disgusted over the years with Apple for the following reasons:1. being forced to sync/dock to iTunes (only to have my entire music library accidentally deleted more than once)2. having to go through gymnastics and gerry-rig other third party apps to try and place my iTunes library on more than one computer or more than one Apple product (all which I own, mind you), and STILL not having something sync up (either music, or pictures, or movies or books etc.)3. having to pay a HUGE premium to get a little extra memory (which cannot be expanded).4. Let's not forget the dopey non-replaceable battery.5Let's move on to the Nexus and I'll explain why this is so fantastic.  First thing, EVERYTHING is sync'd effortlessly over WiFI.  Updates to their operating system, all their apps...EVERYTHING. No more having to sync with a computer app (iTunes).  And when you're tired of an app, you just un-install it right on the device (seems quite obvious to me, but not to Apple. they make you go through iTunes again). And trust me, there are thousands of fantastic and free apps...for music, games, magazines, productivity, calendars, phoe calls over wifi, twitter, facebook EVERYTHING!!!!And guess what, nearly limitless storage on the Nexus. Yes, it has a fixed internal memory and no card slot, but just buy a $2.99 app (called Media to Go) and buy a $2.00 usb to usb micro connector cord and you can store movies, books, music everything on a little SD card. Simply connect the card to the Nexus and you're good to go. You can save all the precious on-board memory in the tablet for processing. And this same set up let's you connect a mouse, a keyboard, nearly anything. And it works flawlessy on the Nexus. No drivers, or special connectors needed (unlike Apple which constantly changes their docking connections, ports, chargers etc.).And the speed of this thing is LIGHTNING fast....quicker than my 2g ipad.  (oh, and although it's not advertised, the battery on the tablet IS replaceable. Just snap off the back cover and snap in a battery).The look and feel of this device is amazing. Magazines, pictures, games (Temple Run 2 anyone???) looks and works flawlessly.  Nearly every day, someone on the subway asks me how I like the device and that they're going to get one as well.  The screen is great, and the back cover has sort of a rubbery coating that makes holding this thing a pleasure (and no more smudges).Guys, if you've been holding off for a tablet, please try this out yourself or talk to someone who owns one.  I am so happy I purchased this (as opposed to the iPad mini which I looked at for quite awhile).  The Nexus 7 is more value for your money, expandable and in my humble opinion, a superior product.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexus 7 review", "Author": "Jim Fiddelke", "ReviewID": "R9EAE9MZ38IGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Price!Google Play market is great. Not as many choices as the Apple Store, but it's getting there.Build quality is outstanding. Love the rubberized, grippy back.Books look great on the 7 inch screen, and the G.P market has plenty of them.It's good to know you'll always be first in line for updates.The smaller 7 inch screen size is very good for smaller hands, and also for playing games that use the gyroscope, like Riptide GP.The processor is blazing fast! No frame rate issues at all with Tegra 3 games like Dead Trigger or Riptide GP. Project Butter also makes the user interface zippy and responsive.Chrome is standard.Ehh:Decent screen resolution. Pixels are barely visible, only if you look very closely.Screen isn't very bright.No storage expansion, so go for the 32gb model. That should be enough for the average joe.Charging isn't very quick.No rear camera. Not that I would take pictures with it anyway.Cons:My unit (bought from hhgregg) had a busted speaker.Screen size. In the days where most new smartphones are upwards of 4 inches diagonal, a 7 inch tablet just doesn't seem like a good investment.Screen is too small for web browsing, in my opinion.The large bezels on the top/bottom and small bezels on the sides make the tablet feel unnecessarily narrow.Conclusion:Unfortunately, because of the speaker issue, small screen area, and an issue with booting up the device, I had to return my Nexus 7 just 2 weeks after I got it for Christmas. However, Asus makes great products and I just ordered my Transformer Infinity. This tablet will be great for younger kids who just want to watch movies, read books, and play games, but for someone like me that will use it for email, web browsing, and taking notes, I would recommend going for a 10 inch screen tablet (Nexus 10 or Transformer Infinity are my two non-iPad recommendations).", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nexux 7 was a gift to replace a very slow Acer w/ Windows 7", "Author": "J.

It is fast and because it is based on the Android operating system, there are countless applications for it.

Highly recommend, I've owned a couple of Android tablets over the last year... this is by far the best one. The price of the 32GB recently dropped down to the same level as the 16GB, although for most people 16GB is probably enough. If in doubt (use games, plan to store lots of media) go for the 32GB model. I decided to do the 32GB because there is no expansion slot. In general, I try to stick with the \"Nexus\" on the phone as well because these units get updated from Google directly (at least for a 2 year period in the case of my phone). Of course, the first Android tablet I got only had about 6 months of updates (won't name the brand). My other tablet was 7 inch and this was my \"sweet spot\" as I can handle it easily etc. My adult kids have big iPads and the recent mini was somewhat attractive to me. Actually, I bought 2 of these (spouse) and my wife who is technically impoverished did fine with this as she has been using the Android phone. It really boils down to your ecosystem and we've leaned toward Android over the last 2-3 years. Not a retina display, but much higher resolution than the iPad mini, also this unit has a quad core processor and 1GB RAM. I can honestly say it is smooth as butter and we are happy with both Nexus 7 tablets. If you don't have any investment in the Apple line, definitely save some money and get the Nexus... I would say the 32GB Nexus is about $130 cheaper than a 32GB iPad mini and you will be happy with it. Do get yourself a gmail account (free and really a must as it integrates a lot of the things you do on the tablet - although I sync with a email/calendar server (Microsoft exchange) at work with no problem. Some new features of Android 4.2 (as of this writing) are Google Now (a Siri like program), and a \"gestures\" keyboard (a must as I hate tap typing on a keyboard - with this you \"slide\" your fingers to each letter and it is much faster). Screen brightness, battery life, Wifi ease of use etc. all are excellent. High quality materials - especially the glass - speed and ease of use easily match the Apple iOS tit for tat.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still not sure", "Author": "David W. Hunt \"Skipper\"", "ReviewID": "RCMACWONLI5UW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The best feature is the ability to dictate search requests to Google.  The voice recognition is very good, and very fast, and far better than SIRI.  But the results are stuck on a small screen.The Nexus 7 is very fast for Google searches using the installed Chrome browser.The NOW feature seems somewhat helpful, so far for me primarily for appointments, weather and traffic home.  Note that it is VERY hard to turn NOW on if you do not do so during the initial set up (check for on-line tutorials AND additional instructions if you want to, since the NOW option is in a tiny menu hidden under a keyboard if it is not activated).  I suggest you activate it during set up and turn it off later if you don't like it.I had higher hopes for using the Google Maps application on Nexus 7 on the road, but it is usable even without active WIFI and is does give turn-by-turn directions.  You must download the relevant map area, which is not an intuitive process, and the range of the map is limited.  But the real problems are:(i) You must select your route while connected through WIFI, since it cannot create a route without a data connection. You must plan your final destination before leaving WIFI coverage. DONT fully exit the application on the road, or you cannot get the route back - you can suspend it.(ii) As far as I can tell, it does not allow a route to more than one location.(iii) Dynamic rerouting works once you gave a route, but it is not very resposive - it did have the better route than a Garmin once, but you must wait quite a while.  Also, the maps stopped scrolling as I drove.(iv)  Be very careful, since it does NOT incorporate HOV restrictions and tried to route me on a restricted route.(v)  Also, forget about POIs on the road.  But with a WIFI connection, there are some good searching map-based searching tools.Speaking of the screen, for some reason Nexus 7 will not change to landscape mode except for videos and Skype.  It would be much better to have an unlimited ability to change from portrait to landscape to blow up text on the screen.The video playback of Ice Age (included for free) failed on several attempts.  It appears Nexus 7 does not have a very good WIFI antenna.  Playback quality was just ok with a great connection.The one speaker is almost useless - poor sound, low volume, wrong place for a movie.Skype was spotty, probably due to the weak antenna, although it did work very well once.  The pictures of me looked even worse than normal for Skype since the camera creates high contrast images, with lighted areas of my face washed out and shadows totally black.  The pictures of were very small due to the extreme wide-angle lens, which might be just as well given how bad they looked.  Also, you are forced to use landscape mode on Skype, so your camera is on the side - that is a real pain.You can access most Amazon contact using free apps.  Google refuses to allow Flash 9, so you cannot play Amazon movies or see animated radar maps, and who knows what else.  I find this totally unacceptable - an obvious attempt to force you to use the Google Play Store exclusively for movies.Be aware that the device requires you to sync up to a Gmail account for many features.  When you do, you have total Google integration either forced on you (Gmail/Gmail Calendar), or immediately available (Google+).  Good, if you want it.The Google Play Store demands to save a credit card to the Google Wallet on the Nexus 7 even to downlaod a freebie.  I do NOT trust the Nexus 7 to have my credit card number.  The device is not secure.  I am not sure I will ever buy from the Play Store as a result.The Nexus 7 can track your location using GPS, or by triangulating your position from known WIFI locations (a feature available on Google maps).  So, even though it is not able to use cell towers to figure your location like a phone, it may have a rough fix on you.  Decide if you want the Nexus 7 to collect this much information about you, which I am sure it will send to Google.  It can be turned off.The Nexus 7 is good about warning about many privacy issues when you load an app, but there are no details and it is not obvious how to selectively disable features of an app, assuming you can.  You have to wonder about the apps based on all the warnings.There are tow totally annoying ads from the Google Play Store on the home screen by default.  TO DELETE THEM, hold your finger on the ad, at which point an \"X\" will appear at the top of the screen - drag the ad to the X and it and all of its progeny are gone.  However, the top half of the home screen will remain blank und unusable.  If you add more than three shortcuts and one widget, you end up with a two page home screen, each of which is largely blank.There is no way to put the device into screen off mode to save the battery.  The default time is really short, and if you increase it through settings you basically have to live with more battery drain all of the time or turn it off entirely.The Nexus 7 takes some time to start up from off mode, no time from the screen off mode. The device is normally on all of the time, with just the sceen off.So, while I like it, I am concerned about privacy issues, quite disappointed about the Google Maps integration, annoyed by the refusal to allow landscape mode on demand and the insistance on Skype in landscape mode, annoyed by the Play Store ads and the loss of home screen when they are deleted, totally annoyed by the refusal to allow Flash 7, and disappointed by the poor antenna.

The google Play store doesn't receive the credit it deserves - there are so many good apps and having an android device already, I have wonderful access to reliable, dependable, quality applications. I was concerned over the 7\" screen size, I'll admit, as I'm a student using the device first for reading and second for goofing off. Text books are very readable and easy to access with any number of powerful apps (Kindle, Play Books, Adobe Reader...) and novels are no harder to look than on any other LCD screen of comparable devices; that said, I can't say it reads like E-Ink but I dont mind for one!For this price and with a good battery life of 10-11 hours of reasonable use, it's perfect for a student on the go.The Tegra 3, 2gb internal memory, and 32gb of storage in addition to limitless cloud storage assuming you have access to WiFi which is very fast on this device, i must add, give it solid futureproofing.iPad?

I was really surprised at the specs and reviews (especially the ones that rated the Nexus above the Ipad mini). So after lunch with friends we went to the store that had a great price on the Nexus and I purchased the 32gig 7 for my wife's birthday, without here knowing of course! When we got home I put all of her information into it which loaded her apps, set up the wifi and it was ready to go.Pros: Very fast, clean look, great battery life, picture is amazing.

The Jellybean 4.1 system is smooth, fast and simple to use.Cons: There is no slot for a SD memory card, I don't know why although 32 gigs is should be enough. I probably should have dropped the extra $50 and got the one with network capabilities ( I found out later that you can purchase one from google that is unlocked and with AT&T; sim card for $299).

I like the physical design and size. The software used is really great. The fact that it is Google makes it even better, especially for syncing purposes. The problem = there appear to be a large number of defective models in existence. The primary issue with my particular device is instability when it comes to tracking my fingers. This has become so much of an issue that it basically renders the device useless. I bought the device to use as a quick reference with PDFs and other documents, and also to search the internet; the stability issue makes it very hard to actually scroll through documents and typing using the 'swype' function is virtually impossible; additionally, the screen frequently experiences 'phantom touches', causing inappropriate clicking and accidental mistakes. Forget any sort of gaming. Warranty services provided no help. Further research into the issue seems to indicate this is the result of a grounding issue that affected many of the Nexus 7 devices.Likes:- Physical design & size- Software design & syncing abilityDislikes:- Large # of defective models - results in touch input instability- Warranty services: To no avail, I went through a long period of communication with warranty services to try to fix the issue.

I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.

Went to their website, plugged in the RMA number and learned they are awaiting customer response.  Customer response to what?  I called and got a rude agent on the phone who said they don't notify customers of problems.  She said she would escalate the RMA and I MAY OR MAY NOT RECEIVE WORD FROM THEM.

Not necessarily so.  If you buy it directly from Google, Google will support the product.  If you buy anywhere else, you are left with ASUS's worst-in-the-industry customer support.

My previous tablets were $200 appx tablets purchased from Chinese sellers on various websites. It was an effort to save money on the more reliable models from HTC, Motorola, and Samsung. They wereok but there was typically no access to the Google app store without rooting the device. There were always battery and screen issues as well.I was very excited about having am official Google device. This thing performs. It is fast and smooth. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it is a super phone. This tablet performs just as well as that phone. I have found myself going to my nexus 7 before my S3 unless I need to make a phone call.YouTube is fantastic on here, Twitter and Facebook are more engaging on the larger screen, and the games like fruit ninja are much more enjoyable. Internet browsing on the chrome browser is excellent.The screen size is perfect for ebooks through the kindle app. Speaking of the kindle; this tablet absolutely smokes the kindle fire. You get the benefits of what a kindle offers through the app and the benefits of an open android os.I would advise ordering a screen protector, rubber/silicone case, and a USB drive adapter. The essential app you will need is called the nexus media importer off the play store for a few dollars. It allows you to transfer content from a USB drive to the device. Movies, music, pictures, you can move it all with the app and cable.My best experience so far with this tablet has been using the ultimate guitar app to view tabs while I play guitar. I put the nexus on a universal tablet stamd purchased on amazon for viewing - I find the \"leather\" cases with built in flip stands to not only be ugly and bulky but seriously tacky as well.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and unless you're and apple fan or locked into their micro-economy (iTunes) get this tablet. It will do everything you want it to do at a great price point.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nexus 7, brilliant tablet by Go0gle", "Author": "Abhishek", "ReviewID": "R1JG2XI9WN7JBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When google initially announced the nexus 7, I was rather skeptical of it, because the tablet market was already dominated by the iPad and a $200 tablet wouldnt be able to compete with it.But now, it has proved otherwise. It is completely changing the tablet market along with the kindle fire and introduced a new sub category within the tablet section.Starting off, the nexus 7 is still not officially available in India, so I had to purchase it through a friend in Dubai. I got the 16GB WiFi only version, a few weeks back.At the first look, the soft rubberised back makes it a pleasure to hold it and you wont feel the pain to holding it upright unlike an ipad.The screen is a 7\" one, which is smaller than the iPad and the resolution is almost comparable. I was rather uncomfortable with such a large bezel at the periphery, but it actually makes it easier to hold wile reading a book or browsing the web.Coming to the software, it runs android 4.2 out of the box, and that is the latest version released by Google. Since it runs pure android without any customization by the manufacturer, and the tablet is made by google, you'll get the updates as soon as they are released. Many of the samsung tablets are only now getting their Ice Cream Sandwich update, whch is just sad, because Samsung customizes the tablet by changing the skin and adding the Touch Wiz UI.The tablet has front facing camera with is good for video calls, skype, google + hangouts etc, but only if you prop it up properly so that it is aligned with your face. In the potrait mode, it becomes rather uncomfortable to use when video calling because the camera is located in the right side or the left side and the camera lens does not have a wide angle to cover more angle.The device comes with Wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and what not. The initail setup was very easy if you have a google account. All it asks you to do is to connect to a WiFi network and sign into your google account. It takes care of the rest. Once you start the Google + app, it automatically pulls your profile picture from there and props it into your user account in the tablet. All your mail, calender, contacts are synced. THe best part about Jelly Bean 4.2 is the user accounts.My dad uses a corporate account for syncing and it contains much sensitive information. This is where user acoounts realy shines. All I had to do was to sign in with his email account and right in the lockscreen, it provides you an option to log into either one of the accounts. The two accounts are no way connected to each other and my dad's and my data are separate.The screen is beautiful and you'll love to use it. The tablet has a power button at the right edge and the volume rocker there too. Nowhere else are there any buttons. The charging port it at the bottom and so is the 3.5mm Headphone jack.The battery lasts pretty long, even with wifi turned on, It remained for over a week with low usage and a full day with heavy gaming and video streaming.You can find plenty of apps on the play store, and even though people say that there are not many tablets apps, it is still sufficient for the average user. Most of the apps will look clear in landscape mode also, but some of them become slightly blurred.One aspect that I didnt like about the Nexus 7 is the fact that it doesnt have touch sensitive keys below the screen. When running apps there is a small black band which shows buttons for the home, return and the most recent apps keys but they take up a some screen space and make the apps look slightly stretched.The presence of the Quad Core Nvidia tegra 3 really is felt at all times. The UI is so smooth, even with the memory full and a couple of apps running.Overall, I personally recommend this device to anyone who wants a tablet, but is not a Apple fanboy.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet value", "Author": "Mikey likes it", "ReviewID": "R31KTC5EGAMD2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being my first tablet purchase, I debated on whether to get a 7\" or 10\" and whether to go for an ipad or something else. My decision to get the Nexus 7 was a good one. It's the perfect size - light and compact enough to bring anywhere while large enough to be effective for viewing videos. It's great as an e-reader. The width allows it to be held with one hand like a paperback book, which is harder to do with the wider ipad mini. The virtual keyboard is just right - in portrait mode I can thumb-type much faster and more accurately than with my smartphone. In landscape I type even faster using three fingers of each hand. Quality is excellent and the screen resolution is higher than the ipad mini, which doesn't have the retina display. Movies are large enough to be enjoyed. 32gb is a good size, providing ample storage especially when supplemented by cloud storage. It's the perfect personal organizer and can take the place of my laptop in most travel situations. Android Jelly Bean is fantastic and though there currently aren't as many android apps as IOS apps, most of the truly useful ones exist. Since I got the Nexus, I hardly use my smartphone for anything other than calls. My laptop use has also decrease a lot, as many things are just faster and easier to do on a tablet.The minor complaints I have are: 1) there's no rear facing camera. I had assumed it would at least have a basic one and I was surprised after receiving it that it didn't; 2) the audio quality through the headphone jack is okay, but don't expect audiophile quality. My ipod touch sounds way better; and 3) the speaker is rear facing, at the bottom edge. None of these are significant flaws, given what I use it for and in light of the price. Get one. You'll love it.A few accessories I recommend are a USB adaptor which lets you expand storage by using a thumb drive, a bluetooth speaker like the JBL Flip (great for music streaming and watching movies) on the Nexus 7 and a case (the Blurex N7 case is great).

This one was supposed to be the best 7-inch android tablet, but I'm questioning that notion. I own the Galaxy tab 2 7.0 as well, and to be perfectly honest, I think that Samsung's personal touches to the Android software makes it a winner over the Nexus line. I can't seem to find a battery-saving mode on the Nexus, the buttons are all in the most awkward locations, and there is no way to expand or import memory through memory cards. it seems the battery dies out way too quickly, even when in stand-by mode. It seems to take a long time to charge. The screen only looks a bit sharper and brighter than other tablets I used.I wouldn't say that this is \"bad\". Not at all. But I think that Samsung's Galaxy is a better choice. The only drawback in the competition is that their hard drives don't come with more memory (if I could've got a 32gb Galaxy 2 7.0, I wouldn't have bought this Nexus 7). I wanted this for video games, apps, movies, music, etc. It holds 32gb, and it feels like I can download half the Play store without seeing a dent in memory. But in reality, I think that the \"pure Google experience\" is not as nice as people made it sound. There are too many features I enjoy that are missing.But as things are right now with the competition, I'd still highly recommend this. It's portable enough to fit in a bookbag, purse, laptop bag, or even pants pockets, it does almost everything you could want a tablet to do, it's fast, it holds a lot of stuff (the 32 gb version), and it has a lot of potential in the right hands.

The keyboard would sporadically appear, then in the middle of typing in the username, the keyboard would just disappear.  The operating system runs very slow as well, and sometimes crashes.  When I plug my SD card reader into the S3 android phone micro usb charging port, the file structure on the SD card is immediately displayed.  On the Nexus, I had to pay $4.00 for an app to use micro usb port.  This is a design problem - reason, there is no micro sd card slot on the Nexus 7 therefore, the only way to direct connect to the device is through the micro usb port.

Within about 3 or 4 weeks it became glitch, with apps crashing.  But I could live with it because it allowed me to take advantage of the app store.  So for months, I actually enjoyed the tablet even though the screen would not fill with pictures all the way or something else would close unexpectedly and the sound was not all that great.  However, last week, Tuesday 07/09/2013 the sound stopped altogether.  I had already bought a mini speaker to compensate for the poor sound quality.  When I plugged that it in, I got sound from the tablet, but that was the only way I could hear anything.  I called ASUS support and right away they asked had I dropped it.  I had not.  I promptly sent it off on the same day, Tuesday, 07/09/2013.  Until today, I still haven't heard a word.  I called ASUS support myself and was told that they received the tablet yesterday, 07/15/2013 and that I should received a 'repaired' tablet within 7 - 10 days from 07/15/2013 their receipt date.

I wrote back to remind them that the device would not start and so could not find it through the settings ment, and my father had thrown out the original packaging. Another 24 hours later, they wrote back with the exact same email asking me to find the CSSN number through the settings menu.  I told them again that their machine was such a piece of crap, that it would not even start.  It was like a screaming at a brick wall.  Another 24 hours later, they Google wrote to ask me for the CSSN number again off the original packaging.  I don't think they were reading my email responses or listening to me at all.  I cannot say how frustrating it was.  After spending a half hour on the phone with their customer support again, they told me they would email the consultants that handle the emailing to see why they kept asking me for a CSSN number.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, and only then did they start to try to cooperate and break through the walls of beuracracy and send me the paper work to get a new device.  Even then it would take 21 days to get a new Nexus and they would put a hold on my credit card until I returned their malfunctioned Nexus.  I bought the Nexus because I was tired of always giving all my money to Apple, but instead I got a poor quality device, was not treated like a human and had to struggle to just get one that worked.

I really like it but because it is fairly new there is not as many cool apps and features like their is for Ipad. Everything I do online this Nexus does not work with, but it does work with Ipad so basically I have to buy an ipad now, instead of spending $700 I just have to spend $950.I can say that this little nexus is great for a portable device to take with you on the go. I bought a small case with a built in keyboard and kick stand so I can use it like a mini laptop, the case was only $14 on amazon. If I owned an Ipad and had to take it on the road I would be on edge, but this device is perfect for that. You can fit the nexus and case easily in an over-sized jacket pocket. I can stream netflix anywhere there is a wifi connection and I can watch live TV on filmon tv from the internet. This is an awesome device for traveling.

I will admit that I am not very experienced with tablets since this is my first one, which makes it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it also tells you about its simplicity, but that doesn't mean it has no customization. Andriod is very very customizable. I'll start off by throwing out a few things that are pros and cons in my book.pros:Very solid product, comfortable to hold, and light.It has amazing battery life.The screen quality is right out superb for a $200ish tablet.It's a nexus, which causes you to get very prompt OS updates giving you the latest of Andriod.Speakers - they put out better sound then many laptops I have seen.It is very simple device to root.There are sleep covers for it so that it doesn't waste battery life when not in use.WiFi reception is good, not amazing, but good.Bluetooth works pretty well. I like using a Bluetooth speaker while using the shower to keep the tablet away from the steam.Charges & syncs using micro-usb so it is easier to find accessories.It normally is a pretty speedy tablet.With buying a simple, three dollar, app you can connect external storage, it doesn't even require rooting.It costs half as much as many comparable tablets benchmark wise making it a great deal.The back, as apposed to some tablets, is not a finger print magnet and it is not slippery.The Nexus is very comparable to the Kindle Fire HD but the nexus runs pure Andriod so it is much more customizable. With the Kindle Fire you are completely locked in Amazon's ecosystem unless you root it, but with the Nexus you can get the Google Play Store and then buy apps for Amazon, Nook, and such, so it gives you much more options.Neutral Comments:Size - seven inches is perfect for me. It may or may not be perfect for you, but it was for me.It runs Android which i like but it will depend on the person. The classic Andriod vs. iOS, which you'll have to decide for yourself which is best for your individual propose.It doesn't cost as much if you buy it from other retailers.Negative:It's a Nexus causing you to get very prompt updates, which sometimes are slightly buggy causing a little lag at times. You get to be used a little like a guinea pig at times. since the 4.2.1 update it has needed reboot two times, but before that it never had to. I am sure it is very temporary thing, and will be fixed soon.There is a lack of compatible apps, let alone optimized for the screen, but the Play Store is growing rapidly, so that's just a matter of time.On a side note, one thing that annoys me with this, and other tablets as well, is there pricing. let me elaborate, charging up to 50 dollars more for only 16 gigs of extra memory is a little steep causing Google to get more off those who need more memory.  I just wish that they'd not be quite as unfair against those of us that need more memory, but that is against all tablet makers not just google/asus.  That said, it is just an amazing deal for a tablet. I have  even read multiple places that Google it taking a loss on the tablet and just hoping to recoup the money through data collection and apps.  so for the price you can't do any better.Finally, I'd like to say, I have owned my tablet for three months and, overall, I am very pleased with it. The Nexus Seven is a good tablet for a mediocre tablet price. It is a solid device that I have recommended and will recommend to anyone in the seven inch tablet market.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Poor service", "Author": "jamie barnich", "ReviewID": "R1CZ597T2YAFVH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had been told by my husband to order my nexus 7 for christmas, well it is now January 7th and I have to wait for it to be shipped back from Asus.

I have been a long time Asus adept and they have to steer away from Google as much as possible as Google is tarnishing Asus with their horrible customer support.Pros of tablet:-Great processor-Beautiful high definition display-Very nice design. In-hands feel and ease of use is fantastic...Cons:-No video-out, don't try HTC (80$) adapter with Cavium Wi-Fi Media app, it does not work. There is a youtube video about this and it will not work unless you have an HTC phone which the HTC media HD device will recognize as being on network and then connect to network...-Video-out: dont waste your money on an MHL adapter, it does not work either...-Video-out with iMediaShare Lite do work for files on device through any Samsung All-Share enabled tv...but there is absolutely no streaming (sorry Netflix will not work on TV via the tablet).-OTG USB access works out of the gate with \"Nexus Media Importer\" app with JB 4.1 version, but within 10 minutes of unboxing your Nexus 7, your device will update to JB ver. 4.2 and this kills OTG support all together. This way, if you still want to use USB via OTG Google forces you to root your device, then it works with either Nexus Media Importer or stickmount app...and voids your warranty...-Speakers are too quiet and will bust if you use Winamp equalizer Db boost or any app that boosts db...Just don't do it...You can google that...-If you bust speakers, there are ZERO vendors nor Google, nor Asus who sell spare parts (speakers).-Google Play store and horrible customer service....need it say more? (oh but I will...)I got Nexus 7 in Dec 2012. Bought the device on google play store. Was able to purchase apps until mid January 2013... All of a sudden and for no reason, all apps purchases get automatically cancelled. Credit card info on google wallet matches credit card statement, credit card has plenty of free room and bank says all good on their end and that they approve all Google Play transactions, but get immediately reversed. After countless emails, always answered by same \"wait 24-48 hours\" automated reply and nothing else. There is a place in the support website that makes you enter your data and then they call you. I did that 3-4 times and always speak with the nicest people, but they just take your info, apologize, then send you another useless automated reply...and you fall back in this useless never ending loop.I just recently converted all my Apple devices and got Nexus 7 and also Samsung S3 which i both loved, but Google, by denying apps purchases, have rendered my devices useless... BTW, I did enter other credit cards in google wallet, all of them good with a lot of wiggle room, got my bank to recheck address on file, so much that they are exasperated with me... and one of the last google Rep, after being on the phone for more than 30 minutes, since I was demanding a reason for the cancellations and \"what can I do to fix the situation\" discussion, ended up telling me that issue was on their side and they had no clue what was going on and that there are thousand of users just like me that are totally baffled...Conclusion, try windows 8 based tablets or stick to apple's products (their service is impeccable, but you pay devices dearly, but is usually worth every penny...), but just do not fall into google's customer service abyss...it is not worth the heartburns...", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Electronic express sucks", "Author": "michael mosley", "ReviewID": "R2KKP53NF16Q31", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "had it replaces three times, never have i had so bad cust. service, honestly don't waste your money on them they are not worth, you will never get help. and just run arouds", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crap screen", "Author": "Meghan Lally", "ReviewID": "R2G17AJAXNC8JF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product is VERY delicate.

I thought having a \"true\" Android experience would make the experience smoother and more enjoyable. I was wrong. This device automatically updated to Jelly Bean 4.2. I like that. The update was fast and seemless.However, having used the Android OS in the past, I knew where everything was. With JB 4.2 things are changed and, personally I found them more complicated and hard to get to. Synchronization and Background data disabling just to mention a few. You also can't kill your most recent apps like you were prior to JB. You can only do so one by one. That's ridiculous.Seemingly, I erroneously assumed JB would've eliminated unwanted and needless apps populating in the background, thereby minimizing sucking your measly 1 GB or memory (RAM). Nope, not even with background data disabled.  I had to install GoLauncher to easily kill the apps and a few other apps like FMR cleaner Fast Reboot to do this on a regular basis. The amount of memory rescued or obtained is simply obscene. I can disable all \"push\" or notification settings but that won't help.Google Chrome is a joke with JB. You get tabs and you can't get full screen view. Kinda defeats the purpose on the tablet. At the same time, you can do so with the Chrome version on iOS 6. The same with Google Maps, no full screen view.I find the device's overall responsiveness rather sluggish, even right after you do a fresh or clean install (restore). There is no comparison to the iPhone or iPad which is silky smooth unless you update your old device with the latest firmware update which can be a problem. Case in point: updating the iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4G to iOS 6.It's quite ironic though. I have the iPhone 5 now. I said to myself, that is going to be my last Apple device I will own unless Apple get's their act together. Now, I am having second thoughts. If a pure Android device like Nexus 7 can perform not well (to my expectations) then how can I expect,  say a Samsung Galaxy 5 or 6 to be much better? After all, Google is NOT known to listen to their customers. They are known to have very horrible customer service and don't respond to customer feedback at all. Look at how they did with the launch of previous Nexus products especially with the Nexus 4 phone?

Despite the descriptions I had relied on with respect to how easy it is to copy music files to the device (like an MP3 player), it does not work.  I copied several GB of music files to the device and I can even see them in the folders, but the device does not recognize them.  I downloaded several apps that are supposed to 'correct' the problem, but they either crashed or failed to have any effect.C'mon now, why is this soooo difficult to do?  So far, no music and no obvious fix.The screens are not intuitive.  I cannot figure out why some screens appear out of nowhere and are sometimes empty.  There is no obvious means of managing the screens or icons.  I cannot figure out how to move icons around in order to put the most used ones on the first screen.  It goes on and on...(I have an iPhone and find that it's design is much more elegant with respect to managing content.)There is no native camera app.  You must download a special application to use the camera.  Really?The screen is really nice, though.Three stars may be overly generous._-----------------After using this device for several months, I can say that the initial review was on target. Games work well, but editing ANYTHING (email, documents, etc.) is worse than a chore.  Try moving the cursor to a point in the text where editing is needed. It's so incredibly tedious to edit text that I end up retyping the entire word or sentence instead of changing it. I usually end up back in front of my server to do the task. Reading email works reasonably well, responding to email is just frustrating.I am guessing that Apple copywrited the 'better' editing methodology and the Android devices are not allowed to use it. In hindsight, I should have purchased the iPad.Another fail on this device is that Skype does not function with the camera, only sound.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Customer Service", "Author": "antonio C.

This tablet was meant to be a showcase for Jelly Bean and ironically it has been let down by the software. Android still has some ways to go before it is as snappy and reliable as iOS.  Apps like Facebook and Aldiko brought the tablet to its knees and the only solution was to restart it. Android now supports multiple users but it renders the tablet nigh-unusable and everything becomes slow and stuttery. Multitasking suffers, especially. The default Chrome browser feels like beta software and one has to install quite a few apps to make the tablet usable. PC connectivity is as another sore point as the device now announces itself as a media device and the file transfer is iffy at best. many files are not at all visible till you restart and you can no longer play content off the tablet directly. You can't start multiple copy tasks simultaneously. The default music and video players are one of the worst I've seen in a tablet, really poor. The device is basically gimped, there's no USB on the go or any way to mirror the display on to a HDTV.Now, the good stuff: great hi-res screen, but very dull, IMO. Great battery life and Google Now/voice recognition are the best I've used.Overall, a decent device but typical, unrefined Android experience hold it back.

It uses numbers and symbols. It was quite difficult to enter the password with this device's hard to use keyboard. I prefer separate concave keys with permanent markings on them. Unlike flat screens, they offer physical feedback instead of nothing. I have never enjoyed touch screens, and this device confirmed my burning hatred of that weak, pathetic technology.I wished to view my flickr photostream as a slide show to test the screen's picture quality. It was impossible. The device did not support Adobe Flash. The device is completely useless for web browsing without Adobe Flash. I wanted pictures, not an error message and a link to download the Flash player that led to another error message. How can a 21st century web browsing device not support Flash? It is ubiquitous and essential. The device is truly useless.I thought Google Chrome had Flash built in. Evidently I was mistaken. The Android version of Chrome is different and far weaker than the Linux and Windows version. What is the purpose of this operating system, browser, and device? How does not supporting Flash help users wishing to view Flash content?I hate this device. It does not serve my simple needs. A 10 year old desktop PC is more than capable of easily accepting alphanumeric input efficiently, responding to input from pointing devices, and running Adobe Flash in a web browser.

You can't: play Flash files, play digital copies of movies you've purchased, use the GPS for anything useful except when you're connected to the internet.  (This last one is a particular sore spot, since the GPS was the reason I chose it over the Amazon Fire.  - it says you can download maps to \"use\" offline.  And you can download maps, but you can't use them for anything useful.  It's basically a picture of the map - no search, no directions, nothing)  What else can't you do with the Nexus 7?  You can't use it to watch Amazon Prime videos even though you're an Amazon Prime customer.  You can't use it as a universal remote.  You CAN play music, but the built in speakers remind me of a transistor radio, so playing Pandora on it while cleaning out the garage is a nostalgic trip back to the 70's.  It has neither deep nor rich sound.I've gone online and it seems like there's various workarounds for some of these issues.  And certainly other tablets have speaker issues.

After using it for a week, I can honestly say that this exceeds most of my expectations. It does have a quirk that you might want to keep in mind.
