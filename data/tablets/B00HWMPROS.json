I have discovered playbook app and the ability to upload my rather extensive book library.  I use calibre with a drm removal program so that I can have all of the books I purchased available anywhere.I have had some issues getting this to sync with my samsung tv.  I have the remote control working and am able to control my tv just fine but I just can not get the screen mirroring to work.  It acts like it is going to connect and show up on my tv screen but then fails.  If anyone has an idea as to what I am doing wrong I would welcome your advise.It continues to function great and is getting free updates from Samsung for software.  I really like the rubber back....around the house i do not need a cover.So you are thinking about buying one of these.  They are rather high in price but you do get a nice large screen and a LOT of free software.....NOT what I would say is bloat ware.  For me bloatware consists of basic come ons that give me a few days for free and then I have to pay more money.  While that is true about some of the software much of what Samsung offers up is FREE>I will not simply cut copy and paste the specs.  You can see those for yourself.This is a new type of device.  A natural evolution of a common device.  It is a new and fresh approach to this whole new category of consumer tablets.  New in that they are still in their diaper stage........ much change has happened to size and weight.  Screens have become better and functions have increased.I like this device.  I am still learning how to use it.  My usage of windows 8.1 definitely helped me get going on this.  Sure I know this is android but it does share some common characteristics with the surface pro2...... i.e......you can have multiple applications running side by side.I like using the pen.  It is unlike any other pen I have used.  It communicates with the screen long before you ever touch it.  It is stowed in the side of the device.  I did not know this so I looked back through the box thinking they had forgotten to send it to me......then I found it.I was able to sync up my microsoft exchange account, my cox account, calendars, contacts, etc....I am able to use the amazon mp3 app to listen to my music..... I uploaded ALL of my music to the amazon mp3 cloud many months ago.Dropbox works fine as does OneDrive.Like many people I have vision problems.  Vision problems are not something for the aged it affects millions of people of all ages.The accessibility options are cool.  I have my voice over set for British female voice.  She sounds sexy.  I think I would like to meet her....anyone have Raj's twitter account..... Since he found Siri maybe he can help me find my sexy British voice......(don't tell my wife that I am looking for her)Sooooo with the pen out you just hover around the screen and it tells you exactly where you are.  Touch the icon for settings or samsung apps and she will talk you through it all.  I have the power button set so that if I hold it down for two seconds it pulls up the accessibility options so I can turn her off just as easily as she turns me on.One caveat with the voice over on is that you HAVE to use the pen..... finger touch does not work to change pages etc.....Playbook.....  a great way to get books and a FANTASTIC way for those of us with vision problems to get the text just right.Now that I have been using my new iPad Air and this Galaxy note for reading I fully realize what I was missing using my amazon HDX 8.9.  You can get the fonts way larger on the iPad Air and the Galaxy note than the amazon device.  When i say bigger i mean BIGGER.  We are talking about the difference between say 40 font and 60 font.PLUS with the added real estate of the galaxy I can get around 15 words per page.  The playbook app also has free and always on text to speech.  You just move the pen to the top and click start speech.Voce over works pretty much like on my iMac.  It works with programs on the note.  i.e...... Netflix.... voice over works with it and will read me what is on the screen.  A big plus for those of us with vision problems.  No more trying to find my high powered glasses...I can just activate voice over and use my lower powered 5.0 magnification glasses.Sadly when I use the google playbook I have to listen to there rather robotic female american voice....... please google let me use the samsung british voice.  I think I love her.I bought one case for this but it just is not what I really want.  I have two of the ionic brand on order.  One is like there Kindle HDX case and has a keyboard and the other is hopefully like a book.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "This tablet pricey but awesome", "Author": "Thor20 \"Thor20\"", "ReviewID": "R1HYRS66OVCGA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took a while for my to pull the trigger on this one.  I just felt like it cost too much.  However, now that I have the tablet I have nothing but great things to say about it.  My previous tablet was a Gen-1 Ipad and this tablet and my ipad are night and day.  I enjoy using the multitasking and the S-Pen is very handy as well although,  I wish that I could do multitasking with Netflix without rooting the device.  Accessories are  cheap (unlike Apple), but not plentiful (unlike Apple).  I was able to purchase 2 cases and screen protectors for about $30.Battery:I have had the tablet for about a week, I am getting approximately 9-10 hours of use.  I typically stream Netflix, play games and surf the web with some light drawing via S-PenStorage Expansion:I purchased the Samsung 64GB Micro-SDXC-I card.  The card worked great no need to format it.Syncing:This is where I ran into some issue and had to do some serious research.  I wanted to be able to continue using iTunes to organize my media but sync that media including playlist to my android tablet.  I triedSamsung KIES 3:  I thought this would work very well for me, but it seemed to be missing a lot of functionality such as exporting playlist, etc.  KIES 2 had all the feature but was not compatible with the GNP  DoubleTwist:  This product worked well, but it will not sync any DRM protected content, my view here is I paid iTunes for the music and I would like to be able to put it on a non Apple device without paying to use their service.  Doubletwist also would not let me write my music to the SD card.  Android KitKat 4.4 prevents applications from writing to the SD card. This was a show stopper for me.  I want to control where my content goes.  I know they did it for security reasons but they need to find a better way to handle this.  iSyncr:  This is a paid app ($3.99 US)  .  This app allowed me to continue using iTunes as I did in the past, it simply hooks into iTunes and finds your content/playlist and syncs that with your Android device.  iSyncr also allows you to write to the SD card no problem.Screen:The screen is phenomenal I have watched a few bluray movies on it and I am very impressed.Speakers:The speakers on the GNP compared to my Gen-1 Ipad are very good.  The sound is not only loud, but rich and crisp.  I do not see the need of always connecting a Bluetooth speaker to my tablet just to hear over some back ground noises.Docking:I currently use the cable that came with the device, but would really like a docking clock system for my bed side.  Unlike Apple, Samsung has very few options in this space.Camera:Camera doesn't seem to do a very good job in low light, but who takes pictures (often) using a 12.2 inch tablet.  The software for the camera and movies seems to be feature rich, but I cannot provide a lot of detail as i have not used this part of the tablet often.Performance:The tablet is smooth and does multitasking without any issues.  Inititally there seemed to be a little lag as you swiped from screen to screen, but I followed the advice of another Amazon reviewer by the name of Chris Olic to resolve those issues see link below.http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OHHGEWFW3577/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdponSummary:I hate that I took so long to purchase this device.  I can see myself using it for a very long time.  Everyday I seems to find a new awesome thing I can do with it.  Do yourself a favor and don't wait as long as I did go get this awesome tablet.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Still new to it, but so far WOW", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R1FZ7JWP205D6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've S-pen.only had the tablet an hour now but I love the full screen keyboard and the new tile system is fantastic, I really like it. It's actually less heavy than it looks given its size. I am moving over from a note 10.1 2014 edition and so far immediately very happy with this device. I'll update more later. I'm giving it 4 stars only because it's my first impressions.Update: WOW, I new there could be 4 windows but they are always shown (on various website images) as a quad of windows. In fact you can turn many apps into overlapping windows or Facebook style chat head bubbles. I'm writing this review with my \"s\" pen and it's absolutely fantastic. It's great to have it on your lap while using the S-pen. So far it's very nice and I Love the large Screen. Update still loving the device. Very easy to touch type on. The interface is smooth, no jitters as far as I can see right now. It would be nice if more major apps could be windowed.There are two different ways to use the windows.  If you swipe left from from the side of the screen you see the multi apps. There are currently about 28 apps that use multi window. If you just TAP an app it will open as a floating window, like in, well, Windows.  You can have 5 apps open at once in floating windows and they can be resized and minimized into chat heads. Very handy.  If you DRAG an app it snaps into grid formation and you can have 4 of those. I really like the flexibility in the operating system.Another great thing and I don't know if this is kit kat but I know I can't do it on my note3 which is still running jellybean, but you can set Google play movies to DOWNLOAD MOVIES TO YOUR SD CARD  and for me this is huge!The only reason I wanted a 64gb tablet was to hold more movies but I only need 32 now because I can put a ton of movies on a 64gb sd card. Makes the 64gb version unnecessary.If anyone has questions I'll do my best to answer. Loving this tablet!

It's a Samsung product, it's an Android OS and it's NOT an Apple Product! Win, Win and Super Win! Sorry, I know apple makes decent products, but I just don't like them!Ok, I digress on with the Review.I have always had good luck with Samsung Products, I have a Galaxy Note Phone and it's been great!So, it was time to replace my tablet, I had a Kindle Fire, the \"original\" release. It was a fine 7 inch tablet but it was time to upgrade and I wanted a true android operating system.I did my research and once this went on \"sale\", $50. off, I jumped. It has been GREAT! Can you Say FAST! Wow! The Quad-core processor is amazing. It's so fluid and smooth. I like how easy it is to operate and how LIGHT this tablet is considering it's a 12.2 INCH Tablet! I mean, it's not lighter than \"air\" but it's also much larger than any \"good\" tablet on the market.  :\")The freebies that come with it are a nice added bonus, but the tablet is worth every dime I paid for it and the $50. I didn't!The S Pen is great, I love the S Pen on my Galaxy Note Phone and it's even nicer on such a LARGE Screen! Great for drawing, writing, whatever you want to do with a pen, you can do with this S Pen!This tablet is so fast and responsive on Wi-Fi and makes browsing a dream. I tether at work with my phone and it works great too! The Display is amazing, best picture I have seen in a LONG time, watching movies in HD is flawless and beautiful, it's almost immersive and a bit mesmerizing. The speakers actually produce clear crisp sound in stereo or even SURROUND!  It's a pleasant experience to say the least.You are drawn in by its beautiful picture and the 12.2 inch screen is the perfect size for watching TV/movies anywhere! Great Job Samsung! This is the best product I have purchased in a long time.Honestly, for what you get, it is priced just right, it's not expensive at all for what you get. I purchased this product for fun, leisure and enjoyment. If you want a fantastic, beautiful large screen tablet, I truly think there is no reason to look further. I love Android, so it's the android of choice for me.I did not buy this product from amazon.com even though I love them, I got a better deal buying it through Costco, not on the price of the tablet mind you, same price but on the price of the extended warranty.First, you get two years of warranty on all electronics you buy from Costco, secondly, you have a NINETY Day return policy and thirdly, the extended drops spills warranty I purchased was about a fourth of the price for something comparable on amazon.com. So, that's the only reason I didn't purchase from amazon.com.I will probably update this review as time goes on, but for now, I say make the jump, you won't be sorry.For the millions that have abandoned Apple and switched to Android, if you haven't yet but are tired of Apple's overpriced antics, this would be a good first experience with Samsung and All that Android's operating system can do for you.Also, while I love my little Kindle and as I mentioned before I wanted a true Android OS, not an amazon Hybrid, I would have purchased another Kindle Fire if it had a larger Screen and it would be nice to have Google Play on Kindle Fire too! Just sayin.So, Go by this tablet, you WON'T Be Sorry! You will be Happy, like me. :\")P.S. I wanted a 90 day return policy, just in case I had buyer's remorse.  Sometimes with large ticket items, I have buyer's remorse.  I am here to tell you, that didn't and won't happen.  I am \"connected\" to this bad boy, I take it everywhere and why not, it can do ANYTHING! :\")ll be Happy, like Me. :\")", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Replaced my notebook with this tablet, really like the tablet, but....", "Author": "PSmith", "ReviewID": "R3S7OI56V8MD1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the galaxy note 10.1, 10.1 2014, and now the Note Pro 12.2, this is mostly comparing the tablet to the older versionsI really do like this tablet, compared to the 10.1 it is definitely a bigger tablet, but when you actually have it, you'll be glad you have the real estate (and the updated android!). A lot of online reviews say you wouldn't want to pull this out all the time because it's so big, and I call bologna. It's so much smaller than my laptop, and way more convenient for simple tasks, even compared to my Galaxy S4, I'd much rather pull out my tablet to watch a video or surf the web.Pros:-Even though the specs are the same, it feels a little zipier than the 10.1 2014 did, which could have something to do with the TouchWiz and Android updates.-Unparalelled multitasking compared to other tablets-Awesome battery life (this is like hour 29 of pretty frequent use, and I still have 20% ish left)-Charges faster than traditional devices on laptops/computers thanks to USB 3.0 support-Stylus! The stylus is accurate, and easy to use, and offers a lot of features on-screen.-WHat used to be just the menu button to the left of the home button is now dual purpose, click once to open a much faster and more efficient applcation quick-switch bar, with a short hold to bring up the menu, definitely a plus.Cons:-It's actually lacking a few features from the 10.1 2014, such as NFC, which I don't use often, but would be handy in transfering files from my phone to the tablet instead of using bluetooth. Given that this is the \"Next Generation Samsung Tablet\", AND the \"Pro\" series, I would expect these tablet to have more features, not less.-Price: It's $200 more for the same hardware, absent eye tracking, and no NFC. Really?! Ok, a bigger screen is cool, but is it $200 more cool? Hardly-Stylus (also a con): It's tiny, I'm going to get a Bamboo Feel stylus and just atatch it to my folio when I'm not using it, the small stylus is convenient in that it fits into the tablet, but if you want to get some serious work done or take serious notes, I'd definitely get a bigger stylus.Final Thoughts:Yes it's a big(er) tablet than all of them on the market, but once you have it in hand, it's phenominal. You can hold it in one hand, it isn't hard, the only time I don't do this is when I should be holding it with two anyways (like over my head), it's heavy, but it's bigger. If you can choke down paying an extra $200 for literally the benefit of a bigger screen, it is worth it, the screen is great, the tablet is a great size for anything you could ever need it for, and the updated software is fantastic.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Andrew S.", "ReviewID": "RO5XH3D40YOYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my note pro for a few days, being a owner of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2012, this is much better than the original note. I first got it, yes it is a big tablet, to be exact, it almost covers my HP 17\" laptop's keyboard.A side note on the S Pen- it is the same design as the note 3, however the size is different. It is a little bit longer and a little bit bulkier.When I took it out of the box, it was about 60% charged, took about 3ish hours to fully charge, and this is partially due to the processor. I charge my note 3 from completely dead to 100% in about 2.5 hours.As far as the magazine on home, I personally am not a fan of it. I like how you can swype up on the note 3 to get the magazine. The Hancom office is very useful, I now have no need to get Microsoft Office 2013 for my laptop.Speakers are better sounding on the sides, as I can also close my case and listen to music clearly. App to SD card transfer is adequate. Screen is very sharp, very clear with my live wallpaper in the background.There has been some slight problems with lag time, but I am used to it from my old note 10.1. There is a reason why I knocked it down from 5 to 4, not because of anything but the price. 850.00 is very expensive for a tablet,  as my laptop was cheaper and it has the new intel i7 processor. The starting price should be 600 for the 32GB, 700 for the 64GB. Instead of buying through amazon,  I bought directly from Samsung because they included the cover for it (extremely flimsy, not protective at all), and they didn't charge for tax (savings of about 70 dollars and change).", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bloatware and Magazine UX", "Author": "Grad Student", "ReviewID": "R3FLT3AZH073LQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a grad student and owner of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. I bought the Note Pro 12.2 for the larger screen and its integration of the Wacom stylus. My primary use for the Note 10.1 and Note Pro 12.2 is to write notes (using LectureNotes), take pictures of professors' notes on whiteboards and view PDF textbooks. I decided to trade up to the Note Pro 12.2 for the larger screen.My dream machine would be the Note Pro 12.2 with Apple OS and applications. I own many Apple products. Unfortunately, Apple products are not integrated with the Wacom stylus that I need for note taking/homework.The Cons of the Note Pro 12.2:1) a RAM hog..the background OS applications use about 45%-55% of the RAM at all times;2) slower than the Note 10.1;3) more bloatware than the Note 10.1;4) Magazine UX is limited to bloatware, social-media and selected Samsung widgets (it would be nice to have such an interface but make it completely open and customizable instead);5) the price;6) Multi-windows (i.e. split screen option) will not allow for horizontal screen split for just two windows (i.e. applications);7) difficult to compose emails using webmail as the Samsung keyboard covers up the substantially all the composition/input area;8) the camera is poor quality (only 8MP) and camera features are harder to use than the Note 10.1.The Pros of the Note Pro 12.2:1) the large screen allows for effective split window use;2) the large screen is great for reading technical textbooks.Fortunately, I had reward points and bought the Note Pro 12.2 cheaper than $750. Although the Note Pro 12.2 meets my needs of stylus note-taking and PDF textbooks, it does so marginally. I think that the Note Pro 12.2 (and the Samsung software) is too expensive for $750.

Never really cared for it and while I thought I wanted something small and portable I found myself wishing I had gotten something bigger.I currently am using a Note 3 for my phone which I absolutely love. I had been using it as an all purpose device for work to take notes during meetings and looking at excel documents. While it served it's purpose sort of. I had some problems with certain excel files and never did find an office program I was completely happy with and it was hard to take lengthy notes without a proper keyboard and while the screen is big it wasn't big enough for long lecture note taking.For me this product was a good compromise of a tablet and a laptop. The bigger screen of a laptop with the portability of a tablet. I wanted something I could use for work and for play.This thing is big though. With that being said I wanted that extra 2\" of screen real estate. For me 6' tall with longish arms and average sized hands I can comfortably cradle it in one arm and use my other hand to operate it. I also find it very easy to read and operate laying down propping it up on my leg.The display is beautiful. My only complaint is in a dark room I can see a tiny bit of bleeding at the bottom when it's first booting up. Not a deal breaker for me. Movies and games look good.I'm currently using a Note 3 with the quad core snap dragon processor and was not sure what to expect with the Octacore. I am not disappointed in the least. The system is responsive with no real noticeable lag.I love the new Magazine UX Samsung implemented with this tablet. I personally find it a refreshing change up. A lot of the reviews talked about this and it seemed to be a love it or hate it. Don't let that scare you away though the core Android system you are used to is still there. There are still home screens to customize and your standard app tray. The 4 part multi view works awesome and doesn't feel cramped and you can resize the windows.It comes with Hancom office viewer by default and you can go In and download the editor for free. By FAR the best office suite I've used on Android. I have a logitech 810 bluetooth keyboard I bought to sync to this to take notes and I had zero problems getting it to work with this and both were very responsive with no lag. Made typing up emails and word documents a breeze.The S Pen functions work great as they do on the note 3. Though I wish they had made the pen a little bigger. It's the same shape as the pen in the Note 3 but 1/8\" to 1/4\" longer and just a tad thicker personally I didn't notice much difference till I put them side by side.Battery life has been fantastic hard to say how long I have been getting on a charge because I have been playing on it non stop.The built in speakers are quite adequate in both volume and sound quality. I have a bluetooth JBL Flip speaker I usually hook up to listen to music or watch Netflix on my phone to get increased volume. And while the JBL speaker was still better for overall quality and volume I didn't find it a necessity to use like I do with my phone.Camera quality is fine though I don't plan to use it for taking pictures or video I have my phone for that. And rarely will I be using it if at all for video calls. Though the option is certainly there and does a solid job.Internal storage, I went with the 32GB model. Almost 10 gigs of that is taken up by the OS and other bloatware. The good news of course is that it takes a micro ST card so you can expand the memory without having to overpay for a tablet with more space.All in all extremely happy with this tablet. Hope this review can help someone out.Update - 3/10/14I opted to get a keyboard and mouse for this tablet. I picked up the logitech k810 keyboard and logitech t651 trackpad. Both work perfect.I have been using this tablet for a few weeks now and I thought I would update. I am actually typing up this review with my logitech keyboard from my tablet :)I have been using this tablet a lot for work. One question came up which was did it seem to much to have both a Note 3 and the 12.2 pro. I think this comes down to the user. I use sNote and Evernote quite a bit. I like that I can jot down quick notes with my phone and reorganize on my tablet later. I wish evernote had a better tablet layout but thats not samsungs fault thats evernotes fault. However with the large screen size on the tablet I can just go to the main website for Evernote and log in there which is handy.One thing I am really enjoying is reading comics on this. It's one thing I really wanted to be able to do with my Note 3 and it just didn't work. To much zooming and moving around. The screen on this thing is perfect for that and combined with the comixology app...MONEY!What have I been disappointed in? Since everything cant be 100% sunshine and rainbows. Lack of customization for the new magazine UX. Samsung pulled a bunch of the widgets for that. I didn't notice it at first because I didn't really end up using it as much as I thought I would. It wasn't till I was reading on the XDA Developer forums that I noticed this. I have noticed a bit of stutter when sliding between screens now that I have loaded up some of my apps.They could have made the icons smaller to allow more icons in a row rather than making them bigger.The only other thing I wish it had was sPlanner. I love having that widget on my Note 3 as I put everything in there and its nice to be able to slide a screen quick to get a quick glance rather than opening the app.Aside from that I am normally very quick to root my devices but am still rolling stock at the moment.I still don't regret my decision. And I liked this thing enough to dump another 100 bucks into a mouse and keyboard and another 150 for a \"man purse\" if you will that holds the tablet keyboard mouse cables and external battery backup.

If you have lead poisoning, this tablet may not be for you.- Thin- S-PenThe S-Pen is a pretty neat piece of hardware. Although you can get a stylus for any touchscreen device, the S-Pens built in software and the inclusion of detecting whether the pen is in it's craddle or out makes it just that much more useful. Utilizing Tasker and Note Buddy, for example, puts the S-Pen on another level.- Hancom OfficeJesus, this piece of software is a gem. Couldn't ask for much more from an android Word replacement.- 4 Window Split Screen & Floating Apps  * Floating apps have been around for ages including browsers and calculators, so that feature isn't very original. But the 4 window split screen is done impressively well and the 12.2 inch screen really provides the real estate to make it viable. The ability to \"pair\" apps together is particularly useful for things like email and calendar.Cons:- TouchWiz & Samsung AppsAs always, TouchWiz remains a fairly unresponsive, crashy UI. WatchON crashes constantly in the background and I've even had the entire UI process repeatedly crash on me until I hard rebooted the tablet. There's also some hitching when returning to home screens, but that's par for the course with most android devices.- PriceYeah, not much to say here.- PPIBecause of the massive screen size, the pixels per inch is significantly lower than, say, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".

However, I didn't find software app that handles pdf itself with s pen \"smoothly\" although there are some apps. I tried some apps but its not the quality I have expected. This does not mean that this tablets functionality has any issues, but it does not fit to \"my expectation\" of specific purpose. (2) there are useful apps samsung embedded. I like most of them. However, I found that when I start apps, they ask my accounts saperately, and install something blahblah. I really don't like this process. Of course, you can ask my permission on my account or information. That's fine. but, I don't want to input account information every chances I set up apps.

I think this table is the best tablet for writing. It's got a higher resolution, larger screen, and longer battery life than anything else. The tip of the stylus also has texture so it doesn't slide across the glass like the surface pro 2 stylus.It is lackluster in many ways though.-glossy screen - terrible for a screen where you have to view what's on the screen when lights are on, like somewhere you might be taking notes (meeting or classroom).-operating system - Android is wonderful, for phones. This operating was not designed for tablets. It was made for phones and modified for tablets. So a lot of basic computer functionality that has been around since the early 90s is not here. No folders in folders, you can't place icons wherever you want on the screen, most programs don't open in popup mode (windows). If you are looking for productivity, don't look here. You will spend time fighting with your system. What would take you 10 seconds on your pc can take several minutes on android, because of the various steps you have to take and not the limitations of the hardware.-no flash support - or rather semi useful flash support, when modded with Dolphin. You will have to look up how to install that. It is buggy and slow compared to other systems with similar or slower hardware.-the total lack of a tablet-based store - you want to find apps made or optimized for tablets? You'll have to google it. Many of the applications that are touted as being designed for tablets are just phone apps that run in landscape mode and look very poor. The vast majority of apps are of low quality compared to what they could be. A quick look over at what applications are available on ipad shows the potential that is being missed here. You can say there are good reasons for this problem, but reasons don't stop this problem from existing. You need to understand how bad the android app store is for tablets. We shouldn't have to sift through piece of garbage after piece of garbage to find software that is decent. The android store needs to have a tablet section and it needs to be curated. A base minimum of specs need to be established and developed for. There are a few wonderful gems out there that really showcase what could be possible on android. Just a few though. I don't have the time to do android's job for them. Some people like to customize and search and test for hours on end. I don't have the time for that.I returned the tablet and I will not be purchasing android again until they've resolved these issues.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would be a great tablet, but external SD card writing capability is crippled", "Author": "Ken L.", "ReviewID": "RPS5RQK57M6OK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very happy with the graphics and speed of this tablet. With power saving mode on and using thmenu system is easy to use and chock Full of Features too. I misht be bold to say, this Suite turnse tablet moderately, with a variety of apps, I was able to get more than 10 hours out of the battery. I was mainly inside, so I was able to use the tablet with a lot lower screen brightness than I would if I had been outside. This will make a difference, and in this case the tablet will not yield 10 hours.The main disappointment, of this tablet, and my , main reason of giving the tablet 3 stars, is the fact that external SD card storage capability is greatly diminished due to its use of Android 4.4. The only apps that will be able to save our modify data on the external  SD card are pre installed applications.  So the stock camera, Hancom Office Suite, etc., will work. If you install a custom camera,  or any thing else from Google play,  at the time of this writing, you cannot save data,  or move the apps to SD card.  You can however,  still read from the SD card.  Any modified files will have to be saved to the internal storage.  I don't like this restriction,  and I can't possible see any good coming out of it. If you rely heavily on SD card usage,  do not buy this tablet.  If however,  you can get by with the roughly 22GB of storage you have left after installing Hancom Office,  then it shouldn't be a problem. People might say to blame Google, and not let this affect the product rating,  but this limitation affects my experience, and Samsung and other manufacturers should pressure Google into fixing this!Speaking of Hancom Office, when you get your new tablet, it comes with the Hancom viewer pre-installed,  but you must install the applications to be able to edit and create documents. I can't speak for everyone,  but the download,  install,  and updates took a very long time;  several hours. I was not on a slow connection,  my home router is an AC one which this tablet utilizes very well.  Although you must manually download the application,  you are still able to save and modify files on the SD card. One last note on this is that you may manage the Hancom updates through the included Hancom Office Updater, but it is not managed through Google play or Samsung Apps.Hancom Office is the best Android MS Office replacement I've tried.  Beats all the others, hands down.  I don't want to do a full review on this application as you can go to YouTube and watch hands on videos of it, but I will tell you it has many of the features Word,  Excel,  and PowerPoint have, and by default, saves files in these formats. I'm a heavy user of Excel,  and it was hard to find an Excel formula that wasn't recognized. With word, you have access to shapes, etc. which the other office replacements don't even come close to having.have access to shapes, pictures, fonts, Formatting, etc. which the other office replacements don't even come close to having. The menu system is easy to use and chock Full of Features too. I might be bold to say, this suite turns this tablet into a productive mobile office. It might not have all the features You need, but it's real close.As with all Galaxy Note products, this tablet comes with the S-Pen which works very well.  The integrated handwriting to text application is very accurate too.  I have sloppy handwriting and it recognizes my handwriting better than Swype does.  Of course, Swype is much faster,  but for those who like to write \"Old School\", you will be fascinated.  I only wish you could control the pause delay time,  because I wind up making mistakes when I pause for a second,  because the text moves to the left side of the screen before I'm done writing.  It's not a big deal,  but I'd like more control over that. What's really cool is that when you install an additional language,  the handwriting to text engine recognizes the words of the currently selected language,  not just English.The Sketchbook Pro  app included pre-installed is very awesome if you are an artist.  Checkout Youtube, and search for \" Galaxy Note 12.2 Sketchbook Pro\". Even if you're not an artist it's still awesome anyway.0verall, I would recommend this tablet to anyone without the need of saving data to the external from user installed applications, or attempting to move apps to ext.

The Kindle app is one of the most difficult for an Android device to run in my experience, and the app (and all apps) runs very smoothly, with none of the glitches and lagginess found on less powerful Android tablets.If you're considering this tablet, it's because you're willing to pay a premium for a honking huge screen and a strong processor.  I'd say it's worth the price on that basis.  I've found little to complain about.  I'm using the ZAGG keyboard cover - an external keyboard makes this an excellent laptop replacement.

I bought is as an office productivity lap-top replacement for my 81-year old mother, who has never used mobile touch technology.  DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS.  This is still Android, and even if file management, etc. is a little more convenient than iOS, it\u2019s a tablet.  To print a photo, you have to got out of the gallery, open a printing app, find the picture again, and go through many touch-steps (like a dozen touches) to choose all the options.  Compared to a PC, it\u2019s a bear.  And for my 81-year-old non-techno mom to learn this?  Forget it!  That alone would take forever to teach her.  But every basic PC function she\u2019s used to, other than Chrome, is that much more complicated.Hword margins are in mm, not inches.  (Maybe there\u2019s a way to change it, but if so, it\u2019s non-intuitive).  The fonts are better than most Android WP apps, but limited compared to Word.  There is no way to print non-gmail emails from any printing apps I tried.  (Google only wants you to use Gmail, I guess.)  And let\u2019s face it \u2013 mobile operating systems were never designed to DO the data management and manipulation which Windows or Mac OS do so naturally.  Mobile devices are still computer ACCESSORIES, designed primarily for communication and media consumption.  Of course, they do many things a computer CAN\u2019T DO.
