This was on sale at HHGregg for $46 right before Christmas.  We knew this was not a main e-reader in the market but thought it was worth the gamble.Like most of you we tried to get it to run in the Android market.  It needs to be rooted to do this so we purchased an sd card and I was ready to dive in to begin to root it, UNTIL I found a tip in an forum to use Amazon instead. VIOLA!! I went into my Amazon account, downloaded the Amazon App and that was it!  I was able to add a free texting program, Angry birds, and many other apps from the Amazon market for FREE.So if you HAVE to have the Android Play app, go right ahead and root your tablet, or take the much easier route and use the App market here, go into the Android store and do the same thing without the hassle.We're loving it!", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "don't worry - help is on the way!", "Author": "David Fliegelman", "ReviewID": "R3MOP4XBMKT97J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have three of these I bought from hh Gregg. They work perfectly if you get the lt 7033 \"D\". Here's the diff. If you order the \"d\", it is already rooted. Just go into the settings menu, tick \"allow apps from outside sources\"  (paraphrased) say who cares to the warning (because, who cares), wander over to Amazon and download their market app, and use it to get Google Play Store. Scamouche' you're there!  The whole thing takes less than 10 minutes!  If you would like step by step instructions (?) Go to the XDA Developers website/bulletin board and search the klu lt 7033 \"d\" and the 2nd and 3rd postings on the page walk you through it.Great tab. Great value. Plus it's rooted. That means you are in command, own it, and can do what you please.  Better , faster processor than the I-pad mini. Nice build quality (much better than lt7052, for instance), great features, and being rooted you can download \"ROM manager\" and delete a lot of the crapplets you are stuck with on non-rooted tabs. This speeds it up. You can also change the launcher to a GO or ADW launcher or even change the mod to something even lower in \"overhead\" like \"cyanogenmod\", \"laytveyit\" , or \"ImUI\" for less overhead and more speed!  I am tweaking on #3 that I am bringing to my friend in the Netherlands. I have been burning all 3 in side by side as I add identical features.

I was surprised at how well it works.  Using the amazon app store is easy, fast downloads and haven't had major trouble with the apps yet (some restarts but not a big deal to me).  I think it's worth it if you want an inexpensive tablet for minor uses (I wouldn't watch a movie on it but it's easier to read web pages vs my iPhone).", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "Robert Winterode", "ReviewID": "R1HB3VT06Z72WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is on a Curtis klu LT7035-j 4.1 jellybean tablet 4G expandable to 32G sd card .
