{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Forget The Big Red Fruit", "Author": "J. R. O. Neal \"Islidur\"", "ReviewID": "R2TEVTJ5Z1XFBO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome tablet. Extremely powerful and versatile. Some purists will say the display isn't up to par, but that's ridiculous. This is a stunning display even if it falls short of the highest pixel count available. The performance is better than the iPad 3, it's a beautiful device and it offers the unique ability to pop into a keyboard base and \"transform\" into a laptop. Combine that with it' s low price and Apple is outdone and forgotten. Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself. Ease of use, convenience, portability and awesome power make it a better option for me than my laptop.The unit is made of plastic, but it's very sturdy and I feel it will last quite a while, I did order a leather case for it though. As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says. I have poor eyesight, but I can clearly read the screen even with full sun shining on it. I tested the GPS with the unit tethered to my iPhone and it works flawlessly. Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there. There are litterally too many features on this tablet to list individually and I know I haven't even found all of them yet. So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up. I think this is a problem with ICS and will probably be fixed with the next update. Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy. I was constantly hitting backspace while writing lengthy messages because it would misspell (even though I hit the right key) and would put spaces in the middle of some words. I haven't tried the Google keyboard yet because I decided to just use the dock from now on for long messages.One more note. I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released. The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon. But, it's good enough now for us to thoroughly enjoy these tablets and has given me a reason to ditch our iPhones and go with Samsung Galaxy S's as well.UpdateHaving spent an extended amount of time with the tablet, I've got a few observations.First, there is some light bleed on the screen edges, but under normal circumstances it's not noticable.Second, on top of shutting down occassionally the browser is very slow to extremely slow. I believe this is more an Android issue than a tablet issue and I hope it will be corrected with an update.Third, the tablet has 3 performance settings. Initially, I left it on the default balanced setting. I've discovered that MANY times video will not play unless I switch to the high performance setting. I've decided to just leave it on the higher setting and sufffer the battery drain.Fourth, for some reason, you cannot use a usb extension cable. It won't work for power or data with any cable extention. This is dissapointing as I'd like to sit on the couch and charge at the same time, but the stock cable is too short.I still believe it's a great tablet and will only get better with software updates, but right now it suffers from glitchy, slow apps and OS. I've dropped my review by 1 star due to the software issues.UPDATE***I've spent many months with the tablet and thought I'd share my thoughts now.The new JB upgrade and subsequent upgrades to that have really helped. The keyboard works great now. For the browser, I switched to Chrome and have had no issues, just have to go to the stock browser for flash related content. Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use. And, about another 5 hours if I add the dock, very good in my opinion. A user commented about the extension USB issue and rightly informed me that it has to be USB 3.0, I was using a 2.0 cable.I use the tablet every day and it has become a necessary part of life. I use Kingfsoft office for word docs and spreadsheets, scribble pad for notes to myself and during meetings, play games, do email, take videos, navigation, weather, etc. I've also installed Splashtop on my PC so I can do remote desktop, works great.It's still the best Android tablet availible at this price point and will be a viable option for some time.I like the tablet so much, I bought one to give away to one of my employees during my company Christmas party. The lucky winner is very happy.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything I dreamed it would be!", "Author": "Katherine G. Carr", "ReviewID": "R23OYHLBN0PPMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my TF300 a few days ago and I love it! I really wanted to wait for the Transformer Pad Infinity because of the nicer screen and the metal casing, but for $200 less, I felt that the TF300 would be a great deal and it is! I haven't tried to use the tablet outside, but inside the screen is bright and crisp - I have zero complaints about it.Some of the best things about this tablet:*It's able to run Flash programs*Full keyboard dock*customizability (Apple doesn't want you messing with anything except maybe where you put the apps on the screen)*The ability to print on most printers using Google Cloudprint (Apple airprint lets you print on certain printers, but the list is short)*Comes with Polaris Office (like Microsoft office and compatible with office and excel and power point)*Much more compatible with a PC*You can remotely control your PC using this tablet (really cool!)*Way more apps than I thought there would be with all the hype about Apple's App Store having more - I have an iPhone and so I know there are gazillions of choices there, but if I didn't know better, I wouldn't have noticed the difference.* You can use your PC to download apps directly to the TF300 without connecting it or anything.*There's a widget you can use to kill all the running apps to save battery power.As for the unit itself, it feels nice in my hands - the plastic doesn't feel chintzy, but I have nothing to compare it to. The touch screen is very responsive, the apps and browsing are fast and smooth (even with some really cool live wallpapers running in the background).So far, I have no complaints at all. Part of me still wants the Infinity just because it will have some things that are really cool, but I'm not sure they are worth $200 extra when the insides of the two are pretty much the same.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I have so much love to give :-( REVISED AGAIN", "Author": "Mikec717", "ReviewID": "R8OJCZE9LZ12F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3:  Please check each individual section in my \"PRIOR REVIEW\" for updates on those particular items.  I will do one more small update later.UPDATE 2:  This is just a short update just to let everyone that the replacement TF300 has for all extensive purposes been a home run.  This is the tablet I wanted to love and it keeps giving me reasons to love it more.  I will do a more in depth update later in the next few days but for now just let me say BUY THIS TABLET.  I'm very happy I just got a defective unit the first time around.  No strike 2 for ASUS.  I'll leave my prior review in place just in case someone gets a tab that was doing the same thing.UPDATE 1:  Just to keep those interested in buying up to date.  ASUS responded very quickly to my review (see comments) and after a few emails back and forth they also think I have a faulty tablet.  For those interested I'll post some excerpts in the comments, I do go into a bit more detail on some of the errors.PRIOR REVIEW:Well, I'll get right to it.  I want to LOVE this tablet.  I did a lot of research and knew this was it for me.  I received my tablet and started putting it through the paces.  All was well for about a week, then it started rebooting over and over again.  First it was rebooting after every song on Pandora.  So I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it.  Ok, problem solved.  Not quite.  Angry Birds Space froze, tablet rebooted.  Now I'm getting suspicious.  Pandora made it reboot.  EVERYTHING made it reboot.  Keep in mind all this was yesterday that it got all kooky.  I am on the latest firmware.  I did a cold boot (power off, unplugged, power button+volume down) and was hoping for the best.  Nope.  Getting my google play on and then silence.  Look at the tablet and it's rebooting.  So I start opening apps to test again.  I open Dolpin Browser, Gallery, Super Note, and My Library, all but one come PREINSTALLED on the tablet.  I go to open Pandora and don't even get to touch the icon before it's rebooting again.  So I want to run that scenario, open the same apps, it's fine.  I have the tab in the keyboard dock and I go to open Netflix.  The screen goes to portrait then back to landscape and nothing happens.  So I say screw it and put Google play back on again.  I let it play over night, it did not restart, but the music did pause.  Fine.  I hit play in the morning and like 15 seconds in it restarts.  I am returning this tablet and hoping it's just a defective unit.  From the reviews it sounds it is.  But I will make some comments on how it was when it did work.DisplayPeople say it's not as nice as the new IPAD.  Well it's not, IPAD is a premium unit sold at a premium price.  I'm not gonna compare a Hyundai to a high end Mercedes.  Is a super duper HD screen really worth THAT much more?  Not for me.  Compare the Transformer Infinity to the IPAD.  That said, the screen is great.  Reading books is no problem, my pictures look awesome, games look very detailed.  LITTLE bit of bleeding on the bottom (landscape) but as others have stated, only on black back grounds and really it doesn't take away from anything.  It's not burn your eyes out bright as the Prime, but it's plenty bright.  At home I usually keep it at 50%, in my office I might max it out, but in my defense 3 of my 4 walls are windows really so I get a lot of sunlight in here.  It's plenty bright.  I sort of think we've all been pampered and spoiled by gorgeous screens and I can honestly say this is one is just that.  It's just not super duper IPS HDx400.  Stop, it's great, plenty good, especially for the price.  I've thrown some HD video at it looks awesome.  And I'm a little snobby when it comes to these things, I'm happy with the display.  It's also (when it works) very responsive out of box.UPDATE:  Not much to add to this.  I still feel it's plenty bright for the average person.  Resolution is fine, HD video looks great.  HD games and apps look great.  Non-HD apps are a little pixelated but that's not a display issue, that's an android issue because (and apple does do this better) not every app is made to be displayed on tablets.  Great, solid screen that is very responsive.  Really my only gripe is a gripe about ALL tablets is that they are finger print magnets.  I was given a stylus that I thought I would never use, but I gotta admit that I love the thing.  Since I use it so much it sort of solved the finger print issue.PerformanceMeh, can't comment on this until I get the replacement unit.  It started off pretty snappy and just fell apart.  Graphic intensive games were nothing to it.  No lag at all.  My bigger problems were the simple things which is kind of odd.  I do love the option of low consumption, balanced, and performance.  You can change between them quickly and there is a definite difference in battery life (and performance).  I don't need 5 cores to do most things, i'm usually on balanced and it (when it works) was plenty fast.  I think my unit is defective so I'll hold off on this part.UPDATE:  Now I can comment on this.  GREAT tablet.  This will probably be one of the most important sections for most so I'll try to be thorough.  I'll break this up into subcategories to make it easy.MULTITASKING UPDATE:  This beast is amazing.  Let me take you through a normal day.  I get to the office and throw on streaming music or put a movie for back ground noise.  I gotta prep for some meetings on Evernote, review some documents on Google Drive.  Meeting time.  We have a lot of internal documents in pdf, no problem with ezPDF reader (two bucks, buy it) where I can pull it up and ohhh look at that, yes I am annotating the pdf file with my own notes, text, drawings and pictures. I work at a large facility, someone in the meeting just asked about a certain area of our property.  it's Maps time!  I remove my tablet from the keyboard dock (which always is met by a look of surprise, then \"oh how cool\" then questions about the tablet) and scroll smoothly from side to side and zoom in and out with no problem (AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FAST WIFI!!!).  Another question and I have to look at a website for a quick answer (like I said in the internet browsing, it's not that bad, just not a desktop experience on the speed) and now they ask to see some pictures, up comes the gallery where my pictures render quickly (performance mode is your friend, ladies and gents).  Another question that I know can be better explained with a youtube video and back to my notes.  Is Thursday good for a follow up meeting?  Let me pull up my calendar....how were your numbers last year for this....let me open the file manager and pull up my excel sheets.  I do not close any of this stuff down and only once has maps frozen and shut down.  I do this almost every day to that extent and do not close apps between all this bouncing around.  It handles it with out breaking a sweat.  This machine is a multitasker.  Quad-core?  Yes please!PERFORMANCE GAMES UPDATE:  I did not purchase this tablet to play games.  That said, holy jesus I love playing games on this thing.  Your normal Android game (i.e. angry birds, Fruit Ninja, Ninja Chicken, TnT, Temple Run, Brave Temple Run, TripleTown (I saw the cutesy graphics and was going to bail, 3 minutes later I'm buying this insanely addictive game) all look and run beautiful.  The graphic intensive games that should show off the processor might does just that.  Max Payne, NOVA 3, Six Guns, ShadowGun and Biohazard 4 (korean only release, I don't know what the hell is going on in it) all look great, run smooth, and do it all with a high frame rate.  I did have Shadow Gun shut down on me when I connected it to my 50' panasonic along to my PS3 controller, but that was after I played it for about half an hour with no problems, turned it off, and went to play it again.  That was yesterday and I haven't tried again.  I'm getting used to playing the higher end games on the tablet, it was a little weird at first with out a controller.  I'm still a little clunky at it but I'm guessing I just need to practice.  Overall I'd say the tablet has exceeded my expectations on the game front.Internet BrowsingAt times it's brilliant, but it's buggy. (right as I wrote that my tablet restarted...again with pandora)  Anyways, not the smoothest web experience.  But i think that will get better.  My personal experience is that Chrome Beta seems to be the most unstable, it shuts down a lot.  Dolphin seems pretty good as does the stock browser.  I honestly have not put in enough time browsing the web to make a fair judgement on this.UPDATE:  I think this Internet Browsing might be the weakest thing about Android (not this tablet, it's really more of a software problem)  It's not as good as desktop browsing, but it's a pretty new OS so there's going to be a lot of improvement on this front.  It's not awful by any means, but it's just not that normal desktop experience.  Some sites load just fine, no problem at all.  Others that are flash heavy or have videos tend to take a bit too long to load.  Nothing unbearable mind you, but definitely has room for improvement.  But I might not have the right browser.  I mainly use the stock browser.  Haven't used Dolphin HD much, the chrome browser (beta) was god awful and unstable, and Firefox just came out and I have not tried that out yet.SoundNot bad, not oh my god amazing, but not bad.  I watched Iron Man 2 on netflix with my Onkyo system hooked up to it, it did surround sound pretty damn well actually.  Didn't really expect that.  With out assistance I would say the sound is above average.  It's actually damn loud with Ninja Chicken.UPDATE:  I use it in my office all the time, no problem hearing music or movies over the stupidly loud AC.  I use headphones a lot, they sound good.  I would like an equalizer but that's a software thing and I'm sure there's on in the market place, haven't looked.  But really that should be standard for any OS.  I also connect it for music and movies to my Sound System and it sounds epic.  Don't expect to put this thing as your sound source for your party or anything like that.  One somewhat big gripe is the speaker placement is stupid.  If I'm holding the speaker landscape laying a game like NOVA 3 I cover the damn speaker with my hand.  Why ASUS put two speakers on one side of the flippin' thing is beyond me.  The speaker quality itself isn't bad though and the placement is more of an annoyance than an actual problem.MEDIA PLAYBACK UPDATEMusic:  No problem.  I use Winamp myself and have had no problems.Moves:  Ahhh!  Here's where this beautiful creature shines.  First, as stated several times in this review, get the MX PLAYER.  It's awesome.  HD looks great.  The intro to Dark Knight, Hugo, Final Fantasy Advent Children and African Cats all made me give a little \"wow\" and I was playing them.  But it's not just HD that look good.  I threw Batman the Animated series and Batman beyond on this tablet and was a kid again watching them with no problem.  I've thrown a lot of formats at it, avi, mp4, mkv (my personal favorite), mpg, all play no problem.  The only thing that makes it jam up a bit is the M2TS which I actually never heard of until recently.  Aside from that all video files have played back with no problems.HDMI Playbackit pretty much mirrors what's on your tab.  Looked good but subtitles are a bit of a let down.  Playing netflix movies subtitled will not display on screen.  It'll show the movie on your TV but the subtitles only show up on the tablet.  There's technical reasons for this having to do with HDMI, but it's disappointing because in my situation (my wife has english as a second language) it really does help.  Other than that the quality is good and the sound does carry through the HDMI in case anyone was wondering.UPDATE:  Loving the HDMI playback.  No stutter, no slow down.  I have quickly amassed a large digital library and it's great.  Picture and sound are not problem.  The subtitle thing for NETFLIX is a no go, but when playing a movie from your tablet on MX PLAYER (highly recommended) the subs on that show up just fine on the TV.  I go into more detail on this in the comments section.WeightYou don't really realize how much a pound is until you are holding it for a while.  I'm ok with it, my wife on the other hand did complain after a short while that it was a little heavy.  I think it's fine, you'll really get tired holding pretty much anything for a while.UPDATE:  After a few weeks I think I'm just used to this thing, weight doesn't bother me at all.  I can and do hold it for long periods of time.  My wife hasn't complained about it again either so I think she's on the same boat.BuildIt feels sold, keyboard dock does too.  Not poor quality at all.  I actually like that it's a littler thicker than the prime, it makes it more comfortable.  There is such a thing as too thin sometimes.  (And my tablet rebooted again, just FYI, this time with google play)UPDATE:  Ah hell, I dropped it.  It did have a case on it but parts were exposed.  It got dinged up a bit because it was right onto asphalt, but it took it with minimal physical damage.  Probably would have dented an aluminum housing, it was sort of a rough drop.  But it's fine and very happy with the build quality thus far.BatteryGreat battery.  Tablet with keyboard dock lasts me about a day and a half of fair usage, streaming music (as I keep trying to do), playing games, reading documents, always connected to wifi, brightness at full in my office, multi-tasking.UPDATE:  I use the thing a lot and almost exclusively on performance mode (I paid for all those cores, I'm gonna bloody well use them).  I do try to adjust the brightness to my surroundings (more proof that it's plenty bright) and keep the GPS and bluetooth off.  After a day at work with me, games, movies, and streaming music I usually have about 30% left.  Once it was at 23%, never has it died on me.  I do have it in the keyboard dock most of the time.  I don't need it to go 3 days with out charging.  I am confident that if I had a super long flight or something that if I turned off the unnecessary items (wifi, gps, bluetooth, etc) and adjusted the screen brightness I can get between 12-15 hours out of the tab with dock and probably about 10 hours tab alone.  For my personal needs it's more than enough.WifiNo problems with wifi.  two seconds to find and connect to my home network.  My work network is hidden.  I just punched in the info and away I was.  I have not done speed tests yet but I will with the second unit.  I have fios so it should be interesting.UPDATE:  No problems at all.  Good range, stays connected.  Fast downloads.  Just used the speedtest dot net app and I red lined download at 20284 kbps and upload at 18317 kbps.UPDATE EXPANDABILITY:  Yet another area where this tablet absolutely murders the IPAD.  On the tab alone I ordered (have not received) a 32GB micro SD card.  For the keyboard dock I have already slammed in a 64 GB SD card and I can equal that in USB flash drive at a reasonable price.  But I have an 80 GB ipod that has a busted something or other and I get no sound.  Kind of useless to me...or is it?  Yup, reformatted and plugged in via USB port...HELLO EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE!  Also had a spare 80GB macbook drive that I reformatted and it read it no problems.  So let's do some math.  32GB internal+32 Micro SD+64 GB SD Card in dock+80 GB external drive=208 GB.  Suck it IPAD, suck it.Final thoughtsThis tablet is filled with potential and I really really hope it's just a defective unit.  Android has come along ways and ICS is great.  Still has it's bugs, but I think it'll give iOS a run for it's money sooner rather than later.  Don't be cheap, by the keyboard, it's really handy and good build.  Easy to type on (and I type pretty fast).  I'll hopefully be changing my rating to 5 stars with the second unit.  Any questions or tests you would like comments on just leave a comment.  I'll get to them when I get my new tablet in hopefully the very near future.  By the way, exchanging on amazon is painless.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Until Asus works out several bugs, there are better tablet choices", "Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R2NGT7PK0T2EVP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Tablet!", "Author": "threeofsix", "ReviewID": "R1QPSHVIRKGAKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my tablet for about a week now, and can say I'm very pleased with the device! I was happy to find that it has nearly the same specs as the Prime, but is priced at $100 cheaper. Personally, I've found the screen brightness to be just fine and the speed to be very impressive. I do wish there was flash on the back-side camera, but I don't expect to be using my tablet as a camera very heavily.Other users have had complaints about \"light bleeding\". I haven't found this an issue at all on mine, and I'm usually one to notice these things. After watching a video of someone showing this light bleeding, I took the tablet into a dark room to look for it and it does show up...if you really look for it. Now this has been a more serious problem for some users, but I haven't had any problems here. On the other hand, I have noticed that the colors don't seem to be quite as vibrant as on my PC or my Evo 4G, although this isn't a very significant difference. The picture is very crisp, and I don't have any complaints here.I'd also like to comment on the speaker quality. I was very, very impressed. Honestly, I think this thing has better speaker quality than my laptop, and can go to higher volumes. On the other hand, however, the speakers are placed both on the right side, removing any stereo separation. Really, it's hard to tell whether there are two speakers or just one amazing speaker. Either way, I still found the quality very impressive.Although it is slightly heavier and thicker than the Prime, it certainly doesn't feel like a bulky device by any means. Even at thicker than the Prime, it's still only 9.9mm thick (thinner than the Evo 4G at a *massive* 13mm thick!). And, the weight is still less than the Acer tablets.I tested the microphone with Skype, and it seems to work well. Of course it's not anything like a headset microphone, but as far as built in microphones go this does the job. I haven't tested video calls yet, but the pictures I've taken with the front facing camera look as good as any other device I've used.The plastic finish is very solid. Now this is my first tablet, and I haven't played with the aluminum tablets to compare with. But, most laptop and phone cases are plastic and this case is just as sturdy as any other, so I see no reason to have anything different here.For game players out there, you'll be really pleased with the gaming performance of the tablet. I've installed probably 3 dozen games and have been quite impressed with the performance. In fact, I can't play 3D games on my Evo 4G anymore because I've come to realize how terrible its framerate is. Unfortunately, Tegra 3 optimized games are new and still a bit buggy, but they're getting better every day. If you're looking to show off the gaming performance, I'd recommend Riptide GP or Dark Meadow.The battery strength has been decent. It lasts about one day through heavy use (reading/writing emails, gaming, watching videos, web browsing, and downloading).Overall, the TF300 has some strong pros, and a few (relatively insignificant in my opinion) cons.Pros:- Very fast, the 1.2GHz Tegra 3 handles everything without issue.- Ice Cream Sandwich runs very quickly and smoothly- The speakers are ridiculously good- The picture is crisp- Expandable microSD card slot, plus a microHDMI out and Bluetooth- Strong and consistent WiFi and GPS reception- Still light and sleek, even if not as much so as the PrimeCons:- No flash on back camera- Screen colors aren't as vibrant- The speakers are close together, removing stereo separation- Tablet and/or Tegra 3 optimized apps are still relatively new", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Pad TF300. Good hardware, shady software.", "Author": "Ronnie \"Ronnie\"", "ReviewID": "R151KD3FYAZH8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Transformer TF300 disappointed me a bit. It wasn't the hardware but the software that was disappointing. The TF300 does indeed have great specs and its benchmark performance is high. Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently. My tablet suffers from random unresponsiveness and lag when browsing the web,  running certain apps or multitasking. I get the option to close the browser/app or wait for it to respond. Usually, right after selecting the \"wait\" option, it becomes responsive again. Using a different browser to at least remedy the web experience only makes it worse. Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly. A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem. These issues are unacceptable for a next gen tablet with such good specs. However, the tablet is still new in the market and I expect Asus to patch these issues in the near future.I'm very pleased with the TF300's hardware and construction. Yes. You're going to get a plastic shell. This isn't Asus' Prime series and it's not an iPad. This is the Asus Transformer TF300 and sacrifices had to be made in order for the company to sell it at a lower price than it's competitors. Fortunately for the buyer, the TF300 doesn't sacrifice too much to keep its low price tag. If you compare it to its more expensive predecessors, it actually gains in some areas.In conclusion, the TF300's performance is held back by it's poor implementation of software. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by software updates. I'll be keeping my TF300 because I'm hopeful that these issues will be patched and, once they are, I'll be one very happy consumer.P.S. Would you like to see your problems fixed? We can ALL help get these and other issues fixed faster by letting ASUS know. Contact them via their webpage and tell them what's wrong. The process is very easy and they do listen. I did it:)UPDATE (5/14/12)I received a reply from ASUS concerning my tablet's issues.  They recommended a factory reset followed by a cold boot.  I did as they recommended and the tablet did in fact become more stable.  Occasionally,  I'll still get an unresponsive browser.  This mostly happens if I try to scroll the page before it fully loads so it doesn't bother me. Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.  This is no big deal as the games only need to be patched up.  There is,  however, one persistent issue that drives me mad.  Sometimes,  for no apparent reason, the browser will close by it self. I'll make sure to follow up with ASUS about this.Update (5/24/12)ASUS released an update for the TF300 on May 10th 2012. First of all, I would like to mention that this firmware update fixes the FLICKER issue that some of us have experienced. Since the update, I've also noticed a better web experience. However, I still suspect that the WiFi receiver is kinda weak. Also, it could still use some more tweaking. You can look over the fixes provided by the firmware on ASUS website. If your tablet didn't update automatically (mine didn't) do so manually under Settings/About Tablet/System Firmware Update. I'm raising the rating from three stars to four stars because of the current fixes and ASUS' quick response to consumer complaints.

I bought the Transformer Prime and would have loved it, but the Wi-Fi issues were as bad as everyone says. It is a shame, because other than that, it was a great looking tablet and I loved everything else about it. I returned the Prime for an iPad 3 and was really not happy with it at all. I had the 1st gen iPad and loved it because it was it was new and different. The New iPad felt like the same exact product with a crisper screen. A week after buying the New iPad I heard of this being released and returned the iPad immediately. I ordered this off Amazon and had to wait a week for it to ship due to grouping it with other items that were not in stock. Best decision I could have made. This tablet is really fantastic.The TF Pad 300 is basically the same as the Prime, but the Wi-Fi works. I don't care about the camera not having a flash, that is what my camera and Galaxy Nexus are for. There is the occasional hiccup while browsing, but I have found that using the task manager widget that comes preinstalled by Asus resolves this issue every time. I also have widgets on every screen that are updating constantly (weather, email, Facebook, twitter, G+, etc.) I am sure this is the cause. I have tested this by removing all widgets and just placing app icons on the screen (like the iPad) and the performance improved greatly. However, I love the customization with the widgets, so I just run the task killer occasionally to fix it.I also bought the keyboard dock. I have used it a bit with the keyboard dock and it works very well. I do not see myself using the keyboard a lot, but I like having it if I want to type a lengthy email or document.  Also is great for long trips due to increased battery life. I will write a separate review for the dock.Also, if you do buy this, or any Android tablet for that matter, be sure to download Tablified Market from the Play store. It finds apps in the Play store that are created specifically for Android tablets. Trust me there are a lot more than you think there are. I do not know why Google has not implemented a tablet apps section in the Play store yet; it might really help their sales of Android tablets.Also, playing NES and PlayStation ROMs is awesome. These are bit trickier to install on a tablet than a phone, but you can do it easily with ASTRO manager from the Play store.Pros:Great looking screenCustomizationPolaris OfficeUSB ports (Dock only)Micros SD slot (Up to 32 gig)Keyboard dock (Sold separately)Useful widgetsTegrazone (Games are fantastic)Ease of setupPriceCons:No flash on camera (If you care about that sort of thing, I don't)Placement of power button (Top left)Semi-Con:BLOATWARE - There are quite a bit of preinstalled apps and widgets on this table. However, I am not adding as a con, because frankly, most of them have turned out to be very useful. Also, most of them can be removed. You definitely want to keep the following BLOATWARE MyCloud (8 free gigs of storage, MyLibrary and MyNet, Polaris Office, Nvidia Tegrazone.)I hope this helps those of you that are on the fence.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problems, but nice overall", "Author": "Steve H.", "ReviewID": "R6RC73K6ALXW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay.  I had a Nexus 7...bumped it into the toilet...DOA.  After tasting Android 4.1 on a tablet and loving it (that tablet was great, btw), I decided to go with ASUS again (despite horrible customer service once) and get this because it also has Android 4.1 (you'll have to upgrade using your wi-fi when you open it up, it comes with 4.0.3 on it.  The upgrade took it to 4.1.1...UPDATE:  Now updated to 4.2.2 in the US).The tablet is pretty nice and comes with some nice additions, most notably, a well integrated version of Splashtop Remote 2.0 which controls my PC perfectly!.  The screen is beautiful.  The machine runs things pretty well...once they get going.  Clicking on the clock takes you to all of the quick settings I would want.  Brilliant little interface tweak there.  (This interface tweak is now optional with the new Android 4.2 update...it now has two drop down bars on the top of the screen...stock Android 4.2...it gives you the option to keep the 4.1 interface if you prefer).Here's the issue:  LAG!  This thing gets laggy and misses touch presses too much.  It really detracts from the experience (but it also registers when your hand is close, even when you don't touch it).  You might be happier with the Nexus instead which was really smooth without a single issue.  Maybe the lag is noticeable because I switched from the Nexus 7?  Who knows.  (UPDATE:  I can now say that, with the Android 4.2 update, I no longer worry about the lag.  This baby screams.)I did a bunch of research and it's a common problem complained about online.  I found a solution that seemed to help a bit:  Completely factory wipe the machine 3 times and start over.  That seemed to clear up the laggy nature of this machine...UNTIL...I installed Swiftkey X Tablet on it.  Then the lag came back.  Now, I've used Swiftkey on three other phones AND the Nexus 7, and had no problems with it.  The stock keyboard on this tablet is TERRIBLE.  Can't decide if I want to stay with this tablet or not because I LOVE Swiftkey and HATE the on-screen display on this machine.  *UPDATE*:  No longer applicable with subsequent software upgrades.As for ASUS, they make rock solid PC parts, so I was thinking this would rock.  A little disappointing.  Do yourself a favor and get something a little nicer or save money and get a Nexus 7.  BTW...I called ASUS twice about my damaged Nexus 7 and, of the two calls, one guy was great, the other was a complete pain in the rear...antogonistic, belittling, and didn't want to do the work.  He demanded a serial number for my Nexus before he could \"help\" me, when I read it to him, he replied, \"that's not a serial number\" and refused to help me.  Told me to go back to the store I bought it from.  I called Google and they verified the serial number and called ASUS with me on the line.  That call had great, helpful service.  I wish I knew who was the pain.  I couldn't catch his name because the line was so scratchy (on every call to ASUS!).  If you need service, this is something to be wary of.UPDATE:  After my last wipe and reinstall of everything.  The lag has not been noticeable.  It's running pretty smoothly.  Not exactly the most user-friendly thing to do out of the box.  Interestingly, after the factory wipe and reset, the set-up screens changed from the ASUS setup to the stock Android set-up.  Very odd.  Overall, I am now happy with this purchase and am upgrading the review from 3 to 4 stars.By the way, something to consider:  The keyboards are hard to find in red (I got a red tablet) and, when you do find them, they cost $20 more than white or blue.  Do yourself a favor and get this in white or blue.  I'm going to get a white keyboard to go with the red tablet.  Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.  It works really well and thumb drives pop right up, just like in Windows, when you pop one in.  Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!  Be warned that you will have to use only chargers exclusively designed for this tablet.  Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).  This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.  Just a helpful tip for those that may have or buy one of these.***UPDATE*** 3/4/2013:  Just installed the Android 4.2 update to this thing and it rocks!

This tablet has a faster processor, better camera, and more RAM.  Does an iPad run a little smoother yes but keep in mind that Apple is extremely strict about the apps and software that they allow on their tablet and they make sure it is all optimized.  If it doesn't run well on their tablet, guess what they don't publish it.  In comparison Google does not monitor every app to make sure it optimizes their software and tablets.

After several returns of the new Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 I got the TF300 and love it. Ive only had it about a week and already there has been 2 updates to the firmware. This is a nice change from other companies delaying updates. I also have an Asus laptop that I am writing this review on and I love it also.

Suspect software updates from ASUS will only improve performance.HW Features:When hinged with the dock, the audio cable is plugged into the top of the tablet. This is not ideal considering the tablet is top heavy and prone to upset. The audio cable does not help.  Would like to have an 3.5mm audio output at the bottom of the tablet or on the optional dock. This is really a dock complaint. But at $380-$400, who can complain?MicroSD is great for loading Gigabytes of Movies and Music.Get the Dock for the full-size USB connector..great for USB memory sticks.I don't like the charging connector. ASUS should have used USB, at both ends, for charging.Software:Firmware update was happening just minutes after connecting to my WIFI. Bundled ASUS software is nice, not annoying like many packaged applications. ASUS cloud app, file manager and dock/tab battery widget are great. Stock launcher is okay, I recommend APEX or NOVA. The TF300 is stable. No random restarts.

This is once a day with different applications. I will not remove a star for this. This is android, not IOS.Build Quality:The plastic back is solid and not slippery. The TF300 is a solidly-built device. Glass and metal are not the answer to build quality. It feels great. Dock will protect the screen when not in use.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R20QUXHFFUL4B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is only an initial report, as I've only had the TF300 for about 4 days.  At first I was concerned, as when I took it out and started it up for the first time, it hung at the language choice screen.  Bummer.  But being someone who uses computers often and is aware of their quirks and issues, I simply turned it off, and then back on again.  The second time's the charm!  Booted perfectly, did a firmware update, and I was off.  Entered my email address and it downloaded all the apps I have on my phone automatically.  A little weird and creepy, and I certainly didn't want ALL those apps on my tab, but okay.Then I started using it, and can now safely say that I'm falling in love with the little guy.  It's very smooth and quite fast in general.  Never having used the Prime, I don't really know what I'm missing; and though I'm sure it's faster and has a brighter display, etc... this one's cheaper!It doesn't have a metal housing, but truth be told I think the plastic looks quite nice.  It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.  I can't imagine any issue with the brightness unless I was outside in direct sunlight.  Not a concern, at least for me.I dinged the TF300 a star because of the start up issues, and occasionally an app stops responding properly.  Whether this is a fault of the machine or the apps themselves, I cannot say.  It hasn't bothered me much, as I simply restart apps when they hang and they work just fine.  Only a few apps I've found exhibit the behavior, like the Netflix app for instance.Other than these minor glitches, the tab is great.  The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.  Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.  I've only watched a couple of HD videos, but everything's pretty smooth.  Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.  It does exactly what I want it to do, and quickly, with only a couple of very minor issues so far.  I have ordered the TF300 dock, and will add to the review once I've used them together.***Update***So I've been using the TF300 with the dock for a couple of weeks now.  The tablet itself has continued to function as was stated previously, meaning it is for the most part a great joy to use.  There is still sometimes lag with browsing and certain apps stop responding very occasionally, but as I've previously stated, this is not so different from any Android phone I've ever used, so it's not all that surprising.  Android (especially for tablets) is still really in its infancy and thus I expect a certain level of random behavior, which often is related more to the apps themselves than even the OS, which on its own functions pretty well.As to the dock, it's quite simply wonderful.  It adds so much to the functionality and ease of use of the device that it simply cannot be overstated.  Even just the additional battery life is a thing of beauty alone, as I now always run the device in performance mode (which helps to cut down on lagginess), and still get good battery life.  I own a 12\" laptop, and this thing is a dwarf in comparison.  It folds up perfectly, fits in a very small space, and is extremely easy to tote around.  The keyboard is very responsive, the mouse trackpad works great (though sometimes it takes it a moment to pop up when it comes back from sleep), there are lots of helpful hotkeys, etc, etc.  It's awesome.A couple of things to be aware of though:People with large hands beware.  Though you should be aware of this before you buy such a device, take care to remember that this is not a full-sized keyboard and people with large hands may have trouble using it.  That said, I wear size large gloves, and while it did take a small period of adjustment, I'm now almost as quick typing on it as I am on my laptop.  One of the tiny shift keys does give me some grief from time to time, but it's really to be expected.Also it's convenient the trackpad has an on/off button, because when you're typing, you will inevitably run your palm across the pad and create all kinds of annoying issues at random times.  This to me was not really a surprise, since I knew how small the keyboard would be, but it's something to be realized before purchasing.  But just turn it off when you're in full on typing mode and you'll be fine.So, a few weeks out with my TF300, now with the dock, and I'm loving it.  It's one of the most handy devices for media consumption I've ever used.  The wifi is very strong, and the thing is really a joy to use in general.  I do wish there were a more full-featured office program, as even the one I paid for-- Office Suite Pro-- still leaves a lot to be desired.  It's not much better than Polaris, which comes with the TF300.  *sigh* So I'll simply wait for updates.  Certainly not a fault of the tablet itself.Overall really a wonderful buy and a great product, especially with the dock.

So I quickly bought an expensive screen protector since I was sure I would keep it. But as soon as I restored my account and opened gmail (white background) I noticed a gradient in the \"yellowness\" or warmth of the screen from top to bottom! I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me. So that one goes back too! And I don't think I would get another one from Asus.

I have looked at the Transformer Prime/Transformer (and the Infinty 700), Acer Iconia 510, Toshiba AT305 and the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  Each and every tablet has its pros and cons.  I have found that the Asus 300 was the one for me.  I was impressed with the colors on this device as my initial thoughts they were washed out but when you look at it in a store will bright lights that can happen.  Movies played crystal clear and without issues.  Music also played well  I did download Riptide GP as I wanted to see how the Tegra 3 graphics and I was impressed.  Asus could have done a better job with speakers but they sounds fine.  I will end up using my headphones anyway if I am listening to music or videos.  The camera took nice pictures but I didn't get the tablet for that reason.  I have seen people complaining about no led flash, come on we have our wonderful smart phones or digital cameras for that.  Can you imagine people taking there tablets to Disney and taking pics with that?  I did however have a brief display issue where I did see bars on the lower left side but that only happened once.  I have seen reviews complaining about this on another forum but it appears to be a software issue which I know Asus will fix or else Amazon will get alot of returns.  If this should happen again and not get fixed before my 30 day return window I will return it.ProsNo light bleeding as I have seen in the Toshiba AT305My external drive connected flawlessly and able to read all files.  Copied a 5 gig files in several minutes.Wireless works very well.Plays MP4 files greatThanks to the docking station you don't have to hold the tablet for a long time as I have heard with some people it can get tiresome.  Also works great to protect the unit.Browsing worked well but I have seen it \"hang up\" Not an issue for me.ConsSpeaker placement could have been better but not a show stopper.Browser pauses sometimes but I believe this to be an android issue.Overall I love the unit. for the fact that you have a docking keyboard with battery as this is one of the main selling points for me.  I will update further if I have any issues.Why I didn't chose other tablets:From a Toshiba review on Amazon\"Toshiba tech support from my limited experience with them is awful. I called about transferring files via the supplied cable and they were no help.I also had an issue using the USB host functionality trying to use an external hard drive and found via their tech support it will only support drives formatted to exFAT, FAT or FAT32. DOES NOT support drives formatted to NTFS.\"I find that very interesting considering all my drives are NTFS and I don't have a spare to format to exFATI also eliminated the Toshiba due to high cost of 529.00 for a 32gb tablet.  In fact I ordered this first but in good conscience however I cancelled it.  For that price you can get they Asus 300 with the keyboard as I did.Eliminated the Iconia A510, nice battery life however it does get very warm and $50.00 more than the Asus.Eliminated the Tab 2, nice unit but it was going a step back to dual core and also the Asus was the same price for Tegra 3 Quad and 32bg memory.Eliminated the Prime due to wireless issues and the Transformer due to pricing of $30.00 more you can got the Asus 300.Eliminated the Asus Infinity 700...who knows when the US release will be and also how expensive it will be.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asu TF300 If your in the market:  Buy It.", "Author": "Desert Hiker", "ReviewID": "R1AS9UMQ7PA1SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a mail order item direct from Amazon.  Delivery was faster than either of us expected.  But even better is the Asus TF300.  I was concerned about the comments in some of the reviews regarding the display and display brightness! Man, what a waste of energy, this tablet is perfect. I have owned both the Toshiba Thrive and the Acer Iconia A500.  The TF300 beats them hands down.  I like the thinness of the unit, the low weight, the incredible bright crisp display, Ice Cream Sandwich already loaded, and the feel of the unit.  Touch response is fast and accurate.  I was planning to upgrade to the TF700 when it became available, but not anymore.  This one is a keeper and the price was right.  It took less than an hour to set it up including an \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" upgrade and a few other downloads.  Be sure and check out the TF300 if you are in the market for a tablet.

For example, I'd totally forgotten I'd enabled MAC Address Filtering on my wireless router, so couldn't connect the ASUS at first until I wised up. Duh. I also struggled a little with the new environment of Android 4 as I'd only ever used Android 2.0 before, although a within an hour or two I'd got up to speed with it and now it's second nature. The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted. I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts. I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated. I've already found that I no longer use my PC as much as I can do pretty much everything I need to on the ASUS. The slight tweaks ASUS has made to the vanilla system are fine, although it would appear users are locked into using the ASUS file manager which may be off-putting for some. I can't say I'm that bothered though, their File Manager works and does what I need.Many people have commented on the screen quality being a little dull compared to more expensive alternatives. I don't find this a problem at all. The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it. I doubt I'll ever need to use the tablet outside in bright sunlight, so I have no complaints other than the fact that there are two odd several inch horizontal smudges on the screen. When the screen is totally polished I cannot see them, but finger print oily deposits adhere to them differently than the rest of the screen and they soon become visible again, but only when the unit is switched off. As I can't see these marks when the unit is switched on, I'll live with it. The screen doesn't appear to be scratched or physically damaged; the texture is totally smooth, so I'm perplexed as to what these marks are.The unit comes with minimal documentation so users might want to go to ASUS's website and download the full comprehensive manual in PDF format. This manual offers further assistance with the ASUS unit itself but also includes a useful Android user guide for those who aren't familiar with this operating system. I certainly learned a few things and found it useful.Overall, I'm overjoyed with the unit. It's amazingly powerful and very well priced for the features it has. I absolutely love it and am very happy with my choice. I toyed between several alternatives for a week or so, (i.e. the new Samsung Galaxy, the Acer Iconia among others), until plumping for this ASUS and I'm glad I did.EDIT: July 27th 2012Unfortunately, my unit's screen totally broke on July 16th. A crack appeared during normal use. I had never mistreated or dropped the tablet. I suspect the screen was warped or weakened in some way after the device was put under duress in shipping due to the daft way Amazon packed it with the screen under pressure by the outer box with the device itself mounted right at the top of the inner (ASUS) box, (it was pushed upwards under duress due to air-pocket packagaing in a too small box.)Any other boxes that were sat on top of my delivery during transit would have transferred a good deal of their weight directly onto my screen due to the way the tablet box is constructed and the way this box was packed into an Amazon outer box. Amazon were sympathetic but wouldn't help due to my being outside the first 30 days so they gave me ASUS's details to deal with directly. ASUS replied to my email promptly but stated that my warranty didn't cover physical damage. (At this point I was kicking myself for not reporting the unit DOA immediately upon delivery.) Reading other comments from other users that suffered the same fate I saw that this would likely cost $200+ to have the item repaired through ASUS. Thankfully, I also bought a Squaretrade warranty for my unit at the time of my tablet purchase so I contacted them and they are currently processing a full refund for me after receiving my unit and stating that a repair is not possible.If I buy a replacement tablet, I'll be sure to buy a tablet with Gorilla Glass such as the ASUS TF700 Infinity or perhaps something by another manufacturer. I've learned my lesson though by buying something that appears too good to be true. I paid for the omission of Gorilla Glass. It's a real shame as I truly adored this tablet! When it worked it was wonderful but too many corners have been cut in the manufacture to meet the sub-$400 price point.I feel I must mark down my 5 star review to an \"average\" review, but take no pleasure in doing so. The TF300 was an incredible piece of kit when it worked, but my confidence in the materials and construction is gone now. I'm still tempted to buy another, but the TF700 with its Gorilla Glass inspires more confidence. At $500 minimum though, I really don't think I can justify that so may wait a few months and see what units appear on the market.UPDATE: August 30th 2012I missed having a tablet more than I anticipated so I decided to buy an ASUS Infinity TF700 and received it on August 7th. The TF700 is fantastic and well worth the $100 extra over the TF300 in my opinion. The new IPS+ high resolution screen is superb, the faster processor is welcome, the TF700 feels better constructed overall than the TF300, (partly due to being primarily made of metal), and having a built in flash for the rear camera is a nice extra too. However, the main reason I chose the TF700 over another TF300 was its inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass. As my TF300 screen cracked during normal use and was never dropped or mishandled, I was wary of the same thing happening again, (despite my suspicion that the glass in my original TF300 was faulty from the start as the screen did dip slightly and have permanent marks on it right out of the box from new. I should have returned it immediately, but didn't as the marks were invisible when the unit was switched on and it worked fine. I probably would have returned it but for the fact I had a Squaretrade warranty that I knew would sort me out should the fault have got worse. I was probably just unlucky to receive a damaged item, but it still turned me off a little from buying another TF300 a little.)However, after having used the TF700 regularly for a few weeks now I am still overjoyed by my decision to spend the extra for the TF700 and am glad I didn't wait any longer.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good choice of tablet", "Author": "Jesse Phillips", "ReviewID": "RP3RHAT1B3RF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this tablet. I have not had problems with the hardware as other have described (light bleed). Nor have I found some of the other complaints to be an issue. Performance is great, even the auto light sensor is usable (power saving mode actually causes it to take a lower setting, though I can't say it is always perfect). Pretty much everything else is as expected and stated elsewhere, it doesn't feel like a tank so I wouldn't want to drop it, but the build is just what I'd expect. Since there are some many reviews on the hardware I'll go over to the Android/Software side. This is a Google product, I do not know what it is like to use this without a Google account \"attached\" to the device.One thing that takes getting use to is not closing applications. Things are just left running, though usually this means the app is stopped and won't do anything until becoming the active app. While many times you can switch from one application working on something to another, there are still times when an app will cancel what it was doing when being backgrounded.Android 4 uses the MTP and PTP so plugging the device into the computer will not provide you with a standard USB media device. This was chosen so that there was not a separate app drive from the system drive, and maybe more.I love the customization Asus did with the notification area. It gives quick access to a clock, power controls (wifi, bluetooth, gps), screen brightness, and performance settings.While Asus gives 8GB of webstorage, Google has turned their docs service into Drive and provide 5GB of webstorage. So good for all of us. The splashtop software is also very nice for those running Windows, it will forward your Windows desktop to the tablet and on a local network it is very usable. I don't have any comment on @vibe or Kindle or Netflix. I can say that Google actually provides two navigation software. Maps provides the ability but it isn't spoken directions, while Navigation is more of what is found for a GPS device. And if listening to Google Music (probably others) it will turn it down to make its statement.I would like to mention that text input comes in many forms and can downloaded if you want a different keyboard. One text input that comes with Android is \"Google voice typing.\" Just be warned, dictating long messages isn't easier than typing. One thing I haven't figured out, the Asus keyboard has swype functionality, but not always (and it is actually a good keyboard).I do think that there is a slight security risk with this thing. I recommend using a screen lock that requires some code, even the basic kind. On top of that I've found it way too easy for purchases to be made, so I use AppLocker (comes pre-installed) to lock the Play Store, nothing complex, just to give that extra step. You can go into AppLocker and disable it if you're going to do a lot of switching. I do not like that AppLocker takes up a permanent spot in my notification area.Some other tips.

However, after several weeks of usage I did notice a few things that made me wish for better design.First I do get a little lag every now and then, even a little freezing of apps.  I'm trying to ignore this hopping it'll fix itself.  It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.  My main gripe about this pad is that it is PLASTIC arghh#$%@!.  Why is this my big problem?  Becase when you lift open the pad from the closed \"laptop\" position I notice I sometimes pull away the plastic edge near the camera.  Also at the base of the charge port is the same issue with the skinny piece of thin plastic covering.  I'm noticing this almost on all edges.  This continues to be an issue with my excellent Poetic case (Poetic HardBack Protective Case for Asus Transformer TF300 Black With HandStrap with Built-in Folding Cover - Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)(Has Open Slot for Charger Port)(Speaker Hole is Completely Opened) (Intergrated HandStrap)), because the pad's cheap plastic covering keeps getting ripped appart along the edges.  Now i have to be extra carefull.I Just wish this TF300 pad had a nice solid metal body like the Prime and others.  Asus, why can't we have our cake and eat it too.  Why can't Asus produce a nice sturdy Pad like the Prime without it's inherent issues with the metal body?By the sound of this review you'll think I'll give this pad a 2-star or something, but I still love it but wish it was constructed better like the Prime minus the inherent issues I can't live with.  But for a 32GB at $399 shipped (no tax payed, free shipping, from new egg)it's a no brainer.  Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the \"Netbook-Like\" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support", "Author": "Mihir", "ReviewID": "R2MAANKSMTS0C4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TF300 ReviewI got my tf300 on May 17th have used it for about 6 days now. In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet. If you are an android user and enjoy the freedom of android then you will definitely enjoy this tablet, but if you rely heavily on iTunes and the easiness of backing up and syncing, and the simplicity of iOS then this tablet might not be for you, more specifically android.Physical Aspect  - The plastic back body does not feel cheap even though many have complained about it. The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy. Some have said that the plastic does bend inward which is true but it is not significant enough for it to be a real concern. You will not notice the plastic bending unless you actually look it. In the end I know that the back was made plastic to increase Wi-Fi/GPS reception which now works fine.- The only major problem I had for the tablet build was the fact that they decided not to use gorilla glass and went with hardened glass instead. The glass they used does not feel slick when sliding my finger across it like in the iPad 3. Also it is a fingerprint magnet which can get annoying. Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.- Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode. When listening to audio/video in landscape mode it feels awkward because my right ear gets a higher volume than my left, but it isn't that big of a problem when in portrait mode. Although I won't complain too much about it because the speaker is better than that of the prime and is very clear even at the highest level.Display Quality- video quality seems fine,  I watched a lot of YouTube trailers in HD and even watched Sherlock Holmes games of shadows in 720p and Avatar in 1080p and so far video quality seems fine to me and the tablet did not even hiccup. I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.- I know a lot of people complained that Asus did not put in a Super IPS+ display with 600nits of brightness in this tablet but the fact is that this tablet's 350nits is plenty. Not to mention that in my house I only use about 10%, yes 10%, brightness and the 600nits is only for outside use and will take a toll on your battery. I have actually used this tablet in sunlight, but in order to see clearly the sun must be at an angle, the screen at max brightness, and the background preferably in white or light color.Operating System (Ice Cream Sandwich)- This is my first android device and all I can say is Wow, kudos to Google. I know many people have said that Android is confusing or too hard to use, but I got the hang of it within a couple of hours and there really isn't that big of a learning curve as people say there is.- in the reviews I actually saw that quite a few people got lemons and when I ordered mine I had my fingers crossed and hoped for a good working tablet. Luckily my tablet was and is still okay. Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down. A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing. To those that do have crashes and reboots I would suggest upgrading the firmware or trading it in for another one and definitely give the tf300 another chance.- I have also read in the reviews that many people have had the wait/close message many times while browsing and my case is no different, I would suggest using another browser like dolphin which is a lot more stable and less likely to crash, my dolphin has yet to crash. Also if the wait/close message does pop up just press wait and it will start working again immediately, to avoid wait/close error just be a bit more patient and let the page load completely.- The OS itself is very stable and responsive with a few glitches here and there. If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.- The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like. This is not a digital camera replacement but I know that if I ever needed a camera that this tablet can take decent enough pictures for me.- the webcam is also okay,  does not work too well in low light conditions but is good in adequate light levelsProcessor (tegra 3)- I'm so glad that Asus went with a quad core processor this to me increases the longevity of the tablet and the dual core processors in other tablets would have only lasted so long. I recently heard that Microsoft and NVidia were working together to make an Arm based Windows 8 running on Tegra 3 which they actually debuted and it worked perfectly, just goes to show you that the Tegra 3 is a quite powerful processor and it will last for years, sooner or later developers will start taking advantage of the 4 cores.- Apple claims that the A5X is more powerful graphics wise and is 4 times better than the Tegra 3, now that is true the A5X is 4 times faster, but once the iPad's retina display turns on the A5X has to use up more resources to power that and only leaves enough power as the Tegra 3, also with screen turned on. So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same. If you want to see the benchmarks in detail then here is the link ([...]). In terms of raw CPU output not graphics, the Tegra 3 obviously is better with its 4 cores.Tf300 vs iPad 3- When people compare Android tablets vs. the iPad I think they should only focus on the software not the hardware.- To be honest the iPad does not give you any hardware features that it should, the tf300 has micro-hdmi, micro-sd, and you can buy an usb kit for the transformer to attach ntfs hard drives or keyboards and mice.- The only thing the iPad has better than the tf300 is the app store in my personal opinion, don't get me wrong the iPad is an awesome device and they only problem I had was for $499 they still only give 16gb which was not enough for meICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) vs iOS- So a thing about iOS is the closed environment of apple. Unless you jailbreak the device and void the warranty you cannot customize the iPad with widgets or better security features. It also lacks true multi-tasking. Another problem is app to app integration. For example, I have a word file in my Dropbox account which I want to edit. In the iPad I can't edit it, but in Android I can click on it and have the option to open it in Polaris Office and edit it and save in to the tablet. And if I wanted to upload it back into Dropbox.- The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive. I can freely add and remove media files without having to go through an application like iTunes, although to be fair I actually like the easiness and organization iTunes has and wish Android had a free and better program like iTunes. The only problem with iTunes is its lack of many different video formats which is annoying, Android has a awesome array of format it supports without the need to convert which I love.- I won't keep going into detail about why I like android better but wicked4u2c on YouTube has made a 5 part mini-series about why android is better using ICS and the iPad. Although to play fair he did say he preferred the iPad as the better tablet, but once again that was based on the mainly the lack of true tablet applications for android tablets.Wicked4U2C channel -  ([...])Part 1 - [...]Part 2 - [...]Part 3 - [...]Part 4 - [...]Part 5 - [...]Bonus - [...]TF300 vs iPad - [...]Feel free to comment and ask me questions below all opinions welcomed.UPDATE:So apparently I can't display links so you guys would have to find the articles on your own.For the CPU benchmarks: Google keywords,-Redmond pie, a5x, tegra 3,For Wicked4u2c: YouTube channel called wicked4u2cThe ICS vs IOS videos called \"Android vs IOS the truth\" - that's part of the nameFor tf300 vs iPad YouTube search both tablet names and look for the video made by wicked4u2c.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Quite 5 Stars", "Author": "Blu-dog \"Peace like a river\"", "ReviewID": "R39NE784YGIHIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well it's been a week since I got this tablet and overall I'm happy with it, but not completely satisfied.

Never without it. So far two occurrences keep me worried about this issue. Hopefully a new firmware update will get this fixed, but in order to happen we have to let asus know about this, is not enough to go to forum as xda developers and post our issues and concerns there, we have to report this type of incident directly with Asus.Wake up issue when dock attached: it doesn't wake up the unit if you use the touchpad or the mouse buttons, finally I realized the tab key on the dock does the trick as long as option called \"mobileDock battery saving mode\" is disabled. however once I did this my dock drained out in 3 hours in sleeping mode. I got this fixed simply installing the app \"juicy defender plus\"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds. but tf300t touch controls remain responsive.Overall I'm happy with my unit, my expertise level as a system administrator (IT director) allow me to get around these issues quickly, but I cannot imagine an end user dealing with these annoyances. Must be frustrating for them. hopefully Asus will get those issues fixed in time, eventually.Shame on Asus for such poor quality control in their tablets line up. this is a 2nd generation tegra 3 product, they had plenty of time to learn from their mistakes w/ tf201(prime). It's unbelievable how a company release a product in such poor working state. my tf101 was RMA twice, my tf101 dock once and those were bought brand new. my tf201 preorder was never delivered, got charge twice and waited for 45 days with no success, apparently wasn't asus fault, despite the fact \"worst buy\" directly blamed Asus for short supply.

Reason: the software for all tablet devices is too unrefined at this time to support such tasks.The machine is well suited for reading and sending emails, reviewing documents and photographs, doing Internet tasks, making on-line purchases, video communication, etc.  I do not play video games and can not comment on same.I am writing these comments on my tf300 equipped with the docking station (keyboard), 32GB memory card , carrying case (all purchased at Amazon last week for $752). Add $6 for a better email program (Kaitan Mail) and a spell-checker (ABC Spell Checker).Hardware - no complaints. My machine is rugged enough - nothing flimsy. The docking station firmly latches onto the tablet and provides a solid work platform. When folded together, the dock and tablet protect each other. Excellent keyboard.  Keys have a good touch.  The special keys on the top row are well thought out.  I spent $13 on a neoprene case, which pulls over the unit like a well-fitted sock.Wi-Fi reception is greater than 300 linear feet. I sat on a chair across the street from my house watching a T-Ball Game two hours ago and had 100% linkage with my Fios router. And, the first floor walls of my house are 18 inch thick solid granite rock, which acted as a barrier between the machine amd the router.With 64 GB of storage, I have more than enough space for everything. I archive my photos, documents and financial data in a 750 GM Western Digital Remote Hard Drive. I hooked that drive up to the machine's USB port on the dock and transferred about 2 GB of photos to my memory card in about 2 minutes.The batteries in the tablet and the dock will give you at least 9 hours of heavy use without a re-charge.In summary, I feel that the hardware is solid.The limitations for the device are software based.First, you MUST spend the six dollars to get a decent email program and spell checker.  Now, my personal computing days started in 1980.  Back then, the spell checker 5-1/4 inch diskette for my Syntrex Computer cost $600.00.  Every upgrade was $600.  The word processing program was $600.  So was the spreadsheet program.  I write this because I spent from 1980 through about 2000 living through the hell of terrible software.  The hardware was always more sophisticated than the software.  30 years ago, you had no choice - either a $12,000 primative Syntrex computer with 5-1/4 inch diskettes - one for data and the other for the program you were using.  Or, an IBM Selectric Typewriter retrofitted with a card reader - one card for each page of text.I have spent about 36 hours with the Asus Transformer tf300.  I am more than just plain satisfied with it.  The machine has plenty of horsepower.  What is sorely needed is better software.I have experienced zero breakdowns - either hardware or software.  The machine came equipped with the Android 4.03 operating system.  I have found it to be reliably stable.  But, this is not Windows XP, which I run on my other machines.The first thing that I did was connect the tablet to the dock and plug the dock into a wall outlet.  Only after I got the green light (the change from orange - charging  - - to green - charged) did I attempt to do anything.  I read too many comments written by folks who did not charge their machine fully and experienced problems.The next thing I did was download all of the software updates.  Then, I installed the same password to unlock this machine that I have will all of my other computers.Email - forget the generic email shipped with the machine.  It has no spell-checker.  And, you have to delete the garbage in your \"trash\" folder one item at a time.  Spend $5 and buy Kaiten Mail.  You must spend one more Dollar to get ABC Spell Checker.  You write text of your emails in ABC and then press the send button to ship the email via Kaiten and your email server.Because of software limitations, the machine is inefficient.  Ok, you can read everything without a problem.  But, go ahead and try to write something.  Cutting and pasting text - for me - almost impossible.  Creating macros - for the expressions you use all the time - your name - address, etc - forget it.  I have searched for such programs - they are too primitive.Yesterday, I took the machine to a 9 hour seminar.  I was able to retrieve and read all things important to me on the Internet and collect and read my email.  The keyboard is excellent - again - the hardware is excellent on this machine.I feel like I am reliving the 1980s of the computing world.  This machine could replace my notebook after many major improvements in software.  I am biased towards Google.  I don't own the stock, but rely heavily on Google's programs, such as its Chrome Browser and Picasa.  The better software will come.If you want the convenience of a small computer to handle the basics of your computing needs, then this machine offers you excellent value.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor technical support", "Author": "Lucio Da Silva", "ReviewID": "R3VUEML49YHJ6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am an IT professional and use the tablet mostly for professional purposes.I purchased this product about 10 month ago and about 3 month ago the screen started flickering.I contacted ASUS and sent the tablet for technical support.

I researched Android tablets heavily for the last 9 months and was even skeptical about the TF300 at first. I had read some having screen issues but they were clearly software related and Asus fixed them. I had read other complaints but decided to take a chance on Asus after reading more good reviews than bad.I'll first say that I almost bought the Transformer Prime when it came out but after reading about the flawed design with the metal backing blocking the GPS and Wi-Fi I decided it wasn't worth it. ASUS has fixed that problem with this tablet! Don't be scared away by the blue plastic back. It is NOT cheap and doesn't feel weak like some people have said in these reviews on Amazon and other sites. The tablet feels like a solid build all over. I think internal function and performance is more important than an external piece. I don't know why many desire this aluminum backing. Who cares?! This tablet delivers on it's promise with the hardware!I fired it up, plugged in my Google account and it synced everything I wanted it too and the few things I didn't want to that weren't necessary. FIRST IMPORTANT thing to know about owning an Android phone and then getting and Android Tablet. DO NOT EXPECT ALL OF YOU'RE ANDROID APPS ON YOU'RE PHONE TO WORK ON YOU'RE TABLET! This is where many people are disappointed wrongly. Good news is the tablet will not download all of your apps from you're phone when you launch the Google Play Store for the first time. If it does for some reason, just manually stop it. Then go down through the list and only download apps that you know are optimized already for the tablet. When you click on an app it will even tell you that it is not optimized for the tablet so it helps you out! Then browse through the Google Play Store and look for the section that has \"Staff Picks for Tablets\". Those are guaranteed apps for tablets. Most other apps are already optimized but you'll usually find out when you first start an app if it was made for tablets or not. If not, just uninstall, don't complain and blame Asus or Android. Blame the developer.Performance:I was really glad that ASUS put the Tegra 3 1.2Ghz Quad-Core CPU in this! And boy does it fly! I have seen VERY LITTLE lag and that was while only in \"Balanced mode\" and if you put it in \"Performance mode\" then you will see no lag at all! Google Maps and Earth run so fast and smooth it's an amazing experience! The NVIDIA Graphics in this is a great pair with the CPU because together they give you zero lag gaming and graphics display. Download Riptide GP, it's a paid app but it's worth the money to showcase the power of this tablet! Running Live wallpapers and doing other intensive tasks doesn't even begin to slow down this tablet!Screen:Many people have said they are disappointed with the display because it's only 1280x800 and only has 350 nits of brightness and it's not as good as the Transformer Primes 600 nits and Super IPS+ but they have the same resolution so I don't know what the big deal is. This screen is amazing! Don't let the bad reviews fool you! At the highest brightness it is uncomfortable to look at for more than a few minutes! Ideally 50% brightness is the better setting but I keep mine down around 30-40% on the brightness fader even when I'm at home or work and it's fine! Colors are crisp, everything displays great so trust that the screen is fine with the 'super' in front if the IPS. :)Camera's, Mobile Dock, etc.The 8MP camera is not that bad. The pictures are of decent quality. But who really is going to use it a lot on a tablet? That's mostly reserved for your smartphone nowadays. And anyone taking photography seriously will buy a real DSLR camera. You don't buy a tablet for it's camera, it's just kind of a convenience. The 8MP on my Samsung Galaxy S2 is much better than this 8MP but that's okay because I know that for this price point the camera sensor quality wasn't a huge priority probably. The front camera (and back) is good though for video chat like Skype. That's probably the most valuable role the cameras will play.The mobile dock is worth it! I know it's an extra $130+ but it's a huge part of the whole package that ASUS designed. I really like it and when it's docked you get extra battery life and full keyboard functionality. I know there's a track pad but I still find myself using the touchscreen even when docked. I find I can execute commands faster than using the track pad.I really like Android 4.0. This is my first experience with 4.0 and I like it. It's kind of a learning curve a little coming from the phone version of Android, of which I'm running 2.3 on my Samsung. It's nice having 5 homescreens on the tablet. Live wallpapers look and work like a dream on this! Thanks again to that Tegra 3 CPU! Navigating the app drawer, the settings and other menus are a blast. Everything flows smoothly and works as it should. I haven't found any flaws in the OS so far. The only thing I could say is that sometimes web browsing can lag but that is all depending on which browser you are using! I have found that the best Browser so far is Dolphin Browser HD. 2nd best would be Chrome Beta, then the stock browser, then Firefox. I haven't experienced any other problems with apps. Just be sure it's optimized for you're tablet and you'll be fine!In closing, I got the 32GB version, with the Mobile Dock, and added a 32GB Micro SD Card that I purchased for only $30 from another online vendor because they're prices and selection were better. (Sorry Amazon!) So for around $550 you get what would cost over $700 for an iPad 3!

I really like this tablet, the feel, the interface, the operating system.  ASUS has nailed this one. Is this the IPad beater?  Maybe, but it doesn't have to beat it to be a good tablet.  Admittedly I'm an not an Apple fan but I have played with a few and I do like how the IPad feels in my hands.  I'm just not a fan of the interface, kinda clunky and dated.  Now the TF300, it feels great in my hands, the texture on the back makes holding it very easy in either landscape or portrait.  To me the interface is modern, intuitive, slick.  I have an Android phone and I'm sure that's why I feel comfortable in the interface.  I like how the various screens appear to rotate from one to the other.  The transition is smooth and attractive.  Google has done a nice job with  Ice Cream Sandwich, I hope to get it on my phone someday.  I guess any review comes down to just  two questions.  Am I glad I purchased this?  Yes, I am very glad I bought the TF300, it does everything I want and looks good doing it.  Would I recommend this tablet to friends and family?  Most definitely, if they want an Android tablet then this is one to get.  Look no further, this is the one you want.

All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches. The iPad is a solid performer in the hardware and software aspect but is made for people that like to be told what to do and not do with their devices... Apple has a sick way of doing that and they always leave you wanting more when you know they could have provided all those things they intentionally left out so next year they can introduce it in their new iPad and have you go crazy for the new little feature that your old iPad should have included for the premium you paid.Then comes a solid company like Asus and comes up with a brilliant idea of making \"Transformer\" tablets, no tablet is perfect and Asus is no exception but the TF300 is everything I want a tablet to be with some room for improvement but not so much you'll cry about it because other have it and you dont. ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer. The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is \"optional\" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10\" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life. I use mine with a wireless USB mouse and it feels solid and reacts just as good as a good high performance notebook while performing many different task including watching HD movies. The combination of a touch screen and a \"real\" keyboard and mouse is a very awesome experience.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it does have it's minor software glitches and the screen could have been better but all the pros overcome the cons very quickly and I would not change it for anything else at the moment.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "iWhat??", "Author": "Hobbes", "ReviewID": "RA6LJKS8TN2OA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the iPad2 and the Asus TF300T.

I have to say that I couldn't be happier with this tablet's performance. Specifically:Operating System: 4.5/5Android Ice Cream Sandwich runs beautifully on this device. I may have an app close on me once every 2 or 3 days. I know apps crash significantly less often on iOS, but you also have to deal with iTunes which I personally find sluggish and heavy. Homescreen and app drawer transitions are very snappy, I never experience any lag. You can fully customize your homescreen with useful widgets like Gmail and weather that automatically updates you without having to open any applications. I always liked Android more than iOS, and it's because of the customization availableSpeed: 5/5This tablet runs applications and videos for me without missing a beat. I've tested it with several Youtube videos, as well as in-browser Amazon Instant Video streaming and I don't experience any lag, even just on balanced mode. I've also run multiple apps at the same time, often switching back and forth between a couple of games and Google Chat, and the processor handles it perfectly. I've had no problems with internet browsing being slow, but I did immediately download Dolphin Browser for Android, so that may have something to do with it. Web pages load almost as fast as they do on my computer. I have no complaints about the speed of the tablet.Sound: 4/5There is one speaker towards the right of the device (when holding in landscape) that is slightly awkwardly placed. However, the sound quality is still much better than adequate. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality when using it to watch shows on Amazon Instant Video. You can hear clearly words and music.Portability: 5/5The tablet is not heavy, I can hold it in one hand for a long enough time to do what I need to do, and holding it with two hands (while browsing or reading PDF documents for example) is very easy and feels natural. It's a light device that is easy to carry around, and feels sturdy enough so that I don't have to worry too much about damaging it as long as I'm just somewhat careful (it's not like you're going to purposely smash it on the floor or even let it be in a situation like that). The battery life is great as well, I often go 10 hours before needing to charge the tablet, maybe 8 and a half hours for heavy use.Feel: 5/5There are some complaints about the plastic back, but I have absolutely none. I love the feel of holding the tablet, the plastic back feels sturdy to me, and it is pleasant to the touch when holding the device. Also, because of the plastic back, I always get excellent Wi-fi reception, and GPS signal is very strong for me. It found me in less than 30 seconds the first time I tried using it, and it updated my position in real-time in a satellite view while in a car.Display: 5/5*The display is very bright for indoor use and more than meets my needs. I have only noticed light bleed on the bright black boot-up screen of the device, but if I had never seen the device boot up, I wouldn't have known that there was any. I can never tell when I'm playing games, browsing the web, or reading documents. It's bright and displays colors wonderfully, I have no qualms from the display.*-the device is difficult to use in direct sunlight. This isn't affecting my score for it because I don't need it or use it in direct sunlight, but you should know if that's what you want to use it for, you should get the Asus Transformer Prime or wait for the Infinity TF700 for a better screen that's made to be viewed in direct sunlight.Overall: 5/5I love just about everything about this tablet, and would recommend it to any of my friends and family. For the price of $400 dollars for this tablet with 32gb of storage, you're getting a light sleek tablet with a quad-core processor and excellent battery life.

At first, I thought it was awesome.  It performed as I hoped it would and exceeded some of my expectations.  However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.  Then matters got worse.One day, I noticed it wasn't charging.  There was nothing wrong with the dock, or the charging cable.  I know this because my wife has the same tablet and I tried using her charging cable.  My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.  Similarly, both chargers could fully charge our keyboard docks as well.Eventually, the battery in my tablet had completely drained and would not charge or turn on.At this point I knew it was already too late to pursue a return with Amazon, so I contacted ASUS support to request a repair.  It quickly became apparent that ASUS doesn't care about their customers at all.  They generated an RMA and sent detailed instructions on how to ship the tablet to their repair facility in Texas.  I was told that once it was received at the repair facility I would get a notice within 24 hours and that the repair would take no longer than 5 days. I was also told I would be able to track the repair status online.  I got tracking confirmation that the tablet had been received, but I was not notified by the service center as expected.  When I tried to use their online utility to track my RMA, the website returned an error saying \"THE RMA YOU HAVE ENTERED DOES NOT EXIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM\"Needless to say, I got a little panicked.  so I called ASUS support by phone.  They told me it was at the repair facility but had not been received.  I asked them if they understood the definition of \"received\"  It was explained to me that they don't consider the repair as received until it is picked up by the repair technician who begins the repair.  over the next few days, they would not take my calls, nor would they respond to any requests for status on my repair.  and about another week later, my tablet showed up on my doorstep.  Apparently they did manage to charge the battery, they completely wiped the operating system, and sent it back to me.Since it seemed to be working, I started downloading and re-installing my apps within a few days it once again stopped charging and eventually shut off again.At this point I'm fuming mad. Clearly they sent my tablet back un-repaired.  Continued contact with their customer service indicates that they WILL NOT EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.  They will however generate another RMA and continue the process of sending it back for service, where in my opinion, they have already shown their ineptitude.

I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.  With the exception of one application, this is a fantastic device to bring while traveling, and for most things more useful than a laptop.  Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.  Reading and commenting on technical documents - I treat dropbox as a briefcase, and put work documents there for a trip.  I can comment on them with a pen, and can send them to others by email easily from the tablet.2. Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.  Adding notes is easy.  The one problem, which is kindle related, is that there are not folders to organize the many books I carry around with me - a whole library in a very small package.3. If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4. I have to do work on a linux server - very easy to ssh to servers at work, and run serious programs there.  Droidedit makes it easy to edit programs on the server.  With vnc one can run X-windows on a server.5.  One has all the word/spreadsheet programs needed.6.  I use latex for most documents - here the support is not great, but Droidedit has syntax highlighting and one can compile on a server or use scribtex.7.  Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.  When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.  One of the most fantastic features is with the keyboard one has 12 hours of battery life and holds the screen in a perfect position for watching movies.One can wait indefinitely for the perfect machine, but I have found that the ASUS TF300T is really a great tool, and at this price point it is definitely worth having in addition to a laptop.  My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well. I find that the one thing that makes this really worth having is the keyboard that allows me to do short trips with not laptop.  Without the keyboard, I would have to bring a laptop, in which case the tablet might get left behind because of weight.  I find that for short trips and meetings I always bring the tablet with keyboard.  A super useful device.  Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.  Using vnc is a bit of effort and so for my purposes 4 stars.

The battery drains faster than advertised even with light use, and sometimes even overnight with airplane mode on.4. When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5. The screen is inferior to both the Transformer Prime and the Apple Ipad 2 (its nearest Ipad competitor).6. My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7. It does not have gorilla glass like the Prime or whatever type of specialty glass Apple uses (both from Corning btw). Certainly a cost issue.8. The glass is a smudge and fingerprint magnet.Pros -1. The price is hard to beat for what you get.2. It's android.3. I like the build quality. Even though the back is plastic (to help with gps/wifi), it feels solid with little flex.4. Sleek design, slim and light.5. HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6. Even when it freezes up in an app the OS remains stable.7. Decent sound.8.

One of the tablets turned out to be defective (I guess there have been some issues with displays), so I started the process for replacing it on Amazon's website.  This was a Thursday evening at 8pm, so I figured it might be the following week before my kids would have their tablet back.  Amazon's customer support, in my opinion, is absolutely amazing.  They responded almost immediately (with what did appear to be a standard, \"We're so sorry...\" email), but that was followed up very quickly with another email, obviously personalized.  This one said that the new tablet had been shipped with Saturday delivery, at no additional cost.  Well, turns out they didn't have to do that, as UPS was out the very next day delivering the new tablet.  The return process of the defective tablet was equally simple.The tablet itself is great.  It's fast, the graphics engine is amazing, and I haven't noticed any light bleed around the edge of the screen, like I've seen other people discussing.  And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.  And since this tablet comes with an \"office suite\" already preinstalled, that's just one more perk.

This is my first tablet and I'm impressed with it for the price paid--$390.I've played with the Ipad and this, to me, is better. Maybe not on overall specs, but you can do so much more because of the Adobe Flash and the open operating system. It purrs along.I had a minor glitch connecting with Wifi though. Turns out, I input the wrong WEP key code and after I input the code, the tablet does not tell you if the code is correct or incorrect. It simply does not log on. Being my first tablet, I did not realize the code was wrong. A warning or prompt from the Wifi connector screen would be nice for novices. It took me a day to realize this until I tried the other code. But, since then, all has been great.Wifi is strong all over the house. There are a TON of apps. Don't be fooled into thinking there aren't a lot of apps for Android tablets. There are. And virtually every good one on the Ipad is available on Android tablets too.Music is great with a ton of apps. The speaker is a bit metallic sounding when cranked to its highest setting, but overall, it still sounds good enough and the volume is more than adequate.The screen is a magnet for fingerprints though and you will find yourself cleaning it off a lot. I clean mine constantly and am looking into buying a screen protector. I'm just waiting until I find one with good recommendations.The touchscreen is very responsive. No lag on mine at all. Its quick. The back camera is awesome with many different settings and fun things to do and try, including a panorama shot. Surprising because my high-end Kodak camera has that too.The front camera has less pixels and isn't as great, but is perfect for video calls and gets the job done.I definitely would recommended this tablet for the price. I think it is a solid deal at $390. It has so many great features and extras like free Cloud Storage and Polaris Office. I'm just now beginning to discover them.  Just an FYI, the Google Sky Map app is simply incredible!! I highly recommend downloading this free app.I hope this review helps others because I spent a few months debating and researching which tablet I wanted.

But this ones great. Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go. It's not just running ics 4.0 its running ics 4.0.3. The same version my galaxy nexus is running. Asus has just released a bootloader unlock tool. Which makes it as wide open to hacking as my nexus. Its also about as close to vanilla Android as it comes wth out being a nexus. Asus has just added some widgets and apps. They did change the task bar out with a custom one. But you can even switch back to the default one in the setting.  Now the reason I took a star away. I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port. I have the USB adapter but its not great. The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode. Its located on the top if your holding it in landscape mode. Which means you have to hold it at a weird angle if you don't use it in landscape. To make it worse most video chat apps seem to be made for portrait mode. It also has a bit of a problem surfing the net. It has a slight lag here and there. Setting flash to not load by default seems to help.

Or in my case, I used the USB adapter to hook up a Logitech combo wireless mouse/keyboard adapter, works perfectly.If it weren't for what I consider flimsy construction (compared to other tablets I own) I'd gladly give this tablet 5 stars.

I have seen several reviewers stating that the tablet is good for a first time buyer, but that any buyer who \"knows\" will think that the TF300 is flimsy and cheaply built.I agree with these reviewers - while in general, I love my TF300, the thing feels pretty flimsy.  If you grip the thing in both hands, its WAY too easy to flex the entire tablet and make the LCD bleed light.  While I don't advocate for flexing the tablet just to see the light bleed, I'm not happy that its pretty easy to do.  Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.  However, with as flimsy as the TF300 feels, I don't feel like its a smart move to use this tablet without a good hardback case.Done with the bad.  Now for the good.I love this tablet!  The TF300 has great hardware.  While the screen is not super IPS and thus is a little bit hard to use in direct sunlight, the screen is more than bright enough for easy use in every other situation.  In fact, the screen is downright gorgeous.  I've compared my tablet directly to a coworker's iPad 3, and actually prefer the black contrast better on the TF300. The Tegra 3 processor is also very zippy - the only slowdowns I have had with the tablet have been internet connection speed related.  HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.  For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.  I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.  While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.  The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.  I upgraded from the preinstalled Polaris Office to Office Suite Pro when Amazon had it on sale a few weeks back and have been very happy with my ability to edit legal documents and e-mails on the go using the TF300.  I also love the fact that I can work the entire day using the TF300 without needing to be plugged in.In summary, the TF300 is a great little tablet and is an impressive multimedia tool.  Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.  One star docked for the flimsiness of the build.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "It doesn't have the flaws of the TF201", "Author": "cpu99", "ReviewID": "R2G0T2DW712KHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would still have wanted the TF201, but with its inability to connect to GPS (without the temporarily free dongle) rendered it hopeless. I can only assume that Dilbert's company actually made such a piece of equipment without testing GPS.Anyway, this review is for the TF300. It's pretty much like the TF201, except that the CPU is slightly slower. If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference. It is a dual CPU computer (therefore providing 4 core). In case there is confusion between cores and CPU, it's like an i5. I don't think performance is an issue. It has always been very responsive.I have the 32GB version (don't know if there is less). So far I have not bought an additional micro-memory chip to put in it. There is room for 1. The only other connectors it has on the tablet are the proprietary power/keyboard connector, the micro-HDMI (which I have not tried yet) and the headset, which accepts and uses the model with integrated microphone (or without). Using netTalk, I have been able to make phone calls from the tablet, over wi-fi of course. I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that. If you don't want to use a headset, you can because it does have an internal mike. As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side. Even if there were 2, there is no way you could get stereo sound with speakers so close together, so one is enough.I decided to buy the matching keyboard for it, and now when I show friends my purchase they say \"Oh! You bought yourself a notebook.\", an then I take it apart and their eyes express surprise and they says \"It's a tablet! Oh wow.\" A friend of mine, pretty much sold on iStuff, said he wished he could have a keyboard that attached to his phone, because my keyboard also has its own battery, and as you use the tablet, it sacrifices itself in order to transfer all its power over to the tablet. The tablet itself has enough power to work decently all day, but with the extra provided by the keyboard, you pretty much cease to check how much you have left because you know you won't run out before you have a chance to recharge it. Charging is relatively fast. That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB. If would still be better than nothing if you didn't have the transformer with you. Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone. What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB. That is a flaw as far as I am concerned, because if the tablet screen times out and turns off, you lose USB power. The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth. I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port. I could have connected the tablet to the TV, and controlled it from my sofa. I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too. The keyboard also has room for a regular SD card.As for the software, ICS, I didn't notice much difference between it and Honeycomb I had tried about 2 years ago. That is not a reproach. I hate it when you get a new software update and you can't find how to do anything anymore. The major difference it has, which I didn't think it did not exist before, is that the tablet can be rotated 360 degrees. It will adjust the image in 4 different positions; portrait, portrait upside-down, landscape and landscape upside-down. (The upside-down is relative to the tablet of course, to the user it always looks right-side up.)That is pretty much it. Overall a purchase that should last me a few years. (Particularly since I also decided to buy the accident warranty for 3 years.)Addendum: The first thing I tried is the GPS. It works fine outside a building and inside a car (we have a mini-van so lots of metal around). Inside the house, it's picky, but then, I do know where I am anyway.I did some Wi-Fi speed tests too. I have a Fios home connection with 25/25MB promised and in general I get what has been promised. Here are some results (all numbers are in kilo bits per second):1) About 3 feet from the router: download - 16016, upload - 188742) In living room, one wall separating: download - 15509, upload - 183183) Other end of the house, 3 walls: download - 15779, upload - 183154) Far end of the back yard, one cement wall: download - 15516, upload - 193655) Outside the house, next to the garage door: download - 13206, upload - 174266) Outside, in front of the metal garage door: download - 1949, upload - 2693As you can see, Wi-Fi works. If you are in a commercial building with metal walls, it might not be very good. But for everything else, it is very acceptable. I had no issues with it, even in the back yard. (I can't explain why the upload is faster than the download, but it always is on all my devices.)Power cable is a decent length (about 6 feet). I could use the tablet connected to the power constantly while sitting on my sofa, because I ran an extension cord from the outlet to the coffee table. But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient. However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it. It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet. And since one end of the cable is a true USB connector (the end that goes in the transformer) you could buy a USB extension cable (male/female) if 6 feet is not enough for you, and you don't want to bring an electrical extension cord closer to you.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Tablet for the price!", "Author": "Bertman5050", "ReviewID": "R2ATQAGSOXHF5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet on launch day and have waited to review it. The speed is fantastic! Tegra 3 is a beast when it comes to games. I have ran emulators on it and it seems to run anything I throw at it. The design is also great. Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back. Some people have been saying because its plastic, they have been getting a little bleed through on the screen. Only time I have ever seen that is when I intentionally push hard on the front or back. If you're handling this tablet as any normal person would, you'll never see any bleed through. Now, ICS and Tegra 3 are beautiful together. It is very smooth in all 3 of the Asus processor modes. The battery life is about average for a tablet. I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it. I do wish there was a deep sleep mode, so that when the screen is turned off it would shut the system down. But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.

I guess since they made the back panel out of poly-carb, the signal isn't blocked. Very accurate and works great with Navi apps. The speaker port looks small but don't let that fool ya, it delivers a LOT of sound (louder than my iPad3), and I am very happy about that. The Wi-Fi is one of the most sensitive I've ever used, picks up signal I never knew were around me. I wish they included dual band 5GHz (802.11a). It is very thin and should be used with care. I recommend a nice protective case with built in screen cover like the Otter Box. Rear Cam is 8MP (no LED Flash like on Prime) and 2MP front Cam, both do a very nice job. My favorite feature is the Micro SDHC card slot. It accepts up to 32GB of additional storage space. Note: BestBuy sells a version on the TF300 that than ONLY has 16GB for same price as amazon.

Then it finally quit completely, and I had to pay $25.00 to send it back as per their specific instructions for packaging.They had it for 2 months. 2 MONTHS!! They told me I had to pay a little over $200.00 for a new motherboard and labor. The tech who emailed me with the price for repair, wouldn't respond when I tried to tell her that my tablet was still under warranty and I had a case number from when I called (she already had that info). Once they have your product, it's nearly impossible to obtain help by phone or to get help online. Anyone I reached, told me that they couldn't address the problem. Supervisors were always unavailable and I was put on a \"call back\" list. I was finally called back on the 3rd try by phone (no response to emails), but it still took several days for that supervisor to respond. He couldn't help either but gave me the info on how to contact (by email) someone who might be able to help. He said tech support was very backlogged. When I finally reached the customer service dept. for resolutions he referred me to at headquarters, they were told by tech support that I had to pay for repair because I attempted to do an encryption which was not covered by warranty. I replied that I only did as instructed by tech support on the phone and didn't even know what an encryption was, let alone attempt to do one on my own.Finally, they said that as a \"one time courtesy\" they would repair the epad at no charge.

I never write reviews unless I am blown away by either awesomeness or sheer uselessness of a product. I previously used a motorla xoom 32gb with the Ice Cream Sandwich os update so for the most part my review will be based against my impression of that tablet.  To be honest i truly loved the Xoom which is why i decided to upgraded heck if 2 cores are great 4 must be incredible.  In that assumption i have not been let down.  I bought the madden football game to play on the xoom but, unless i scaled the graphics back to low it was virtually unplayable due to lag times(tackled before i even say the computer coming at me.  As far as the display is concerned it is crisp, clear and the colors are beautiful.  I realize that some people feel that the new ipad and transformer prime (and upcoming infinity ) have better graphics but, to my way of thinking it is like trying to see the difference between 720p and 1080p on an HDTV.  I just dont see the reason behind paying 150 dollars or more for that.  The TF300 is so so much clearer and  brighter than my previous tablet as too leave me blown away.  When i was looking at a new tablet i had a few considerations in mind based on my experiences with the previous tablet.  Firstly i wanted something that would let me play all my games as they were meant to be.  I do a lot of flying and i have adhd so anything that can keep me amused for more than five minutes is a beautiful thing for both myself and the people stuck around me. I looked at the upcoming toshiba as well as the prime and this tablet. The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).  That really narrowed my choices down to the tf300 however my second issue was battery life.  Might not seem like an issue however, when flying from doha to chicago on planes without outlets 10 hours of video or game usage goes quicker than you might think.  Thus i was back to the toshiba and tf300 having already ruled out the prime.  toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.  The tf300 like all asus transformers has a keyboard accessory which has added the advertised 5 hours to my usage time. The keyboard also adds quite a few other features which i find i like.  The keyboard itself is easy to use and has a number of shortcut keys like volume and brightness control which i find very useful.  Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.  The touchpad is useful but, i am finding that it is about 50/50 whether i use it or the touchscreen so not as big a selling point as you might think.  Also using the keyboard allows me to leave it plugged in and charging while i am using it without worrying about crimping the power cord or yanking it out of the wall socket.  So far the one negative thing is that it only has one speaker.  To be honest the speaker sounds amazing but, having sound come from only one side kind of puts it out of balance for me.  One last note,  a lot of the reviewers seem to not like the plastic case or at least have some issue with it.  I dont see the problem as most people are going to buy a case for the tablet to protect their investment thus rendering most tablets build materials a moot point ( hard to see the tablet case through leather or hard plastic).", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything we wanted, maybe even more!", "Author": "JandG", "ReviewID": "RYOEWG5TT2290", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did not get this from Amazon.

Everyone was telling me \"oh, you should get an I-pad... the apps for the I-pad are endless\"! Yeah, that's true, BUT, with the I-pad you are paying for most of the apps.Now let's see, the Transformer 300 has a Quad core processor which makes it extremely fast and reliable, it uses one of the best graphics processors, and to top it off it's Android based which means that it's an \"Open Source\" operating system that anyone and theirMother can create apps for. While some apps do come with a price, the majority of them are free of charge. Free is good!!!  I also want to make clear that the Transformer Tf300 that I purchased has 32Gb memory with a micro sd card slot for even more storage.Although I am a huge fan of Samsung products, I must say that ASUS really put the Galaxy tab to shame.

First thing this is my first tablet I own myself but I have many friends who own I pads and Samsung Galaxies but I was just waiting until my laptop finally retired to get one. This being said I have LOTS of time to weigh the pros and cons of all the tablets.Firstly, this tablet is amazing and any person who knows or wants value will buy it.Secondly, lets get to the specifics. Unless you work on a construction site and will be in the sun the entire day with your tablet, this screen will be amazing for you. Fortunately I am not a constuction manager so I use my tablet like normal people and this screen is outstanding. I watch countless videos on this thing. As I sit right now in my home office I am streaming How I Met Your Mother. This brings me to my third point.The wifi is better than the Ipads I have used. I live in a small town and where I live we don't get the best wifi reception, however my tablet gets a solid signal at a much further range than does my friends tablets or their laptops. Some complain about the plastic back. But fellow humans.... this was done to improve the wifi reception. On the note I say mission accomplish!The look and feel is amazing and let me get to the value aspect of it. The specs of the machine are the best around right now, the quad core is bullet fast. I have had one restart the first day I got it and that was cause it wasn't properly charged and I was downloading apps like a crazy person. Since then the apps run perfect and Google Play is littered with amazing apps which is why I love it as compared to the Apple Store. The widgets give you variety and allow you to have your personality of sorts on the tablet.Additionally, this is a 32 GIGABYTE tablet. The new Apple tablet cost almost $700 for the 32 gig. I just asked a 7 year old whats the difference and he correctly answered that there is a $300 price difference for a comparable tablet! Brighter screen worth $300 more dollars when you will rarely use it outside?Accessory wise there arent as many for this tablet yet but I found a few great ones  made by other companies.

The original tablet I received had a small defect on the bottom right corner of the screen where a bright white spot (not a dead pixel, much bigger than one pixel, more like a cluster of pixels, maybe one of the LEDs or nits behind the screen?) showed up every time the background color of the screen was white or a light color. It did not appear to impact the overall functioning of the tablet but was disturbing/distracting on a brand-new device. Called Amazon customer service on May 10th, explained the defect, received RMA soon afterward with pre-paid shipping label to return defective unit to Amazon via UPS, and was told that a replacement was being sent out (2-day UPS delivery). Much to my (pleasant) surprise, I received the replacement unit by early afternoon on May 11th, even before I had a chance to drop off the defective unit at a local UPS pick up station to return it to Amazon. After charging the replacement unit, powering it up and going through the initial set up process, I then examined it for any defects (in particular the screen to avoid getting a unit with the same problem as the first unit I received) and much to my relief found no apparent flaws or defects in the workmanship, build quality, or overall functioning of the replacement unit. So, long story short, if you are worried about getting a bad unit, don't worry. Amazon will make things right. I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this was my first time ever returning/exchanging an item, so I was naturally concerned about how painful (or not) the process would be when compared to returning items at a brick & mortar retail store. I'm glad it proved to be painless and pleasant, more so than I would have expected.Now onto the product itself.This is my first tablet and I was lured by the affordable price point, quad-core processor, well-designed keyboard dock (which I did get with the tablet in my initial order), large internal storage, and ICS operating system out of the box. I did look into the original Transformer Prime but shied away after reading all the reviews about the problems some owners have had with wireless reception. Realized that the Transformer 700 (Infinity?) is coming out soon/later this year but with its higher price point wasn't sure if it was worth spending so much money for a tablet when I wasn't 100 percent certain if I would be able to integrate it into my work needs and leisure pursuits. I figure if this Transformer 300 works out well, then I can always save up later to upgrade once I know for sure that a tablet can actually be useful for my needs. Because I rarely play games on my existing computers or watch much streaming video, whether I upgrade later to the Transformer 700 will depend wholly on how useful the Transformer 300 can be in my classroom instruction, lesson preparations, and one-on-one conferences with parents and students. Because I've only had this tablet for less than one week, maybe after I've used it for a while I'll come back to update this review to let others know how useful it can be for an educational setting.I did go to a box store to hold, play with, and examine a physical working model of this tablet (the 16GB one at BB) before deciding to purchase it here on Amazon (where the 32GB version was available for the same price as the 16GB version at BB). I was concerned about the screen resolution and quality, especially after hearing about the improved screen resolution for Apple's iPad 3 and the upcoming Transformer Prime 700. But after watching videos and browsing websites using the tablet at BB, decided that the resolution on this tablet, 1280x800, is perfectly fine for my needs. Despite initial misgivings about the plastic back instead of a metal/brushed aluminum back as found on the Prime, I find that it is sturdy enough for everyday use/handling. The volume on the speaker (even though it is mono and not stereo) is sufficiently loud enough and clear enough that it can be heard even in a somewhat noisy environment and is more than sufficient when one is using the tablet in a quiet home environment. Obviously audiophiles (which I am not) may still prefer the sound quality that can be heard when using earphones connected to the 3.5mm headphone jack. The touch screen has been responsive thus far. While the screen is not gorilla glass, it does not feel frail and fragile. Cannot comment on the software & apps yet because I haven't used it much. But I do think one of the niftier features of this tablet is that by signing in with an existing Google account that is also used on one's existing Android phone, by choosing to sync the tablet to the account the apps that one has already installed on one's Android smartphone will automatically be downloaded and installed onto the tablet along with preferences (i.e. bookmarks in the web browser).For the moment, I am pleased with my purchase and look forward to getting to know the various potential uses of this device in an educational setting. If after a while I notice any software or hardware issues that would result in me regretting this purchase or wanting to take points off the overall rating for this device, I will then post an update explaining the situation. For now, I think it's an amazing device and think anyone interested in getting a moderately priced tablet with pretty good standard features should definitely check it out for consideration before making a decision on what to ultimately get for themselves.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "I upgraded my ASUS t101 to the new t300...comparison", "Author": "AstroBob \"AstroBob\"", "ReviewID": "R1OZNE3AW9U275", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a ASUS t101 and loved it for the three weeks I had it. Found out that the new t300 came out and Best Buy policy is to take it back and swap for new one if less than 30 days. Both my friend and I bought original at same time so we both traded in...thanks BB!They even gave us $30 back since the new one was on sale!The new one has some differences. Quad core vs. duo core is main one but also now has 8mp full 1080p HI DEF video capability (old was 5mp 740p video) both taking and sending to your monitor. I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative). Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah). It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101. The  micro is more available due to its being used by movie camcorders so a positive. Screen is still gorgeous and output to any big monitor through HDMI is outstanding...I use it for astronomy lectures. You can also get a HDMI to SVGA for those older commputer projectors/monitors. The screen format is wide screen so a better match to modern TVs and monitors than the Apple 4x5 format.  Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop. Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off. Beats my HP laptop which with a extra large battery gets about 5 hours.The wifi performance is fine...they use a plastic case so no issues with metal case killing the wifi or blue tooth . I tested in real world use alongside my two HP  laptops Pavilion DV6s Win7 64 bit....the ASUS t300 just slightly beat both on distance from  router which was in my basement and computers were on next floor up...through wooden floor and a couple of walls.. That was a worry as the previous fancier version called the Transformer Prime had a major issue with limited wifi distance due to a metal case.Quad core does make a difference in processor intensive apps like Sky Safari and SKEye but it isn't like night and day. I have used Ipads and frankly the addition of the keyboard, quad core and ease of memory expansion puts the ASUS ahead. I also love that I can take my 500GB USB hard disk and use it interchangeably on both my  Win7 64 bit machines and the ASUS. Using the included program you can read and right in Word and Excel to swap back and forth. I can also use a flash drive to exchange data.I also love having option of tablet standard operation or keyboard WITH mousepad. My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem. Tablet locks to keyboard so no danger of it falling out like another brand I tried.Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5....wish it had a user replaceable battery...same issue with Ipads. And like all laptops.. Wish it had red backlit key letters for low light/dark conditionsBy the way it does support AD HOC wifi which is necessary for me so I can use a SKY FI device to connect wirelessly to my telescopes and operate them remotely...works flawlessly. Rooting is not necessary.  The Android version of Sky Safari is identical to Apple version and works perfectly...my main reason for getting the ASUS. Beware that some Android brands do NOT allow use of the Sky Fi due to the AD HOC issue.There are probably a million apps for Android...I like idea of not being tied to Itunes and the open architecture has advantages.In short a most amazing product.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Right Decision", "Author": "Mark M", "ReviewID": "RB9CIZ7QT4Y7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my tablet - it does not replace my laptop, but its portability and features are what I was looking for in a tablet.

Cracks all over the place.  I contacted them and sent them a picture of the cracked screen as they requested along with an explanation of what and how it happened.  This was after they gave me two non-operative email addresses to them and I had to find the correct one after searching around.  They acknowledged the picture, gave me a case number and a number to call.  I did just that with the following result:1. they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.  I asked why I needed to do this when they asked for a picture.  What was the purpose of that if not to evaluate the case?  They didn't know, I had to send it in.2. I then asked them how much it would cost to repair if they decided--arbitrarily, of course--that it wouldn't be covered under the warranty (which, of course, it should be since only a defect in manufacturing either in the tablet or the docking station could cause a spontaneous crack).  They said $248.  I told them that was ridiculous because I could but a refurbished one getting the whole thing again for $202.  No response.2. I then said to tell me what the replacement part number was if I wanted to repair it myself.  They said they didn't have the information.  They don't have the replacement number for their own product?  Ridiculous.  They just want to obviously overcharge you for their ridiculous repair cost for their defective product they don't want to repair themselves under the warranty.3.  They could, of course, tell me how much the part they don't have a number for costs though.  That was $148.  Gee, how do you know what it costs if you don't have the number Asus?  This, of course, is also ridiculous as you can easily find an OEM replacement for it on the internet for around $60 or so, meaning they are overcharging you some $88 just for the part.4. That leaves $100 for them to do the labor to repair it for you.  Gee, a quick search of the internet shows a video on how to do it yourself which takes about 20 minutes to do if you do it slowly and carefully.  That means they are charging you at a rate of $300 an hour to do the repair for you (actually probably more like $4-500 and hour since an experienced tech could certainly do it much faster).5.  Needless to say, I told them what they could do with their company and hung up, telling them I was going to post this experience online for all to read.

ASUS should have never let this last OS upgrade go out, and on the forums there seems to be many experiencing these random reboots.Since I wrote the above review, I discovered another issue when buying from Amazon.  Evidently I bought the tablet from \"Amazon Wharehouse\" which can not be returned after 30 days.  However, even more an issue, I went to the ASUS site to register the tablet to get some fleeting support.  Well I couldn't register it because the serial number was already registered.  I can't even give ASUS an email because you have to be registered owner first.  When I bought it there was no re-manufactured warning, instead I guess these is a tablet returned and then resold.

I don't sit down and hunt for imperfections, I wait for them to interrupt me. Then I get angry. Anyways, this tablet is the slightly streamlined version of ASUS' other tablets - this one has a bit less CPU power, more plastic, and not as great of camera utility/quality. The plastic is weak - it resists scratches really well by having a patterned design, but against any impact, the plastic just kinda gives and leaves nasty marks and dents. I would suggest a case for it, or that you baby this more than your child. Drop it on anything hard and you'll be trying to get used to the damage.

I can't tell you how annoying lack of updates was with my phone. ASUS cares. One annoyance: plugging in a SD card, and having it treat it like a forever-external drive that it's compelled to constantly have a notification of it's foreign-ness. Just integrate and shut up. It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out. It doesn't care that you put it in there because you wanted more space for the tablet alone! In general I like it.

Doesn't matter if it is inserted in the dock or not. I have no SD card installed. I have babied this tablet from the day I got it (I have OCD on stuff like that) and there is no way the hardware issue is from abuse from me.

Someone with other Apple equipment would be very happy with the iPad.For the cost, though, this ASUS is already better. I suspect that any future replacement will cost even less and be better still.

I doubt I'll fill up the 16GB. But if I do, external SD card storage is better for me anyway.

Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front. This could have been engineered better, though mechanically, it's fine. I have other Android tablets, most notably the Motorola Xoom, which was billed as a premium tablet when it came out, and it is. The Asus is not quite there in perception of quality, but it is easier to use than the Xoom by a good margin. Part of that is the fact that the Asus has the new Android ICS OS, and part of it is that I prefer the Asus UI over the Xoom's (also, the volume buttons on the Xoom might be the industry's worst). However, one of the main reasons I got this tablet was its upgrade to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and with the exception of the ability to make folders and thereby only needing one screen for all of my apps (I always have many more than I need), I'm NOT impressed with that new operating system.

The really neat part about it to me is that it has a keyboard dock.  The dock  protects the screen a little while also recharging the tablet's battery.  The keyboard also expands the capacity with removable SD cards and USB mass storage.  I can connect my camera directly to my tablet or I can remove the memory card from the camera and insert it into the dock and backup or share them easily without the need to have a laptop.  And of course the best part of the keyboard dock is that you have the full screen devoted to your application without a touch keyboard taking up precious screen real estate.  Other devices can connect to keyboards via Bluetooth, but then you still need something to hold the tablet up.  The keyboard dock does this as well as to recharge the tablet battery!Recently I used the tablet while shopping for a washing machine.  The included SuperNote app allowed me to easily intermix photographs, handwriting, typing, and drawings while taking notes of what we liked and didn't like about each unit.  I even use this to complement my Kindle Touch when reading books with figures or images that don't display well on e-ink.I would strongly recommend buying this with Multi-Functional Docking Station for ASUS TF300T Tablet, Blue (TF300T-DOCK-BL).", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE", "Author": "oldmanyoungatheart", "ReviewID": "R1TCENL7IABY9K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "price nd user friendliness", "Author": "loves books", "ReviewID": "R2V67Y82KI2M2C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i do not know much about tablets,i am no tech savvy, and for me to be able to use it comfortably, says something. also, price-wise, who can beat 393 bucks (from Amazon= where i get most, if not all of my gadgets, nd ETC) for a 32 GIG tablet.my nephew has the old Transformer and liked it very much nd told me to get ASUS. i waited until the T 300(as i call it), came out. i was an apple user and FAN for a lonnngggggg  for Ipods but found out , there are other products whc are competitive in QUALITY but i don't have to pay the big bucks...thank you ASUS and PLEASE don't increase your price. it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus Tablet", "Author": "volfan254", "ReviewID": "R39B4GN01C73JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been waiting for a tablet with the quad core processor.

I haven't been disappointed either. Having read many reviews of this and other tablets and having used the TF201 and Ipads, I thought this would be a safe middle ground, not too expensive but with very good hardware and software.I have the tablet for a 2 weeks now and have found nothing wrong with the operation of the tablet, very smooth with none of the issues others seem to have had. Maybe I have been one of the lucky ones, I dont know. The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen. It is a finger print magnet. They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible. But considering the price mark of the tablet, you cannot have everything. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "tf300 vs. sl101 (slider)", "Author": "Joe King", "ReviewID": "RGQM369MNJVSS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I figure there must be some people who are considering the TF300 or the SL101 (Slider), especially given that you can get them for roughly equivalent prices (with the TF300 dock/keyboard).  I have both now (running ICS on Slider) and though I like both a lot, I do have opinions on their differences:Build/Fit/Finish:  The SL101 wins.  Apart from the somewhat odd keyboard sliding mechanism, the SL101 has an awesome feel.  Rubberized surfaces, rounded/beveled edges, two-tone styling.  The TF300 is plastic.  The grip made with grooves in the plastic on the back give an odd feeling.  Almost tickles when you move your fingers across it.  I prefer the rubberized surface much more.Performance:  Of course, the specs tell you that the TF300 is the winner.  And it is.  However, it is just the barest perception of a difference when used side-by-side for normal use.  I'm going to reserve judgment though for gaming.  No noticeable difference in the games I do play, but then I haven't really gotten a game that is built for the Tegra 3 yet.  I notice that there are some games you can only get for the Tegra 3, so even then, I wouldn't be able to do a comparison.  That in and of itself is a comparison ...  Available games:  TF300 wins again.Cameras:  TF300 takes it.  Not just because of Megapixels, but the image is less grainy.  There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.  It is really grainy.  This includes the front-facing camera as well.  The other thing to consider is video conferencing.  The TF300 takes it there too.  The image is better and with the dock you can easily adjust the angle of the camera.  The SL101 has a fixed angle, and it is some what \"up your nose\".Typing:  TF300 wins.  The keyboard on the SL101 takes a little getting used to, but the TF300 is natural right off the bat.  The button to turn off the mouse pad is your best friend, because the mouse is very easy to touch with your thumb while you type and in turn moves focus on your screen to something else.  Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.  It does better with touch.  Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.  I use it all the time.  It's just not as nice.  Plus, the TF300 comes with an extra row of very useful keys, and of the keys that the SL101 does have, I think their location on the TF300 is better.Touch while propped up with Keyboard:  SL101 wins.  The angle I was complaining about before for video conferencing is actually why I prefer the SL101 in all other uses.  The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.  It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.  The TF300 reach and angle are very different.  It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.  Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.  Touching the screen tips the balance.  Of course, this may be the point where you decide that using the mouse pad is the best choice for the TF300.  Personally, the mouse to me is not a desirable feature for a device based on touching.Screen:  SL101 wins.  There is nothing wrong with the TF300 screen, but side-by-side, the SL101 seems more vibrant and has better darkness (contrast).  It is still pretty close though and I wouldn't make a choice based on that alone.Battery:  TF300 wins.  I haven't actually run a test to prove this side-by-side, but by all reports, and especially given the TF300 dock carries an extra battery, it should win.Weight:  No winner.  This one is apples to oranges.  The SL101 has a keyboard built into it and is marginally lighter than the TF300 with the keyboard attached.  The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.  The TF300 when detached from the keyboard is very light.  Overall, I prefer the feel of the SL101, with or without the keyboard extended.So, that wraps it up.  I personally think that it is unfortunate ASUS seems to be dropping the SL101 form-factor.  I guess it didn't sell that well, but all thing being equal between devices, I'd prefer it.  Here though, all things are not equal.  The TF300 has some other advantages that might tip into your favor.  If asked which one I would keep though, it would still be the SL101 slider.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer support from ASUS", "Author": "lpedreros", "ReviewID": "R2PC6UII5MSVW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet, along with the Transformer Prime have horrible GPS lock issues.

I have to admit that I go to meetings where the tablet of choice is an IPad. I raised my eyebrows at that.  Have to have a wireless keyboard and the machinations that I see my colleagues go through to make the keyboard work makes me scratch my head. Why go through all that?  I know that other tablets also run off of wireless keyboards but again why?The dock is what sold me on the Asus TF300T.  The keyboard when attached offers an SD slot which is perfect for me and can charge separate from the tablet.  The combined battery life when connected to the dock is totally off the hook.  Can't do that with an IPad!My Asus updated itself to Jelly Bean 4.2 and updated the Asus firmware as well.  There is no bloatware from Asus although I have to say that I am not crazy about what Google wants me to run (things that I will never use for example the Calendar) but you can kill the apps in Task Manager and is NOT a reflection of the tablet or Asus.There is some confusion about installing a Flash player.

I absolutely see the benefit of having this in my work.  It's NO toy.The keyboard dock takes a little getting used to but compared to typing on the screen it's a snap!  The processor is very snappy. I have not noticed a lag period.  I purchased the 32G bundle and for the price that I paid I am over the moon.  Some reviewers have knocked the \"plastic\" feel of this model of the Transformer but think about this - your laptop is plastic does it affect how you use it?  This is no different.  Some reviewers have also made mention of the rear speaker. I have to say that I pretty much keep my tablet in the dock so I haven't found the rear speaker to be an issue.  Although the sound bar is really small it really delivers stereo sound.  The one thing that I find annoying is the weather widget that comes installed.  It doesn't update well and it's cumbersome to get the GPS to turn on even with permissions.  I have tried other weather widgets with the same issue.  Not sure if it's an issue with me, the widget(s) or GPS but it makes me grumpy.  I haven't attempted to use the microSD slot in the tablet or the HDMI but see no reason why they wouldn't work.  Please note that the full-sized SD slot and the USB port are on the DOCK, not the tablet. An owners manual DOES NOT come with the tablet but you can download it off the web.  If you have upgraded to Jelly Bean 4.2 the information will be off slightly but you will get the gist of what the manual is telling you.  You also have the option to revert to the 4.1 launcher if you desire.The tablet comes with Polaris Office (think Open Office) which is compatible with Microsoft, what a bonus!  The only apps that I have installed are Adobe Reader and Evernote (how cool is Evernote?).  You can get Asus to sync your docs I haven't tried that yet but Evernote syncs seamlessly!Yes, I do love my Asus TF300T bundle.  I really do.  Best tech investment I've made after my much beloved smartphone!  Don't hesitate to purchase but make sure you get the dock.  Also watch the prices on the bundle which can swing as much as 50.00 either way. I got mine for under 380.00, if it had been 400+, it would have made me think a really long and hard time.

This happens for multiple apps, which is why I suspect the problem is NOT the applications.The crashing needs to be fixed. I have seen NONE of these types of crashes on my galaxy S2.-I understand this is a review for the tablet, but my keyboard dock has stopped functioning. None of the keys work and is now rendered absolutely useless.-Android is pretty much stock. If you compare this to any Galaxy or Sony phone/tablet, you'll find some extra flare/widgets/apps added to the OS.Conclusion: I'm torn whether or not to even RMA this device.

I love the weight, the dimensions, the hardware specs!Asus also just pushed Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) 2 days ago, so that's rad!My biggest complaint, and it's the android industry in general, is the lack of accessories. But that's no fault of this tablet. There are enough basic options out there. And this may change over time and Asus continues making devices in these dimension.One minor complaint with this plastic version of the Prime is some movement along the edge of the screen. It's really pretty minor, but I notice when holding it at the corners that the screen edge can be squeezed into the case a fraction of a millimeter. Additionally, with the case I bought, because it fits very snuggly, also started to pull the back cover off a teeny bit around the camera when I first put them together. So be careful. But this is why we're paying $380 instead of $500 :)Other than that, I'm very happy. I've hardly touched my macbook in the 2 weeks since I got this.Tip: Accessories that adhere to the device via suction or other \"removable\" adhesive methods probably won't work because of the radial texture on the back.Tip: Here's a dimensions table of similar devices that I put together to help me find compatible accessories.MODEL  DIMENSIONS (IN.)

Everything is good --- when it is working.I have been using the tablet for less than a month. In the first week, the screen protector and cover that I ordered has arrived. So I put it on, but at that time I found the screen has an uneven intensity when it is showing white. I feel sad about that but it can be tolerated. Indeed, I can't see it if I am not looking at it closely.After the third week of my use, suddenly one day, I found the screen cracked! The glass is not broken but the LCD cracked. The system still running, and I can still retrieve my file using the USB. I swear I did nothing. May be temperature change due to this hot summer, or may be I put it in my car's trunk that shaked it. But I cannot see anything now. Simply speaking: It is dead.To all who want to buy this tablet: DO NOT BUY IT.I searched on the web, and I found that the higher end model such as TF700 has stronger screen. And TF300 is **very easy** to have the screen broken. Same manufacturer, but the price difference made a huge difference on durability. If you can afford it, get a high-end model with so-called \"gorilla glass\" that might make it more durable. But this one, no, no, no!UPDATE: I got back from Asus. They refuse to do any repair under warranty. Can you imagine that a screen problem is always customer's fault no matter what? That's Asus! You know what? They even have the template response for that ---\"I have not received any internal reports that there is some kind ofdefect w/ the LCD screen where it would just break/rupture on its ownw/out some kind of intervention (i.e. drops, excessive pressure, misuse,something being dropped on the unit, etc.), therefore I must follow ourstandard policy which excludes physical damage from warranty coverage.Being that this isn't covered by the warranty the labor fee would applyif you'd like the LCD repaired.  I would be willing to offer you a 15%discount off the total cost of the repair to reduce the price for you.\"Exactly the same text you can see from another review here. A response template exists because the screen problem is very very common, as you can see from Amazon's review. The problem is common because that is a design fault. And Asus insist that it is customer's fault. Now Asus is trying to ask you to pay 50% of the price of this tablet to repair.

I had a  Viewsonic G Tablet that i had flashed with various versions of android with good and bad results but got tired of having to support my own device. After much research I landed on this Asus TF 300 with the keyboard/doc. I have now had this over two weeks and I have to admit this meets every need I have...and I have a lot. I use this product for business and pleasure. At work I use it with multiple cloud based solutions for sharing files, note taking, etc...I also RDP into Terminal servers using various products and join webinars on a regular basis. I experiment all the time with new apps to increase efficiency and all perform incredibly on the TF300.  At hom, e, I play games (including Flash...wink,wink), watch movies, Facebook, YouTube, browse the web, and anything else you can do with a tablet.. All in all, I work my tablets hard and this device hasn't broken a sweat or run out of battery. I read reviews about slow browsing which I think is somewhat inherent in Android 4.0 as I learned during my 'flashing' days and was ready to return this product and go with an iPad if performance was similar to my other tablet. Apparently Asus has released a few updates prior and one since I owned but frankly, never noticed any browsing issues since i owned it. Nothing but power and speed. Now don't get me wrong...Android is Android and the occasional force stop message and the need to reboot once in a while to 'clear it's head' are to be expected...but frankly since iOS 5, I don't know that my iPhone 4 fares all that much better. BUT, Android does allow for so much more customization, storage options, a browseable file system, and a huge array of useful widgets that make me a fan. And don't even get me started on what value the keyboard/doc brings to anyone wanting to use this as a business device. I can carry this with me from meeting to meeting and continue to easily stay productive. It may not be a MacBook Air, but for half the price, this allows me to be just as productive. The keyboard included a track pad for a mouse cursor and has a USB port if you wanted to connect a physical mouse and adds 5 hours of battery life on top of it.

I read all the reviews of other customers, and seen that some are having the same concens, if not more. I have learned soooo much from all the reviews and resolved issues also. Youtube has been a wonderful place to go to understand a lot about the tablet. Like some have said the instrucitons are not really robust. I purchased this on the reviews on Amazon and from Cnet, and other sites that I have visited. Was looking at Acer but for the cost and for memory this one was it.  I do belive that this is a good tablet, I just think that I got one that is not built quite right. I will play with it more in a few days to see if anything changes with it.

This one has a quality concern. Turned on the Asus this weeked and came on real slow, then when everything came up, I seen that it stated that I was charging at 82%.

Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.

I liked the tablet since day one, but just got a bad one. They were happy to exchange it, which I really thought I was going to have problems with this, but didn't. It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch. Have gotten all my updates, and running like butter. Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach. Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet. If you do get this make sure you get the dock and the case for it. It will make it look, good and protect it also. You will get rid of the top heavy concern. My friends are really impressed with what I can do with this, and so am I. This will be a journey with this tablet and I hope it last me for awhile until the next best thing comes along, but until then I will roll with this one.

Running on normal mode (you have power saver, normal, and performance), this tablets takes on everyday tasks and even some very intensive games like a champ. The screen is also beautiful enough to truly show off to friends and family, and combined with the speed can already get some auto buys from some people. The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people. Some minor downsides include no flash on the back camera (taking pictures can become difficult because of this), a battery life that only lasted between 6-8 hrs, a badly placed speaker that gets muffled if the table is on its back, and no expandable memory.

Any confidence in Asus products has gone out the window and I would never purchase anything of there's in the future and i would recommend for anyone to stay away!2nd UPDATE OCT 25 (touch screen still does not work after being serviced)-------------After contacting support, I was told to create an RMA and ship the tablet to one of the service centers. After a couple of week I received the tablet back, when I turned on the tablet the initial screen worked and and i set it down. When I came back and had to swipe the lock, ONCE AGAIN THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE TOUCH SCREEN and I CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH THE TABLET.What was the use of spending my money to ship the tablet to the service center and they can't even fix the issue! Once again I'd recommend NOT purchasing this product, even when you ship it back to get repaired they send it back with the same issues.------------------------------FIRST COMMENT (touch screen does not work)Bought this tablet a month and a half ago. Without even installing any apps the system started constantly freezing. Its completely useless when everytime I try to browse or open gmail the system freezes. Rebooting and cold rebooting doesn't help.Then 2 weeks after amazons 30 day return policy, the touch screen completely stopped working.I tried to reboot, cold reboot, wipe data and now all i get is the startup screen when you boot up the tablet for the very first time and because the touch screen does not work I can't get past the initial page.When the tablet is working, it's great!! But needless to say as much as I do not want apple products, maybe I should have gone with an ipad. As much as Asus is still probably trying to work things out with their technology, my suggestion to you is to stay away from Asus tablets. More of a waste of time trying to get repaired and probably a complete waste of $300.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Hope D.

The graphics are awesome too.  I purchased the keyboard as well, and i'm amazed at how long the battery lasts.  I can play around on this thing for hours and don't have to worry about the battery one bit.  This probably isnt the most technical review, but i truely believe this tablet is worth looking at.

Running on balanced power mode and at 25% brightness, it was running only 5-6 hours.Returning and getting the replacement unit was very easy with Amazon. Initially, I contacted ASUS to ask whether the real-life battery time I am getting is reasonable or if I have a defective unit. Tech. support is essentially useless. They have very poor knowledge on the product they are servicing and lacking even common knowledge on electronics. Example: one tech support insisted that 10 hours of battery life advertised is the 'stand-by' time as in the cell phone, and 5-6 hours of usable battery time is normal, which makes absolutely no sense. ASUS does not seem to educate their tech support properly.Now I have new replacement unit and the battery life is much longer 7-8 hours under the same condition, although it is still shorter than what they advertise. But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button. It's wide enough to notice easily.

The reboots may occur while surfing the web, in the settings screen, or in any other app. The reboots were especially frequent when I tried to download data via USB from my desktop to the tf300 (after installing ASUS sync application on the desktop still got reboots).Initially I thought it might be a firmware or android problem, however they were both up to date (As of 16'th June). Then I was told by customer service to try factory reset, which did not help at all. Currently I'm trying to return or replace the unit at the local dealer but even this is difficult.Its a shame that Asus debugs its product and production line on the backs of their customers.

I've had this tablet for a month, and it has satisfied my needs in almost every way.However, I discovered that the wall wart to charge this table outputs 15V rather than the 5V the iPad charger has, and the same 5V you get from a computer's USB slot. This means that you cannot effectively charge this tablet via any method except the wall wart, and I imagine you shouldn't use the wall wart with any other device. I imagine the reason for the 15V is either a hardware requirement or possibly a proprietary requirement.

The LCD cracks VERY easily.  I have only had mine for just over 1 month.  It has been in a protective case and has been handled with care.I have had an ipad since the original so I am very used to a tablet.  Anyway, I don't even know how it cracked.  It wasn't dropped, bumped or held by the corner.  The housing and glass are perfect (no scratches, marks or anything). After looking at it carefully, it seems the housing does not provide enough support.  After it cracked, I gently flexed it and with the slightest of pressure you can see the housing flex and the LCD flexing inside.  I liked the usability and the overall device but there is NO WAY I would buy another one until they fix this issue. I guess the metal housing on the ipad keeps it from flexing.By the way, I called ASUS and they are not very helpful. I was on hold for nearly an hour.  I could barely understand the first person I talked with.  I then asked to speak to a manager.  He was fairly easy to understand and attempted to be helpful but he just kept telling me I had put too much pressure on the screen. I am far from an Apple fan (in fact that's what drove me to try the ASUS).  However, ASUS could learn a thing or two from Apple Customer Care.I have read other reviews regarding this LCD issue but ASUS was adamant that I caused too much force and that's what broke the screen.  Again, my advice is if you haven't bought one, don't until they fix the LCD issue. If you have bought one, handle it like you would an egg and strongly consider buying some type of a warranty that covers screen cracking.I honestly think there should be a recall or some type of a warranty on these LCD's.  I am convinced there is a design flaw or faulty parts involved.  Does anyone know how we go about having someone look into doing something like this?  Is there an online site or an address to mail to where we could make a request that this be looked at?UPDATE AFTER REPAIR - So, I sent the tablet in for repair after being told they could test it to see what caused it to crack.  I told them that was great because I knew I didn't anything more than normal pressure on it.  Well, I got an email back saying I broke it (Customer Induced Damage).  I called to find out how their tests concluded that when I knew better.  I was then told that they didn't have a way of testing it but that it was certified during original testing to withstand 50kg (110 lbs).  So, for anyone reading this, take comfort - your TF300 (according to ASUS) will withstand 110 lbs of pressure on the LCD without breaking.  I can promise you that is not true.  I wouldn't be comfortable with it withstanding 10 lbs of pressure....I know mine didn't.Anyway, they won't budge.  They just keep saying it was my fault.  In all fairness, the lady I dealt with was being as nice as she could be.  She didn't have final say and she can't help that her company doesn't care about the customer.  I am sure she needs the job so she isn't going to do anything to risk it.  So, I pay the ransom to get my tablet back.  It arrives and I turn it on to test it out.  After a short while, I find out the screen does not respond to touch on the narrow edge near the headphone jack.  I was using an application in protrait mode and the icon to close the app was located on the bottom edge.  When I touched the icon, nothing happened.  I then tried out more apps and more icons on the botton edge and it doesn't work.  I can rotate it so the top edge becomes the botton edge and the icons then respond to touch.So, my nightmare with Asus and their poor products, poor quality and poor customer service continues.  For everyone loving theirs, my only hope is that you never have a problem because at that point, you will regret the day you ever trusted this company with your money.

I emailed their customer service for a repair ticket 5 days ago and am still waiting.  Two stars for the decent tablet and no stars for no-customer-service.Update:  after waiting 7 days for a response to my email, I finally called the customer support.

Companies like Canon will provide a pre-paid shipping label when I've dealt with them in the past.  I would think a reputable company like ASUS would do the same which is why I paid a higher price than for one of the cheap knock-off brands.Update 10/25/12:  Sent in the tablet and it needs a complete main board replacement!  This is a major repair to a two month old tablet that will be done in the back of a shop instead of the clean room factory environment.  I contacted ASUS to request replacement instead as the tablet will no longer be the same after such a major repair.  It doesn't even make sense cost wise to as the tablet retails for $350.00.  I can't imagine their cost is more than half of that.  What does it cost to replace a main board in a repair center?  Needless to say they refused.

I prefer the flexibility of Android and I already have an Android phone so I decided to give this one a try.  I also do not want to install iTunes on any of my PCs.I decided to purchase a tablet because I do not like having to boot up or keep a PC running just to check my email, surf the web, watch a video, or read an ebook.  I decided to go with this unit because it's being sold at a reasonable price for its specs.  I really wanted a tablet with a USB port so I could transfer photos in the field but no models so equipped were/are available at the time with an IPS screen (another one of my requirements).  In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.  I do not believe in spending big bucks on something that I can't do real work on so I stayed away from the expensive iPads and premium Android models like the ASUS Transformer Prime.I have mixed feelings after using the TF300 for a couple of days.  It is speedy and comes with plenty of RAM.  RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.  Pretty much all the programs that I have tried on it fly and I haven't noticed any bothersome slow-downs that some have noted.  The USB adapter works but I would have much preferred a cable because it becomes a rather long moment arm hanging off of a delicate connector when it is in place.  Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.  For normal use this is fine because the screen flips automatically but some programs, mainly games, insist on displaying in only in native orientation.The screen is more than bright enough for indoor use but not enough for daylight outdoors.  It's also a HUGE finger magnet. At this point in time, the \"Next iPad\", with its much higher resolution screen (I refuse to use their incorrect marketing jargon for it) just wipes the floor with all the Android tablet displays out there.  Hopefully that will change sometime soon but I foresee the manufacturers charging a large premium for the increased resolution.  The screen does have some minor light bleed that is noticeable when the background is black but nothing that I consider overly objectionable.  What bothers me more is that when the background is completely white I can see a slight yellowish gradient near the top.  Not sure if most people would notice this but it bothers me; especially when I'm reading ebooks.  Both Wifi and GPS work great.  I wish there were speakers on both, or even three sides like some competitors have, but they sound clear and are loud enough for me.  If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.  The build quality (or maybe the internal design) is not what I would call \"bulletproof\".  When I push on the screen near the left bezel I can feel it flex.  If I look into the microSD port I can see the opening change shape when it's flexing.  I'm worried about the long term repercussions of this.  The screen feels solid around the rest of the bezel perimeter.  I checked on the display model at a local store and it has the same issue so unfortunately this does not appear to be an isolated case.Being a fan of Google Sky, I quickly found that ecompass to be terrible.  It's off by about 90 degrees and very inconsistent.  I've tried calibrating it and trying different applications with no luck.  If anyone knows how to put this tablet into diagnostic mode let me know so I can figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.I'll try to update this review as I log more time with the unit.

And that's not including the keyboard.  The TF300 runs the few games and apps I have tried, so far, without a glitch.Pros:It is extremely fast.It has lots of memory( I got the 32gig), and options to add more( micro sd on the tablet and full sd card with the keyboard).The 10 inch display is stunningly beautiful.The tablet is not too heavy for its size.The wifi is very strong.The GPS works great.The body of the tablet feels solid.Keyboard option.I haven't found any of the problems others have so far.

Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Good, Affordable Tablet With Some Minor Quibbles", "Author": "Antonio Shaw \"SHAWAM!!!\"", "ReviewID": "R15I6A9D0QXQQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Besides its price, I opted for the Transformer TF300 over the Transformer Prime because its plastic construction wasn't as flimsy as I'd been led to believe, and the plastic build also ensured I'd have better wi-fi reception and avoid the issues with GPS and signal strength that the Prime suffered from. With the exception of the Prime's aluminum body, longer-lasting battery, camera flash, and moderately brighter screen, the TF300 is practically identical while costing significantly less.The TF300 has the same Tegra 3 quad-core processor as the Prime, and it shows; it's fast, powerful, and fluid. It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together). Still, it's far louder than even my laptop. When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black. That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but the screen on my Galaxy S2 blows this thing out of the water. The Pad's colors aren't as vibrant and text/images aren't nearly as sharp. It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors. If you don't already have a mobile device with amazingly high resolution and vivid colors, then you probably won't have any problems with the Pad's screen at all. The native browser is unforgivably slow and buggy at times; hopefully, they rectify this in a future update.As for the battery, I'm impressed. I'm not a heavy user (I mainly use my tablet to play word games and do light web browsing and reading), so I find that I rarely have to charge my TF300, perhaps once every other day. Apps that are optimized for tablets really shine on this device thanks to ICS and the quad-core processor. With the exception of the browsers, I've never had problems with any of the apps that were actually optimized or specifically designed for tablets. I love the keyboard dock. It is, of course, significantly smaller than a regular desktop or laptop keyboard, but if you're at all comfortable with typing on netbooks then you shouldn't have any problems using the keyboard dock. I have fairly large hands for a man, but I still find the keyboard dock adequate, just make sure you turn off the hyper-sensitive track pad while you're typing. Oh, and the keyboard charges the Pad when you dock it, provided the keyboard dock has an adequate charge.The keyboard dock leads me to my biggest and final gripe with the TF300: it doesn't come with productivity software. This should have been a no-brainer, especially when one considers that Asus made such a functional keyboard dock in the first place. Yes, you can use Google Docs (now merged into Google Drive, if you weren't yet aware), but that presents you with Google Docs' main shortcoming: you need to be connected to the internet in order to use it. If I could open, edit, save, and create word documents without having to be connected to the internet I'd probably get rid of my laptop, or at least relegate it to the same dust-gathering status of my netbook.So, that was my rather long review of the Asus Transformer Pad TF300. I'm truly pleased with it, despite some shortcomings. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for an Android tablet. If you've always wanted the Asus Transformer Prime but were put off by its sticker price and/or GPS/wireless issues, then this is absolutely the tablet for you.UPDATE-6/17/2012It was brought to my attention that the included software, Polaris Office, is a productivity suite. I opened it up briefly when I first received my tablet and assumed it was nothing more than a file manager, but you can, in fact, create word documents and such with it.UPDATE-6/18/2012After doing some research for a problem I was having with Polaris Office (it would open my Word documents but it wouldn't let me edit them) I found out that there is a major bug with this software that causes random, irreparable corruption of files.

The 1280 by 800 screen looks pretty great and is better than most laptops. It may not look as great as the Ipad 3 but it is great for it's price point. Some games like Shadowgun thd and Galaxy on Fire 2 look amazing. Also the cameras are quite formidable, the 8mp on the back takes detailed, natural pictures but works best outside and the front facing is fine for video chatting.The speakers sound really good, nice and loud for such a small device.

Google's Ice Cream Sandwich is pretty great but still has some flaws and glitches. I find the multitaksing way better than in ios and same with task management. I find myself using both the stock browser and chrome beta with some issues on both of them. With flash I love that I can surf the web in its true form and I like being able to automatically set to desktop sites always. Google Play store is certainly a work in progress but it has a good number of apps and is looking nicely.

While I've had a few crashing apps that's mostly due to me rooting the device and whatnot. Anyways the interface and custom widgets really make it look cooler than iOS but the play store and ease of setting up apps isn't as great.Battery life: It's really great and I find that even doing stuff like watching films or downloading files doesn't take a huge toll on the battery.Storage: The 32 gb SSD is fast and works great, expandable memory up to 32 gigs is also awesome.Cons:If you hold the tablet for a long time it can feel warm around your grip. Also as I've mentioned the screen smudges pretty easily.The stock keyboard kinda sucks, luckily you can change it which I would highly recommend. I got the thumb keyboard which I find easier to type on though there is occasionally some lag.There simply aren't as many apps.

It's even rather overpriced at current market value. It's a decent tablet if you can get it on sale, but otherwise, there are better options today.With that said, however, I'll be judging the functionality of this tablet based on the time it was released. When this tablet came out, it was one of the more powerful ones on the market. The Tegra 3 was a top-of-the-line SoC and even the lower binned chips in the TF300t were still rather snappy compared to the higher binned chips in the TF700 or TF200. Using the stock Asus Android build, it was a little choppy here and there. While Android itself was largely unmodified in the stock build, Asus added a lot of bloatware to push their ecosystem of services. These apps generally ran in the background and could not be killed/uninstalled. As a result, they ate up a non-trivial amount of processing power and memory. Unlocking and rooting the tablet (A relatively easy process thanks to the good people over at XDA) and installing a custom ROM meant you could overclock the CPU/GPU, and get rid of the bloatware. With that modification, the tablet rivaled anything else on the market, and definitely was one of the better priced options in the high-end market.The wifi and GPS on the TF300t was greatly improved over the previous TF200, thanks to the plastic body. It still retained that swirled finish, which looked very nice and was practical too, since it provided a better grip.The single external speaker was pitiful as most tablet speakers are. However, the TF300t speaker was particularly irritating because it was on the side of the tablet when held in landscape. This means that watching a movie or playing a game in landscape (as they should be watched/played) meant that you only got sound out of one side, which doesn't sound like a big problem but it actually is really annoying really quickly considering that tablet speakers tend to be tinny sounding and aurally grating. Imagine someone talking loudly into one ear, and you'll know what it was like to listen to this speaker at any useable volume. If the speaker were centered on the top, this would have been a much better location for it.The resolution is 1280x800, with the Android notification and home bars on the top and bottom, meaning effective screen resolution was basically 720p. For a 10\" tablet, this is adequate, but pixels are noticeable when you're doing up-close reading or surfing. There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video. This was a common problem for this model, and in general, is a common problem with IPS screens.The biggest drawback to this tablet is the 1GB of RAM. Devices began coming out shortly after this tablet that had 1.5GB and 2GB of RAM, and the extra memory makes a huge difference in Android, probably more so than a faster processor would.All in all, it was a good tablet at the time it came out, and is still a decent tablet. There were no glaring deficiencies, as the TF200 had. The dock was a nice option. As long as you know what you're getting (which is old technology), and you are smart about the price you should pay for that technology, you will be happy with this tablet.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything was great, but....", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R23YRC1VEXL7RP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The tablet is great and the service was great.

Melvin", "ReviewID": "RBQKF7D1JXCEQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was a fan of the \"Transformer\" design from the moment I saw it - so it saddened me to give it a low rating - but I'll explain.First, the plus of the design.  It uses the Android operating system, allows for an optional (highly recommended) keyboard dock, and has a fairly nice system bump by ASUS to give it a slight advantage over the stock Android design.  ASUS has supported this up to the Jelly Bean upgrade (no official Kit Kat as of this review - but there are unofficial upgrades for it), which is a nice upgrade over the pre-installed Ice-Cream.  Scrolling between screens is smooth and software loading is fast and responsive.Now the bad - and I will caveat, this is only my experience, so I can't say if it is common or not.  Approximately 3-4 months after purchase, my tablet would reboot by itself whenever I touched it.  I called ASUS and they issued an RMA, stating that it was likely a short in the tablet.  After a few weeks away (and complete loss of my data on the tablet), it was returned and worked great.  Then, 2-3 months later, the connector ports that hold the tablet to the optional keyboard started showing signs of stress.  The plastic of the frame at these locations is thin and poorly made.  I use this tablet at home and only to surf while I am sitting watching TV.  How the wear was so great as to cause cracking of plastic is beyond me.  Even the center port, where the tablet actually interacts with the keyboard cracked.  The plastic is a bit thicker, but still too thin to be a secure point between two pieces of equipment that, while light, put stress on each other.  This eventually led to a small crack along the back of the tablet between the two ports.  I sent it in to ASUS for review and they stated - \"Nothing found - no repairs necessary.\"  Then just this month (right after my warranty expires of course) the tablet started experiencing the same issue it did the first time - auto rebooting whenever I touch the tablet cover.  Sent it back in and looking forward to seeing how much ASUS wants to charge me to fix something that shouldn't be an issue to begin with.Overall, I've lost my data twice (as the reboots eventually lead to data loss) and had to send it in three times for repair.  I'm hoping this repair is my last, but I am now very hesitant to recommend an ASUS tablet to anyone.  It very well could be a lemon and not indicative of ASUS quality control, but it has left a bad taste in my mouth.  I love ASUS motherboards, but can honestly say it does not extend to their tablet products right now.  I gave it a 3 of 5, however, as I have found it to be very useful and responsive during those periods that it worked without issue.  I believe such technology should last longer than 1 yr, which is how long the warranty is good for - but I'll hold off on a final verdict until they fix it this time.  I'd recommend looking at other products unless enough of the feedback from owners is positive without issue.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "keyboard docking station \"buggy\" from the start", "Author": "Michael G", "ReviewID": "R22NJ7DR4CEQZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet lasted me all of 11 days before I sent it back for a refund.

I don't have any drops or cracks in it, but it just started becoming inconsistent in recognizing touches and now it pretty much recognizes nothing. Fortunately, I have the docking keyboard and the mouse worked so I retained some function.But a tablet isn't worth much without touchscreen capability -- docking keyboard or no. It's at a local shop for repair and will probably cost me about $150-$175. I'm not thrilled about it, but if it works again that's better than losing it's functionality completely and still cheaper than replacing it with another 10\" tablet.I googled and found a lot of people complaining about the touchscreen/digitizer issues. Just know that this is a problem going in.Otherwise, as far as functionality, screen quality (visually), and ease of use I really like the tablet. The add on keyboard is worthwhile because it gives you extra battery capacity and makes the tablet more functional as a laptop alternative for short business trips. You can maintain email access but be able to type much better than you would just off the screen.

I already own an IPAD2 and wanted to get a low cost tablet for the family.  I was afraid that the ASUS would fall way short when compared to the IPAD2.  It costs a lot less so I thought it would do a lot less.The Transformer's screen is bright and vibrant when using apps or watching netflix.  However when it displays websites, the resolution suffers a bit.  The same websites come out clearer on the IPAD.  I was told that it's not due to the tablet but how most websites are optimized for IOS vs Android.  Hopefully this will change since there are so many great Android products out now.  I was also surprised at the responsiveness of the touchscreen and how smoothly I can navigate through the tablet's contents.  The shape of the ASUS tablet also makes it better for watching movies.  The plastic backing doesn't feel as sturdy as aluminum, but its never given me problems.I've read reviews about the ASUS pad crashing all the time but it's happened to me only a couple times so far (some apps and safari on my IPAD also crash every so often so it's not specific to Android).I'm more of a casual user and find the IPAD2 easier to use since IOS spoon feeds you, but after using both products I don't see much difference between the two performance-wise.  IOS and android both have the apps I use or feel are practical.  I also could have bought two ASUS TF300's for the price of one IPAD2.  The expandable memory on the ASUS is also very convenient.  All in all, this is a solid device that I am very happy with.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R3VT9J5B6NX1SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well.

I spent many months looking and researching and came across this one.  I wanted the red one, but it was quite a bit more, so I went with blue.  Then I put it in a red case and you can't even tell that it's blue!Anyway, this little bugger is fabulous.  I have had it for about 2 months and just love it!  I did have 1 issue when it wouldn't turn on one day, but the guys at tech support fixed me right up!  They are personable and understandable.It's been perfect since.  The reason I chose this one was because of the quad core and the storage.  I don't do alot of \"app\" downloads, but when I do, I want enough space to hold it.  I figured that if I'm going to keep this thing for a long time, I getter get a lot of space.  So I did.  I also wanted fast.  It's been pretty fast, but I think I still go faster than it does.  It also depends on the site I'm on.  If it is a fast site, I have no problems.  If it's a slower site, I will get an error message saying that the browser is having an issue.  It's not the machine, it's that the browser wants to go faster than the site will accompdate.  I know this only because the same sites give me issues on the desktop machine.I did notice that there seems to be a challenge with Chrome.  That was one of the first things I installed and it doesn't seeem to want to play nice with the pre-installed browser.  I installed firefox as an alternate browser and it works fine.  (Uninstalled Chrome very quickly)I have chatted with my sister in Europe several times via skype and it works great.  Skpe itself has issues, but the machine was perfect.  Love the portabliltiy.  I actually spent New Years with her from my own home!  It was still daylight here, but for her it was the new year.  That was fun.I do suggest that you get a screen saver only because I'm anal about protecting my new toy.  I have a case and a screen saver, you don't touch the actual machine except for the start button!  :-)All in all, I love this little thing.  As far as I can tell, it doesn the same stuff that the I pad does and costs about 1/2 the price.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking into getting a tablet. I wanted a tablet to be a middle ground between my desktop and my Android--portable, but with a large enough screen, and enough processing power, that I can use it like a mobile computer. I use it for reading books, browsing the internet, Skyping, playing games, and when I worked as a private tutor, I used it as a teaching aid. I've had it for about 8 months and loved it the whole time. That said, while it hasn't had any real problems, there are definitely some little things that I would change.Appearance:- It's a good looking tablet. I love the blue, I love that it's textured, and I love the glossy screen. The edges are large enough to hold it comfortably without accidentally touching the screen. The display itself is beautiful as well--bright colors and clean edges. I watch videos on it all the time, mostly from YouTube and Netflix, and they always look great.Operation:- Mostly very smooth operation. I have no problem with starting programs, connecting to a wifi network, streaming video, playing music, etc. Occasionally, it will lag if I've been playing a game for a while, but only within the game itself; other programs are not affected. Using a task killer solves this most of the time, though a couple times a restart was required.- The browser is definitely the worst part, but I don't like the default Android browser on my phone either, so this is not a tablet-specific problem. I solved it by installing Chrome, which doesn't close without warning, or constantly bring up messages that the browser is not responding, or make scrolling jumpy. If you're having these problems, switch browsers.Sound:- The sound quality is decent. It has one speaker, and that speaker is good, but it's still only one speaker. Don't get me wrong, I have no complaints about this. It's pretty much on-par for a portable device of this sort, and much better than the speaker on my phone, so I'm satisfied.- The location of the speaker is slightly awkward. It's on the back right-hand side, exactly where I want to put my hand when I'm holding it. None of this is a real problem, though, because I've found that I can still hold it in the same place if I cup my hand around the speaker (which also, incidentally, makes the sound richer/louder/better in general).Keyboard:- The pop-up keyboard on the touchscreen is kind of a hassle. Part of the issue is the size. When the tablet is in landscape, the keyboard is pretty large, but still cramped. It's too big for me to hold it in both hands and type with my thumbs, but it's smaller than a netbook keyboard, so typing with both hands like it's a regular keyboard can be tricky as well. Typing is a lot easier when it's in portrait.- Its version of the Swype system also is pretty buggy. Word recognition isn't great, and it's auto-spacing feature needs work.- However, one of the fantastic things about this product is that it can plug in to a physical keyboard and be used like a touchscreen netbook. I attach the keyboard if I have a lot of typing to do, and detach it to play games or read e-books. I definitely recommend getting the keyboard, but its still a great tablet without it. I only got my keyboard a few days ago, so I've been using it most of the time without it, and still really enjoyed the product. The keyboard just adds some extra functions.Charger:- I'm not sure if I just got a bad wall adapter, or if they're all like this, but mine falls out of the wall with just a light bump. It sort of \"hangs\" loosely out of the socket, so it doesn't always maintain contact while charging. I've noticed that, if I'm using it while it's charging, the battery logo (the one that shows up in the middle of the screen when the tablet is first plugged in) will show up every 10-15 minutes. The cable itself is perfectly fine, so I just started using a different wall adapter.In summary: despite a couple small issues, I highly recommend this tablet. If I could go back and select a tablet again, I would stick with this one.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "the best tablet", "Author": "david", "ReviewID": "R2TJXZ7N84FS9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked it, and had formerly a TF101, but there is no comparison with this, I really recommend it", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "upwardglances", "ReviewID": "RUWL5FG58NRQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it tremendously.

So right out the box you want be able to use for about 30 minutes because of an uupdate and upgrade to 4.1 JB. So first thing i did was got adobe back,(youutbe some great tutorials) its a little slow to start but once it gets going im trying to catch my breathe its so fast.Im a real guy so i want real spec not computerize specs so i put this badt boy to the test. Feel is awesome. Even the plastic back. Look is amazing its look like a netbook its a huge screen. Im loving it. But i have sweaty hands so i leavefog marks on the back and lots of fingerprint on the screen. Recommend screen protector but not an anti glare but an anti finger smugg.Android, im a little new been an apple man since grade school with the color backs. I had android before with a htc hero love customization but hated everything else lag,load, and ec. Typing on the on screen key board is pretty hard. Im using it now. So if any misspelled or grammar issue is because im not deleteing. I wantyou to get the true look. But im having troublw with my cursor jumping every where. Have to push on the screen kinda hard to get letters to registar and the space bar im punching the screen. Web surfin awesome fast i use stock browser i love dont need that other stuff. I really impress with andriod i feel so free from apple no more jailbreaking ;). Joke.  Apple may be more easy but android is more user friendly. Hope you like. Write me for any more question. Last note only bad thing so far. I mentioned early but On Screen Keyboard and Typing SUCKS it horrhorrible.*Update*I JUST wanted to let everyone know how it is going. I'm in love. Lol. Seriously i sleep with this thing. But i encountered some of the problem I have read in other reviews. I almost sent it back but thanks to some research i found a solution. First dont care what you say the stock browser sucks. It is so laggy and slow. My grandma is on a walker imagine her walking ten yards on a football field. Take a long time right that's how long it takes for the stock browser to load a page. Painful i know. Explore a little bit i had huge success with chrome speed but no flash can be loaded. And dolphin was swimming like a dolphin it is fast and i can adjust my flash so i can use it when i need to. I dont recommend root if you just want watch movie and get free apps use 4share or blackmart( i dont support) most people dont understand root. Its not like jailbreaking which is necessary on apple. if you want fast go performance mode its all the fast you need you dont need 1.6 you dont have the screen that need that much power. But you paid do what you need want. I found that the tablet runs better on normal mode when you doing basic browsing. Still haven got the dock but when i do i will make a full review on youtube so be looking out and not one of those boring ones with the mono tone guys or the guys with the funny accent. No offense.but ask question and thank you for looking at my review rate if help if not send a question. And ill help i have great followers on this review site so im sure they will help also.

Riemers", "ReviewID": "R8UAL1Y4H5GBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my son's birthday 3 weeks ago.  The tablet works reasonably fast, and seems to give good bang for the buck.  However, my son still prefers to do things like watch youtube videos on the $300 laptop I bought him last year.  The problem he says is the videos regularly timeout on the pad, indicating the wifi network connection is slower.  When he does use it, he lays down on my bed, as the is the closest comfortable place to where the router is located.My wife's laptop died, so she ended-up using it for about a week.  During that time she complained it did not register her screen touches in the right location.  I installed a drawing program, so I could confirm my touches were recorded right where I touch, so I finally concluded it is something unique with the web browser.  However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.  So it seems more complicated than that.  Upgrading android helped, as now android pop-us a zoomed window when clicking on buttons and links in the web browsers.However, after the upgrade we have a new problem.  Sometimes when the device has been asleep, or freshly booted wifi refuses to turn on.  It gets stuck in a permanent \"starting wifi\" state.  Toggling airplane mode does not help.  The only workaround I found is to turn airplane mode on and then reboot.  After booting, turn airplane mode off.The last problem is more with quality control on the google play store, than the tablet myself.  My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.  So far mostly he has just used free games.  However, he did try to buy a couple of games on the android market.  Each time while downloading, I read the reviews of the game and found that they consistently crashed on this tablet.  You have just ten minutes after the download is complete before you can no longer use the refund button.  But 10 minutes has been exactly the amount of time it takes to get past the initial install, updates, and tutorials to try the games and see the reviewers are right.  If you do make it to the refund button in-time, you cannot leave review for the game, so when reading the reviews you are only seeing failed to run/crash reports from those who failed to make the 10 minute time window.However, this problem in a minor way is a blessing.  You see I had set up the tablet to use my gmail account, so it could be paid through my credit card.  But it seems when doing that, there is no way to keep my son from being able to access my e-mail.  Had I not had to request refunds for 100% of the game, I would be stuck.  But as it is, I still have the opportunity to create a new gmail account to use exclusively with google play.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product for a reasonable price", "Author": "Linda B", "ReviewID": "R2KL8QEK27UCMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a tech savy person but I am very happy with this purchase.

At that price for a quad core tablet and 32Gb of space I don't think there is really any competition in the space.Pros: Well supported by Asus (software is already on Jelly Bean 4.1), Asus' bundled software isn't total crap, Fast!, Great IPS screen, viewing angles etc. Lots of space and expandable. HDMI out, smooth clean design, optional keyboard is a real differentiator.Cons: Short charging cable, proprietary cable, where it is mounted is understandable for the dock but annoying because it makes it hard to use with a case and charge it and use in general while charging it. Speakers could face forward and would be much much better.Conclusion: I love it so far. It does everything I want it to and for the price the only real competition is it's brother the Nexus 7. But in a 10 inch tablet I am really happy with it. Still android doesn't have the app ecosystem that the iPad does, but for more space, HDMI out, expandable storage, keyboard option etc. it fits my lifestyle much better and the price is incredible especially if you can find it for $375.

In retrospect, I wished I had waited for the TF700 before I bought the TF300, but you need to consider whether or not the $100 premium is worth it. The biggest difference I can see is the screen. If you use your tablet outdoors, definitely get the 700. My 300 is usable only if it is cloudy or you are in substantial shade. As far as the nicer metallic finish and thinner depth of the 700 is concerned, since I use a case, this does not matter at all.But the good things...The tablet is quick and capable. It does all the everyday surfing, game playing, and video watching without any hiccups. I appreciate that I can use external media and change out cards easily.

I was originally looking at a slightly older pair available at another retailer as refurbished.  However, after considering that an update to Jelly Bean is important to me I decided that Asus's statement regarding the update being planned \"in the coming months\" and the quad core processor were worth the bump in price.The aesthetics are pleasant.  I knew I was buying a 10\" tablet so the overall size and weight are inline with what I was expecting and have found it natural to use.  The screen does collect finger prints and debris easily so I'm experimenting with a stylus and have a screen protector on order to see if that will help.I am a fan of Ice Cream Sandwich (and looking forward to Jelly Bean), so while that's not a unique feature of this tablet, but they do pair well together.  The apps/widgets/etc included are OK, the Note app in particular seems to have potential.  However I like that there are not a ton of unnecessary apps/bloatware included that you can't remove; it provides a nice, clean, simple environment for you to go crazy downloading apps catered to your needs/wants.  Contrast this to my smartphone which came with a dozen apps I never asked for nor want but take up precious space and constantly want updates and I'm a happy camper.As for performance of the tablet itself, I have seen one or two hiccups including apps closing themselves and lag/slow performance.  I'm not certain yet if it's relating to the specs of the device itself, the performance settings being used (Asus includes an easy to access setting for low/mid/high performance to help manage the trade off on battery life/performance), or the apps I've installed.  Hoping to experiment more and zero in on a possible cause.Overall I'm happy though, with my few minor concerns so far either having work arounds or being \"livable\".", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding, Easy to use, even for a six year old.,", "Author": "W.

They were built like tanks. My first two ASUS laptops from 10+ years ago STILL run today... and I never turned them off, they run 24/7.NOW this ASUS tab worked fairly well for the first 2 weeks. The unit itself looks great. The plastic backing doesn't look cheap at all. The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker. I did have some problems with the light sensor that was suppose to detect environmental light levels and adjust the display automatically... It just didn't work. Where ever I was, when set on auto, the tablet screen always adjusted to the most dim. Another problem is the battery display. My battery can be charging or fully charged and the unit would give me the most random battery status. \"52seconds on 100% battery charge..\" really? The Android OS isn't polished either. Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase. Adobe reader was laggy, and google chrome as well (without flash support???). The weather app was useless on auto detect mode as well... I had to manually set my location...I could deal with all this except 2 days ago the tablet started randomly and frequently rebooting itself. I would set it aside and when I come back to it, I'd notice the tablet had shut down. After a bit of trial and error I found the unit was defective. It was sensitive to me placing it on any surface, even on the couch or the carpet. I wasn't throwing it either and from day one I had a hard case placed on it. I'm sure this is a QA issue. I'll give the tablet another chance and it's been shipped back to Amazon for a replacement.UPDATE: First of all the Amazon replacement program is AMAZING. I never left the house! Makes me not worry about ordering from this company ever. Printed my labels and called, they dropped off a new unit the same day they picked up my defective one. This unit works perfectly, no more shut downs for no reason. The OS is running smoother now with the latest update. The ASUS weather is working finally, as well as the auto dim option. Adobe's update also makes my image heavy pdfs run alot smoother. I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.

I got tired of lugging my laptop to/from school everyday. I'd been eyeing the Asus Transformer family with lusty eyes, but didn't have the money for it. Then Asus quietly released the TF300, which coincided beautifully with my (pseudo)graduation and consequent graduation money. I snapped a TF300 up to get me through my final summer classes, and DAGGUM, I wish I had this little beast for my regular semesters!OVERALL: It's a solid tablet and the best bang for your buck. I haven't taken a look at everything that the TF300 can do, but what I've used has worked for the most part. I'll try to update the review as I try new things.APPEARANCE, BUILD QUALITY, AND ERGONOMICS: 4/5- True, it's not \"sexy\" or shiny. It's understated and professional (which I prefer). Most importantly, it doesn't scream \"I LOOK EXPENSIVE. STEAL ME!\", which is perfect for studying a train or bus. However, if you have it out, you should still maintain a firm grasp on the device.- It doesn't FEEL cheap, and the plastic body makes it feel very lightweight despite being 1.4lbs. HOWEVER, it is kinda cheap. I have a tight-fitting slim-fit case that has a clasp that holds it shut. In trying to close the clasp, the plastic body did separate a little from the display around the clasp area. I was able to pop things back into place, but the point should be noted.- The edges are more rounded and thicker than the Prime's which will make it more comfortable to hold after long periods. Typing is a bit difficult while holding the TF300; I recommend downloading \"Perfect Keyboard (Free)\" because it comes with a \"thumb\" keyboard that splits the keyboard in half.PERFORMANCE 3/5:- Moving between homescreens is snappy, apps open quickly, and switching between open apps is pretty quick too- Polaris Office sometimes tells me that there isn't enough memory to run the application when it's the only app that's open. This is a major annoyance because I would lose any notes that I had taken since the last time I saved the document. To be fair, the PowerPoint that I have open is often 50-80 slides (4-8MB) long and has MANY images on it. I've also been running the tab in Balanced Mode, but I doubt bumping it up to High Performance Mode would help much, since it only clocks the processor at an additional 0.1-0.2 GHz. I haven't experienced any app crashes outside of Polaris Office.- People say that their apps freeze or that they get that \"this is taking longer than usual\" message. It's not because there's something wrong with the OS or processor. It's just that the READ SPEEDS are slow (despite it being an SSD). The OS will think something is wrong, but in reality, it's just the data isn't loading fast enough. (I'm lead to believe that this is the case because the large PowerPoints take forever to load in the sidebar in Polaris Office)- Loading Gallery images/thumbnails also took a bit of time. Weird, since I don't have many images on the device. Again, my hypothesis is slow read speeds.- The stock browser experience isn't much better than the one found on Amazon Silk. It'll often give you the \"this is taking longer than it should\" message, but as soon as that message pops up, the page will finish loading. Just tap \"wait\" and move on. The Google Chrome Beta and Dolphin Browser are great alternatives.- I can't speak for gaming performance, as I did not purchase this tablet for games. HOWEVER. I do have a few art/photo editing apps. Strokes in SketchBook Express rendered well enough, and the zoom was pretty smooth. Adjusting saturation/brightness/contrast in Photoshop Express was very smooth, and adjusting fill/shadows/highlights in the stock Gallery Editor was very smooth as well. I'd say the GPUs are a very capable bunch (they better be - there's a DOZEN cores!).SCREEN: 5/5 (if you can live without IPS+)- 300 or 350 nits (I keep finding conflicting numbers) is plenty of brightness for indoor use. I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark. It's great for using in the dark. Back when I had the Kindle Fire, I'd have the brightness all the way down and it would STILL be too bright.- The colors are neutral, if not a tad bit on the cool side. I prefer warmer colors, but honestly, I can't really tell unless I had something to compare it to.CAMERA: 3.5/5- I haven't put the front-facing camera through its paces- The rear-facing camera is good for a tablet. The colors are a bit washed out. The zoom is..pretty amazing, actually. I managed to snap a photo of a rail operator extinguishing a smoking switch that was about 100ft away just the other day. Some quick touch ups in an app, and the photo was pretty acceptable.- You can move the focus box around the viewfinder, which I really like. But it takes forever to focus. Factor in my shaky hands, and you get a picture that never really focuses.TAB + KEYBOARD COMBO: 6/5- I'll leave a review of the actual dock for the dock's product page, but as for the combo...LOVE IT.- It's top-heavy, so be careful not to tilt it too far back.- Naturally, the form factor is like that of a 10.1\" netbook. You would think that it WAS a netbook until you noticed that there is a camera sensor and speaker grill where they normally wouldn't be.- The best part is that I can take notes with the dock while I'm at school, then review those notes on the train with just the tablet. This is another big plus because it's easier for larger items such as netbooks and laptops to get stolen while you're using them on the train. A tablet that is firmly in your grasp would be much more difficult.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good tablet with sound issue", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R12QTEAL53T1ST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had it for more than 2 weeks. did not see issues related to bleeding screen, system resets, etc.However, occasionally, sound will be muted/gone. the only way to correct it was to turn it off and then back on.

The only reason I am writing this review is because people should stop buying this junk and look for other alternative tablets. This tablet always had issues and I hoped for it to get solved with its updates as the updates were pretty frequent.Anyways to the point, this is junk because:- WIFI signal is always low no matter how close you are at the router. This never got fixed with any of the updates.- GPS locking is OK. Sometimes takes about 4-5min to lock down the location.- Audio is a piece of crap.- Video is OK.- Performance is very slow when in power saving mode/balanced mode but tends to be a little better when in performance mode. However, it is still slow. The worst thing is the performance degradation is not noticeable when trying out the tablet in the store, but as you use it and try to do a little multitasking then it just breaks.- Has quad core processor, 1 GB RAM, and cannot handle any process intensive tasks. If you play a game like minion rush which is not even that process intensive, then it keeps skipping during display.- No resale value. I have been trying to resale this for around $180 and I just can't. No one buys it and my tablet is in mint condition.- Better alternatives out there with less price. For example: Nexus 7, Nexus 10, Samsung Galaxy Tab3. However the Nexus are manufactured by ASUS, so I would try Samsung instead. Personally not a fan of Samsung either, but hey I would bet that it performs well than this piece of junk even though the processor is dual core only.- Lot of bloatware apps included that makes your tablet slower than it already is.- The product build quality is not good as well. It's very plasticky and will break if u mistakenly drop it.- No exchange program with ASUS to replace it with a better one. I checked the exchange program with BEST BUY and they are offering $30 for it. Really????- Lastly, comment me to post the tablet for $180 if you want to buy it. It is in good condition and has a very light scratch at the right top corner. You can't find the scratch unless you want to find it. I just want to get rid of it.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R1DUKJ246K4YZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these on sale last week.  I loved the specs, memory and price.  Considering the mediocre resolution (1280X800) the screen was actually bright and decent, although it took a little while for me to get used to it, considering it replaced my retina iPad.  I gave the iPad to my wife and switched to Android because I find the widgets and other customizable options to be very useful.  Although the specs of the ASUS look good on paper, the iPad was still much more responsive, especially with games.  Subway Surfers and Adrenaline 7 play flawlessly on the iPad.  The colors are rich and vibrant and the gameplay is smooth with no frame rate issues.  On the ASUS both games had dull colors and suffered from constant frame rate issues including artifacts and occasional stuttering.  I realize the iPad is better optimized for gaming, so I didn't hold this against the ASUS, especially since I spend less than 10% of my tablet time gaming.  That's one of the tradeoffs going from iOS to Android.  The good tradeoffs are the customizable interface and my fave, the widgets.  The TF300 was wonderful for the first week but on the ninth day, two bright spots appeared on the screen.  They were about the size of a pea and appeared in two different areas of the screen.  They were noticeably brighter than the rest of the screen. I exchanged it for another, came home, opened it and immediately scanned top to bottom for screen issues.  The screen was okay other than some backlight bleeding along the edges.  Figuring I was just unlucky with the first one, I settled down with the replacement and started reloading all of my apps and settings.  My joy lasted one day.  On day two a dead pixel just popped up out of nowhere.  I tried t ignore it but it was in a prominent spot of the viewing area.  No matter how hard I tried to ignore it, it attracted my eyes like a magnet.  Needless to say, I returned that one as well and gave up on the TF300.  Call me picky but if I'm paying over $300 for a tablet, I don't think a defect-free display is too much to ask.  I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.

Is responsive, does all kinds of things a tablet should and does it well; when it works right. Got it with keyboard. Glad I did. In August (after Amazon return window closed) Tablet touchscreen stopped responding. Would only work if attached keyboard, used it for a while, then disconnected from keyboard. Searched web and Asus site for support. Found very little info on web, some similar problems but no solutions. Found nothing on Asus support. Very awkward site to negotiate. Removed some apps, no improvement. Have rebooted device multiple times with no results. Lived with sporadic problem for a while then Asus pushed out OS update to Jelly Bean, problem went away. Then it started again a couple of days ago. I wanted to take some photos with it (excellent camera) but no touchscreen response. It sucks when trying to take photos with keyboard attached. I use this tablet for my references for a study I attend and cannot do it with keyboard attached, too many things to hold on my lap. Did not intend to use keyboard for routine work, only for occasional and when traveling. So tablet without touchscreen becomes $500+ paperweight which I don't need. Needed it for class last night but screen would not respond. Turned it on while writing this review this AM, now it works. Not very dependable like that. Spouse has Ipad II which has never had this problem. Starting to regret my purchase. Gave it 2 stars at this point.UPDATE 12/07/2012I had a very hard time finding specific support information for my problem. Looked around web, other forums, and ASUS site. Struck gold on Amazon when Tien Phan found my complaint on the Amazon site and contacted me. We established email connection and he and I attempted a couple of fixes including a system restore to factory defaults. When those software attempts did not work he determined it had to go back for service and provided me with an RMA to ship it to Texas. Prepared it (I still had original packaging) and sent it off on 11/23. Was able to track progress via shipper's site and the repair with ASUS RMA. Service turnaround was quick and had it back on 12/5. Have used it heavily past two days, no repeat of the screen freezing up. I am pleased with the device, raised it to 4 stars. I'll give it some more time before we get to 5. I am very happy with Tien's work and so happy he found me on Amazon.UPDATE 02/11/2013Wanted to leave a final update to this. Have used the tablet daily since ASUS repaired it. Taken it on travel, used with variety of hotel and other wi-fi connections. It works flawlessly.

I've had it for 2 weeks now. For the record, i dont use it every day & is plugged into its charger in my room for at least 4 days out of the week.Everything was fine the first week. But this week it started turning off randomly. Since I've never had a tablet, i thought maybe it as turning off to perform updates, so i wasn't too concerned.  We'd hit the power button & it would power back up.Today, on a road trip i was using it, & it powered down again.  This time i couldn't turn it back on. I ended up calling ASUS & the rep walked me thru a cold boot (press the volume down button first, then the power button & hold them together til the screen comes back to life. It will go thru its motions & reboot to the desktop) I explained to the rep that at this point this was worrisome. He said if it happened again to do another cold boot. I told him if it happened again there was clearly an issue with the tablet & if i could send it back for an exchange.  He said I could send it back for servicing. \"SERVICING\"???!!!  Really, only 2 weeks old??!! I told him i didn't buy a new tablet to have it serviced after only 2 weeks. If there was another problem i wanted an \"EQUIVALENT NEW IN BOX NON-DEFECTIVE\" tablet. Let's see what happens over the course of our vacation & more usage. But i hope if i need to exchange, Amazon doesn't send me a \"refurbished\" one or tell me i need to have this one serviced. My only other \"issue\" is the serial #. Its a sticker by the charging port & the corners are coming up. If the sticker falls off i wont know what the serial# is. I'll have to write it down & file it for safekeeping. Cheesy. *UPDATE* I was searching on Amazon.com for a cover for this tablet earlier today & the browser crashed 6-7 times. VERY frustrating. Asus just downloaded a firmware update tonight so lets see if that fixes anything.7/7/12:  After 3 weeks, several crashes, random shut downs & reboots, coupled with several reviews about how delicate the screen is, I decided to return it. Is $385 a good deal? Yes, but couple that with all the problems, and that's an EXPENSIVE risk to take. As much as I prefer Android, this experience has made me lean towards an iPad.

For what is it worth, it is NOT worth it, and deserves 2 stars. It may have a quadcore, lots of ram, and a nice GPU in it, but all this hardware is useless because Jelly Bean cannot utilize the hardware very well. I do not like it. There are many ugly Apps that do not work well. There are not enough tablet optimized Apps, but many stretched out phone Apps... Jelly Bean is slow and not very responsive while multi-tasking. There is no way to end-task completely. I have no idea why there are so many stock Apps running in the background. If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden. When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state. Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely. The Jelly Bean OS don't have well control over the running Apps. The browsers are not very responsive too. Some pages are distorted. I have tried the stock browser, Chrome, Dolphin, and Opera. They are all terrible. I cannot even play MP3 in the background without causing serious browser lags on some pages. Compared to Safari on iOS, these browsers are all FAR behind! They do not immediately start scrolling when touched like on safari, there is a slight annoying delay, and when you zoom in and out, there is rendering lag. The scrolling do not bounce naturally, they just kind of slide... Developers need to understand that the browser IS the most important App on tablets. There are light bleeds on every corner of the screen too, I don't really mind this, but it bleeds much more than my iPad 2, so I just have to mention it. My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING. Why can't this TF300 be like that? I don't understand. For $400, I expect the BEST and nothing less, period.

For all intents and purposes it's near flawless.Now, let me continue by saying that one star is way too many rate this device NOW THAT JELLY BEAN was pushed to it.Jelly Bean has issues connecting to 802.1x networks (i.e.: large offices or colleges).  Just use the search engine (that developed Android) and search for `Jelly Bean 802.1' and start reading (get a drink and some chow cause you going to be there for a while).  Also when the tablet wakes up from suspend mode, the wifi connection speed is significantly less.  Example:  tablet running at 52 mbs, after putting the tablet in to suspend mode then waking it up the connection speed is 5 mbs.  The noted internet work around is to go in to settings > wifi > forget the network, the reenter the network password - volia 52 mbs (unfortunately you need to do this each time you suspend the device).  Being a network tech, and having run 2 of these side by side, you can see the difference in the wifi connection speeds.If you are going to use this tablet at home with Jelly Bean it's probably livable, you can stop reading and save some time.The REAL issue is that ASUS is FORCING users to upgrade (and there is no downgrade option unless you root the device and void your warranty).After 5 calls to ASUS support:call 1: you can downgrade,call 2:  we apologize there is no downgrade option,call 3: supervisor set up RMA,call 4: called to discuss rma, got another supervisor.  He admits that they probably will not be able to duplicate this as they do not have an 802.1 network in their rma facility in Grapevine TX.  He does state that if it connects to wifi there they would just send it back.  I quickly point out that I know it connects to WEP / WPA2 - I want this to function like ICS.  Note: here the interesting part, he states if you got one that had ICS you could disable the update.  So off I go to the local store to get ANOTHER TF300T. I get home set it up and the first thing it does is try to upgrade to JB !!!call 5: another super visor, we apologize the is no option to disable the software push.Now lets examine that:  Imagine if that large software company in Redmond Washington, just pushed Vista to all the XP users, or pushed out Win 8 to all the Win 7 users - lawsuits would be filed the first day.  Imagine if HP just `pushed' patches to all the users of its server regardless of the consequences, again I believe there would be lawsuits.  When I asked the supervisor about this and where legally did they have the right to change a device that I paid for, his reply was `that the way the developers wrote it'.As of now one device went back to the local store... the other has ICS that keeps prompting to accept the JB update (every 5 min - interrupting whatever you are doing).  Asus' answer to this is to stop the CMclient and the DMclient which stop the prompts, I refer to this as the BM solution (as in bowel movement).Lastly, I'm not blaming ASUS for a flaw in JB, which lies with the JB developers.  I am blaming ASUS for NOT GIVING THEIR CUSTOMERS A CHOICE TO UPGRADE OR NOT,  AND TO ROLLBACK TO ICS.  This tablet was purchased because of Asus' reputation for standing behind their products.  After 5 calls they admit they do not have a customer service department, only a tech support department.  If you are buying this with ANY intention of using it in your job or school CHECK FIRST because you may want to consider a device from a manufacturer that a:) allows you to rollback or b:) gives you the option of upgrading or just sticking with ICS.7/1/2013  Note Google has fixed jelly bean - big pluses for Google !!!

I didn't get the keyboard attachment for this tablet so I can not speak to that. I've actually had this for about 9 months now, so I've been using it pretty extensively.The biggest complaint I have about this tablet: It's sluggish. After waking it up it may take 5-10 seconds before it starts responding to touching the screen. Or it may respond almost immediately. If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app. I have to reboot the tablet periodically to regain performance.This sluggishness doesn't make it unusable. Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine. It just seems that background processing and context-switching is very poor in this tablet. I do not know how much of that is the specific flavor of Android and how much of it is hardware.A second problem I have which may be linked to the sluggishness is the touch-screen doesn't seem to respond properly sometimes. Even when an app is clearly running (screen is updating, sound is playing, etc) I sometimes have to tap a button or icon a dozen times before the tablet realizes I'm actually interacting with it. I've verified this isn't due to calibration settings or the screen being dirty.By contrast the Acer Iconia 500 was very responsive both to touch input and general app performance. It has a lower-power CPU and less storage capacity, yet this supposedly more powerful tablet ultimately feels like a downgrade. :(My advice is you are considering this tablet is to try and use one for a while, such as borrowing a friends or trying it in a store. Or pick-up a used one and sell it if it doesn't meet your needs.

Amazon's only attempt to inform their customers with booked orders were to delete the letters 'GPS' from their 'click for further technical specifications' section (no mention until much later of the significant wifi range problems).After several discussions with their order desk it was clear they didn't have any TF300 and it might be 3 to 4 weeks before they got any.  All this when several local big box stores had them in stock - so I bought the 32GB.After using an iPad2 for a year, the TF300 has been both a challenge and a delight. Asus apparently didn't learn enough from their TF201 design problems so wifi range is still a problem (they did make a significant design change in the TF700). The screen is not as bright or brilliant as the TF700 or the iPad3, but to my 74 y/o eyes it looks pretty good until I go outside.

I plugged the tablet into the removable keyboard, and the cursor worked fine for a few minutes, then became overly sensitive, selecting apps when I'd only moved the cursor either over them or in close proximity to them. I reset the tablet about three times before the touchscreen function worked, but only for a few seconds.After the Jelly Bean update, the touchscreen function became more reliable, but I still found that every few minutes, it would stop working. This could be fixed by either rotating the tablet a few times, or tapping the power button off and on, or by plugging in the removable keyboard.My attempt at using the Note Scribble app was incredibly frustrating because of this, and additionally, the tablet started scribbling random dots and dashes when I wasn't touching the screen.I went to the Asus website to speak to a customer service representative about this; there is no phone number for customer support so I had to use their live-chat option. The representative was nice enough, but denied that this is a common problem when I asked him if he'd heard of any other complaints. While I was online with him, my tablet suddenly started selecting multiple apps and opening and shutting them, without my finger anywhere near the screen. I told the rep about this and he said that I could have my tablet sent in to be looked at by Asus, but that they would not refund me for the postage.I looked up the TF300 reviews on multiple forums, and found that while a few customers had great success with the tablet, many had similar experiences to mine. Some had even claimed to have sent in their TF300 three-plus times to Asus repair centers and were still finding problems with their tablet.A final issue: I tried downloading some PDF files from my class' lecture and found that even though I'd downloaded the adobe reader app, I couldn't successfully download my PDF files because of an \"internal error\".As of now, I am considering the Galaxy NOTE (or tab) since those seem to have great reviews and are about the same price as the Asus transformer.TL;DR-- The touchscreen is buggy and unreliable, the removable keyboard is far too sensitive, Asus has a frustrating customer support service, it seems that a poltergeist is included in the product package, and a search on google will show I'm not the only person who has had these problems.

Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.  The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.  Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.

The Galaxy also has a much nicer, more polished feel to it - wish it had the keyboard integration like the ASUS.As for the battery/keyboard, the weight balance is not very good and the unit is very top heavy/tippy because the screen is so much heavier than the keyboard. Given that the combo is not super thin or light, I'd gladly take on additional weight in the keyboard (maybe via bigger battery) to not have it be so tippy.Overall feel is very plasticky compared with much more polished units from Samsung.

More resolution is better but you could be really happy with this. It has a quad core at the heart, with 32GB of inbuilt memory. Add to it the Micro SD slot, make things a lot easier.

I selected next day delivery for $3.99 (I know very inexpensive for 1 day delivery).The delivery was guaranteed to be delivered by ONTRAC by 8:00 pm.  To make a long story short, they made no reasonable attempt to deliver the item, didn't use directory at gate, or the gate code I provided them with (apparently too late).  I complained to both ONTRAC and Amazon.  Another long story short, got the package dropped on my doorstep @9:30 am after badgering ONTRAC when they called me back.I followed the directions and charged the tablet until the battery was 100%.  The tablet did a firmware update the first time I turned it on.  I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.  I did some browsing, installed Nook app and a few other common, free apps.  After having the tablet about 12 hours, it began to operate erratically, sometimes the screen would not respond to any action (swipe, tap, hold, double tab, etc.), essentially frozen.  When not frozen, tapping an app would sometimes work, but more often would execute an entirely different app (note they were not at all near each other on the screen).  Examples - tap browser, runs gmail - tap any app displays wallpaper dialog - tap settings, first screen appear but could not press anything that worked and could not scroll.  Attempted a cold boot (Vol down plus power), after reading posts about the issue; this appeared to work, but did nothing to remedy the problem.I called ASUS tech support @ 1:30 am PST and amazingly enough got through to a live person after about 30 minutes (20 minutes then disconnect, 2nd call only took 10 min). The Technical Support Representative took 5 minutes to be able to repeat the spelling of my name back to me correctly after 10 very careful, slow spellings (also using letter names), kept adding an e to the end of my last name.  After reviewing the issue with him, and attempting another re-boot, the tablet went into what appeared to be an endless power up and down cycle.  I was finally able to get it to stop, but upon starting normally screen totally frozen.  Rep said it was defective and I should send it to them \"unless I could think of something else to do\".  He indicated it could take anywhere from 4 to 6 or 8 weeks and I would have to pay shipping.  I asked him what the \"something else for me to do meant\" and he said perhaps return to Amazon (duh).I arranged to exchange this defective item with Amazon, trouble free and quite simple to accomplish KUDOS to Amazon.  Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.  I printed the label and return authorization and re-packaged everything in the original box and Amazon shipping box and took it to UPS store.  UPS store charged me $1.00 to tape the box (about 2 seconds and perhaps 10\" tape {wow at that rate $1800 per hour :-(I've already gotten the shipping confirmation and tracking number for the replacement and it's the same delivery company so I've got my fingers crossed and will call them as soon as it's on the truck  in hopes of ensuring a trouble-free delivery.During the about 6 or so hours that this tablet worked, it worked fine.  I'm a little nervous about the charger connection as it's pretty obviously a bit flimsy and feels somewhat as if it will fall out of the tablet.

Specifically, I've owned 3 different phones (HTC G1, Google Nexus One, and Samsung Nexus Galaxy) as well as a Google TV.  I'm a happy owner of all 4 of these, and all but the G1 I still use.  In general, I'm a big believer in the Google ecosystem and I like the idea that Android makes it so I can seamlessly switch hardware manufacturers (in theory).This is my first Android tablet.  My wife has a recently purchased iPad 2, which allows me to make pretty direct comparisons to the obvious competition.  Overall, this tablet doesn't hold a candle to my wife's iPad 2 and it's a major let down.On to the review:Versatility: HDMI out, microSD slot, 32GB.  This is frankly my favorite part of the tablet.  And this is the kind of flexibilty that Apple bends over backwards to stop users from mixing/matching hardware as they please. While the tablet also supports an external keyboard, I prefer to use my desktop, laptop, or Chromebook for actual work or heavy communication.Performance:This tablet has fast specs on paper.  I've ran numerous benchmarking suites on the tablet, and it appears that my tablet scores very well.  When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.  The actual browsing experience (responsiveness, page load time) is way worse than my iPad 2.  This is true regardless of browser -- default Android web browser, Chrome beta, Dolphin, etc.  And in several games, the tablet frequently stutters or pauses for several seconds in the middle of it all.Tablet touch sensitivity:The tablet has a very hard time registering clicks.  Sometimes, it works flawlessly.  Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.  Sometimes clicks are dropped.  Other times, I just need to \"patiently\" weight 8 seconds.  I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.  Some games that require you to use 2 thumbs (one for navigation, the other for actions like shooting) are completely confused by any movements I make with my left thumb.  I have to awkwardly use my left index finger, and even then a lot of the motion gets dropped or garbled.  I can't tell if all of these issues are completely software or issues with the tablet input itself, but the end result is a very frustrating navigation experience.Stability:My tablet crashes at least once daily.  This is the least stable consumer device I've owned since the original HTC G1 I've used.  Android should not feel this \"beta\" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.  I've also seen odd glitches in several browsers -- for example, videos will sometimes play \"underneath\" a page.  Half of the video is visible, half of it appears to be playing underneath the embedded video widget on a web page.Google services:I'm used to flawless integration with Google services on Android devices.  Gmail and Google Voice continue to work well.  But what I really care about is media.Unfortunately, this is another area where this tablet falls short.  Picasa Web Albums does not sync correctly.  I can't easily get all of my photos on my device. I have tens of thousands of photos and probably at least 100 albums -- this may be causing it sync less reliably than if I had less.  The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.  However, the TF300T's headphone jack plays very good sound.Display:Display suffers from some fairly visible light bleed in 2 of the 4 corners.  My wife's iPad 2 has light bleed issues as well, but not as obvious.  I think part of this has to do with the color palette of iOS being more white/gray, while Android is more black/dark gray.  The iPad 2 has much more rich and vibrant colors than the TF300, which appear washed out in comparison. I notice the difference in color when browsing, when watching videos, and sometimes when playing games.In my mind, the crashing/lagging/glitching alone makes this product defective.

Since installing the update nearly 4 days ago, the screen flicker has not re-appeared.  I was seeing it every day prior to the update.  Asus had said via email that the update would resolve the problem and they were true to their word.  While I don't think the device should have shipped with this flaw (numerous people experienced it), it is good to see they support their product.  The only thing keeping me from rating the tablet 5 stars is the screen brightness.  In a sunlit room (forget about outdoors) you cannot see the screen very well.  Otherwise - great tablet.Original post:I have had my TF300 for a little less than a week.  I joined the Transformer forum and started seeing posts about a screen distortion problem related to the unit.  This has happened with my device 3 times now.  After the first two I contacted Asus and they had me do a factory reset and assured me the problem would be resolved.  After getting the unit set up once more - it happened again.

I would not buy this for a personal everyday use, because this is an Android device, which is an inferior product to the Apple iPad. This is a product for people who has never experienced a real Apple iPad and thus, sadly do not know any better.Hardware:This is not an iPad, no matter how hard it tries to be one. Compare to iPad this thing is heavy, the interface is cumbersome, jerky and ugly. The text looks awful on this screen, I can count the pixels from which the letters are made, it does not charge off the USB if connected to a computer. It has to be connected to the wall instead.When connected to MacBook in \"Media Device File Transfer Mode\" it does not appear to mount the storage. (Other android devices do with no problem). It has cheap plastic feel to it because it has a cheap plastic screen instead of the glass like on iPad. This tablet does not have a mini USB port so you have to use the cable that it came with and if you loose that cable - tough luck. By the way the cable connector suspiciously looking like the old iPhone and iPod connector. I wonder where they stole that idea from.Preloaded third party software:It comes with a bundle of pre-installed third party apps you do not want and did not ask for and you cannot delete them. Quantity of the pre-installed apps does not make it up for the quality one comes to expect after using the real thing. In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps. It is our choice what we install and what we do not install on our units. In Android world the manufacturers and carriers like to festoon the unit with third party software which is rolled in to the price of the unit and then called \"free\" or \"value added\". If you have to \"add value\" to the unit, it tells me that it had no much value before the \"value added\" stuff was added. The Google Play lets anyone upload an app and thus even though there are seems to be plenty to choose from, the tablet version of the apps are really stretched out phone apps. Not impressive at all. Asus pre-installs some apps for you, but do you really need those? If you do not - you cannot remove them.The security:On Android device you have to agree or not agree to the security warnings when the app is installed. (too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus). Most people do not check what permissions an app requires and just accept them. If the user does not accept the permission the apps is not installed. In Apple world the app asks the operating system to use something that requires permission and the operating system asks user to grant that permission. Thus the user can disallow the app to root around the address book or use the location services or read SMS etc. Thus the app continue to with limited functionality. For instance, I can use Yelp but not let it user my location. In Android world I can only choose to use Yelp and thus let it know my location or not use it at all.Stock software:The music player is just not nearly as nice or user friendly as the one on iPad or iPhone. It looks like a 16 year old high school kid wrote it in a lunch brake. 0 designer's thought went in to it. The email client is ugly and cumbersome to use. The browser needs work, compare to iPad it feels like some beta version of some prototype project that was abandoned by developers before it's completion. The sites do not render properly, the stolen pinch zoom or double tap does not take me to where it should and the web graphics look pathetic. All and all web pages look ugly on it and the responsiveness of the user interface leaves a lot to be desired.Asus hacks:The software keyboard does not work right in the numeric only fields. It supposed to switch to the number only layout but ASUS puts their paws in to the Android OS and installs their own keyboard that will give you the same layout when you focus on a number or date field. You have to hunt the settings to find that you can switch to the default android keyboard that works properly.Looser Experience:The first thing the tablet did after booting up it found it's firmware update, it updated itself. I opened Netflix to see what it would look like, it opened and promptly crashed presenting me with the ugly mail client where the bug report was attached, but no email address was set in to the \"To\" field. What am I supposed to do with this bug report?Developing on this tablet:In development mode when you plug the cable to the computer it immediately mounts the SD card either in camera or in data transfer mode, there is no charge only mode. Thus SD storage is not available during debugging. Which is somewhat annoying for development on this unit. Also the DDMS does not connect so you cannot take a screen shot.Conclusion:So to conclude it is a cheap knock-off made by the lowest bidder out of inferior materials and low budget workmanship. It was designed by someone who got kicked out of the arts school for copying some one else's home-work, it is heavy, the battery last about 5 hours if you actually use the thing, it is rubbish for development, it is overpraised, it is ugly and exhibit sluggish performance.This is something that general public does not understand: the processor speed and memory capacity is meaningless if the operating system that runs on the device is a bottle neck. But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad. If you want a brick to toss across the room get this tablet.

I sold it since I had an iPad anyways, but I always really liked the keyboard and mouse option and wanted to see if Android for tablets ever improved.Second, I have 4 Google TV devices and this if my 3rd Android tablet (the original Transformer, the Nexus 7 and finally this, the TF300 tablet) so I'm not an anti-Android person. I also have an iPad (3rd generation currently) so I have something to compare it to -- and the comparison isn't even close. The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all. This is to be expected however so I'm not taking off any points, just giving a heads up for people making the jump.Since this is the latest and greatest from Nvidia I was expecting something that would match the iPad 3 performance, again this tablet doesn't even come close. It's flat out slow compared to the iPad 3. You can put it into 'performance' mode which helps a bit (but kills the battery faster) but it's still slow. Not sure if this is a hardware issue or an Android issue but I'm baffled at the sluggishness of the thing. I even did a factory reset to make sure there wasn't an issue, but it's exactly the same. This isn't to say it's as slow as the original Transformer or the original iPad, but surprisingly I'd say it's slower than the iPad 2, at least that's my feeling.Also speaking of the battery, this thing drains when the unit is off at an unbelievable rate if you have it plugged into the dock. It was so bad I returned the dock for a new one and it's exactly the same. Here's an example, if my iPad 3 is at 87% and I don't use it for 2 weeks when I pick it up again it will be at around 82% - after 2 weeks! For the Transformer, if it's in the dock, it dies within 2 days of not being used. Unbelievable. Without the dock it's better but still seems to drain at least 10-15% a day, meaning it will be dead within a week even if you don't use it at all. This is ridiculous - not sure if it's an Android issue or an Asus issue but someone needs to fix it.Let see, oh yes the Apps situation -- it's barely improved. Again and again applications just don't take advantage of the additional screen size of the tablets. The Android platform is still 95% based on phones and not tablets - it's a bad situation.Also the device feels cheap, yes it is cheaper than the iPad and if you touch both devices you'll know instantly which one is the cheaper one.Anything positive? The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable. I like the idea of the keyboard dock with the mouse and I like that you can hook-up things like blue-tooth gaming pads - that is something the iPad really needs to allow, both the mouse if you have a keyboard attached and game pads.Summary - buy an iPad - it's better in every way. I own both platforms, I love my Google TVs but the Android tablets are just not very good, mainly due to the horrible software situation. I had an Nexus 7 for a while as well and had the same situation with the battery and apps (although the build quality was quite good). The iPad 3 or 4 is much faster, has a much much better screen, has a huge software library that actually takes advantage of the screen space and is always a much better to hold due to the 4:3 shape as opposed to the 16:9 or 16:10 shape of the Android tablets. In your hand something more squarish is easier to hold when you're talking about a 10\" tablet, the longer the tablet the better for movies (in theory) but for everything else, and I mean everything, the 4:3 feels much more natural and is easier to hold.Again, I own this and I own an iPad -- I'm not an Apple fanboy and obviously I'm not an Android fanboy, I just want what is best I can get for my money and I can clearly state the iPad is a better device.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Wi-Fi Antenna", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIYH987NTW42N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet as a refurb from another website.

Upon pressing the power button nothing happened. Tried few times - no luck. Thought the battery may not be fully charged. Plugged into the wall and let it charge few hours. The power button LED came on in amber color which gave me hope.After allowing it to be charged several hours, I tried again. No display. I can see the black color all over the screen. Nothing else. You can tell the difference between the screen switched off and the black color in the screen. I held the power button for several seconds in hope of doing a hard reset. That didnt help. I thought of hitting the reset button using a pin. But then thought, why should I do it. I paid in full for this and I shouldnt have to reset it the first time I am switching on. It didnt feel right. I packed it up and shipped it right back and got the refund.Now I am back in the tablet market - debating whether to give Asus another chance or not. Or go for Acer although it gets warm. Or wait for some more time until Amazon or Google to come up with a 10.1 tablet. Not sure what to do so I am waiting....I wanted to give zero stars. But Amazon doesnt let me do it.

I want to return it but of course my \"window\" to return has expired.  I have not called customer service yet as I keep hoping they will fix these issues with another update.

He has been living there for few months and will only return to US in about a year from now. Just after few days he got it, during a conversation I found out that the screen was all messed up. Can be seen here ([...]). The whole left edge of the screen, there are strange lines about 2 to 5 mm long all over from top to bottom about a mmm apart. Almost like bar codes from top to bottom. They started appearing about two days of taking it out of the box. He also told me that he has been super careful with the device, so this is not a case of mishandling.Now that the tablet is in Nepal I can neither return it nor claim a refund because it's so far away. To make it worse, the school he volunteers for is a plane ride away and it costs about $60-$70 (around that)just to get to Katmandu, even if there is a ASUS repair and warranty claim center. So, that's not an option. Now he has a defective tablet that he can not exchange and is doomed to have it the way it is. It may or may not be a good tablet, but in my case it sucked and it made me look like I bought something cheap for him. I am not saying he is ungrateful, but that's just the way I feel now.

The tablet is reasonably functional, but quality of construction is very poor, on top of spotty manufacturing process and failed quality control. My first unit had a defective camera with auto focusing problem. The TF201 model, which has a well-known problem with WiFi and GPS signals, has a better working camera (8MP back camera), but the GPS signal on TF300 is still very poor compared to other tablets such as Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0in. The second unit has a screen defect: the touch sensitivity is inconsistent over the surface. This means when I entered letters from the pop-up keyboard, some keys would not respond at all! There were also some dead pixel problem.So, while my experience in dealing with Amazon has been great, I think ASUS needs serious improvement on their quality control because 2 out of 2 TF300 I've received have some serious technical issues.Contacting ASUS customer support was extremely painful. It's difficult to get through to a live person and when I did, the quality of the tech was shameful! ASUS contracts out to some company in Jamaica for its support. And the customer care department (\"highest level customers can reach to for tech support) in Fremont was also a waste of time. All they could do was to give me a \"case number\", but NEVER followed up on it.

I gave it two stars because maybe tablets are not for me. My wife and I decided to get tablets for \"V\" day. We got her the Asus TF101 and I decided to wait. None of the other Tablets were matching up on price, so when I saw the TF300 for the same price for the 32G, I jumped on it. Price wise it was a good deal.One of the first few days I had it, the letter \"a\" just kept rolling across the screen like it was stuck. It took me a few minutes to actually be able to get the tablet to turn off. Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal. I though I should be able to use it in my car like a GPS, but I guess not. I work in the back of the plane and my goal was, I thought it would be cool to be able to see my location when flying across the ocean.I didn't like pecking with one finger to get typed out whatever I was doing. I downloaded a swype like keyboard, like what my phone has, to make typing quicker. It seems different on a cell phone compared to a Tablets because of the distance of going back and forth across the tablet screen. Yes, for the Asus you can buy the keyboard and attach it to the tablet, but then I might have well just bought a laptop (which is what I'm looking for now).I tried a couple of games on it. I did like some of the flying games with the sensors it has to be able to tell how you're holding the tablet. But really alot of the games, all you're doing is moving your finger across the screen to interact with the game, I found it boring.Battery life, I felt like it didn't really last all that long before I was having to recharge it, maybe five hours. of course it depends on what you doing and in the bottom right corner, you could bring up a little display that would show if the GPS or wifi was on, etc. but there were several other symbols that I had no idea what they meant and I couldn't really get them to stay long enough in view, because they would slide back over out of view. There were like 7-8 symbols that displayed, but only half of the were vissible unless you slide over to side to see the other symbols.There were very few documents that came with the device, maybe if they had something that came with it that explained more of the features and how to properly use them.The last straw was when I was using a website to search for airline tickets for our vacation. I had typed in the three letters for the airport but the tablets was acting like there was noting typed in the provided field.I was wanting a tablet because I though they would be faster to use.

Price-wise, this is THE most worthy to buy tablet.2. ICS 4.0. A OTA is available right after you turn on the tablet. right now it is running at ICS 4.0.3.3. Wifi works great, so does GPS. the indicator does not seems so accurate since it sometimes shows \"poor signals\" while it says excellent in the setting page.what is not so great......1. screen:Asus down grade the screen from IPS+ to IPS form tf201. It was not a significant difference, but it is becoming hard to read under the sun vs. tf201 is nice and clear. Color is not perfect, in my opinion. it is turning to be to over bright that some of the pictures would loose details.A big problem of the screen, also is the reason I decided to return it, is this. refer to this video:([...]). I have a same problem as shown on the video, on both the original one and the replaced one amazon mailed me. I am not too sure if it is a problem on the design or due from the software, since I upgrade my tablets once it come to me. But I don't want to waste time to give another shot since it have be present on 2 trys.2. plastic back:It does have a same size as TF201, however the plastic and the circles on the back makes it looks fat. Also not as stable as TF201. the gorilla glass is removed from this tablet, that make it feels soft. I mean, while you are holding this tablet on a corner, it feels bent for a small angle. On the left corner of mine, it clips when I am holding it with one hand. I result it from the softness of the back material.3. file system? (not so sure, may due for my wrong operation)In it's file, there are some sample pictures and musics. It took me a whole night to try to delete those files. and irony, I didn't find out it comes back after I reboot. Also, while I was trying to copy me music file to the tablet, several times, It shows a copy window but not copying. I'm in Windows 7, by the way.Thanks for great service from amazon. Tablets comes fast and did not give me any worry when I try to replace or return it.(returning the second one, hopefully not...)So, I am not recommending this tablet right now. problems might be solved after several batches.
