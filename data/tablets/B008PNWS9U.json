GetJar app works but when you use it to download an app I always get a connection error message. The only market app that I have gotten to work is Amazon. Kindle & Netflix app that came preloaded did not work but worked fine after I downloaded them from Amazon and reinstalled it.The built in speaker were busted. They make a constant crackle/pop/buzz sound.The audio jack does makes the same sound when using headphones. I tried 2 different types of headphones and both did it. I will send the tablet back to Walmart and exchange it for another one.Touch screen works perfect. I only need to touch the screen lightly for it to work.Video play back is very good with great graphics.It does come with flash pre-installed (flash needs to be updated) but I used the apps (not the browser)to watch videos on YouTube & Netflix.Battery life is really good. I can easily get 7-8 hours out of it but not while watching videos. Just standard app uses like email, browser, facebook, and google chat. I haven't timed it to see how it does on just watching video only.(Remember to check all your apps to see if they need to be updated)Does not take long to reformat the tablet if need too. Only took me less than 5 minutes.It comes with 2 cables. A small USB adapter that allows you to connect External Hard drives or flash drives to it. The other cable allows you to connect the Tablet to the computer for transferring files. When connected to PC my tablet did not charge by the USB port but I am not for sure if it was supposed to do that but it does come with a wall charger adapter but the cord is short and should have been longer.This is my first tablet and learning to use it did take me some time but overall its fairly easy to use. I love the live wallpapers that comes preloaded on to it.The color of the tablet is not the same color displayed on all the websites that advertise them. I bought the red one but I got was a dull ugly red color not the bright sleek one that is displayed on the sites. I will reorder it in a black color.Overall I love this tablet even though the speakers & audio jack are messed up but I can easily exchange it for another one not a big deal. The speed was very impressive to me on this Tablet because of the price. I own a gaming PC with a 6 core processor that I paid $1,500.00 just for the tower by itself. Speed and multi-tasking is everything to me. This Tablet isn't built for multi-tasking because it only has 1 core processor in it but it's fast (this is why I ordered the 1gb of RAM)and the multi-tasking that I do on it, the Tablet handles it just fine but it will have it's limits. I've used iPad's before and liked them but I would never pay that much money for a Tablet when I can buy a laptop. Google Play will not run on it but there are ways around it but compared to the iPad it's not that much of a difference except the price. So when I say that this tablet is good it's really good and I am thinking about buying another one for a family member.I do recommend paying the extra money and getting the warranty because you never know when you may need it even if it is your own fault of damaging the Table, the warranty will cover it. I bought my Tablet at Walmart and got the extra warranty for $19.00 and I have an extra 2 year warranty when the manufacturing warrant expires. I've already learned in the past to go ahead and pay for the extra warranty on all electronics. I have a 3 year old 52' Plasma TV from Samsung that needs both motherboards replaced at the cost of over $600.00 because I did not buy the warranty.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just awful", "Author": "Kayla Conley", "ReviewID": "R1YLW8OEC2YAQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If I could give it negative reviews, I would. I ordered two. One blue and one pink. The blue one came bricked and we had to send it back to get another one. They were slow from day one. It doesn't have the google play store as someone in the reviews said. It has mobile1 market and that's not so great. After about two days mine started randomly shutting off and wouldn't come back on unless I plugged it in. The point of this was so I could take it with me while I went somewhere and that took that option out of the picture. I mean, it would crash about ten times a day, minimum. The memory is very small. I even had a 16gb sd card in it and still only fit about 20 apps. That's the same memory as my iPod and it has hundreds of apps and still goes pretty fast.The camera is terrible. It's dark even in daylight and extremely blurry no matter what. Both cameras are exactly the same. I wanted it for skyping with family too but it wouldn't run it and they wouldn't be able to see me if it had. The browser crashes if you try to go to a website and I had to download a different browser every other day because they all did the same thing eventually.It's so flimsy too. I bought a case for it and dropped it on carpeted ground and it cracked. Then the crack just kept getting worse. It is totally unusable and I hate that we wasted so much money on these pieces of garbage. Seriously, save up for something else. This isn't worth a dime.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet for the Price!", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R11KLNY0505XD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Prestige 10 Tablet the other day not quite knowing what to expect since I had my heart set on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. However, the Prestige was $100 cheaper. I am VERY HAPPY with this tablet. The battery life lasts 8 plus hours, the touchscreen is fast and works well, the speakers sound good, and it is nice and light. I ordered the pink one. The color looks the same as on the website. The only thing I had trouble with is downloading a few apps. It doesn't have Google Play on it, but there are alternatives to that. Amazon App Store works great. But now I have everything on it that I need. Also, I recommend downloading a different browser for it, I downloaded Dolphin Beta which made browsing much quicker.

It doesn't tell you how to do much of anything.  No specific instructions or directions to follow.  You have to play around forever to figure everything out.The browser it comes with is useless.  It took me 20 minutes to download a simple web page.  I had to upload Google Chrome browser and it works a bit faster now but is still not up to the speed it should be.I purchased a book from Kindle using the application that the Prestige comes with.  The book is clearly there as there is an icon for me to click.  When I click to open it - I get a black screen.  There are choices for me to bookmark, look at the cover, go forward or back....however with the black screen - I can do none of those things.  I finally got the book to download after 30 minutes of black screen only to find yet another black screen the very next time I went back in to actually begin reading it.  This time it STILL has not downloaded and I have tried several times.  VERY FRUSTRATING. I purchased something I can't read.I have tried several of the other APPS that come standard and I always get an error message.After playing around to figure out the camera, I have taken several pictures of which I cannot find anywhere.  Shouldn't there be a gallery where my pictures are all displayed like my Android phone?  I can find the jpg files but cannot open them up.  I'm sure they are there somewhere - it's just a matter of taking an hour to find them.I have tried contacting Visual Land via their \"HELP\" desk website two times.  What a joke.  They have never once contacted me back and you cannot get through when you call the number.  I should have spent the extra $75 and got a Kindle Fire.  Something I can actually use for more than playing Angry Birds.

I got it in the mail within a few days and loved it, until I found a bunch of little quirks in it. The speakers have this constant whine, no Google Play (Which I thought was a given on an Android Tablet), and the wifi cuts out while I'm using it. Also, this tablet is super slow to load apps, and even when loaded, apps have a high tendency to crash. All in all, I expected more out of a tablet, but I should have been more cautious when buying such a cheap, off-brand tablet. I wanted to use this tablet for school and personal time, but that isn't going to be happening with such a low-powered tablet.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Went back faster then it was delivered", "Author": "BATCThomas", "ReviewID": "R2XYGR1Y1G76KN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "a complete waste of money.

Hite \"Hopeless BookWorm\"", "ReviewID": "R3VB8UKPNPMV9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have trouble with my hands (diagnosed as tendonitis 20 years ago), which makes writing difficult. I became desperate for a tablet for note-taking at an annual convention, because typing is much easier on my hands than writing. So I started the search for an inexpensive tablet with decent reviews. I chose this one, and I'm pretty pleased with it, especially because it didn't cost $300.00-$400.00.Pros:1. Cost. It is not $300.00-$400.00.2. Ease of use. I wanted it for note-taking without an internet connection. It was pre-loaded with Evernote, which is, reportedly, really wonderful, but requires an internet connection. I downloaded the Thumbkey app and the  Inkpad app (which doesn't require internet) from Amazon as an alternative, and was able to take notes for three days with no pain or strain at all! The touchscreen is sensitive enough for typing. I have it set up so that I can see where I touch the screen.3. Amazon apps. Although I don't have access to Google Play, I've still been able to download a few apps that I like, such as the ones mentioned above, and the Kindle app for reading eBooks. I use the Kindle app every single day.Cons:1. Sensitivity. I found that it may not have enough \"points\" (I don't remember if that's what they're called or not) for great accuracy in highlighting or underlining PDF documents, but I'm still able to do both to my satisfaction. Sometimes, if I've had the tablet on for hours, it goes a little crazy when I try to turn pages in an eBook, with \"points\" jumping around in different areas of the screen. When this happens, I either re-start it, or use the manual volume keys to turn pages.2. Screen orientation. The only thing I really hate about it is this:  If I turn off screen auto-orientation, it doesn't allow me to choose how I want the screen oriented. The default is landscape, rather than portrait, which is not convenient for reading on my side in bed. That was my second favorite thing about the e-reader I used to own. I could prop the cover sideways like an easel, and read in portrait orientation. It was very easy on the eyes and I went through books very quickly!3. Not having access to Google Play for downloads is a little issue. There are some apps I would like that are only available there. I tried to follow the instructions for getting Google Play on my device, but I wasn't successful. I'm not quite techy enough to accomplish it.I haven't done everything with this tablet yet, because I have to rely on public wi-fi for now, so time is an issue. I've had it for a little over one month, and I don't love it, but I'm satisfied.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useless Tablet - Don't waste your money", "Author": "robert j estrada", "ReviewID": "RIFIUXJT3Z67D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have not been able to download any apps since I received it.

The preloaded applications work sometimes and sometimes not. GetJar and 1 Mobile only work half the time. Their ereader does not work at all.For instance, after a website was taking forever to load on the Prestige, I picked up my trusty old Fire and opened the same website, retrieved the information I needed and closed it, while the Prestige was still thinking. Yet the Prestige is supposed to be faster and have better graphics than the old Fire.The Kindle application crashes more than it works and when it does, you have to open it with the tablet in the horizontal position, wait a few minutes then switch to vertical.We won't even talk about putting the speakers on the back of the unit.I plugged in the hdmi card and attached it to my TV -- and that was the only thing that works great.

It's not just for younger kids or teenagers either.  I'm gonna buy one for myself so I can skype with my daughter, who's in college.  An extra bonus is that this tablet comes in many colors.

The tablet I received was beyond defective from the start-up until I gave up trying to get it to work a few weeks later. CONTRARY TO ALL the Amazon customer service questions that were answered by phone, THIS TABLET DOES NOT COME WITH NOR CAN IT DOWNLOAD GOOGLE PLAY!I ordered this tablet just as it went on sale, and unfortunately there were no reviews on it before then. Everyone else ordered it AND QUICKLY RETURNED IT...then the BAD reviews started piling up on this site. The touch screen was mostly unresponsive, then after a few weeks this thingy acted like it was possessed! I took videos that i'm going to have to upload to YouTube because they are so beyond whacky. This tablet actually started going beserk, with more than 10 minutes (till I gave up and force-shut it off) of windows randomly popping open that I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED. It even opened up the touch keyboard itself AND STARTED TYPING random letters that made no sense. It was kinda funny at first, but literally this tablet became impossible to use.I would touch the app I wanted to open, but it would highlight/open an app ON THE OTHER SIDE of the screen. Angry Birds worked in the beginning, but then even that refused to work. It would auto-disconnect me from FREE wifi every few minutes (while my old XP laptop would remain online on the SAME free wifi). I tried for days to get the 'settings' button to open up that window, but it kept sliding over -left to right-AWAY from where I touched to open it! It took me about 3 weeks to get the tablet to RESET, since pushing a paper clip in the reset opening on the outside of the tablet refused to work (it would only auto turn off the tablet). I was FINALLY able to get the settings window to open and do a full factory reset, but it was still fully defective with the touch screen unresponsive (and the minimize/zoom feature still disabled most of the time  without any way of my fixing it).I SUGGEST YOU NEVER BUY THIS TABLET. I hope this company figures out how to fix this thing, it's a shame that at that price and with the supposed features that it didn't work....would have been great if it had. This is tablet #4 that I received defective from Amazon - 1) a Coby (never buy anything from them!), 2) the replacement Coby which was worse than the first one, 3) an Allwinner tablet-also defective, and now this 4) Visual Land.I've given up trying to find an under $100 tablet that ACTUALLY WORKS. I will also NEVER buy another tablet that isn't a well known major top known brand. I JUST missed out on buying a Lenevo Tablet, all sold out through Amazon...after it took me weeks to find a tablet that is under $200. I am either buying next a Lenevo, Samsung Galaxy, or similar item...and praying I FINALLY get a working tablet that actually does what it's supposed to and doesn't freeze up or have wifi issues.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't ever buy a Visual Land tablet.  10\"", "Author": "Margaret Owes", "ReviewID": "RPC6I4310M946", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Because this is the worst tablet that I have ever have the misfortune to order.

It's resolution is enough to pass on most everything, but not enough.  You will notice the pixelated content frequently.speakersfacing away from youthey are not loud at all.wife and I have to use headphones whenever we're watching a movie, even in the quiet evening hours.also -- every time you touch the screen, for 5 seconds the speakers crackle no matter what you're doing.extremely annoying.operating system.  this tablet might have android 4 ice-cream sandwich, but i think it has a lesser known version calledthe ice-cream-bologna sandwich - but it has some intuitive functions that i enjoyed.BUT the hardware that matches it creates serious lag with everything you do.  every touch, every flickcomes with 5-10 seconds delay for a response.  booting up Netflix takes minutes.  when it finally loadsit takes at least another 2 minutes for it to stabilize enough to browse.  the flicking and scrolling is choppyat best.  you have to touch multiple taps frequently for it to recognize what you are trying to do.  programs crash constantly.when i get home from work i like to sit down and read my bibleon it for a while.  here's how that works...  sit down, turn screen on.  wait for screen to respond, screen comes on 15 seconds laterthis is not a boot up, this is just waking the screen.  flick the unlock  icon and wait another 5 seconds for the home screen to appear.do not touch it at this moment.  you must wait for up to 3 minutes for it to finish telling you what has crashed while you were at work.  (AHHRG steam rising from the eyebrows)it tries to load things that i didn't load.  amazon app store crashes, netflix crashes, bible, keyboard, gmail, turbo racer, calendar all crash and i didnt even click on them... the list goes on.  they all crash immediately upon waking the screen.  sometimes you have to reboot to get it to behave.  finally you get through all of that and the bible app is loading.  wait another 1-2 minutes just to load the app.  so somewhere in the time frame of 5-10 minutes after i sit down to read, i actually get to read my bible.by that point i am so frustrated and blood pressure rising, i have to pray first to calm down.  It's a lesson in patience every time I want to use this thing, and it's BRAND SPANKING NEW !!!!!  not doing this anymore.  return - refund - moving on.
