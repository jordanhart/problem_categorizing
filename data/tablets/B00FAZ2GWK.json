At that price this tablet has a lot of power and a lot of apps for the price.  The wifi and parental controls setup was very simple and I was able to have my child up and playing in about 30 minutes.  It took about 30 minutes because all of the included apps have to be installed.  Once it was going my child spent the rest of the day using it to take pictures, listening to audio books and playing educational games.Christmas came early and my son loves it.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good device when compared to similar devices", "Author": "Melissa J. Newman \"msolomon25\"", "ReviewID": "R201RV22B84KYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my kids 8, 10, and 1 year old.  In terms of hardware, it had the largest screen in the \"kids\" category -- 8\" instead of the standard 7\".  All of the other specs were the same as the other tablets in this category we were looking at: 2mp camera, 8GB internal memory (expandable with SD card), Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.In terms of installation, the check boxes on the installation website are a pain to click.  They are too small even for my petite fingers.  Although, I had the screen in the portrait position, so it might be different in landscape.  Once you create an account through the tablet, you can just log in through a regular computer to change the settings in the future.  So that is annoying (not a deal breaker, although it felt like it during the installation).There is one setting during setup that allows all searches to return Wikipedia as a \"child safety feature\".  Basically, the tabeo is prepending \"site:wikipedia.org\" in front of all searches -- standard Google feature.  The concept I agree with, but I would never put Wikipedia and Child safety into the same category.  Tabeo should allow a user to set the \"default\" website.  For example, I personally would pay the subscription for World Book or Brittanica and use that feature for one of those sites, because those sites have editorial staff and \"questionable\" topics return what one would expect from a middle school textbook.  Wikipedia shows actual photographs, which I would not consider acceptable for children.  But that is a software issue, not a hardware issue.I have not fully tested the internet filtering.  We setup \"opendns\", so we have basic protections throughout our whole Wifi at home.The default \"bookmarks\" for chrome (the browser pre-installed) are all grown up bookmarks (MSNBC and other similar websites).  I would have expected to see sites like Disney, PBSKIDS, etc.  But again, that is an annoying software issue, not a hardware issue.I agree with the others.  Install \"Amazon App\" (from a standard download from Amazon) which will allow the downloading of more apps.  Once that is installed, you can install the Netflix App (http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android)This tablet is a toys-r-us product.  The toys-r-us sales people are given a \"test\" about this device, so they can answer customer questions, but I don't think they were ever given a tabeo to play with.  The sales person did not know anything about installing Amazon Apps.  He thought it was not possible, but if a parent allows downloads and installs the Amazon download app, it is possible. Also, the covers that toys-r-us sells are marked as being for a Tabeo e2, but they only fit the 7\" Tabeo.  I ended up buying a cover from Walmart that is marked as being for a 9\"-10\".", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Tablet for 5 and up...", "Author": "Rebecca Gibson \"Becky!\"", "ReviewID": "R2E4AJHAK95ZO9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son for his 6th birthday. I was also looking at the nabi 2. I kept debating between the two. I finally decided on the tabeo. I based my decision on the price factor since they were basically the same in technology (well i'm not a techy, so don't base your opinion on mine) I wanted the buyer protection plan so it would have been $200 for the nabi v.s. $170 for the tabeo. My nephews have the nabi so I could compare more now then before I bought the Tabeo.Tabeo:Pros:1. I like the setup of the apps. Makes it look like a adult tablet.2. Good graphics and speed for a child's tablet.3. My son seems very happy with the ability to find his way around it easy.4. Parental controls.5. lightweight design.6. Durability*I will add more if I find more I like about it. I hardly play on the tablet myself.Cons:1. Camera is awful. The nabi has a way better camera.2. Freezing on some apps.3. The tabeo store is limited. (I also downloaded the Amazon market)4. I have had a few small issues with installing and some apps not working correctly. I reset the tablet and reinstalled. I haven't had the problem again so far.5. When my child pulled off the protective case himself it made the tablet come apart. It was fixable, I'm sure its the way the get in to fix the tablet.I think that's about it. We really do like the tablet.

The support number is out of service. These things are 150 dollar paperweights currently. I will hold on to it long enough to TRY and get some customer support, but I'm REALLY considering getting my money back. Not worth the frustration.

On Christmas morning my boys opened their tablets and wanted to play with them, but I was made to register the parental control first before they could play.I took the tablets into a quite place while they continued to play in an effort to register them without notice.  While the registration process seemed easy enough this is were the drama began!On both tablets simultaneously, I got to stage one of the process, and then to stage two, but I was unable to check the box on either tablet.  So I shut the system down and tried again... but no luck. So I attempted this process four more times before attempting to contact Tabeo tech support.  Guess what?  Their 24/7 tech support line was busy, and busy and busy; why couldn't they at least leave a message stating the obvious --- we're experiencing server issues and we're working diligently to resolve the problem or something like that, but not just a busy signal (I am still receiving a busy signal the day after Christmas).  So I tried their Chat Support, but no one would pick up and therefore I kept receiving a dialog box in which to leave message.  I then emailed them and 24 hours later I've yet to receive a reply.  And I am not at all sure why there are Chat Support Apps on the tablet when you can't chat until your Parental Control has been set up.I tried for hours, 13 hours to be exact to register these tablets.  And perhaps the most frustrating part was whenever I would get to step three and/or step four, I would be sent back to step one (very frustrating).I am not sure who wrote the program for this worthless device, but if they should be FIRED immediately if not sooner.  Imagine all of the children who received this for Christmas and were disappointed that Santa would bring them something that didn't work.Here's an idea for the geniuses at Tabeo/Toys R Us, rewrite the program and allow the children to play with some of the Apps that are rated kid friendly so that they could at least have access to their Christmas present and then have the parents register the tablet when the child needed access to the Internet.

I would spend a little extra to buy something that actually functions seamlessly rather than spending hours trying to set upthis supposedly \"kid friendly\" tablet.  Initially I liked that fact that it had parental controls, but it turns out it is really annoying and time consuming for the parent.

They lasted 19 days. Instead of drawing power via The USB mini port, they come with tiny plugs (smaller than,  though similar to headphone jacks, and located on the same side for extra confusion) that very quickly failed on the tablet side. It would legitimately take 5 minutes of tinkering to find a way for the table to lay where it would charge.  The screens would pop out, and after that they would quit working periodically until the tablet was restarted. Were they dropped? Yes. But they came in a rubber, ruggedized case and were marketed for kids, so.....As for the parental controls, ehhh. It's easy to set up hours for Internet access. You can disable the Internet for a given hour block everyday, or a given day of the week, or an hour on certain days, etc without too much difficulty. Apps, however, require you to individually disable the app completely, then enable it for certain hour blocks. The rub is that every change requires a screen refresh.  So for me, for example, I wanted the tablets to have no Internet or functional apps after 8pm (bed time) until 6am (when they would normally be up for school). That meant getting to the screen for controlling Internet access, then 14 screen refreshes at several seconds apiece. Then navigating to the apps control page, then a similar 14 screen refreshes per app after one to disable it and another to pull up the list to disable by hour blocks. After all that, one app was set up the way I wanted it. The tablet comes stock with 29 apps. So 14 screen refreshes per app times 29 apps, times two tablets for me. You'll understand that I was a little irritated because that is the type of tedious, repetitive work computers were. INVENTED to end.All in all, the tech support promised to update the settings matrix on the parental controls sometime in February of 2014, and they were pretty prompt about getting back and helpful. As far as how it ran, the tablet itself performed okay, I think. It wasn't blazing fast, but I didn't spend a blazing fast amount of money.The real problem is that the tablet that was supposed to be rugged enough for kids had flimsy construction and a frail plug in for the charger.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "B. Fulson", "ReviewID": "R1OL8UZL3G033G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off I have to say that the Tabeo E2 looks really nice and is packaged very well.  I bought two Tabeo E2 tablets, a blue one for my son and a pink one for my daughter for Christmas at my local Toys R Us Store.  Unlike other reviewers that state that they cannot set up their parental controls I was able to setup the parental controls without difficulty.  However that is when the problems started.  The parental control blocked EVERYTHING (even the pre-loaded apps) on the Blue Tabeo.  I made some adjustments to the filter by allowing everything except for porn and violence and tried playing the games again with no luck.  I got frustrated and tried to set up the parental controls on the Pink Tabeo.  I was able to set up parental controls but as soon as I opened certain apps like My Little Pony that came pre-loaded it would crash and the tablet would restart (it seems to take forever for these tablets to load after being turned on or restarting).  I tried contacting customer support on the tablet and the Mobile Parental Filter took me to the home screen with a message that said APP BLOCKED: check parental filters on Mobile Parental Filter on left corner of the screen.  I tried to tap the mobile parental filter on the screen as it said to do and nothing ever happened.  I used the Blue Tabeo to try to contact customer support and I got through and typed my message in.  No joke I waited for 52 minutes for someone to respond telling me that the network is down and try to be patient.  While I was waiting all that time for that very helpful response I used the Pink Tabeo to go back to the Parental Control site online and unchecked EVERYTHING.  I took off all filters just to see if the tablet would respond better to the apps without the parental filter on.  I had no such luck.Their App store was pretty disappointing as well.  I was able to install some games from the app store and they would work on the Pink Tabeo sometimes.  Another issue with the app store that I had is the fact that the games available are not very popular and most of the apps that have reviews are very low but no comments are available to read.  I was never able to download the Amazon App store like the Toys R Us Tabeo E2 Q&A; section says that I should have been able to. The parental filter blocked me from downloading it.  I spent about 3 hours Christmas Eve trying to set these tablets up and they were a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.  When I took them back to the store the lady behind the counter actually told me she is tired of the Tabeo E2 because LOTS of people were returning them.  When I looked behind her on the shelves beneath the counter there were about 20 Tabeos that had been returned just that morning.  Like I said in the beginning, they are really nice visually to look at, but when you go to actually use them they are a junk.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Grandson loves it!", "Author": "Paul Mazurkiewicz", "ReviewID": "R1PSX5L0AQWKY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my girlfriend's 5 yo grandson for xmas.
