I've used it on a PowerMac G5 running OS X 10.5.8 with two monitors. At one point it worked pretty well, though not nearly as well as the handwriting built into higher-end versions of Windows 7. The strokes are not as smooth, the recognition of poorly drawn characters is not as forgiving, editing is harder.  Also, the tablet is not quite calibrated correctly and there's no way to adjust the calibration.  This is a minor annoyance. Recently when I've used it I've had two big problems. First, the screen cursor doesn't track the pen when you hover it above the tablet. Second, when trying to use full screen input I got a spinning beachball cursor and was unable to get control back. I had to reset my Mac. It' been years since I've had my Mac crash like this.  I probably should uninstall and reinstall and try again, but I don't think it's worth the effort.This may work better with an Intel mac, or if  you don't have have two screens. It doesn't work for me.Chinese handwriting may work with Apple's Magic Trackpad. If it's like the Chinese input on the iPhone, it will be worthwhile.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0032ANCEQ"}}
