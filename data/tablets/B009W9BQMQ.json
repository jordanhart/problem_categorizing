{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2EBIZ57N5JG0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.  It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day!  It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have.  I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system).  I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version.  I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version.  I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010).  However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once.  I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day.  I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.).  The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will.  If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device.  In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc.  I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting.  Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVING THE NEW IPAD 4!!  HERE'S A BREAK DOWN", "Author": "Bigz \"BIGz\"", "ReviewID": "RM1Y65IQTWOX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.Externally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.

Well, this is essentially an iPad3 with a few improvements that I really like.I already own an iPad2, but decided to upgrade to this because I needed to bump up to 32GB.  That, and a deal on this iPad which was incredible convinced me to upgrade now. I still use my MacAir and my Dell laptops, but the iPad is my daily go to device and where I go an iPad is going. Great battery life and minimal problems make this a much loved convenience.The improvements are not overwhelming, but the truth is I already love the iPad and this makes it better. I've always thought the screen image was very good, but this is an obvious step up. It is clear, bright and vivid with the improved retina display.The iSight camera at five megapixels is very good, but I wasn't complaining about the pictures I took with my old iPad. Still, it is a nice improvement and it takes a much clearer picture than my old iPhone.The new processor is really fast. I didn't think it was slow before but when I have a lot of apps running I've noticed that it is faster. You'll have to trust me on this one. I tend to run a lot of stuff at the same time and the old iPad was slower, but not to the extent that I found it irritating or irksome.I like the new lightening connector which is an 8 wire adapter. Just me, but it seems less clunky. However, if you have a lot of Apple products that use the old 30 wire adapter, this may be a pain. I'm going to have to get another car charger/wall charger and I'll have to take two chargers to cover both adapter types when I hit the road.Another thing I like is my personal secretary Siri. Depress the screen button and Siri is ready to roll. It is voice interpretive intuitive software that retrieves information. While this will probably seem like rudimentary artificial intelligence in a few years, I get a total kick out of it. It's nice to get directions or find out where the Sox are playing or get the earliest showing of a movie. Love it, though I am still playing around with it and probably haven't scratched the surface yet. I don't know if there is any truth to this, but I've heard that the Suri software may be available for the earlier versions of iPad at a later date.As for the size and weight, minimally larger but I'd be hard pressed to say this except I compared the specs.Here is the thing. If you don't care about a better camera or a better display or a faster processing speed or having your own cyber slave to talk to, go with the less expensive iPad2.I like Apple products. I have been using the iPad for two years now and it is fairly trouble free. The few problems I've had were the result of software upgrades. I am absolutely no techie type, but the problems have all been fixed with minimal grief.This product is getting 4* because the differences between this iPad and its predecessor are slight when you look at the overall big picture. This takes a great product and kicks it up a notch or two, but it hasn't reinvented or reimagined the iPad.Update: I am liking this better each day. The updated processor is nice but this also seems a bit more intuitive if it can possibly be so.The imaging is incredible and the pictures this takes are amazing in their clarity and level of detail.I found that my pricey Joby stand case, which was supposedly made to fit with my iPad 2 works with the new iPad despite very slightly different dimensions. I'm delighted that it doesn't have to be tossed.The only problem I've encountered thus far was an upgrade to the software. This is Apple's problem since it screwed up our other iPads with the same problems, most notably with mail. There is a fix that I found on an Apple forum.Love this, but it is still a 4* considering everything.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "You need one too!", "Author": "Lionsfan \"LionsFanForLife\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0NIXN13N3MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a MacBook and our household owns 3 Ipod Touch devices, and I made the mistake last year in buying the Nook Tablet.  It was ok, but I really didn't use it much because it was a pain to even access web pages, just clumsy overall.  So I plunked down the cash this year and took to leap.  I bought this IPad on Black Friday from the Apple store and it is getting heavy use every day at my house.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros-Awesome Retina display- this is pretty nice.  I wouldn't say it was a selling point, but is nice to have.Nice chip- this has the newest chip in it, and you can't get that with the mini.Apps- I love the apps.  My Nook was a joke compared to the immense amount of choices I have now.Great for kids- My 4 year old loves it...and I mean LOVES it.  There are so many good free apps for her to learn with.Voice dictation- This is it folks.  This was where I dropped the extra $130 or whatever.  You can build documents just speaking.Lightweight- it feels really good as all Apple products do.Charge time- I run this thing all day long and just plug it in at night.Capabilities- I feel like I am just scratching the surface, seriously.Cons-Handling- You need a case, absolutely.  I bought an Otterbox Defender.  This thing almost hit the floor 2 times when I got it.

It is not my intention at all to harm apple, in fact I plan to return my ipad4 and buy an ipad3 because it was perfect.Also, Just to let you know, after I received my ipad4 I sold it and bought another one just to discover it had the same problem with Wi-Fi.Apple made a huge mistake with their new generation ipad4, and they should either fix the problem or stop selling the unit.

No slowdowns on apps that i previously had problems with.- Wifi speeds are also twice as fast. The improvements are noticeable, downloading on the Appstore, watching Youtube and just browsing are quick.- It runs cooler.

For this it deserves 5 stars. As an owner of the \"New iPad, aka iPad 3rd generation,\" however, I feel that Apple did an injustice to those who purchased it.The previous version was released to much fan fair in March 2012. This version was released a mere 7 months later, in October 2012. When I called Apple to find out why they would release a newer version so soon after the previous one, the representative who I spoke with informed me that there were problems with the 3rd generation, and as a result, Apple removed it from the market and introduced the generation 4.I have no problem with the fact that technology constantly changes, and that computers are outdated in short order. What I have a problem with, is the fact that Apple prematurely introduced the 3rd generation of the iPad knowing full well that it wasn't ready to be sold. While Tim Cook was onstage last March promoting the 3rd generation of the iPad as the most revolutionary product ever offered by Apple, he knew that it was just a stop-gap measure until the components were ready for the model that you see here.I love Apple products and have always thought that the company treated their customers in the highest regard. As a result of the above, I now feel differently about the company, not the products. As of this writing, Apple sells the iPad 2 and the iPad with Retina Display, aka the 4th generation. They do not sell the 3rd generation at all, as the one listed here is what the 3rd generation was supposed to be. I feel that this is very deceptive on the part of Apple and believe that owners of the now obsolete 3rd generation model should be given the option, for a fee to upgrade to the model presented here. I spoke with customer relations at Apple regarding the above and was told that this would not be an option. They readily agreed that there were \"issues,\" with the 3rd generation model, but refused to tell me what they are. In this regard, they are certainly not being very transparent to their loyal customers.So, the bottom line is that the iPad with Retina Display is a marvelous device, however owners of the previous generation got screwed. I'm giving the model presented here 5 stars, because that's what it deserves. On the other hand, if I had the option to grant stars to the way Apple treated owners of the previous version, I would give them just 1 star.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lemon, not Apple: wi-fi connectivity issues", "Author": "Bea Haven", "ReviewID": "R2FOXOVPREEH8N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I would love the iPad, but I don't even like it at this point.  I love my sister's iPad, my son's and others', but mine won't stay connected to wifi.  I tried to troubleshoot using Apple's website, called AppleCare several times, and ultimately sent the iPad to AppleCare for repair.  But my iPad still doesn't work.  In the same locations that my iPad is nonfunctional, I can use my sister's iPad (she has the iPad w/retina display, too, and I set hers up the same as mine) with no wifi connectivity issues.  But every time I try to access the internet, I get the message that my iPad is not connected to the internet. I go to settings, select the wifi connection, and if it connects at all, it's only briefly.  This happens not just with my home router, but at my place of employment and other wifi access public places (where other iPad users report no difficulty and I have no problems with my laptop, etc.). The AppleCare folks sent my iPad back in 2 days (fast service but the porblem is not solved) with a form letter that states my iPad meets Apple's specifications for acceptable performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my standards. I have a $700+ lemon. I know the Apple iPad is amazing when it works (and it usually works, according to the vast majority of reviews). If Apple replaces this lemon with an iPad that actually works, I will update my review accordingly.Update-1/13/13: I spoke with AppleCare again and was instructed to send the iPad back for maintenance--this will be the second time. Why should I expect it to work this time? What a a waste of time! Another week+ without a functional iPad. If the problem persists after this encounter with AppleCare, I was told the iPad would be replaced. I am becoming more disillusioned with Apple. I have had experience with other iPads and know they can be wonderful when they work, so I would not advise against buying this iPad. But purchase with the knowledge that there is a significant problem with wifi connectivity attested to by many consumers on Apple's own discussion forum. I'm thoroughly frustrated with this lemon and my experience with AppleCare!Update-1/28/13:  After a few returns for maintenance without improvement in performance, Apple replaced my new iPad with a refurbished one. It connects to the internet, but is slow.  I've updated my router, called my wifi provider, and it's still the same.  If I could, I would return this one. One of the big selling points of the iPad is the ease of use and mine has been anything but easy to use with this wifi connectivity issue. Another big selling point is the fast connection speed--not so for me.

Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking.

If they just stuck with that I'd never leave them.  Unfortunately I love my Google also and Apple is pulling an AOL by trying to make its customers be stuck with their apps.  We'll see how that works out for them, but they lost me as an iPhone customer because of it.That's my Apple rant :)  Moving on to the review, the 'new' new IPad, aka iPad 4, is nice and quick!  Had the original iPad and it became obsolete pretty quickly due to the small 256MB of memory - great for a game of freecell, but it couldn't hold more than a few web pages without having to do constant refreshes when you switch tabs, very annoying, hardly ever used it eventually.  Bought an iPad 3 for my girlfriend, she didn't like it and we returned it to buy $100 necklace which she loved.  Almost bought an iPad mini, cute size, then found out Apple only put in 512MB of memory - it can't handle many web pages without doing the annoying refresh thing either - already obsolete when it hit the shelves.  So iPad 4 had the nice high res screen and 1 gig of memory, still only half the 2 gigs that comparable Android tablets have, but that's why we'll all have to buy another tablet in a year or two rather than 3-4 years for any other electronic device - planned obsolescence, slightly annoying also.  I would do a Nexus 7 over the mini, but since I have an Android phone with a nice large screen (which I love compared to my iPhones), a Nexus 7 is too similar.So long story short, I like and use my iPad 4 a lot more than I thought I would, it's still currently the best tablet as of February 2013.  The higher res screen, although not a big difference in the store, is actually really nice once you get used to it.  My MacBook Air looks old now in comparison and I'll have to upgrade that when Apple adds the Retina display on the next generation.  Web pages look great, HD apps are more available now and I even use my iPad to read with the Kindle app ... although I suspect Apple will take that away from you at some point also, ha!  Greedy, oh well.  Best of all the iPad is very quick and has great battery life so far, using mostly for web browsing and not gaming.WIFI claim of double the speed - FALSE.  One of my big factors of getting the iPad was its claim of double the WIFI speeds as I want quick internet browsing.  No one at Apple Store knows how or why it will give you this or whether it will do it without special equipment like a new router.  So here is the deal - the new iPad gets HALF, not double, the WIFI speed of my three year old 2010 MacBook Air on the same (standard 2.4mhz) high speed cable modem WIFI router.  I get about 66Mbps (speedtest.net) on my 2010 MacBook Air and only about 32Mbps on the new iPad.  Tested it every way possible and the results only get worse if you adjust your router settings.  Long story short, you need to get a new dual band (2.4mhz & 5 mhz) router if you want to get the higher claimed speed, but the claimed speed is only in comparison to prior iPads.  Essentially buying a new router and going though the pain of setting that up with your ISP is the only way to get back to the wireless speeds Apple could do three years ago on a standard 2.4mhz WIFI router.  Browsing is fairly quick and will obviously depend on your broadband connection, but to claim double and then not even equal three year old speeds is a little annoying.In conclusion, with all the little issues that Apple makes me not like them as a company, they still do make great hardware and they have a stable operating platform.  If you are looking for a quick, smooth, full size tablet, the new iPad is hard to beat.  We'll see what the rest of 2013 has to bring.  As Android apps convert to full size tablet and HD over time, I think next year Apple will see a lot more competition.  All I want is my Google apps on my iPad, is that too much to ask for to keep me an Apple customer in the future?  Will have to go through the hassle of jailbreaking this to be able to make Chrome my default browser and then Apple will not allow updates, slightly annoying.

I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the folks at the store but when I asked if they actually did not have an ipad in the store to replace mine, the answer was \"warranty replacements come from a different inventory than ones for sale\".  And not one store in the greater Miami area had a \"Replacement\", according to them.  I was told my only option was to go to a UPS store, and mail it via ground to them, and then in a week or so they would send me a \"Replacement\".

I had several issues with the product when I first received the iPad, starting with a small issue of the home screen button not functioning properly.

After several more hours on the phone with both Apple and Verizon, I was finally able to get them to over-night me a new SIM card and thought everything should be fine... wrong.The big issue I am now having is a \"No SIM card\" error, which I clearly do have as evidenced by the SIM card in my iPad.

My iPad will work great for some time and then give me that error and no longer let me connect to the internet through my Verizon service.All in all, when the iPad is working, its amazing, however when you pay >$700 for an item you expect it to work perfectly without having to lose hours of your time at the Apple store and on the phone.

That said, it's not without some flaws and annoyances. Foremost, there's no consistent method to back navigate. Perhaps, this was one of those cases where design overrules function; in order to keep the device looking elegant they sacrificed functionality. The result is confusion and inconsistency. In some cases you find yourself navigating back via the app itself; however sometimes you need to use the home function or start swiping. For example, at one point I opened a PDF that was attached to an email but then I could not easily find a way to close the PDF to return to the inbox. There's no consistency as to where the back function is to be found or what it may be called. Often you are forced to make reaches across the screen whereas if there was one consistent placement for a back function you always know where it is. The same is true for getting a list of apps running in the background. You are forced to use a awkward four finger up motion.  Why not just give us a consistent button for a list of running apps?  I found the need to use 4 finger swipes annoying.. Another missing function is the cancel key. If you accidentally start to download a huge file and want to abort - where's the key to stop the download?  The app store is annoying as you can't search for apps in ways of your choosing. Why not offer advanced search that would give you some options to sort and filter?  Another issue I have with the device is its dependence on iTunes. Certain files cannot be removed from the device unless you are on iTunes, really? Why? I should be able to delete files off my device. I'm assuming there's an app for doing that but really - why not just make that part of the OS? Speaking of what's not included - why not include a free calculator? Do I really need to shop for a basic calculator? The native Maps app is a work in progress with many roads or local features not labeled correctly. If you want to hook this device to a camera you need to purchase a special adapter but check the reviews for the adapter as many users are reporting it no longer works after the latest OS update. There's no easy way to manage your cookies in safari. In advanced setting you can either delete all cookie data or none.  It has a very nice display however I refuse to adopt Apple marketing speak and call it \"retina\" display. Don't bother thinking you'll be able to send anything to your printer unless of course you have a specific \"air\" printer that will work with the Apple iOS.

It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day! It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have. I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system). I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version. I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version. I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010). However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once. I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day. I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will. If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device. In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc. I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting. Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "As good as advertised", "Author": "stu", "ReviewID": "RMGBPKEZ1NMXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Grandma bought this for our Daughter on her Birthday.

Here I am going to talk about what 'new' features you see in the IPad 4 (also called the 'new' IPad).First off.. they don't make the IPad 3 anymore.. when this was created it was immediately a replacement for the IPad 3.  There wasn't a lot of fanfare as this wasn't a huge upgrade over the 3 and was just released with the new IPad Mini.The two main features (for those in the US):- Retina display.. I never thought the display was bad, but this is an improvement.  Compared next to the original IPad 3 there is a difference, albeit not overly noticeable unless you get an app that was made for the retina display (not many out there yet as the product isn't even 30 days old yet).  The glare issue is still there.  If you're using this outside it's basically like looking in the mirror if the sun is at a bad angle. Nothing changed on that front.- Faster speed. Same as above I never thought it was an issue but when using some speed tests it is faster and you'll notice, especially when multitasking, the apps run smoother with less 'hitches'.Also:- Like the IPad Mini and the new phone it has the 8-pin adapter and not the 'old' 30 pin insert.Everything else.. the exact same as the former IPad 3. Battery life is great and while I'm not a 'heavy' user of the IPad (mainly used for web surfing, basic apps, etc..) it fits all of my needs.  Overall, if you have the IPad 3 should you upgrade?  I don't see a major reason unless you're the type that HAS to have the latest and greatest.  I just happened to finally be in the market for one (after years of indifference) and with my roommate having the IPad 3 it was an easy comparison.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first iPad", "Author": "W.

They have periodically come to me to complain about lack of wifi connectivity, I usually restarted the device and most of the time it would connect (for a time at least).

The iPad is extremely useful and portable for studying anywhere, anytime.  It offers several different apps that allow you to store PDF documents, highlight, and annotate.A helpful tip for people interested in using this for school.  I subscribed for a free membership at Acrobat.com -- an Adobe product. This was a 100% free program.  You download the Acrobat app to your iPad, and it will allow you to view, highlight, and annotate.  The beauty of Acrobat is that they give you 5GB of free online storage.  (5GB is almost unheard of to get for free... Drop Box only offers 2GB for free.)  Once you have your Acrobat.com account set up, log on to the website from your desktop/laptop (wherever you have your PDF documents stored).  From there, you upload your PDFs to Acrobat.com, and you can access them anywhere and anytime by logging on to the website.  Your website login info will be saved in the Acrobat app on your iPad, and you can study and annotate your PDFs from there.  Once you are done studying, Acrobat automatically saves your modifications to those PDFs, so you can view your latest modified document ANYWHERE.  If you forget your iPad one day, you can log in on any computer and view/modify your documents from Acrobat.com.  **By using Acrobat.com you will not use up any of your iPads hard drive space, so the 16GB was more than enough for me.^^ Sorry about that tangent, but I found this extremely helpful, and I wanted to share it with everyone!

Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.I had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily.

I own iPhones and iPad 2. I bought the ipad 4 because of the price drops when the air was announced. I think we all can recognize that the Ipad as well as most tablets wont replace laptops and won't replace the PC or Mac for work. I use my ipad for entertainment and web and email and photos. The retina display is no big deal and actually makes photos look worse. I found many references to this in other reviews, but really did not believe for myself until I compared side by side with ipad 2. Mostly photos taken with camera phones of loer pixels look horrible on ipad 4 but good or even great on ipad 2. I am not impressed with the increased processor speed, as you really would not notice it anyway unless you play video games. I do not. Overall, there is really no discernible benefit to spend the money and replace an ipad 2. Of course if you did not own an ipad before, or owned the original, I highly recommend ipad over other tablets. I have owned and used many android based, and the Apple iOS I find better and much more stable. I give three stars solely based on the fact I don't see significant improvement between ipad 2 and 4 and the retina display is not a big deal,for web, email and apps.

I was able to return my ipad 3 to the apple store within 3 weeks of purchasing from them. At first I was angry that apple released a newer version after 6 months. I then purchased the refurbished ipad 3. After a while I found it to be slow and read many good reviews about the ipad 4. Black Friday came along and I was able to purchase the ipad 4 for cheaper than the price of the brand new ipad 3 version.On to my review. The ipad 4 is considerably faster than the ipad 3. I noticed this right away once I started using it. Opening, closing and switching apps is faster. Boot up is now half the time of the ipad 3. The ipad 3 took almost 50 seconds, ipad 4 takes 25 seconds. Wifi is also much faster. I have a newer router that supports dual channel bonding. Many web pages load almost instantly. Speed tests show much faster speeds. My ipad 3 would get 30-40 Megs down. My ipad 4 gets 60-70 megs down. The ipad 4 also comes with the lightning connector cable and a faster powered charger. This allows the ipad 4 to be charged in quicker amount of time (5hours and 15 minutes). The ipad 3 charged with its charger takes 6 hours to fully charge. The ipad 4 also has a newer hd front camera for FaceTime or Skype. The ipad 3 did seem slow at times mainly due to an under powered processor having to operate the demanding retina display. The ipad 4 no longer has this problem. My ipad 4 finally feels like my ipad2 used to feel. Fast and responsive. My ipad 4 is also getting 1-2 more hours battery life than my ipad 3. This is due to the a6x more efficient processor. I can get about 18 hours of web browsing and youtube watching with brightness on 25% and notifications, email, GPS and Bluetooth turned off. The ipad 4's screen is made by LG. At first I didn't like it compared to my ipad 3's screen made by Samsung. The screen appears with a yellowish tint when compared to ipad 3's which has a blueish tint. After using the ipad for a few days the ipad 4's screen grew on me. The LG screen is said to be more accurate and easier on the eyes. I also found it brighter, which means I can keep the brightness lower to save battery life.When the ipad 4 was first announced I was hoping it had some of the ehancements I had on my wish list. I wanted it to be lighter, thinner, stereo speakers and 2gb ram. None of these features were added to the ipad 4. The ipad 4 is still heavy and thicker than the ipad2. The ipad 2 was the perfect weight and thickness. The ipad 4 is still heavier and thicker due to its retina display and much larger battery. I don't know if the ipad 5 will be able to be made thinner and lighter. There is a good chance the next ipad will have stereo speakers like the ipad mini design. I'm still not sure how their will be room to fit the stereo speakers. Hopefully the next ipad will also have 2gb of ram. This is a much needed feature so that the ipad can better multitask and run many tabs without reloading pages.If you don't really need or care about a lighter, thinner ipad with stereo speakers and 2 gb of ram then you should buy the ipad 4 right now. The ipad 4 is a great device, which is the fastest when compared to any other tablet on the market right now. No other tablet will give you 10+ hours battery life. Apple continues to have the best tablet apps with 275,000 and growing. Apple also has great build quality and support. The ipad 4 is must have for previous owners of the ipad 1 or 2. If you have the ipad 3 and you bought it when it first came out I would still suggest waiting for the next ipad. Unless you can sell your ipad 3 for a reasonable price or you were able to return it. The next ipad will have more improvements then this version and will be released by October 2013 or even earlier.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "ipad vs MS Surface", "Author": "Aman", "ReviewID": "R3SMMYSRY22ZAE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have 2 iPads previously and so when time came to buy another, iPad was the top contender, but given the rising popularity of Microsoft Surface and Samsung Galaxy tab, I decided to try those out. MS Surface won hands down in my experience.First off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.Secondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.Thirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.Fourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.I like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.Not to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed.

I think that they use proprietary features and lock out very helpful items (like expansion cards and user-changeable batteries).

And I've never been a fan of the iDevices either.Until today.  My incredibly generous girlfriend got me an iPad for my Birthday, and I am truly blown away by its ease of use (for the most part - some settings are really buried, or in non-intuitive locations), its tight form factor, its unbelievable battery life, and it's unparalleled apps and games.After only a few weeks, I find that it is my go to device for checking email, social media, gaming, and gathering information.

I've owned each of the iPads (1, 2, 3, & mini) and just received this one.  It is very obviously faster than iPad 3!  I cannot believe the number of \"professional\" reviewers on tech sites stating that they didn't really notice any difference.I was enraptured when I first obtained iPad 3, and felt at the time that the retina display ticked off my last \"needs\" box as far as tablet computing.  But as I lived with it, it became annoying waiting on its A5X to scroll in a dense webpage ----- daily so.  And the internet browsing experience is the real reason to consider upgrading to the 4 from the 3; it really is that much better.  To use one of my favorite iDevice information websites as an example, go to www.imore.com on the iPad 3, and observe the staccato, stop-and-go browsing experience as you navigate down the page.  Now, do the same on the iPad 4; it's smooth as silk.I'll still be looking for the retina iPad mini when it arrives (looks like 2014 at this rate), but other than the slight heaviness of this iPad 4, I'm completely satisfied.  Noting the never-ending march to smaller-thinner-and-lighter-yet-longer-battery-life, it's difficult to see what Apple can do to improve upon this one.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "banda", "ReviewID": "ROY058C5D9DP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet!

I'm very happy with the upgrades.  Like with my old iPad I'm basically using it to surf the net, watch streaming videos/podcasts, and read books.  I don't take pictures with it or store music.  I'm also not a gamer - so I can't comment that much on the retina display - but I will say the colors are brighter and I find it easier to read books.  The big difference that I notice is in the processor.  Even with my crappy internet connection I notice a huge improvement in the speed with opening apps and streaming videos.  Battery life is longer than the iPad 2. However, because the battery is bigger on this device it takes a lot longer to charge.  I like to kill the batteries on all my electronic devices before I charge them and from a dead battery to 100% charge on this iPad it took over 8 hours to fully charge.  I wasn't using it when it was charging.  In fact, I read on a couple of review sites that this iPad will continue to charge up to 2 hours after it says it's fully charged.  My advice is to allow yourself extra time and charge it overnight if you can.All in all I'm very happy with it.  Since I carry it with me everywhere I bought the OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Pink Alpenglow for extra protection.

Last year I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 inch and still like it for the most part, but even I--a \"no knowledge with a mac\" person--must admit the tab and other devices like it don't come anywhere close to the complete experience with the ipad. My main reason for not buy this has been because I had never really gotten my hands on one up close. Then one day my son walked in with one, and I was blown away by the ease of use combined with applications that work so naturally. I spent hours upon days tweaking the galaxy tab and fighting notifications. None of that with this device. It's smooth, durable, and brilliant. I also purchased a Smart Cover which works just fine but I might end up getting one of the clamshell style cases for use as a laptop when I'm out and about. As I type this, the iWork suite is updating in the background and the lightning cable is connected without any slowdown at all. Couldn't get that much out of the android tablet.

She began using it in June.  By August it was already giving her trouble - the \"slide to unlock\" switch was not responding.

It self-launched the Notebook and began printing an endless chain of letters - Fffvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...  Next it self-launched the FaceTime screen.We took it to an Apple store for repair.  When the technician keyed in the serial number on his own screen, he found that this particular iPad had been manufactured in 2011 AND SOLD IN DECEMBER 2012 - five months before I purchased it !!I can only conclude that the original customer returned it to Amazon, which fraudulently resold it to me as a new iPad without having properly repaired it.Fortunately,  the Apple store replaced it for free.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "UNRELIABLE", "Author": "LE", "ReviewID": "R6TMNIZYSJTOU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife went on a business trip to south-America visiting companies.

On her way back, the iPad spontaneously showed an error (without doing absolutely anything other than turn it on) \"This iPad is disabled\" and asked to wait for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes all was gone. It started as if the iPad was new. I went to the iPad store and they said that they don't know why this happened and that they have no way to recover any data. All was lost. The best they could do is to exchange it for a different one. The lost data was worth so much more than the iPad.I think is unacceptable that this tablet may destroy the user's data and according to the Apple store employees, there's nothing wrong with it. If the operating system has a problem, user's data should not be deleted, even if it has to start cold.This is the second iPad we have and the second to fail. The first one, a first generation, just stopped charging and we had to pay Apple to exchange it for a different one.The lesson we learned is that this devices may be good for music, photos or any other unimportant tasks, but to me, they are toys.I wouldn't rely on this tablet on anything important.Update: It did it again. I went to an Apple store and they exchanged it. The employee at Apple said that they never saw this failure before.

Here are my thoughts after a month with the iPad and testing the other tablets.Pros1. Smooth user experience - I have a Galaxy S2 for my phone and had a 3GS before that, and though Android for phones is comparable to iOS, the iPad and iOS are seamlessly integrated to optimize load times, switching between apps, etc. while Android tablets sometimes lag2. Battery life3. More apps optimized for tablet / high resolution - everything on the mini looked fuzzy in comparisonCons1. Weight - iPad is heavier than the Nexus 10 and more than 2x the mini2. iOS is probably better suited for phones than for tablets, where android's customization / widgets would make for a better user experienceThe iPad has met my expectations.

I found myself in a job where I am on very remote locations with quite a bit of downtime and finally decided that I could use one.I have been absolutely thrilled with this device. It is extremely stable, even with the new iOS 7 operating system. I am very happy that I chose the Retina model, because the screen is basically perfect. For everything from web browsing to watching Netflix, the quality of video and images is second to none.App performance on the iPad Retina is superb, and many of the iPad specific apps are simply mind-blowing, particularly some of the art apps like Sketchbook Pro and Procreate. I recently acquired an Adonit Jot 4, which is a pressure sensitive stylus that connects via Bluetooth, and it works like something out of the future. Just crazy good. For forum participation, writing Amazon reviews, etc., I prefer my laptop simply because I don't like typing on a touchscreen, but that's just my personal preference. I can get around on the touchscreen and if I really wanted a physical keyboard, there are several available. But that's not really what the iPad is all about. It's not there to replace your computer; it's a different type of device that excels at browsing and media consumption and is portable in a way that no laptop is.Though it takes a bit longer than I would like to take a full charge, the battery life is excellent, and I rarely find myself needing to charge when I am out and about.As a media consumption / web browsing device, the iPad Retina is ideal. The screen is so amazing that it is generally preferable to me over a larger computer or laptop screen for these purposes.

When I first heard about the Retina display, I was sort of shocked by it and a bit doubtful. I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.I do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.I have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.This device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.5 stars all the way!!

I used it for about 2 weeks.  I found it not as intuitive and the learning curve, while not bad, was a bit more cumbersome to learn to use.  Also it was one more operating system I would have to understand and use. I have an iphone 5, which replace my 4.  The iphone is easy to use, all kinds of apps (though I dont use many, its nice to know they are available).  I have handle the ipad before from relatives etc and they seemed nice and all, but not much different  from the iphone and wondered why the fuss.  At the time, I just couldnt see spending the bigger bucks for the iPad.  I found out differently.  While the Kindle does everything it says it does,  I returned it and ordered this ipad.  I feel now that it is definitely worth the extra.  It has the same sharp image with the retina display as the kindle and I would say even better.  Since I travel a lot and have satelite for TV at home, I use a vulkano (like sling box) to view my DVR recordings and live tv stations from home.  The Kindle did an OK job, but the iPad is superior with that task.  the app for kindle worked, had to pay extra for it and the operating system handled it OK but every 30 to 40 minutes it would drop the connection.  The ipad app was free and rock solid, so far.  I had used the iphone for several years, and using the iPad is as comfortable with familiar icons and function.  It has a little larger screen, ease of use, more apps, and accessories than kindle which made me spring for the extra dollars.

model was on sale brand new for $550 I couldn't pass up the opportunity!This iPad feels like my iPad 2 but runs MUCH smoother and faster! I chose this over the iPad Air due to its specs being similar minus the size and upgraded chip; other than that I couldn't justify spending more for essentially the same device at 128 gigabytes.I upgraded to iOS 7.0.4 right out of the box via wifi in about 15 minutes (it aborted the first time but after plugging it in to the power outlet attempt #2 was a success!)Where I do not love Apple is in having to start from scratch & reload this new iPad with my content from the iPad 2 (no I do not & refuse to use iTunes due to its cumbersome nature & counter-intuitive user interface [I did use iTunes once but when my laptop was stolen & I synced my iPhone 4 to my new laptop iTunes would NOT let me sync it as Apple only allows ONE computer to be physically registered/assigned to an iDevice] so begins the tedious process of porting everything over.I DO though LOVE that Apple's enture suite of software is now available for download for FREE with iOS 7!I will update you all with further observations but judging from my iPad 2 experience I have no doubt i will LOVE this iPad 4 (the retina resolution OMG is a VERY vivid much needed improvement to the iPad). If you do have a physical disability or missing a body part the iPad is very handicap friendly.

This is a good generational jump from iPad 1 to iPad 4", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R2DOL5W2KM6Z4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had an iPad 1 for about 2 years.  With the apps that I use through the Apple store, I have gotten more than enough use out of it.  The iPad 2 was not enough of a generational jump without upgraded graphics, and the iPad 3 wasn't enough because of the resolution of the camera.  However, this model is truly a wonder and it will be with me until iPad 8 comes out, I suppose.The integrated camera has excellent resolution, as does the video.  The processor is perceivable faster for graphics intensive games such as those by Gameloft, EA Sports and the like.  Sound seems to have improved, as well.Although the latest rendition uses a different port from the predecessors, it's easier to use since either orientation will work.  It does essentially make my accessories, though, obsolete.  That means a new speaker dock, car charger and whatever else I may need.  However, I have become accustomed to using Bluetooth peripherals making connectivity more seamless.Operation is pretty much identical, and then there's Siri.  I find limited use for Siri since I have a Wifi-only iPad.  I can type faster than hold the Home button to talk, and voice recognition is ok.  Not great.  I can touch type must faster than Siri can understand me and react.  However, I'll give it more time.The housing is as small as iPad 2 and 3.  Battery life is essentially the same since Bluetooth and Wifi are always on with a 75% brightness.  The volume control is responsive.Since I have over 1200 apps, I'm pretty much stuff with Apple.  That is the main reason I haven't considered other operating systems, apart from the Kindle Fire.Overall, I'm pleased.  If you don't have an iPad, this is finally the one.  If you're waiting to upgrade from iPad 1 or 2, then it's a no-brainer.  iPad 3 is certainly not that much behind.  Intuitively, I prefer to have a jump in processing, graphics, sound and resolution before I plan to update, again.I love this device.Two thumbs up.Update:I decided to jump up in memory to the 128 GB version.  Music, movies and applications take up a lot of memory.

Thiel\"", "ReviewID": "R13C6MJ4CO2Z3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's termed the iPad 4 but technically it's the iPad 6.I bought this particular model several months after its release at an AT&T; store in a mall.  They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.This is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, \"That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.\"  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.In fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).Will you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.

Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems. There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work. You can get a lot of those same apps through the apple store, but many of the better ones are not free and you have to pick and choose your way through quite a few applications.There are probably more then 3, but these are the ones that stood out to me.

Just like my relationship with my smartphone, don't leave home without it.  Crystal clear on graphics.  Of course, this is my first ipad so I cannot really compare it on past experience.  Tons of apps, batteries lasts ok.  100% can last for about a day (I actually used it for about an hour every hour, and by about 9-930 pm, battery was at 15%.  Again, depending on what you are doing, it lasted me for about 2 more hours (I think).Price was great!  Seller was AWESOME (they actually gave me a cover for this ipad as a token of appreciation for the business).  However, with that being said, if you have kids that always run around, MAKE SURE TO INVEST on a more \"military\" style case.  If you call Apple, the only thing that they could suggest was..., well sir, just buy a new one??!?  (yeah, like I have $500 bucks, spewing out from my pockets.  My response; okay let me go to my money tree and pick some bills out, goodbye!  If you go to an electronics store, make sure to have at least $200 laying around.  I broke/cracked my screen after 2 weeks!  So needless to say, a case with something covering the actual screen, yes it is a must!

However, that's no longer true, at least when comparing iPad 4 to my HTC One. iPad 4 is just as smooth as HTC One, and is still laggy sometimes (For example the frame rate of some animation drops significantly). The screen is a bit yellow, and its overall performance is on a par with HTC One. iPad 4's hardware technically is faster, but no any difference is found on system speed so far. Therefore, iPad has no advantage over HTC One, except the much bigger screen.On the other hand, Android is of course MUCH freer and easier to use. The iOS and iTunes always takes me hours to do something that can just be done in three minutes on Android. (Copying pictures from iPad that was not taken as photos, etc)I was SHOCKED when I found I cannot install an IME or a system tool, cannot customize the system UI or configuration, and even cannot copy files from others' computer without logging into iTunes!

I even set up 1 of laptops for dual os usage--- Linux and windows. I really loved Linux the bests but apps are hard to find. So,after nearly 35 yrs of computer usage,I feel I can objectively rate the apple iOS on my new ipad. I heard,read,and researched info. About apple and thought I should change over after conferring with my husband (senior software engineer) who said apple now has business apps for the professional population. That said: here I am after only one week of owning an iPad and I AM CONSIDERING getting rid of it, the main complaints about windows are: 1) windows 8 2) privacy, 3) the wga genuine harassment (paid a lot of money for msn windows 7 and EVEN with re-doing I'd numbers back and forth --- I constantly got a \"not genuine\" tag that constantly pops up no matter what I did--- I had been using the same os and upgraded to professional, and after a year, for some reason,it started popping up the WGA harassment!  4) during os scans,Microsoft data,,virus,identifying, LSO ,was the #1 culprit that were \"infecting\" my computer!  With these 4 windows os  ( there are FAR more) issues , I decided to leave that os. NOW The iPad issues : 1) apple support (for HOW to use this iPad--- not repairs or apps , all of which are general) I am being forced to give the serial number which I know to be a \"record\" of my personal computer. And NO I am NOT interested in a relationship with apple EVER. Don't I have the right to know how to use this expensive piece of ----- I hadn't even turned it on because I didn't want ios7 automatically downloading on my ipad! And the rep lied and said it wouldn't  and I have full control. Over it not happening. Well, it DID auto download without my permission! Even though it isn't installed, IT Is the manipulative,greedy, way that Apple is controlling over what I want to download . Now,I can't get rid of it,and this nagging update flag is in plain sight on my computer every time I turn it on, this control reeks of dictatorship without any regards to MYRight to use my computer! 2) I didn't buy this iPad for facebook or twitter or ANY social Media at all! Instead of going to the media website and installing it BY MY choice, it is everywhere ---- my settings, shows up in website address bar as I am typing which website I wANT to go to. And if my finger slips on it or I accidentally tap those sites, I get connected or it begins to install itself! This alone disgusts me no END! 3) all software downloads have to come through the apple store---how proprietorial is that! That , too, I didn't know. What I was told was that apple apps are virtually virus free without \"bug\". So why can't I download the free open office word processor directly from the Internet? Another  dictatorial control of apple. (4) the web browser is awful! No way of setting privacy features such as third party cookies (instead there is an \"always\" , \"never\" or when I visit,to always accept all cookies. A site by site \"allowable cookie\" option is not available. And I can't even get redirects stopped when I do a first party website connection,  No add ons, and I have to remember every time I leave the site or shut down, to have all browser history deleted and cookie deletion. Safari is the ONLY web browser because all other browsers have to go through apple's  exclusive browser and it slows down Internet service. (5) email is not user friendly. It is difficult to have all email sites linked to this feature. In fact, using emails other than gmail,yahoo is almost impossible. I don,t use them at all. (6) having to constantly use a password each and every time I access they apple stop is time consuming and the iPad doesn't allow me to have it automatically saved.Well there's the review.like I said ,i am considering getting rid of my ipad. In fact, I am trying to find a reason (s) to keep it.

LOL!What wasn't really funny is the fact that I purchased the Newest, 4rth Generation IPad, the 64GBS Version, White, Standard-sized, with the Retina Display screen, and Siri onboard; and I guess, ready to \"speak\", but I won't ever know now, as I am having to return it, and fortunately for me, through a 2nd Party Buyer. Why is THAT a \"Plus\", in my favor? Because another large, corporate entity, that DOES stand behind their customers, will be behind me on the return of this Defective IPad, and literally, right out of the box! The Second Party ALSO, has deemed it \"defective\", formally, which will help.In short, I charged this brand new, IPad, for 12 hours straight, and it only went to 83% battery charge. after 14 hours of continuous chsrging, from TWO different charging stations, ( I also have an Ipod Touch, but that's for later. ) it only reached 95% charge, if NEVER reached a Full Charge, and this is on it's first one! No \"lighting bolts\" in battery, for me to see! I have since packed it up, and am awaiting the \"call-tag ALREADY marked as \"defective\" from the Secondary Partner with Apple, and then I am sending it back ASAP! whether the trouble is the battery, or something technically more involved, I am NOT going to be the one left hanging with it THIS time!Three months ago, I bought my first Apple Product ever, and it was the IPod Touch, also in White, and also the 64GBS-version. It also was my first mp3 player, but I waited more than 3 years to finally decide to get it, as I have had problems with JUST how expensive Apple Products are, but if they work well, after all, \"they\" are the industry standard for the best there is. PLUS, they DO have their own network, IOS, which was very important to me, as well, At any rate, I got the IPod Touch, and it took 3 times, AND a Senior Technician, to get me on-line with the thing, and I told him THEN, that it shouldn't have been that difficult to get it to sync with my in-home wifi. It hadn't been with my other devices, including my workhorse computer. They are supposed to be such \"user-friendly\", people, with a Customer Service Center, and assistants, that are purported to be the best in the world. That is what I have been told, what is advertised the world over, and I have had some friends who have gotten Apple Products themselves, down through the years, and they have sworn by them, mostly. I FINALLY decided to make the leap, and get the Touch. It gave me NOTHING but problems, also right out of the box, and they just started with the problems with the initial set up. There were several others, and within the first two months of owning it, it went into Repair 4 times in turnaround shipping, they had it in their possession MORE than I did! On the fifth trouble call, and me madder than a wet hornet, I FINALLY got myself a Senior Advisor there, who took stock of the several complaints ALREADY lodged, and documented, mind you, and got me a Replacement IPod Touch, and........ It worked like a charm, also right out of the box, and it still is! The thing was, you see, it wasn't defective in the First Place! It has been working just fine, since I was issued it, and thank heaven's for that Senior Tech, as I am NOT sure that Apple Care wouldn't have left me hanging in mid-air, with the original IPod Touch, and I really think that they would have. I have come around a bit since THAT experience about not only Apple's Customer Service, but also concerning Apple's Quality Control Standards! What the heck is up, with that?After that fiasco, WHY was I willing to buy the New IPad? Because it was supposed to be a \"second computer/backup\" which it technically can be, btw, businessman even use them. It also is very portable, and also supposedly, easy to work with. Of course, I won't ever know that now, as I am having to return THIS one due to defectiveness right out of the box. It certainly HAS had an effect on me, I am waiting until AFTER the first of the year, either in January, or even February, before I make another move about getting something for my computing needs, and choices. I WON'T go through THIS mess again, I can tell you that! Besides, what were the odds that the same type of thing would happen to the same person, with TWO DIFFERENT APPLE PRODUCTS? I thought astronomical, that's WHY I took the chance on the purchase of the IPad.Which only goes to show, there are \"Bad Apples's that DO Fall From the Apple Tree\", and sometimes, lightning DOES strike in the same place!
