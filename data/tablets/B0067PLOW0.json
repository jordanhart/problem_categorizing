{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop-replacement tablet", "Author": "H. Wang", "ReviewID": "RSU0PK7IRFBGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've extensively used a lot of tablets, due to both longtime interest in mobile technology, and my line of work.  To give you an idea of my frame of reference, I've either owned or used the following tablets:  Ipad 2 (owned), HP Touchpad (owned - 2011 firesale!), Motorola Xoom / Galaxy Tab 10.1, LG G, original Asus Transformer (work).  Heck, I've owned the following Windows Mobile / PocketPC devices from back in the day - HP Jornada, Toshiba e800.  My phone is the iPhone 4.With that said, this is one of the best tech gadget I've ever owned. The unanimous rave industry reviews (and very positive end user reviewers, even taking wifi issues etc. into account) aren't wrong.* BUILD AND FORM FACTOR: evocative of but actually feels higher quality than the Ipad 2 and Macbook Air, which is a minor miracle at this price point.  Beautifully machined aluminum, minimalist but not cold.  The resolution of the screen is the best out of any current tablet, and can be crazily bright enough that it is useable outdoors in sunlight.  It's definitely a fingerprint magnet though.* COLOR - for those deciding between the gray or champagne, I received the champagne, and I actually called to confirm that I received the right one. It's much more silver than gold, it's basically silver aluminum with some gold highlights when the light catches it the right way.  This is *exactly* what I wanted - it's reminiscent of the classic aluminum MacBook Pros, but with a touch of warmth from the gold.  In short - it's not very gold at all.* PROCESSOR - the Tegra 3 quad core processor is noticeably snappy, making the whole experience (even with Honeycomb) feel next gen.  I've been getting great battery life, ~ 10-12 hours of normal mixed used, on balanced setting.  With the dock, you're at 18+ hours.  The NVIDIA fifth \"stealth core\" does its job seamlessly.  It just works.  For a quad core tablet with blazing power, this is again pretty mind-bending and next-gen.  Is a quad core necessary?  Strictly speaking, no.  The Tegra 2 / OMAP / Snapdragon tablets do just fine, for the most part (although the un-overclocked Touchpad is noticeably slow), but every non ipad tablet lagged behind the iPad 2 in terms of real world performance (opening menus, browsing, launching apps).  This isn't because Apple's processor is faster, but rather because if the sheer level of optimization between Apple hardware and software, which is industry-leading. With the Tegra 3 processor, though, this is the first non Apple tablet that both objectively is, and also noticeably feels, faster, more responsive, and more powerful than the iPad 2.  It just brute forces past all of the Apple optimizations.  For me, that is huge, especially if I'm going to be spending over $400 on something. Slowly but surely, more and more apps are optimizing for quad core (especially games), but even without that, I'd get a quad core for the general performance benefits alone, as it translates across every app.* OS / SW - I really like the iOS UI for phones, it's simple yet powerful, but for a tablet it's always just felt incredibly limiting / frustrating / slightly condescending.  I even prefer WebOS to it.  Android Honeycomb is a nice balance between power, customization and being relatively easy to pick up, just perfect for the tablet form factor.  My 2 year old toddler figured out how to use it in about 20 seconds (similar to WebOS and iOS).  That being said, I'm looking forward to ICS, which should make things even more stable (HC still crashes occasionally)and uniform. The fact that the Prime gets an ICS in a month or two is fantastic. The pre-loaded Asus apps are relatively minimal and unobtrusive, and some actually are quite nice, such as the Asus cloud.  Polaris Office is solid.  The Android Market could be improved though, especially in terms of sorting and organization.  Finding the right app can be a bit of a crapshoot.CONS: Basically the same nits as others have pointed out.* SPEAKER:  the rear-facing speaker placement is a bit dumb, because it gets covered up relatively easily by your hands or when you set it down.  However, you can still hear it even if it's completely covered, it's pretty loud, and it's located where the tablet tapers inwards so it doesn't get completely covered by a flat surface when setting it down.  I don't mind the lack of a second speaker per se, as you hardly get stereo sound from any of the other tablets that have two speakers.  I would say the sound quality of the Prime is on par with any other tablet, but it is just a bit easier to muffle.  A jawbone jambox bluetooth speaker or the like works beautifully to supplement this tablet.  It's certainly not needed, but it's a nice addition.* CHARGER - the proprietary charger really annoys me.  Until Asus comes out with more accessories, I'm basically stuck with using my one charging cord.  Even charging via the dock requires the proprietary connector.  It's not worth deducting a star for (at least for me), because it's more of an annoyance in light of how great the rest of the device is, but sheesh.* PRODUCT LAUNCH - for a $21 billion company of 110,000+ employees, Asus still can't do a good product launch to save its life.  This doesn't detract from the end product per se, but it's worth mentioning because so many pre-orders (on Amazon and elsewhere) were bungled or delayed.  Asus is starting to consistently put out really great products, but in order to get to the \"next level\"(Sony, Apple etc.) in the eyes of the average consumer, they're going to really need to work on marketing and sales execution.OVERALL: this thing is pretty ingenious, especially with the accessory dock / keyboard.  Hopefully a harbinger of good things to come in the Android tablet space.<<UPDATES AS OF 1/24/2012>>These are discussed more in the comments, but I thought it would be useful to update the main review.* ICS - I updated to ICS the first day it was out (good job Asus in pushing this out two days earlier), to absolutely no problems.  It was like any other firmware update.  The system notifies you that there's an update available, you tap yes, and voila.  ~10 minutes later, ICS is installed.  It's pretty seamless - no loss of applications or data.  I haven't noticed wholesale differences, but everything is smoother, more streamlined, and sometimes faster.  It's a definite plus.  Asus has already provided multiple firmware updates (on top of ICS), which is a very good sign that this product is being actively supported.* WiFi - it's been pretty definitively proven that an all-aluminum back-plate is not the best for enhancing WiFI signals.  Asus attempted to make up for this via \"antenna differentiation,\" a fancy way for saying that there are two antennas instead of one.  In practice, mine has very good wifi reception up to about 25-30 feet from the router.  Specific numbers: wifi analyzer average value of -50 to -60, and speedtest of up to 18mbps, exactly on par with my laptop.  However, once you get really far away from the router (i.e. outside, or more than 75 feet from the router), the performance erodes at a higher rate than the comparison laptop (wifi analyzer -90).  For my purposes, this is extremely useable, and I never noticed the supposedly weak wifi until I started doing actual tests out of curiosity. A lot of people have had luck with installing repeaters and / or more powerful routers, but I haven't needed to go that route.  Asus has announced that they're making a new Transformer Prime variant, the 700T, due in a few months (supposedly).  This one will have a different, non-metallic backplate, similar to the original Transformer (i.e. plastic).  For me, I'm happy to sacrifice a slight amount of WiFi range for the distinctive spun-aluminum backplate; those who don't feel this way should perhaps wait for the 700T if they can.* Dock - my champagne dock finally shipped yesterday, about a month after the actual tablet arrived.  I can understand this somewhat if this device were sold out by the millions, but I don't think that that's the case (even though it looks like this tablet is, deservedly, a hit as far as Android tabs go).  It's just an almost mind-bogglingly bad manufacturing / supply issue with Asus.  It's like they make 10 at a time and call it a day.  Hopefully it's just the first month hiccup - it looks like there are more docks (esp. the grey) among different retailers and that's a good sign.  My original criticism stands though - Asus is insanely bad at product launches.* Accessories - I ended up purchasing this MoKo(TM) Premium Quality Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case with built-in Multi-Angle Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1-Inch Android Tablet, and the Skinomi Techskin screen protector.  The case is not as whiz-bang as some iPad cases - it's the same tired black pseudo leather, but it's cheap and it gets the job done in terms of functionality.  The skin is ok but seems to, ironically, scratch easily.  I've had better luck with Invisibleshield with past devices.* Overall - I'm pleased to report that the tablet is still working great.  After a month of use, I'd say what really sets it apart is the Tegra 3 quad core, which is an unadulterated good.  I can't imagine using a tablet without one now.  The form factor and build are great, but with the caveats noted above.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Prime - IPAD killr ?", "Author": "R. Richelson \"solar guy\"", "ReviewID": "RQ5DE78UTK60W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi guys,Figured I'd stop by since this is the hot toy for the Christmas season !I purchased the 32GB champagne color. I havent put T201 thru its paces yet butdid perform some testing.Quality =Fit and finish is 100%, Very solid feel.Size =Very thin, kinda difficult to hold in hand, I'd recommend purchasing a gel caseor something similar.Gaming =Played the pre-install games and they both ran with 0 stutters and wereextremely fluid. did i purchase a a multipurpose tablet or a gaming tablet... i think the latter :)Performance =Tablet was completely fluid when changing from one screen to the next, i especially like the multi windowtab on the bottom left, it will allow you to select anything previously opened (and will allow you to close too)Built in music player seemed basic and didnt appear to have the ability to download album art. I'll stick withamazon cloud mp3 player.Web =(subjet to further testing) web browsing seemed to be alittle slow, this was experienced with java enabled... with disabled performance was snappy and goodYouTube & amazon streaming =using the youtube app , it was a beautiful display and worked flawlessly. Amazon needs to make an app to stream their prime videos instead of going thru the web... however once a few buttons are pressed the video does fill the entire screen and works. Please note imbedded youtube in web DID NOT display any stutter or frame drops.Sound =Unfortunately this is what caused me to give 4 instead of 5 stars. The audio is quite loud and clearhowever only being emitted from a single speaker port does not provide the spartial/stereo sound. perhapsblue tooth or headset will eliminate this concern.Camera =Front facing 1.2MP camera provided acceptable image quality, however white balance should be adjusted to fully ensure quality (dont use automatic) , rear facing camera provided a good quality picture with decent focus and brightness... even in poor lighting conditions however any zoom used the image would be blurry depending upon x2 x3 etc. video mode was tested with low movement and provided a better quality then my nikon p500 (p500 seems to be abit jumpy).Battery life =Unable to report at this time since testing was limited to less then a full charge.Display =Was very colorful and bright, 600 nits of brightness will make it useable outside. normal amount of backlight bleeding (almost none but there's always some). backlight bleed test was performed and two hot spots were identified one on bottom and other on right side. As mentioned previously the amount of light imo is quite minimal and i've seen far worse on other items. one of my apps displayed a completely white page and there was two hot spots (white slightly brigter then the rest of the page) this may be a fluke or not... i was able to duplicate the brighter pixel, its barely noticeable however is visable on default screen in other colors... not a deal breaker its about the size of a pin head with a slight glow around it, clarification you wouldnt know its there unless i told you to look for it.WIFI Range =two apps were used to test the wifi range speedtest (same test server) and wifi analyzer. I've only compared the two and not a laptop.. plus my house has about 800watts of electronic interference :)12 feet away from base stationevo3d = 15.38 down 4.86 up signal str = -46 dbmprime = 20.50 down 5.00 up signal str = -43 dbmtwo walls, outside, about 85 feet awayevo3d = 02.26 down 0.89 up signal str = -88 dbmprime = 05.50 down 3.00 up signal str = -75 dbmGPS =Best reception i got was 5/9 stable 4/8.UPDATE: Reports have been surfacing GPS isnt working or isnt working properly... When I performed the test it did find 4/8 and continued to have the searching graphic. Honestly I dont know what is normal for GPS reception with this device. Will compare against phone later.Operation & bugs =With any new device there will be patches and bug fixes, I dont assume any different with the prime.while transferring pictures via usb , i was viewing the pictures and multiple times it froze and displayederror resulting in restart of picture viewer. Another item was installation of a large gamesoft game dungeonrunners 2, I had music playing in the background and every 15 seconds or so the music would stutter for a second or twoand then continue playing. I'm sure this will be addressed with ICE and the use of 4/5 cores properly.I'll update this review as time allowsIf you guys want specific info or test , please feel free to ask !01/09/12GPS has issues... perhaps big onces since Asus removed GPS from spec sheet. it appears the metal backing is a hinderance for the gps signal.Latest asus update has improved web speed w/java enabled. I prevously tested wireless and it provided a good speed outside the house. but a few rooms across in my house and the speed dropped extremely low, after update its doubled @ same location.01/19/12reduced another point due to asus removing GPS from their sales web site, Additionally Asus should offer a replacement backplate to elminate the gps and wifi issues. Please note ICS has made the web browsing experience lightning fast - im very impressed. I'm seriously concerned about the future of the prime , the handling of the signal issues , and amazon removing it from sale. I'm returning this to amazon till the smoke clears.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best. Tablet. Period.", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R2AQ47SD5529Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the 64gb Amethyst Gray model. (1/17/12) I have now had my dock for over a week, so I will update a few sections of this review with my impressions of the dock and tablet combined.First, I'd like to take a brief moment to discuss the launch of this tablet. Asus announced it to much hype and the initial reviews only compounded that hype. I preordered it on specs alone back in November. The initial reviews were all glowing with very few negatives. Then the initial units went out and there appeared to be widespread disappointment. I am happy to say that my experience closely mirrors that of the initial professional reviewers.Build QualityThis is by far the best looking tablet I've seen. I was worried about it being too purple, but I think the color is perfect. I love the aluminum body and how thin it is. It is very thin and light which makes it easy to hold an use for a long time. I really love the way it looks and feels. It's a fingerprint magnet, but I guess you'll have that when you're touching all over it constantly. Asus provides a microfiber cloth with the device that works very well at keeping it clean.Battery LifeThe battery life has exceeded my expectations. I can get 8-9 hours of constant use, browsing web pages, playing games, watching videos, all with wifi on and screen and normal brightness. When not in use, the battery hardly drains at all. There is no reason to power down even if you aren't going to use it for a couple days, you might lose like 5-8% battery during that whole time. (1/17/12) The dock does a great job extending the battery life. I can easily get 14-15 hours of use when they are together.Processor (Gaming)The Asus Transformer Prime uses the Tegra 3 processor. This makes the tablet very fast. Running games like Glowball and Shadowgun look fantastic. There is no slowdown to be seen. Switching between apps is also very quick. I've been very happy with the performance of this device, and I expect, going forward, that this quad-core processor will be able to keep up with the quickly evolving tablet landscape. It should be fairly \"future-proof\". Using HDMI-out and a wireless controller, you can play these amazing games on your big-screen tv, making this a type of videogame console. Using SNESoid, N64oid, and other emulators with the wireless controller turn this into a retro gaming powerhouse. (1/17/12) I have been able to get my PS3 controller to connect wirelessly to the Prime. Playing games on the TV is perfect with this.ScreenIt's great. The difference brightness settings make it a joy to look at no matter the lighting conditions. Videos and games look great on it. The touch response is perfect and it's very easy to operate. (1/5/12) I am able to confirm that there is slightly noticeable light bleed in the upper right part of the screen. It's very feint and can only be seen with certain black screens, and only if I'm specifically looking for it.GPSI must take a moment to discuss the GPS issues. So far, I have not been able to lock on any satellites. This does not lower my review score because I never intended to use the GPS on a Wifi only device. My cell phone with 3g/4g data and 4.5\" screen is a much better navigator. If using a 10\" screen to navigate is a priority for you, you should probably look elsewhere. This simply won't get the job done. The tablet is still easily able to tell your location using Wifi, so all location-based services function without issue.WifiThere were reports of bad wifi on the tablet. In my everyday use, it has been more than adequate. It quickly connects, and I have been able to download apps and browse webpages quickly. It's signal strength is on par with my Galaxy Nexus smartphone. My room is 2 floors below the router, and I still get full bars.CameraThe rear camera is great, but I don't expect to get much use out of it. It's difficult to take pictures using such a large device. I'm happy they included a front-facing camera though, it works great with the Skype and Google Messenger apps.SoundThe rear speaker is decent enough for notifications and a quick video, but I'd recommend using headphones in most cases. It's loud enough, but still has a small speaker sound, and I get much better audio out of my headphones. I'd say the speaker is better than other tablet speakers I've heard, but I'd still use an external speaker or headphones if you need better quality.ExpandabilityI want to touch on the expandability on this tablet versus the competition. At this time, I can only comment on the tablet itself, which has a micro-sd port. I had read complaints that the micro-sd sticks out too far, but it doesn't create a problem for me. I can still hold the tablet by it's sides without problem. It won't pop out automatically or anything. The keyboard dock will add a full-size sd card slot as well as a full-size USB port which will accept USB hubs. As tablets are primarily media consumption devices, this expandability is important to me so that I can take many high-quality movies, tv shows, and music with me on-the-go. No other tablets come close to this capacity.Android OSRunning Android versus iOS was a requirement for me. I'm a gadget lover and love the ability to customize. With Android, if you don't like the stock keyboard, you can replace it, which I did, with Swiftkey. Swiftkey allows you to use a \"split\" keyboard, so if you hold the tablet in your hands, it's very easy to type with, and makes the tablet experience much better. This level of customization is found throughout Android. The task switcher makes it easy to go from app to app. I honestly love the stock browser. If you turn on the quick controls from the advanced settings, you can switch between bookmarks, tabs, forward, back, etc with just the swipe of a finger. Pages seemed to load quickly. (1/17/12) With ICS and the keyboard dock, the Transformer Prime really starts to shine. I never thought using a mouse and keyboard would be so great and intuitive with Android. I really love it, it's like they were made for each other.ConclusionI have wanted a tablet for a while, since the iPad took off, and this was the first tablet that seemed good enough to take the plunge. I'm glad I waited because this meets my every expectation. The reason I'm giving it 5 stars despite my minor complains is because it is exactly what I expected out of a tablet. I've seen the other tablets out there, and this is by far the best one I've seen/used. (1/17/12) If you get the Prime, it is really worth it to get the dock as well. They work beautifully together, and it is awesome that you can just rip the screen off of your netbook whenever you want to watch movies on the couch. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking to take the plunge into Android tablets.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus Transformer Prime 32 GB Champagne Gold - Review Updated 01/23/12!!!", "Author": "Jason Harrell", "ReviewID": "RGYQA07TCJQY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "****Update January 23, 2012:  I thought I would post that I have decided to return my Prime TF201.  I'm on my second one actually because of a few problems.  I still think that this is a great device for those that aren't having the problems.  But for me, it just wasn't worth the hassle.I have 2 problems.  First are the physical defect on both that I received.  The first one, as I mentioned below in my initial review, was the scratch on the Gorilla Glass.  Had I put the scratch there, I wouldn't have a problem because it isn't scratch proof, rather, it is only scratch resistant.  So I went on to tablet #2 and there are no scratches on the screen this time, however, there are dents on the silver border around the screen when looking at it straight on.  One at the top and 2 at the bottom.  While this may not bother some, I'm paying good money for this and I want it as close to flawless as possible.  Also, the port for charging seems to be dented a little as well.  It still fit the charger, but it looks like someone pressed really hard on the metal around the port and bent it downward.  AGHHProblem 2:  The second problem, on both devices is that once upgraded to ICS, I have numerous lockups and reboot problems.  Too many to consider keeping it.  I feel that this isn't really the Prime's fault but more an ICS problem, and may be fixed in a future update, but I can't take it.  On the first tablet, it happens while doing any simple task, like scrolling thru a page on the default browser, or playing a simple game, or using the camera.  It is just not acceptable for me.  It locks up for about what seems to be 20 seconds, then automatically reboots itself.  Then it is good for a short while, like 15 minutes, and then it does the same thing.  I really hate making this decision but it just has to be done.  Also, for those concerned, the GPS update seemed to help mine slightly for locking onto satellites with no WIFI turned on, but was still not very strong. And the Wifi strength, after careful testing and review, was just too weak.  Dropping it a star due to both of them having physical defects.****Update January 9, 2012:  I just received my Ice Cream Sandwich update to 4.0.3 and it went smoothly,  plus there was another camera update as well right afterwards.  When the tablet boots up now, it gives the option to unlock and go to the main screen if you swipe to the right, or go straight to the camera if you swipe to the left.I was hoping for the ability to move apps to the SD card, but no such luck yet.  Mine is not rooted.  Although my bootup time went from 3 mins 30 secs down to 1 min 31 secs with ICS then even down to 1 min 20 secs the next time I booted up.  I like the long hold on the main screen for Live Wallpapers and plain photo wallpapers.For those that thought ICS may improve GPS functionality, it did not for mine.  I figured as much, but thought I'd test it out.  Wifi seems the same as before the update.  Though mine seems very good cause I'm always near the router.  (But like I said below, I'm NOT using this for GPS functionality.  If you are, and you like the Prime for the specs, wait for the new Prime TF700t.  Even though in my opinion, it doesn't look as nice and it costs more.  Or wait for the smaller 7\" tablet, unnamed as of yet, which will also run ICS and have the Tegra 3 processor.  ANd it will only be $249.00.  Or look around.  Lots to choose from.)Looks like they also included an updated version of the web browser.  I also see a Downloads App in the app section.I like the transitions from screen to screen in the app section as well.  Although, while scrolling to the Widgets section after the apps, mine just locked up and this was after 5 mins from a fresh boot.  Not sure what that was about.  I couldn't do anything but the tablet rebooted on its own.  I'm sure there will be updates to come to clear any glitches.****Update January 3, 2012:  for those concerned about the locked bootloader, Asus made an announcement they they will provide an unlock key to allow root access at the risk of the user voiding the warranty.  Here is hoping that Asus holds true to their promise, but they usually do.  GPS is another issue for those concerned about it.  I put my star rating back to 5 because Asus has been very good with updates and listening to the buyers.  I just wish there was a way to get a plastic backing to replace the aluminum one for those that need GPS fixed to their wishes.  I hope you all are enjoying your Prime as much as I am.  And those of you waiting for yours to arrive, I'm  sure you will enjoy it, just be aware of the issues before getting it.  Or cancel your order and wait for a better option.  Don't  forget CES 2012 is right around the corner Jan 10-13.  Maybe there will be something more suited to your needs.****Update January 1, 2012:  I added a few photos to the image gallery here on Amazon that I took with the rear camera.  Keep in mind that the photo upload here does not allow the full sized image.  They seem to be compressed and shrunk down in size so you can't see it in full detail, but you get the idea, i hope.  Also, i noticed on Google Earth, everything freezes up after using it for a few minutes.  Then the tablet reboots itself.  This also happened on my original transformer as well.  Did anyone else notice this?  Even with these glitches that I mention, i am very happy with this tablet.  Just want to point out things that i notice when i play around with it.  I suspect that many things will run smoother when ICS comes along, or with future updates by Asus.  I know i mentioned it before but i have to stress how easy it is to clean the screen when the fingerprints get bad.  People seem to point out how easy it is to get fingerprints on it but nobody seems to say how easy they wipe off.  Lastly, i have been reading a lot of negative feedback about the gps.  I did say in my review how mine is slightly off and that for me this is not an issue since i really won't be using this function.  So if you are worried about very accurate gps, you may want to try the prime out at bestbuy or somewhere first.  I have a dedicated gps and cell phone that does gps for me.  I tested my Prime with the 'gps test' app and I lock onto 6 to 10 satellites within 20 seconds indoors but the strength rarely goes above 25 per satellite, (should be over 40). A lot of reviews on the old original transformer complained about the plastic backing, and Asus switches to aluminum and people complain because it blocks wifi and gps.  Watch what you wish for.  I'm still a very satisfied customer overall.****Update December 30, 2011:  Another update to my review.  I have noticed when recording a movie in HD, the auto focus is nice to have, but when it changes focus, upon playback you can hear clicking while it changes focus.  Nothing major but worth noting.  Also, when recording in lower light the movie can go out of focus.  I had to move the camera down to the floor then backto the subject for it to refocus.  Annoying, but tolerable.  Anyone else notice this?  I still love the tablet tho.****Update December 23, 2011:  I wanted to add an additional comment.  Please inspect your screen carefully.  When I got the tablet, I had noticed a small scratch on the Gorilla Glass screen in the upper right side.  I contemplated not doing anything about it, but finally decided that I paid good money for this and deserve a defective-free quality product.  I used Amazon's Help link and chatted online with someone who helped me resolve this rather quickly.  I will do a replacement of my tablet, and since it will be within the return timeframe, it will be at no cost to me.  My concern about this was that it is in high demand and I may not get the new one for quite a while.  I would rather wait a little longer and get a tablet that has no noticeable defect like this.  Some people may not have noticed it because it is a very fine scratch, but it is about 3/4 of an inch long.  I tried wiping it with the provided cloth, thinking it was something on the glass, but sure enough, it is a scratch.  I am currently dropping my star rating to 4 stars because of the promotion of the Gorilla Glass as being scratch resistant.  Here is a quote right from Gorilla Glass' website, \"Gorilla Glass features exceptional damage resistance to the scratches, drops, and bumps of everyday use.\"  I am one who takes extra special care of my electronics, and there was nothing that came into contact with the screen except my finger and the provided cloth.  Plus I noticed the scratch as soon as I opened it, but got more worried about it as the days went on.  I really hate to return it, but I can't see living with this, knowing that the screen may scratch even more later.  Maybe someone in the factory did something that caused it to scratch?  I have no idea, but I will be returning it for a new Tablet of the same model and color.  I thought it would be fair to mention this to other people considering buying it.  I really don't see this as an Asus issue as much as a Gorilla Glass (Corning) issue, but I like to be as fair as possible.  I will update again once I get my new replacement item.  Hopefully there will be no other worse defects.Also, for those that want to know, I ran the free AnTuTu Benchmark v2.5 and here are my results while using Honeycomb OS.RAM: 2109, CPU integer: 3662,  CPU float-point: 2794, 2D Graphics: 283, 3D Graphics: 1190, Database IO: 400, SD Card Write: (8.3 MB/s) 83, SD Card Read: (20.2 MB/s) 189, CPU Frequency: 1400 MHz, Total Score: 10710.  I did not test battery life, but it lasts a good while without having to recharge with everyday usage.Now back to my original review:OK, so I will start by saying that my Amazon order was not canceled, and I received my tablet on Tuesday December 20th.  So there was no problem for me as far as my order goes.  However, my docking keyboard still has yet to arrive.  Amazon says it should arrive around January 6th.Please note that I had the original Transformer, but I sold it to a friend and bought this one. So I will do my best to compare, but it has only been several hours that I got to play around with the new one so far.Am I glad I updated to this one, yes.  Are there major noticeable differences?  Some, but not drastic.  Obviously some new Tegra games cannot be played on the original Transformer, so there are the obvious hardware updates to this Prime model.The new operating system, due later, may make this tablet act completely different.  So I will update once that comes out also.Pros:* Tegra 3 chip makes for more powerful gaming with games that are designed for it, as well as overall performance improvements.* The enhancements on Honeycomb OS are subtle, but nice.  Hopefully ICS will be a HUGE improvement.* The screen has that special coating that they talked about, and although it does fingerprint up like crazy as with any touch screen tablet, it is SO much easier to clean off the prints.  Wow, it is nice.* The rear camera is a huge improvement over the previous model.  Perfect? no, but incredibly improved? yes. The auto focus is nice, although sometimes jittery when making a movie.  But overall it is great.* The rear camera has an LED flash now, which is very nice to have.* I like the gold color a lot more than I thought I would.  It is very subtle.* For only having one speaker this time around, I was impressed by the sound for both music and games and general sound bites.* They included a longer charging cable than the original 3 footer.  Looks to be about 5 foot this time around.  Thanks for that Asus.  The extra 2 feet seriously helps.* The overall-design looks and feels better than the original.* When I opened it, and booted up, I had 2 Asus updates ready for me.* Wifi speeds seemed the same as the previous model.  I didn't test it, just from using it and judging by memory.* The screen looks much improved from the original, even though it is the same resolution, the brightness helps and the colors look better.* Movies look amazing on this screen.* Adobe Flash sites work on this tablet.* Not sure why we need it, but there are 2 microphones this time around.* Asus implemented a new file manager which is really nice and easy to navigate.* Headphones connected sound amazing, and are in stereo. (I read others questioning if headphones would sound good or not)* HDMI port is not the same as the original Transformer.  This is Micro HDMI and the original was Mini HDMI.  But it looks great on my HD TV.Cons:* The Gorilla Glass, which is supposed to be scratch resistant, came with a scratch on it.  See my update above for details.* As far as design, the biggest complaint I have is that the power button is hard to press because it doesn't stick out far enough.  You have to try to press it to truly understand.  Took my a while the first few tries.* If you use it, the MicroSD card sticks out more than it did in the original.  Probably due to the Prime's curved edges.  Not a major flaw, but noticeable if you had the original Prime.* As per usual, the more apps you install, the longer the start-up boot time.  Not Asus' fault, but this is with any Android Tablet.  I have quite a few apps installed (I installed 107 apps myself), and while it still shuts down very quickly, it went from taking 30 seconds to boot, all the way up to 4 minutes and 10 seconds now.  That is a LONG boot up.  Like I said, before I installed my apps, it was only 30 seconds.  Anyone else experience this?* There have been a few glitches in some apps that I've used.  I will try to take note as to which ones and update on here.* Some movies that I had were not able to be played on the default player.  I downloaded MoboPlayer and the codecs and no problems now.* There is only one speaker.  Granted, it is great sound, but still only one speaker?  What were they thinking?  I guess it was a design limitation?  I have no idea here.  But it least it is loud and great quality for one speaker.Let me tell you that this one, compared to the original model, does not feel that different as far as noticing performance improvements. As I stated before, this may (or may not) change when we get the new ICS operating system later.  I don't want to sound biased and say that it will be amazing with ICS, but logically it makes sense that it will run smoother and faster overall, with the exception of older apps that aren't designed around the quad core, etc.So don't expect to see an astonishingly noticeable difference if you played with the original Transformer.I plan to upload some videos to youtube soon that show the use of the front and rear camera as well as some still photos.If I notice anything else, positive or negative about the Prime, I will post as soon as I get the chance.My overall review:  This was worth the extra money in my opinion.  I like to keep my gadgets up to date, and I loved the specs on this tablet.  If you have the extra money, I say go for it, or at least wait until ICS operating system comes out to hear if it really makes a big impact on performance, or to see if it is all hype.  It was a major bummer about the scratch on the front, but I am very particular about things like that when you pay over $100 for an item.  I hope that everyone gets theirs soon also, just don't forget to inspect your glass.  You only get a short time to return the item, so test it out.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prime is (finally) charging; Time for a review!", "Author": "Tracey Zillian \"Always reading\"", "ReviewID": "R3EXTC6X467AFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is going to be mostly about my experiences and the little things I've noticed from the Prime for the 2 days thus far that I've owned it. You all already know the specs (and they're pretty much entirely true). My Prime is an Amethyst Gray 32GB.INTRO:Let me start off with this: There are bugs. HOWEVER, keep in mind that this is a new tablet quite literally fresh off the press. For what it's worth, these bugs are pretty minor-- If you've ever owned an iPhone you're probably familiar with apps crashing for no good reason (unless I'm just very unlucky). Regardless, apps will occasionally crash on your Prime. There are, in my experience, two types of crashing: The rare crash that you just have to re-open the application and you're good to go, and the consistent crashing of a particular app when you start it. There are a fair number of the latter depending on the app (Tap Tap Revenge 4 being the main culprit for me-- I have yet to see the main screen) but most apps work perfectly fine. Myself, I've been playing World of Magic for about 5 hours straight now. Anyway.ONSCREEN KEYBOARD:The first thing I'd like to address is the onscreen keyboard. I don't have the keyboard dock yet (and I would really like to have it now, to be honest). I am an extremely fast (and accurate) typist, so slowing down is not something I'm used to. On my iPhone, I can type as fast as I care to with very few mistakes. This is not the case with the Prime. I have to type noticeably slower and with more care for the words to not mash themselves together in unintelligible fragments. Personally this irritates me, but I know that I type considerably faster than most people, so this is probably just a personal problem. I'm not going to downgrade this to 4 stars for that reason.SPEAKER:Oh my gosh, the speaker. You've probably heard about how there's only one- This is true. One or two speakers makes zero difference in this instance. This speaker is the best quality speaker I've ever heard. Better than my netbook, my iPhone, my laptop, all of them. While most speakers begin to get rather crackly as you crank up the volume, even at higher settings there is little to no 'extra noise' from this one. I've listened to music that was on Youtube with this speaker and it's absolutely stunning. If you need a tablet with a good speaker for whatever reason I highly recommend this one. You can definitely tell, if you're paying attention, that music is only coming out one side. But the quality makes that irrelevant. Onwards!SCREEN:The screen is beautiful. I've watched HD videos on it with extreme clarity and played games with beautiful graphics: All stunning. The screen is also quite responsive and you can switch through windows with ease. The brightness level is also very impressive. Even at almost 0 brightness, you can see things fairly easily. I generally keep the brightness on about 25%. In fact, anything too far above maybe 70% can be too bright if you are on a page with a lot of lighter colors. I haven't tested the screen outside yet but I don't think IPS+ is even going to be necessary for me. The screen is Gorilla glass if I recall correctly but I'm not going to test the strength of it. Not much else to add, unless anyone wants to ask a more specific question?BATTERY:The battery is also impressive. After 12 hours of letting it sit in its case and at least 10 hours of playing with it (at about 25% brightness, power saver mode) it was only at 63% battery life. I had to set the brightness to as high as I could bear and turn it on the highest power consumption setting, and play an MMO for a few hours before it finally got to 15% and it told me I might want to think about charging it soon. (I obliged, which is why I'm writing this review.) I've been charging it for I think a little less than an hour now and it's gone from 14% to 37%. 23% in an hour? For a machine like this, I think that's pretty impressive.INTERNET BROWSER:Good stuff, good stuff. It moves nice and quickly to the next page once you click something, and there are tabs. I'll add more once I've selectively used the browser more. Too busy playing with all my new apps! And on that note...APP STORE:It's not THE App Store. You should be aware of that. However it has all the big-name games from the Apple App Store, and sometimes, the same ones you have to pay for on the iTunes store are free on the Android market. There are sections for Free apps, Paid apps, and you can select your preferred type of app, just like in the iTunes market. The selection isn't as poor as people claim, in fact, there are a whole lot of apps already there, and it's only going to get bigger.FLASH:It has Flash! Built right in! I can access web pages now that I never could with an iDevice. Personally, that's a pretty considerable selling point.CAMERA:Now for the other type of flash. The Prime has two cameras, one rear-facing and one that looks right at you. The rear-facing one has flash capabilities; The front one doesn't. I don't know why you'd need to use the front-facing one save for Skyping and such anyway, so the flash isn't a big deal. The front camera doesn't have the same impressive quality as the back one, as well. The back camera, however, surprised me. A lot. After a few shots with it I quickly discovered that the camera on this tablet is of a higher quality than my actual camera, the likes of which is solely devoted to taking pictures. Indeed, the Prime's camera surpasses a device made for taking pictures. The quality really stands out, it's crisp and clean and if you're a good cameraman anyway that will only help with making it truly shine.The camera software itself has a lot of little settings that I haven't had the chance to play around with yet, but there is a button readily available that lets you switch from back to front cameras just by clicking it. The Prime's camera also takes video- Very nice quality video. Of course, taking pictures or video with a 10-inch tablet is a bit cumbersome and looks rather silly, but the quality that it provides makes it worth it.INCLUDED APPS:The Prime comes with a page (and then a few more) of pre-installed apps. They're pretty standard but they also have apps like the Kindle store already included, which I thought was nice. If you already have a Kindle account, you can log in on that app and all your books will be there for you to read. On that note, readability is nice, and you can resize the font to big or normal-sized.There was also an app called Polaris Office, which upon opening I discovered that it had access to every single file on my Prime, much like how you can look at your folders and files on the computer. On the top right, there is a 'Create New' option, which reveals nothing short of the ability to create Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, and Excel spreadsheets. Anyone who needs these things for work will appreciate that this comes built in. Any other applications you want to ask about, please go ahead.BOTTOM-OF-SCREEN-MENU-BUTTON:Because I'm not sure what else to call it. This little button allows you to, once you click it, see your battery life, power settings, Bluetooth options, screen-tilt options, another button to lead you to the main Settings window, and a personal favorite, a notifications section. This will tell you of any new events that happened on your tablet (or if you have Facebook, if someone has replied to a comment, etc) such as the completion of a new app download. On the bottom of your screen is also a thin black bar that shows when each separate download is occurring, and you can click the little download icons to see the status of each download. These disappear once your download is finished and go to the 'event' section of your menu. Downloads usually happen in a matter of seconds, but can take a few minutes if you're downloading a particularly large application or update. All in all very convenient.MULTITASKING SIDEBAR:This little sidebar starts off as a button, but when you press it, it reveals a sidebar with every window and application you have open on your tablet. You can click the icon of any of them to instantly switch to that application, or you can click the X on the side of them to close the application completely. I've yet to have any problems with the Prime slowing down from too many applications, but I usually try to X them out in groups when I remember that I haven't done so yet.SIZE/WEIGHT:This thing is LIGHT. It's a 10-inch tablet, but it's probably a third lighter than the Kindle Fire, an 8-incher.(or is it 7? Regardless.) In an effort to find a fairly standard item to compare it with, I would have to say as follows: It's lighter than what I consider a standard-sized hardcover novel, (In this case The Da Vinci Code, about 454 pages and bound rather nicely) not by much but still a noticeable difference. Coupled with the Kindle app you could read a thick hardcover novel for cheaper than the hardcover's asking price and it'll weigh less, too.Comparing it with my trusty copy of The Da Vinci Code again, it's about a half-inch longer than a 'standard' hardcover novel on each side. It appears to be about a pencil-width thick if not a bit less, however it slopes in at the edges so I can't quite tell. In short, this tablet is both impressively thin and incredibly light.ALL IN ALL:For all of you still waiting for your Prime to arrive from Amazon, Bestbuy (where mine actually eventually came from, I admit), Gamestop, or wherever else this was available for pre-ordering, I assure you, this is very worth it. It has its bugs at the moment but I've already received updates that download very quickly. (As a note, downloads do for the most part happen very quickly!) I'm very impressed with this tablet, and hope that you are too. If you haven't preordered this yet I highly recommend you do; You won't regret it.If there's anything here I haven't addressed yet, please feel free to ask about it. I'll answer as best I can. I'll also be editing this with new information as I find it.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best tablet available at this time. Period!", "Author": "L. A. Dye \"700hpAMG\"", "ReviewID": "R551KD03GM496", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pre-ordered this late last year while owning the original Transformer with dock. Have now had this long enough to go through all of the paces including the dock (of which I went through 3 to find a perfect one).Originally I was going to purchase an iPad2 like so many others that cannot get past the Starbucks fascination of owning an Apple product. My primary concern with Apple products including my iPhone was the lack of real memory with Apple limiting any expansion in their products-though great otherwise. As I recently converted both of my phones over to Android phones, that pretty much clinched the purchase as purchasing and juggling two platforms made little sense. I did go at it slow originally as I wanted to ensure that the tools (apps) I require were both available and worked well on the Android system vs Apple. Now only were they available, even better options were to be found which was a pleasant surprise as a lot of junk apps are also on the Android Market.Now to the tablet:Breaking this down into simple terms:Pros:.Very fast. With quad core and an extra chip to handle video, this tablet is speed with ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). With exception to browsing (Dolphin HD) which is just OK. Try out Opera..Battery life:  An honest 9 hrs+ with just tablet and over 17 hrs with the dock. Even while watching movies the battery drains very slowly. Very impressive. Also, the dock charges the tablet when connected..Styling. Extremely nice and modern style. All aluminum (which is also it's greatest sin). This tablet is hot looking. I have tghe champagne version which is more like a light metallic bronze..Expandability: Micro HDMI, USB (dock), miniSD. I have a 128gb microSD card for a total of 192gb in the tablet alone and a 64gb in the dock for a total of 256gb. I have a large amount of HD movies, games, photos, apps, etc. All play very well from the cards with no hiccups of any sort. Native USB mouse support and native PS3 controller support via USB. Just plug and go, no ROM needed. Also, the mentioned dock is an exceptional accessory. It adds battery life, USB, looks great, fits well , and really does complete the package..Video playback. Another win over iPhone is the ability to play a wide array of movie formats which Apple can be stubborn about. Playback is very smooth, bright, and you can easily scroll forward or back with no delay or crashes. Very impressive..Graphics:  Superb, the best available on a tablet at the moment. Just youtube comparisons of Shadowgun and Riptide vs. the iPad2 and you will see the dramatic improvements over the iPad and original Transformer..WIFI:  LOL.  Many complain about the WIFI as the aluminum backing does inhibit the signal. However my particular model has great WIFI and downloads faster than any tablet prior. No issues at all here. Additionally, I Hotspot off of my 4G Android phones, again no issues. No fee either through my carrier..Screen: Large 10.1\" screen with Gorilla Glass and highest tablet resolution at the moment. Very strong, very bright IPS, even outdoors. Movies and games look great along with spreadsheets.CONS.Lack of accessories such as cases with the tablet/dock (current versions are designed incorrectly resulting in too thick of material between dock and tablet hinge.) Ton of stuff available for iPads and the original Transformer (those will not fit the Prime).GPS. Yep, I do not use it on a tablet, but it is advertised (before), and the signal is blocked by that gorgeous aluminum backing. Simply does not work on mine. EDIT: Recent firmwares have improved this and it does now lock onto over 12 satellites though still not great for driving.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recent airplane trip. Edited a few spreadsheets, tired of that, decided to watch a full length HD movie, then connect my PS3 controller and played Shadowgun. The guy sitting next to me and another across from the aisle were blown away with this tablet sparking plenty of conversation. It is an impressive piece which has a tendency to draw people into your business. Expect it unless your doing something boring. Using it in the AM, then at the terminal, on the flight, I still had over 80% of total battery left. I did not even bother taking out my laptop.Overall with dock and memory cards (2) it was a bit expensive, however at the end of the day, well worth it IMO..", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet Ever!!!", "Author": "Bucko678", "ReviewID": "R221DJ1IL4T08C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally received my prime two days ago.  I must admit that I was concerned about the build quality after reading many accounts of issues that were experienced by those that received the first batch.  If you're still waiting on your preorder, consider yourself lucky, as I've encountered no issues thus far.  My build is 8.8.3.27.Rather than go over the specs, yet again, I will focus instead on the elements that have received all of the bad press.Wifi:  I don't doubt that wifi issues delayed the release of the prime.  As such, the first thing I did was connect to my home network and install speedtest.  I was shocked to see the meter register a blistering and consistent 7mb/s, greatly exceeding the 5mb/s that my htc evo 4g registers.  I've read that ASUS added another wifi antenna to resolve the connectivity issues. I can't confirm this to be true, but I can confirm that I have no wifi issues.GPS:  I've read that some people were unable to get a gps lock. While I don't anticipate using this functionality for navigation, I still wanted to confirm that my unit did not have this defect.  To test the gps, I downloaded gps status from the market.  I turned off my network connection, and stood in my back yard with the prime level to the ground.  I locked on 8 satelites in less than two minutes.Light bleed:  I read numerous complaints about light bleed resulting from mis-alignment of the glass.  To test my unit I downloaded backlight bleed test from the market.  Although there was a negligible amount of bleed on the bottom right corner, in normal use I did not notice any bleed at all.Browser lag and force closes:  Yes, it's true.  The stock browser has some lag, and a few apps force closed.  This is true of any honeycomb tablet.  Thankfully, ice scream sandwich will be rolled out in January.  ICS will optimize the hardware of the prime, and every indication is that the lag will be gone.  Note that I'm running ICS on my Evo, and it runs like butter.Overall, the prime has thus far exceeded all of my expectations.  My only complaint is that I have yet to receive my keyboard dock...Updated 1/2/2012:I awoke this morning to some disappointing news.  Apparently ASUS chose to deliberately lock and encrypt the bootloader, thus restricting ones ability to load customizations.  For most potential owners, this is not a big deal.  For myself and many others, it is a potential deal breaker.  I choose android over ios primarily because I appreciate my freedom.  Android allows me to completely control my user experience.  I was an eary adopter of the evo 4g phone. Since I purchased that phone, many others with improved bells and whistles have come onto the market.  Having an unlocked bootloader gives me the ability to constantly make my phone feel new.  As I mention below, I'm currently running an alpha version of ice cream sandwich on my phone, despite the fact that my phone is not on the upgrade list.  This is because Google chose to make andoid an open platform.  Open is the philosophy that differentiates android from apple.  For a manufactorer to create a device designed for android enthusiasts, but not subscribe to the open philosophy of android is extremely unfortunate.  Unless ASUS changes coarse on this point, they will stifle the potential of this otherwise exceptional device.Since I relize that the above will not impact most potential buyers, I'm deducting only one star.  If this was a review posted to an enthusiast site, the device would earn only 3 stars.1/3/2012:ASUS agreed to unlock the bootloader if the device owner agrees to opt-out of the warranty.  For myself, this is awesome news.  Now I will be able to install android versions that ASUS does not support on the device (Jelly Bean?).  I am still extremely happy with the unit.  I will not unlock the bootloader for the forseeable future.  Once I am satisfied that my unit has no hardware defects, I will opt out of the warranty and bring back the newness.I applaud ASUS for reacting to their customer's needs and have restored my original 5-star rating.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet I've Used", "Author": "Ian Mcmanis", "ReviewID": "R1KYD98F8GOMU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After waiting nearly a full month to get my hands on one of these elusive tablets, I managed to get lucky enough to find one at a local store. At this point, you've probably read reviews from tech experts and critics that do this for a living, so I'll spare the technical details and go for usability from the perspective of a moderately technologically savvy aficionado.As a previous owner of an iPad 2, I returned mine because of the strict usage requirements forced by Apple and the iOS, I can say the Asus Transformer Prime feels nearly the same in my hands as does an iPad 2. The curved edges and cool metal back feel sturdy and comfortable in my hands. When holding the device in landscape mode, it is noticeably wider than the iPad 2, making it difficult to hit the middle keys with my thumbs. I have yet to acquire the keyboard dock, but until then switching to portrait mode works fine when typing in long segments. The screen gets finger smudges just as noticeably as iPad 2, but the gorilla glass makes removing as easy as using the palm of your hand.There's been some concern over the one speaker located directly where my right hand rests while holding the tablet in landscape mode. To me, this is an extremely nitpicky con since the speaker is louder than iPad or any tablet I've experienced to date even when I am trying to cover it with my hand. Still, there is a 8 mm headphone jack if you're trying to get the full quality experience.The front facing camera (1.2 megapixel) is located just a little right of center when holding the device in landscape mode, which is a bit awkward considering I'm used to the portrait video chat of FaceTime on the iPad 2. It's about par quality with any front-facing camera I've come into contact with, and not really useful for anything else. The rear facing camera is excellent. I have two android phones, one with 8 megapixel and xenon flash and the other 5 megapixel with no flash, and this camera (8 megapixel) beats both of them with superior autofocus and a bright flash for night-time pictures. It's no Canon Rebel by any means, but perfect for photo-journaling and all casual picture needs.Along with the tablet, you'll find a nice, long (4 ft.) USB cable and a AC power adapter. It's important to note that this device does not charge via micro USB so you'll have to keep track of this new charger for all of your devices. Also, if you plan to do any HDMI streaming to an HDTV or monitor, you'll need to purchase a Micro HDMI to HMDI cord separately.I was able to download Android 4.0 ICS right out of the box, and it does look beautiful on the super IPS display. I'm assuming you've read all you need to know about how nice the screen swipes with ICS, and the browser is so much nicer, etc. One thing they don't talk about is using the device through an HDTV using the micro HDMI output. This has been my favorite thing about the Prime so far. The picture on my 55\" Samsung HDTV is pristine. Streaming video through Youtube or Netflix is perfect quality. Games such as Shadowgun, Galaxy on Fire 2, and Blood and Glory could easily be mistaken for Xbox 360. I am incredibly exited to see what developers will do to exercise the Nvidia Tegra 3 chip in the coming months.Putting the fact that my WiFi and GPS work perfectly behind, the most concern for this tablet is caused by the Android Appstore and the lack of tablet optimized apps. While this is currently true, every app that I used on a daily basis on my iPad 2 I have found an equal or better substitute on my Prime. All I needed to do was Google \"Best Android Tablet Apps\" and there were 10 lists available with useful free and paid apps that are made for a larger screen. Also, with the release of ICS, I expect developers are hard at work creating a slew of new apps that will bolster the number of available tablet optimized applications.One last huge pro about the Android OS is the freedom to use it for whatever purpose you see fit. If you want to have one home screen dedicated to weather and clock widgets from around the globe, you can. If you want to download music or video directly to the tablet's internal memory, or expandable SD card, you can do that as well. Google offers the exact same services that iTunes and the Apple Appstore does, but also allows you to choose other options. I can wirelessly transfer files and media from my android phone to my Prime to my 5 year old Macbook or a friend's PC and back. This freedom is the main reason I returned my iPad and opted for an Android tablet.Make no mistake, the iPad 2 is a beautifully simple device that does exactly what consumers want it to do. It's just as fast, the display is just as crisp, and it has more Apps than you will ever be able to use. Having to explore multiple places to discover all of the settings and preferences and options you can tweak on the Prime is daunting if you're not used to it. But in my opinion, the Asus Transformer Prime is not only the best Android Tablet, but the best tablet on the market to date. I look forward to seeing developers make games and Apps that make it shine like it is supposed to.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow .. Not Ready for Prime Time", "Author": "P. Rudy", "ReviewID": "R1BXQDBCAFO9KW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have just sent back my third Prime.  I am done.I really wanted to love it.  It started last November.  Preordered, then got cancelled, then reordered, then delayed, then the problems  wifi/gps, etc. starting happening. I donot care about GPS, but wifi is critical.  I am not a gamer. I don't spend my life on Facebook or Twitter.  I am professional and I really wanted to use the Prime in my business and personal reading.My first Prime had horrible wifi -- even when I upgraded to a expensive Asus AP route.  Second one was a bit better -- but lots forced closings and it seems like updates almost daily. And if i pressed the top of the tablet hard, the wifi improved. Boy, that made me feel happy. So, now on my third Prime, with decent wifi -- still 25% worse than a OG Transformer and still fluctuates all the way down to 3mps.  On Speedtest, I get 20mps on an OG and usually 12 to 15 mps on the Prime, but sometime 3.  But, it basically worked, after two and half months of screwing around with returns, updates, hacks, fixes, reading up every night on the blogs to get tips on making the Prime perform smoothly.On Friday walked by the Apple store.  Walked in and found out I could get a Ipad 3 for two weeks and return it if I didn't like it.  What the hell, thought I would check out the competition.  Never owned an Apple product (oh, have an Ipod but dont use it now that I have an android phone.)After all the heartache ordering, reordering, calling Asus support(boy, that is waste of time), I found the experience in the Apple store was so, so, normal. I walked in, spoke with a person an intelligent person that explained the unit, demonstrated it, did the order and then introduced me to the supervisor for business users.  He then explained the free seminars for business use, took my email and set me up for the next seminar.After two hours using the Ipad 3, I packaged up the Prime to return.  The Ipad3 just works.  No issues, no rebooting, no updates upon opening, I am getting 21mps wifi.  The screen really is amazing.  And tons of apps that work. Tons of apps made for a tablet.I really do not want to become a hacker to keep the Prime working.  With all the issues, I simply do not trust the Asus and the Prime to function.  I now read of all the issues with the year old OG Transformers, with dieing power buttons and the ICS update that bricked many units.Back with all ordering problems for the Prime, I gave Asus a break -- hey, the unit is popular.  I was perturbed with the reviewers here on Amazon that gave bad marks because of the botched up ordered process.  I thought that unfair, but not now.  The roll out of the Prime was an abomination for a consumer device from a major manufacturing company -- and it still goes on.The aluminum case of the Prime, in my opinion, is either a design flaw or faulty in-house testing standards / lack of real world testing.  Asus, to its credit, has done LOTS of work fixing the issue to get the wifi decent.  But, I really do not a product that was miss-designed and the manufacturer came up with a patch after patch after patch to get the wifi to be \"decent.\"  Asus makes such great computer components: motherboards, video cards.  But those are commodities, not consumer products.  Judging by what I have read about issues with Asus laptops, I have come to the conclusion that the billion dollar computer parts manufacturing Asus really does not know how to design, manufacturer, roll-out and support consumer products.Yes, I know the TF700T is coming, eventually.  And Asus tacitly admitted the wifi gps issues by designing a new back.  But when the TF700t comes out is anyone's guess.  After the backlogs with OG Transformer, then the abysmal roll-out of the Prime, I for one do not have any faith in how and when Asus will handle the 700t.  AND, to be honest, I was pissed that Asus announced the 700T when I was still struggling to get a Prime, and then get it working.No, I did not drink the Apple Cool-aid. I am not in love with Apple, but I really like the Ipad3. It works, it looks good and I really could care less if anyone thinks I am cool for having one. In fact, I purposely stayed away from Apple because I did not want to be associated with the cool-aid drinking converts, zealots.  I do not like iPhones and think that my HTC EVO 4G is far superior.  Android does phones well.  While ICS is nice, it still has a way to go to be a smooth operating system on tablets. Philosophically, I love the idea of the open ecosystem of Android.  But, at this point, I would rather have the closed Apple system that works.Sorry to write so much, but I have spent hours reading the Amazon reviews since December on the Prime, looking for suggestions and guidance and solace.  No more.  I have invested so much time, energy and money on the Prime, that I needed to vent.  Good luck to those with the Prime and use it in good health.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautifully built tablet, but...", "Author": "Rance", "ReviewID": "R1YHCJNHQOIBOU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Asus has designed a gorgeous tablet, with great features and aesthetics, but it isn't lacking in the fail department either. I'll get into the flaws later.First off, I loved the Transformer TF101. For my first tablet, I was absolutely amazed by the features Asus packed into it, along with top notch functionality. I used the original Transformer for everything, but in the end it just felt overweight and clunky. Man was that an awkward, and heavy tablet to hold for long periods! In steps the Prime, making its debut with the announcement from Asus only a month after I bought my TF101. My head got filled with ideas of something just as functional as my TF101, only newer, shinier, thinner, and most importantly LIGHTER! I sold my Transformer, and ordered the 32GB Prime the minute Amazon posted it... Then, I waited... and waited... and...Once I had the Transformer Prime in my hands, I immediately noticed how closely it resembled my neighbor's iPad2 in terms of weight/feel. Fantastic! The display is absolutely amazing, and the Tegra 3 processor is a beast! Gaming is awesome on the Prime, as I expected, but what about the Prime's usefulness in other areas that I used my TF101 for daily?Right off the bat, I noticed that the WiFi signal in my home was very weak, even 20 feet away from my router. I average about 2 bars of signal strength throughout my home if I'm lucky (with the original Transformer, I had full signal throughout). I brushed that off thinking that software might be to blame, so on to the next test. GPS.With my original TF, the GPS worked like a clock. With the Prime, it takes 10 minutes, at least, to get a lock on 3 or 4 satellites, only to find out that the Prime thinks I'm 200ft away from where I'm actually standing. The accuracy is HORRIBLE, and POOF! 3 seconds later, the Prime is searching for satellites again for another 5-10 minutes! A little searching around online, and I found out that there are a whole lot of people having the exact same issues I am, which brings me back to design.The metal backing on the Prime seems to have a negative effect on the WiFi signal, and the GPS reception, making both signals spotty and unreliable. I'm no longer convinced, after testing dozens of different apps for both WiFi and GPS, that this is a software issue. This is definitely an issue with faulty hardware, or a serious design flaw. Right now, I'm kicking myself for getting rid of my original TF and hopping on the \"new and shiny\" bandwagon like an Apple fanboy.I'm going to contact Amazon for a replacement to see if I might have received a defective unit (hopefully), but at this time, I can only give the Prime 2 stars. 1 star for the look/feel of the tablet, and another for the excellent display. I will update this review once my replacement arrives (hopefully sometime this quarter).Update: Since Asus has decided to come forward and admit that there is a major design flaw in the Prime, and removed GPS from their list of features, I've decided to ask Amazon for a refund instead of waiting for a replacement. For my money, I am pretty sure I can do much better with all the new tech coming out soon.

However, people giving it 1 and 2 stars are not really being fair.  Now, should we all give Asus 1 and 2 stars...YES... but this tablet is not a 1 or 2 star tablet.I pre-ordered from Amazon, but it was taking to long to get here, so I canceled and ordered through BB, and got it about 12 days later.  It is a very good tablet for the price when you compare it to it's contemporaries (e.g. the Ipads, Xooms, G-Tabs, Xyboards, etc of the tablet world).  The other tablets will run you up to several hundred dollars more, and often will not give you a better experience for the extra cash you fork out for them.  You can go cheaper and get a Nook (rooted and droided) or Kindle Fire, but again, you will not get the shear horsepower of this tablet. Also, I own the OG Transformer, and it was the best Android tablet for the money until the Transformer Prime hit the street, so the Asus-Android combo has been, and continues to be, a great value.Does this beat the Ipad 2?  In many area's yes, in some, no.  Will it be able to go toe-to-toe with the Ipad 3?  Probably so, but will more than likely lack the polish and overall ease of operation that people love about Apple products; however you will pay handsomely for it $$!!  Will other Android tablets be released in the near future that will best the Prime?  Again, probably so, but get ready to pay $100-300 more for Samsung, Acer, and the like.  Now, will you find a more powerful Android tablet with greater features and $$value$$ than the Prime?  I am fairly confident you will not.So, if you need to use your tablet for turn-by-turn navigation, will regularly be 60-75 feet away from an wifi AP, and have the money to pay for the polish and ease of Ipad, then you might not want to get the Prime.  However, if you want the most powerful processor running Android (with Ice Cream Sandwich and unlocked bootloader in 5 more days), sleekest looking piece of hardware, thinnest 10\" tablet, and all at a great value, then get this tablet asap.

It feel much lighter to hold with one hand and it much thinner overall and the edge taper off and wrapping around the glass screen. I'm nitpicking this here, because of the taper design the micro SD card it protruding off a bit and you are reminded when you have it on landscape mode holding the tab with your left hand. The back side have a metal finish with the rings effect, nice looking, but don't have much texture for griping. Glass touch screen like all devices is finger print magnet. But you like that metallic feel this the tablet for you and I don't mind it also.- Performance -Yes the first quad core on a tablet, But I don't see a big different comparing a dual core yet when running multiple different apps and games. Maybe more on the software side and when apps developer optimized the 4 core, also hope ICS can boost the performance even more. I use three browser - Opera, Firefox and the default browser and all is slow to load up. I have some drop Wifi connection a few time. It also freeze up a few time for me. The one speaker don't sound loud or rich and it point away from you. Why can't at less any manufacturer design one aiming at you?. But I pair with my Bluetooth Nokia play 360, so that fine. I use the micro Hdmi port and it display on my Samsung set with a bit of over flow and there no option to resize the screen to fit.Wish Asus add Bluetooth v4.0, but Bluetooth pairing with my Bluetooth mouse with no issue, it pop up a pointer when enable. Auto brightness don't work well for me, it darken the screen way more then you can tolerated when in a dark environment.- Battery -With advance task killer, I have it on and running all day without re-charging until the night with screen brightness half way, Wifi and Bluetooth on and play music, video and surfing the web. I had 15% left, before plugging it back in.I'm pretty please with my Asus Prime tablet, even with it flaws, but I'm sure Asus will be on top of it and released more patchs.

However, their way of addressing those issues was to redesign the product as the TF700 with a plastic back (which the TF201 should have had), add a few bells and whistles, and charge $100 more. Why they didn't just bite the bullet and retrofit the TF201 with a plastic back and satisfy all those customers who already plunked down $500 is beyond me.  In any event, I got the unit yesterday and there was an immediate update to Android 4.0 right when I booted it up.  I thought, \"great I'll have the newest version right out of the box\".  The only problem is that doing the update results in a tablet that randomly locks and reboots.  I had it less than 24 hours and it randomly locked and rebooted at least 15 times.  After reading the message boards (not the Asus support site, which has no reference to any of the problems), I realized that I was not alone in the rebooting issue.  I've put up with enough marginally functional computer products in my lifetime but I've finally realized that if I pay $500 for a product, it should work properly right out of the box.

(updated January 12)", "Author": "Liqmaticus", "ReviewID": "R2SDXB0L46T2DZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have no idea what these negative reviews are talking about. My WiFi signal is strong all throughout my house. Very solid build on the chassis. Incredibly crystal clear bright screen. Stunning performance and graphics. This tablet is just an exciting piece of tech. I have a first gen iPad which two years ago was jaw dropping and now the Transformer Prime takes it to a whole other level. When you play Shadowgun on this tablet you realize nothing else compares. Total silky smooth FPS with beautiful water effects. The Tegra 3 really shows its muscle on this tablet. The scary thing is the quad core processor on this tablet is barely being tapped yet so it is very future proof as well. Now that rumors of the iPad 3 are coming out about quad core as well it looks like 2012 will be the year of quad core tablets. Either way this tablet is a bargain at 500 bucks for the 32GB model. It also is ultra thin and stays cool even under heavy load. Just amazing. I have never been happier with a tech product. Not to mention that ASUS has announced Ice Cream Sandwich will be coming January 12th and ASUS has announced an unlocked bootloader/tool. I wish other tablet makers would follow ASUS's lead and give what their customers ask for.Update: I am knocking two stars off for the way ASUS is handling the TF201 WiFi/GPS signal metal chassis design flaw by introducing a new Prime (TF700) model. Badly handled and I agree that we TF201 owners are stuck holding the tablet so to speak. I hope ASUS comes out with an acceptable solution for us TF201 owners or I predict there is going to be legal trouble down the road for them. There is a petition you can sign here if you are thoroughly peeved like most of us. [...]Update 2: The WiFi issue with the TF201 is worse than I had anticipated. I tested my TF201 from my bedroom where my Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL sits (yes I know that is an older model router, but a tried and true workhorse model) and I am getting an average of 12Mbps down and 3.6Mbps up. I move two rooms away with two walls in-between and it drops to about half at an average of 6.5Mbps down and the same on up @ 3.6Mbps. These are consistent results. With that said, all my WiFi devices experience some drop in speed as I move away from the router's ground zero, but here is the gotcha. The overall WiFi speed is much lower on my TF201 than my two year old first generation iPad. My iPad 1 in the same spots in my house gets 17.3Mbps down and 3.7Mbps up and two rooms away 15Mbps down and 3.7Mbps up. A couple things come up here. Is the antennae in my iPad 1 of better quality or stronger than my new TF201? Notice my iPad only drops about 2Mbps on the down speed when I move two rooms over yet my TF201 drops almost in half by about 5.5Mbps on the down speed. On the flip side of the coin I have an iPhone 3GS which does not have 3G enabled, but I still use the WiFi portion on it (essentially an iPod Touch). It has always had bad performance on the WiFi, but yet again the drop from ground zero to two rooms away is a smaller drop. On my iPhone 3GS I get ~6Mbps down and ~3.5Mbps up at GZ and two rooms away I get ~4.5Mbps down and ~3.5Mbps up. Only about a 1.5Mbps drop on the down. So, to answer the question, yes, the TF201 definitely has WiFi issues compared to a two year old first generation iPad and drops more speed on the down than a two year old iPhone 3GS. I was using Android ICS 4.0.3 for my test on the TF201. So anyone saying the ICS update solved the issue with WiFi on the TF201 is incorrect.Update 3: As some have reported with their TF201 I just got my first reboot for no reason. I was reading news feeds in an app called Taptu and the Prime went black and rebooted. My battery was at 80% charge. Running on the new ICS 4.0.3 update which could have something to do with it. Let's hope this gets resolved in future updates and luckily, so far, this is a rare issue.Update 4: For those who are reporting that your ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 is crashing/rebooting randomly since you updated to Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS 4.0.3) you are not alone. Follow this link: goto comments section under this review for linkUpdate 5: So after all the random reboots, crashes, weak WiFi, barely working GPS I realized I paid premium for a piece of tech garbage. Throwing in the towel and calling Office Depot Online tomorrow and returning the Transformer Prime. I am not going to be buying the new TF700T on principle since ASUS is not addressing their customer concerns with any sort of urgency. There are plenty of Tegra 3 tablets coming to market soon and I will sit and wait to see how it all shakes out. The Transformer Prime had such potential it really is unfortunate. If you want to see how bad this whole ICS 4.0.3 update that just came out went just go over to this XDA link.

As soon as i turned the unit on it went through its initial setup.  It came with Honeycomb. We also have the samsung galaxy 10.1 and they both perform very similiar on honeycomb. The asus does have a better front camera. After loading all my apps i received a update message to upgrade the asus, thinking it was ICS i did so immediately. As soon as it rebooted it lost all wifi connectivity. After an hour with asus support, they told me to go back to factory defaults, which i did. The update was not ics, but upon reboot i received another mesage to update. Per asus suport this was ICS. I did so an presto it was ICS. Immediately I noticed the difference between honeycomb and ICS. The tablet was much faster so i thought great, then problems began, sudden reboots for no reason. When surfing the internet pages would freezes asking me to wait or quit. So i downloaded several other browsers with the same results. At night i would power down and recharge the unit, next morning the tab would indicate no wifi connectivity. I had  to go through wifi setup again not a big issue but still an annoyance that we do not have with the samsung. Tested out the gps and like everyone else has stated does not function. Everyone is saying that having the tegra 3 is the deciding factor to get the asus but currently there is little or no software to take advantage of the better processor. It will be 3 to 6 months before any significant applications will be available by then there will be many tablets to chose from, even asus will have a newer model in the 2q of this year.

First off, my tablet works flawlessly. I did have my concerns like some of you who have done your research about wifi performance, gps and light bleed. Off the bat, my wifi performance was good but not consistent. I used wifi analyzer to check my signal with comparison to my current android phone, the HTC EVO 3D. Both showed the same signal strength but I noticed the inconsistency with various download speeds that ranged from 8 to 20MPS. This was from about 15-20 feet away from my wireless router, the Netgear Wireless N600. I re-configured my router to use channel 11, set the security options to WPA2-PSK (AES), Mode set to 300mps. I disabled the guest network and the 5ghz wireless broadcast. After making those changes my wireless reception improved and I was consistently hitting 20 Mbs using the speed test app. My internet service is provided by Comcast. About the GPS... I was not able to lock onto any GPS satellites from inside my home. Took the table outside and locked on to 6 satellites and counting within seconds with great accuracy on location. Using the stock Navigation app I was able to lock and use. About light bleed... There is no light bleed what so ever on my tablet, confirmed using the light bleed app from the market. The only issue I have with the tablet is when typing with the tablet using the stock keyboard can feel uncomfortable. Its like the edges of the tablet start digging into your palm. This will be easily be fixed once you put it in a case. Performance wise, I did not notice any slowdown in switching between apps and screens until I installed the app called Pulse. This app or others like it may have a compatibility issue with the companion core causing a slow down when the Asus using the companion core to conserve power. Just something to keep in mind.In short, this tablet looks great and does everything I want. I love everything about it, watching movies, fluidity, games, Multiple email account support using the Asus stock email app, and a beautiful display built into a great design to ice the cake. I was looking to jump in on a full featured Android tablet and I found it here with the transformer prime. All that's missing is Ice Cream Sandwich. I will update my review again when I receive the ICS update and/or our second transformer prime (champagne) that I ordered for my girlfriend.

To be honest I was almost dead set on the GTab 10.1, because it had allshare so I could watch television on my tablet, but I decided to go with this tablet instead. I have had it for about a week so I will tell you what I love, and what I don't.The Good:1. IPS+ screen is beautiful. I have never had a brightness issue, and I mainly work outside and I use my tablet all day. It has many brightness settings so you will never have to find a dark area again.2. Dock station. The keyboard dock is a must for anyone that is going to be doing word processing, massive web use, or needs more battery. The keyboard is awesome and feels very nice. I also like how thin it is when it is closed. Also, because it attaches and detaches I know I won't lose it.3. Battery life. I am getting well more than a full day of use out of the tablet (with the dock). I work from 7-5 every week day, and use it in the morning to catch up on my news, listen to music, and watch videos. During the workday I use it for about an hour to read over my appointments, create to-do lists, and jot down notes. On my drive home I do some homework for another hour. As soon as I get home I finish my homework and immediately use youtube, netflix, and the web. Now by the time I go to bed (usually around midnight) I have about 90% on the tablet and 30% battery on the dock, so you will never have to find a plug anywhere. But if you just use the tab, you may need a mid day short charge, and it should last well throughout the day.4. Camera. I own an Epic 4G from Sprint, so this camera is wayyyy better than my phone. It captures images in full 1080p. I also like the camera app this device comes with. Every control is right under your thumb so you never have to move around the screen, which has been great. I do not take a lot of pictures with my tablet, but when I do it is good to know I have a great option.5. Built in office suite. The TFPrime comes with Polaris office, which is a full office suite, with a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation builder. They save in microsoft office formats so you can do everything from your tablet. The tab also has a file manager in it, so if you are a student and need to locate your documents to send, you can find them easily in the file manager. This tablet has completely replaced my laptop due to this feature alone.6. Speaker. I was a little sceptic about the single speaker in the back, but I found that it is amazing! It is very loud and you do not really need to cup your hand to transfer the noise to the front (unless there is a lot of background noise around you).7. Processor. The Tegra-3 Quad core processor is blazing fast! I saw the video from c-net that said the iPad 2 was better, but its not, there is no slowing this tablet down. I even had 15 programs open at once and noticed no change in the speed. transferring between screens on other tablets is very slow, but the screen changes in real time now that I have this one.The Bad:1. Wifi connection: My specific model (which is a C series serial number), has had some issues connecting to wifi. It has only happened twice in the past week, but usually if I just squeeze the top while trying to connect it will connect (which I should not have to do, but it is better than nothing).2. Finger prints. You will get fingerprints EVERYWHERE on this thing. The screen, the body, the bottom....everywhere. But it comes with a cleaning cloth that is very very very durable, and I noticed that if you clean it right away, you won't have a problem. But if you wait to clean it, you may find it harder to clean. If not, you can just use a little water on your finger and wipe it clean.If you are thinking about getting this or an iPad you should seriously consider your options. Many people that have iPhones and iPads love my tablet. Mostly because iOS does not have widgets or scrollable wallpapers. Also, you can download many different keyboard apps to help on screen typing to become much easier by using just your thumbs. Also, take into consideration the aspect ratio. The iPad is a 4:3 and this tablet is a 16:4. 4:3 is old square screen (back from the turn of the century), so if you view a lot of widescreen material, which is most media now a days, you will be diassapointed viewing on the iPad, because it will leave two big black bars on your screen (which ultimately makes the image smaller). If you ever watch some commericials on HD channels, some of the commercials are not in HD format so you will notice two black bars on each side of the screen, that is what the iPad is. So when it does view HD or widescreen media, it is not full screen (which annoys me, and is why I decided against the iPad). On this, widescreen is the format, so there are no black bars.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "now in repair", "Author": "William W.

Initially I simply wanted a way to read my school text books without carrying them around.  At first I was going to get a kindle.  However, the IPad was starting to come out, so I decided that why not get a \"reader\" that also can help with researching on the web?  I am an anti-apple guy and just could not bring myself to purchase an IPAD, especially since it didn't even come with a camera at the time.  So, I decided on upgrading my phone to the Motorola Droid X.  I loved the Android software and the screen was big enough to read books.Fast forward to about 5 months ago.  I seriously started researching the various Android tablets, which had flooded the market since I had first begun thinking about a tablet.  I am an information hound and love looking stuff up on the fly and my laptop was always in the way at home.  Therefore, I was now on the market for an Android tablet.  The Xoom and Galaxy were priced too high for me, the Toshiba Thrive was appealing, but the Sony 32 GB was what really caught my eye.  Then, after feverishly researching in late November, I started to see Asus pop up.  I had never heard of Asus, so I was skeptical.  Wasn't sure it was something like those generic brands such as Coby, or Pan Digital.  I was determined to buy a quality tablet, one which I would not come back later and wish I had spent the extra money afterall.  The Transformer Prime was listed at $500 for 32 gb, with the fastest processor, better cameras, latest Android software, and was not bulky like the Thrive.I was so excited that I put in an order both on Amazon and Best Buy with Amazon coming through first to my pleasure (I am a loyal Amazonian).  First impression:1)  What a beautiful screen!  The colors were crisp, clear.... breathtaking!  I never imagined such a thin piece of technology could look so good.2)  Super fast.  I am not sure what issues people are referring to with regards to the Wifi.  I click on the browser and wham! My homepage pops up and I am able to surf quicker than my pc, or laptop.3)  Really thin!  To be honest, I am not sure if this is really a good thing.  I bought my Wife the brand new Acer A200 and the thickness and almost rubber back makes for a better grip.  I cannot wait till the case I ordered comes in because I am nervous about dropping it.4)  A little confusing to navigate through the menus.  It might be the Android $.) (which I upgraded immediately), or the Asus built in software.  I am used to my Droid X, so it may just be lie when I first used Windows Vista.  Hated it at first, but after getting used to it, I can't imagine going back to the prevoius Windows versions.Pros:-The responsivness and clear video makes for great game play, picture viewing, watching videos, etc.  I am not sure what most people are expecting from a tablet, but this is the most important to me.-The price is extremely pleasing, especially since Samsung is selling their 8.9\" unit for $450!-The camera placements are perfect and the quality of pictures are better than most cameras I have owned.  I will enjoy taking videos of my kids to upload without having to wait for my phone's camera to respond.Cons:-File management.  I may just need to spend more time playing with it, but it is a little confusing.  Also, the Asus \"My Net\" software used for connecting to other units either doesn't work properly, or is just lacking in capabilities.  I should be able to connect and access the files on my other systems connected to my Wifi at the house.  So far, I have not been able to figure out how to do this.  I want to be able to transfer music and pictures from one system to another like I do now between my laptop and pc.-No print option.  I am researching now how to print via my Prime, but all I find are folks who tell me to use a print app, all of which are not as easy to use as I had hoped.I will follow up later after gaining more experience with my Prime.  However, I am extremely pleased that I did not have to purchase an Ipad to get the speed, responsiveness and screen clarity all in a very light and thin (almost too thin) tablet.

The only thing I could wish would be for the hard start-up to be a little faster, Words With Friends would stop force closing - seems to be a problem with the app - not the tablet(but Scrabble Free and Word Feud work great) and that HBO Go and Hulu Plus would offer an Android App for this tablet - they don't yet...but hopefully, it's not too long before they do.  Netflix streams great; however.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Initial Thoughts", "Author": "Callmemike", "ReviewID": "R1AFFEEXDVMRRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TP Saturday morning, 4 days ahead of the estimated delivery date with Super Saver Shipping.  Lucky for me it was a very light weekend, so I had plenty of time to use it.  As soon as I turned it on, it started updating itself, and within 10 minutes I had Android ICS and a camera update installed with no effort on my part.I'm really a freak for electronics, and though I can't afford to actually go out and buy everything that comes out, I can certainly appreciate nice new devices.  I just bought my wife an iPad 2 a week ago.  She's been using an iPhone for a while now and likes it, so it made more sense to keep her in something that didn't require learning a new device.  Same chargers, apps, etc.  I also use an iPhone, but I've been using an Asus laptop for awhile and really like the quality of their products.  I also carry an Android phone for work, so I'm fairly familiar with the OS, apps, etc.I say all that to preface the fact that I've got both the iPad 2 and the Transformer Prime to compare, and I own an Asus netbook, an Asus 17\" laptop, an iPhone 4s, and an iPhone 3gs. I'm not on anyone's \"bandwagon\", I just like different devices for different applications.The Prime is beautiful.  I know that doesn't have anything to do with performance, but it needs to be said.  The spun-metal back doesn't show fingerprints at all, but I'll agree with the other reviewers that have said the front is a fingerprint MAGNET.  The included cleaning cloth works very well on the Gorilla Glass, though, so I'll keep it handy.  The tablet feels solid... one advantage of the metal back plate.  It doesn't feel as though it would flex at all.  The corners are just rounded enough that they don't dig into your hands while you're holding it.  It would be a little heavy to hold up to read while lying in bed, but I purchased a pretty nice case with it that converts to a stand:  MoKo(TM) Premium Quality Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case with built-in Multi-Angle Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1-Inch Android TabletThe screen is extremely clear and bright, and with the tablet set in \"Balanced\" performance mode, \"Super IPS\" turned on, brightness set on \"Auto\", I never noticed the transitions in brightness (but it did change, I just didn't notice when it happened like on some devices).  I think you could easily sit outside on a bright day and read fairly easily with this tablet.  Also, using the aforementioned settings, I got close to 10 hours out of a full charge.  That may not seem like a big deal, since that's what the specs call for, but I was using this thing HARD for the first full day.  We all know that when a manufacturer calls out battery life, it's normally based on best-case scenarios.  I do fully intend to add the optional keyboard dock later, which adds additional battery life and more port options.The screen transitions are very fluid.  I downloaded Riptide and a couple other games and they are very, very smooth.  I especially like the ice cube Live Wallpaper that also indicates battery level.  I've been using Google for mail, docs, calendars, etc. for several years now, so I was very happy to see how well all those are integrated.  You're not locked into using the Google stuff though, and setup was very easy when adding my email account from work.  I was a little concerned about there not being any kind of tactile \"home button\", but having all the controls integrated to touch-type controls feels very natural after a few minutes of use.  All the touch points to access system functions are intuitively placed.  I read a couple reviews about the power button and volume rocker being too small and poorly placed, but I didn't find them difficult or inconvenient to use, other than the fact that when you're looking at the tablet in landscape mode, both of those are located in the top left corner of the device.  If you hold it in portrait mode, they're positioned in the more natural-feeling upper right hand corner (I'm right-handed).  In the 20+ hours that I spent messing with it this weekend, I only had it in portrait mode for a few minutes.  Everything looks and functions quite well in landscape mode.The touch screen is very responsive, pinching functions are smooth as well.  Zooming, scrolling, and \"swiping\" operations are handled easily with no lag or stutter.User setup options and preferences are extensive, which is one thing I personally like compared to the IP2.  I love customization, and this device allows plenty of it.  My wife loathes \"tweaking\", which made the IP2 a better choice for her.My wireless network showed up right away and connected without incident, and signal seems to be fine everywhere in the house.  We have 2 wireless routers, one in the basement and one on the second floor, and it automatically switched to the strongest signal in relation to where I was in the house.  I can get an adequate signal from the router in the basement while in all the rooms of the house, so the recent reviews of poor WiFi signal reception don't seem to be an issue for me.I didn't take the unit out and drive around to see how will the GPS works, because honestly that's not what I bought it for, but it worked fine in the house with Google Maps and Latitude.I read some stuff on the Kindle app, and watched several shows on Netflix.  Loading and playback of all types of media is fast and very, very smooth.  I'm going to start working with some other apps like SplashTop Remote and some other boring apps that relate more to work than play.  I did set up and access my personal laptop with SplashTop.. the tablet is a much better option for remote access than a phone.All in all, I'm VERY pleased with my decision to purchase this tablet.  The build quality is as good as I expected from Asus, and the performance is better than I had hoped for.  I understand that the next version of this tablet is already in development and may possibly be released within a few months, but such is the timeline for technology.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS ALREADY HAD IMPROVED SHELL DESIGN BEFORE RELEASING PRIME", "Author": "S. Smith", "ReviewID": "R31MFD3OGV99WI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This first paragraph is all you need to read. Everything else was prior to latest news. Asus has already announced another version of the Prime for Q2 and it has a redesigned shell to improve Wifi, GPS and Bluetooth !!!  With this being announced so early, before the original Prime has even been able to hit store shelves, its very obvious that Asus knew about the wireless issues of the Prime prior to releasing them. Rather than delay (remember rumored delays due to Wifi issues)and fix the issue they pushed the Primes out in time for good holiday sells, knowing it was flawed. All the time a new designed shell was already in the works and even possibly already in hand. Asus did add higher resolution screen on the new model but its likely this was to merit releasing it has a \"different\" Prime. Very poor move by Asus. I recommend not buying the Prime or the new version Prime.Below is a list of signficant flaws to consider when making your purchase decision. Please read the UPDATE sections below for more specific notes.1. Poor GPS caused by aluminum shell design2. Reduces Wifi range and performance (likely due to same shell as well)3. Drastically reduced Wifi performance when connected to and/or streaming to bluetooth device capable of music / video streams.UPDATE !!! So the issues keep coming. It is known now that there is an issue with using Bluetooh and Wifi at the same time. I have tested this myself and it seems to depend on exactly what the bluetooth is being used for. When used to stream music to a bluetooth headset or stereo, WiFi transfer rate is dramatically impacted.  I tested without bluetooth and was getting 13000 range kbps. With bluetooth streaming on the transfer dropped to 400 kbps and lower. This will be an issue for those that might like to stream music to their entertainment center while browsing on the Prime.UPDATE !!!! Asus has issued a statement concerning GPS issue. They have admitted it is due to the shell and will no longer list or market GPS as a feature. My review started off as 4 stars but to me this is a significant screw up and a sign of poor QC. Whats worse is that early rumors of delayed release due to Wifi issues shows that Asus knew of the problem then but decided Christmas sells were more important than delivering a product that worked the way it should. WiFi issues have also been confirmed and are due to the shell however the WiFi signal is still strong enough to work, but it could be and should be better.WiFi is also not optimal and with 3 units tested I found all three to have significantly shorter range than other devices like iPad 2, iPhone, laptop. Transfer speeds over Wifi are also slower. With all the devices running the same test and sitting the same distance from the router, the Prime came up with slower tranfers. As the distance from the wireless router was increased for each device, the transfer rates for the Prime suffered more than the other devices. So for example moving all devices to a bedroom 40 feet away with two walls between them and the wireless router, all the devices, except for the prime, showed the same level of transfer loss. The Prime on the other hand showed a greater loss.WATCH THIS VIDEO to see that the Prime does have WiFi performance issues.  [...]UPDATE !!!!  Well the rumored GPS issues were apparently real. So real in fact that Asus is no longer listing GPS as a feature of the Prime. Check the Asus site if you doubt. You might find it listed on other sites but that is only because ASUS does not have access to those sites to remove it.  This tells me that the GPS issue is more than likely due to a design flaw and since they are removing it from the list they will most certainly not continue trying to fix it,  because it probably cannot be fixed.  I had to take away a star for this reason.  Very shady tactic on part of Asus. Of course Zealots will brush this off as being an unimportant feature, even though they were sure to point it out as a great included feature that you must pay extra for on the iPad 2. I also forsee Asus adding it back to the specs but it will be for legal reasons only.I was lucky enough to get my hands on 3 of these, two of which were not even Pre Orders. One was a walk in to BB and the other online order from BB, which took only 3 days to process and ship to me. One was from Santa for my 11 year old daughter and the other two for me and my wife.I'm starting the Prime off with 5 stars and deducting or adding back as I go.- 2 Stars - Faulty GPS. Asus either did not test GPS or knew there was an issue and released it anyway. Either way is not good.Asus has removed GPS from the list of features on the Prime and admitted it is due to the shell.- 1/3 Star - BackLight Bleeding on all three.When held in landscape mode the location of the light bleed is on the right side just below the corner. The bleed is not subtle either. On two of the units there are two distinct sections next to eachother. On the third unit its one less distinct area. Being in the same location I am wondering if its a quality control or design issue. It does not stand out under normal use unless that area is dark and has no graphics to cover it. It will stand out during movies when that section is dark.- 1/3 Star - Case / Glass separation on all three.The next thing noticed on all three is a cracking sound when holding along the left side in landscape mode near the volume rocker. If you press there you can see the glass move in as you press.  I think this is a design issue and maybe has something to do with the volume rocker. When viewed from the side (thin view), you can see the glass sticks up slightly higher there. Its as if the glass was suppose to be snapped in but it did not hold.- 1/3 Star - Crashes and Interface issues.I should not really deduct for the OS Interface since its probably not the fault of the device but since it is a part of the device I will. We have experienced crashes although not in excess. Its usually on the browser. I also find that sometimes tapping an icon is not responsive and you must tap several times. Its as if the touch screen stops sensing. This was noticed on the Xoom and the Fire as well so I would say its an OS issue.+ 1 Star - Is for the performance and overall experience with the device. This thing is fast and that is using it in the mid performance setting.Boot Time -  YIKES !!  1 minute boot time ! I will not deduct from this because we generally will let it sleep and not power off until night time.Sound - The speaker seems sufficient to me. I would not have a problem using it for watching a movie or gaming as long as there were not others around that might be annoyed.Screen - The screen looks amazing. Viewing angles seems to be very good. For example sitting at the end of couch with the Prime facing me directly, my daughter and wife sitting to my left could view without having to lean back and over towards me.Quality - In my opinion could have been better, specifically the backlight bleed and cracking along edge that I already pointed out. If those were not present I would not have anything negative to say about the quality of the prime.Is this an iPad2 killer ? I do not think so. If you hate Apple then of course you will think it is. Heck the Apple haters thought the Xoom was the iPad 2 killer. I'm not a hater or zealot of either side. Fact is Apple has really polished their OS. I think once the Android OS gets polished and tweaked a bit that I would definitely put the Prime on top. Maybe the next update in January 2012 ?  If the update is focused on improvements to the current OS and not just a bunch of new features that will open up new problems then I think it will be very promising. I have my fingers crossed.<<<UPDATE>>>  I exchanged one our Primes, which had the worst backlight bleed, at our local BB. The replacement was much better. The cracking / moving glass near volume rocker is not there. Bleed is so minor that I would call it no bleed at all; however the minor bleed I can see is in the same exact spot as the others. I also researched some and found a review that mentioned the bleed and it was in the same location as well.I have been reading complaints for WiFi and GPS issues. I have no way to test the wifi speed but must admit that I see constant fluctuation of signal strenght on the Prime. Apparently the GPS issue is signal strength related. What I have read is that it is strong enough to lock on and give your location but not strong enough to maintain a lock if mobile, for example if you were trying to use it for navigation from point A to B.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than iPad 2...as you already know.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SUWWUM2HBPOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Prime was a gift for Christmas, which I finally got my hands on 1/1/2012 (was on vacation when it delivered 12/28 via BestBuy). In the 28 hours I've had it, I've fallen in love with the simplicity. I even broke out an iPad 2 to do some comparisons. So far, with the camera update and such, the video and camera is better than the iPad; web is quick; gameplay is gorgeous; only a few minor bugs with sensitivity (it really needs a precise touch for closing programs and moving apps on home screen). You want a more detailed review, just search the ones already on Amazon; they are way more tech-savvy than I.I don't care about the bootloader, although it seems to be a really big issue for everyone reviewing the Prime. As the product is intended to be, the Prime is amazing; reviews that say otherwise are bogus, although I understand wanting the bootloader lock removed (but that should not equal 1-star ratings, guys! Come on!). No WiFi issues, but I have noticed the signal will say it is low; when I do a speed test, I get 5mbps, which makes me think the signal indicator is the issue, not the actual WiFi. However, I am not a pro.I'm a student, so this should come in handy so I don't have to lug 10 pound texts + laptop + notebook everywhere I go. SuperNote is pretty awesome on it. Waiting for a good case to come in, but will probably pick up a sleeve tomorrow until the Tuff-Luv for the TF201 releases in February.***update 1.3.12***Asus announced their statement about bootloader. They will allow unlock.***update 1.21.12***After ICS update, my Prime showed a dead pixel and would show black horizontal lines. I found a replacement at Best Buy nearby and exchanged it. The new one has no issues that I've found. I tested the WiFi speed: 17.44 d/l and 3.44 up. Same as the iPhone in my house and Bionic Droid.I have also gotten my hands on the dock. I'm loving it. When the Prime reaches 70%, the dock charges it, but the dock dies very quickly compared to what I was expecting (but I'm always using it).So, yes, many Primes have flaws. Not all.***update 3.29.12***Okay, so now that I've used this thing daily since the beginning of the year, I wanted to give some more feedback. I'm a graduate student, so I use this thing for school all the time. Most of what we read is in .pdf format, so I love that I can switch between notes and reading; it's easy to take the dock off when needed. (If you're a student like me, apps you'll want: EZ PDF, because you can annotate most .pdf files; QuickOffice, because I hated the stock processor, and I can't stand Google Docs; SplashTop is pretty cool, in case I forget a file on my computer at home.)I use this thing to read. No issues with daylight reading, and without the dock, it lasted my from 7AM to 4AM with a lot of reading (I'm on Spring Break). When I game, it handles it perfectly, and I love the graphics. I usually keep it in battery saver mode unless I want to play games.About the dock: while there are some issues with the rubber things coming off the bottom, I love how easy it is to use the dock with the Prime--and it's so thin when they're together! Issues: screen is heavier than the dock. I got a good case and now I don't worry about it at all. Mouse is a little awkward at times, so I usually just use the touch screen (it's funny transitioning back to my regular laptop; I'm always hitting the screen).This thing is so easy to use! The only thing I wish was that the WiFi detector was stronger. If I'm in my backyard, it doesn't pick up the signal; if I am five feet from the door (about 200 feet from the router) I pick it up again.

Hentze", "ReviewID": "R11EI4KP0TTZFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 1/11/12: Well, I promised an update when ICS was released but unfortunately my Prime has the dreaded \"Serial Number Unknown\" issue, and can't be updated OTA. I had to return it to Best Buy, and there are no more in stock. I still like the Prime, and plan on getting my hands on another one as soon as possible. Be advised though. There seem to be a lot of Primes being shipped with this major issue. :(------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:I've had a chance to play with the Asus Transformer Prime for a few days now, and I'm very impressed. I was going to wait until next week when the Android 4 ICS update comes out, but I decided to give a brief review in it's current stage.First Impressions: Out of the box, the Prime has the look and feel of quality built tablet. The thinness really surprised me since my other tablets are at least twice as thick. Before doing anything, I charged the Prime fully. The first boot took about 90 seconds. My Prime came with firmware .27, which I updated to the latest .33. After updating and getting everything setup, the Prime would boot in under a minute.Screen: Simply put, it's bright and beautiful. I do not have any noticeable light bleeding.Wifi: This is where I was most concerned. My concerns seem to be unfounded. My Wifi works fine. My router (an older FiOS Actiontec \"G\") is located on the 2nd floor. I get a good signal throughout my house, including my basement. Throughput is fine, and my connection never drops.GPS: First let me say that I could care less about this because I'll never use my Prime not connected to Wifi, but for the purposes of this review, I did test it. The first test was indoors, and as expected the results were not good. I could get an occasional satellite lock, but it would disconnect. I then went outside and I made sure Wifi was disabled. With a clear view of the sky, the Prime got a satellite lock in around 30 seconds. The GPS seems to work fairly well if you're outdoors and have a clear view of the sky. It remained locked, and Google Maps knew exactly where I was. Depending on your plans for the GPS, it is a mixed bag. If you're planning on using it for navigation in your vehicle, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want to use it outdoors with apps such as Google Maps, or Google Sky Map, then it works OK.Battery: Battery life was good. My first charge lasted about 8 hours. After some tweaking and subsequent charges, I now get around 10 hours.Cameras: The 8MP rear camera has 1080P video capture and is a great performer. It takes excellent pictures in good light, and is the best I've seen on an Android tablet or phone. I haven't taken much video, but from what I have taken, it looks very good.  The front 1.2MP camera is perfect for video conferencing, etc.Performance: Performance is excellent as expected. The Tegra 3 doesn't disappoint even though most apps aren't optimized for it. All the apps I use open noticeably faster than my Tegra 2 based tablet. The screen is quick and responsive, and I haven't noticed any lag. I use Dolphin HD as my browser, and the stock keyboard. There is the occasional \"app crash\", but this is almost always related to Android 3 \"Honeycomb\", not the Prime's hardware. The vast majority of current apps are written for compatibility with phones and Android 2.x, not the \"tablet only\" Android 3.x. In 2012, Android 4.x \"ICS\" will solve this problem, as the same operating system will once again be used for both new phones and new tablets.Overall: I'm completely satisfied. Wifi was my only real concern, and it works just fine for me. The Asus Transformer Prime looks beautiful, and is blazing fast. My only caveat would be if the GPS is very important to you. Since its limitations appear to be hardware related, I wouldn't expect any major improvements to it.

I preordered my tablet originally on November 22.  I received my tablet from Amazon on January 4th, and found out that the gyroscope and accelerometer didn't work at all.  I called up ASUS, and after a few calls back and forth, they decided that it was indeed broken, and that I had to send it in.  It sucked, but they told me that it would take 7 days to fix once they received it, so I said alright, two weeks at most with shipping time, I can do that.  I sent the tablet back and it arrived at ASUS on January 9th according to USPS tracking.  ASUS's RMA status page didn't say that they had received it, until a week later on the 16th.  When I called on the 16th, they assured me that it would be fixed and sent out on the 17th or 18th (7 business days).  The 18th came and went, and the status on the tablet on ASUS's site changed to \"Waiting-[WB5] Wait for Repair\\Test\\Aging.\"  It's still at that status today.  Calling support doesn't help at all.  I've called multiple times, and they can't give me any status other than it's still being repaired, that they'll elevate it, and let me know in 3 days.  It's going on 3 weeks now, and ASUS still hasn't given me any meaningful update or eta on when I can get the tablet back.  I have friends who didn't even pre-order the tablet who have it now in working order.  Now I'm worried that if I ever do get the tablet back, that the wifi will be gimped on it.  In hindsight, I probably should have just sent it back to Amazon for a refund.I've bought plenty of ASUS products before, mainly motherboards.  No more, their support and RMA process is absolutely terrible.  I don't want to have to go through this again.  Is it too much to ask to give an accurate status or eta to an RMA?

Got like 14 satellites and it followed me pretty good. I'm not sure how to mount it in my car though.

Haven't had major issues with any web pages I visit so far.ICS very intutive. It took about 10 minutes to upgrade. Was able to figure most things out without the manual (available online only). Everything synced to my google accounts easily. I had a few apps force close, but restarting them made it fine. I have not had to fully reboot my system yet (had it for a week). Tablet is pretty zippy. Don't have much to compare to except my wife's ipad 2 and they're pretty similar.There are a bunch of apps, but the good ones are still limited. Some apps just don't open, probably due to the new OS. Make sure you d/l the amazon appstore for some freebies.  Some good free ones that work are google translate, google++, google Earth, wifi analyzer, GPS test, BSPlayer lite, angry birds, kindle, skype, and tank recon 3d. Skype video chat works. You need to go in the Skype settings and enable video. It said it hasn't been optimized for the device so video may be poor, but it looked fine to me. Use wifi analyzer to select a good clean channel.I was able to hook it up via USB to my computer and upload all my music and video.

The $3-$4 beats the $30 one you need for the iPad 2.***12-17-2012***I got my micro hdmi cable. My first one got lost in the mail. My second one made it fine. Quality looks excellent. One issue is that it seems to cut out about 1/2\" around the edges. In some apps, it just duplicates what is on your screen, in others like BDS player, it goes black and only shows the controls which is nice.My issue is about the inconsistent flash performance on large network sites (NBC, CBS, ABC, etc). Sometimes I can get it to work, some never work, some sometimes work. There was a new flash update so time will tell if this improves. Unlike the iPad, there are no apps that can play shows from these places.***I'm not sure if the GPS and wifi issues are blown out of proportion, if there's user error, if there's a unit to unit variation, or if the later units had a fix, but these 2 features seem to work fine on mine. Instead of focusing on numbers (ie speed/BW), just see if it's able to do the things you want reasonably well compared to similar devices. You don't need a firehose to water a plant or having a supercomputer to write a paper isn't going to get it done any faster. :) Likewise, it's very possible that some of these units are genuinely defective.Lastly, a hint to buy it on amazon (at it's intended price and free shipping) is to add it to your cart and just check it religiously. I saw it become available once (Wed morning) and it was gone in 30 mins. I saw it again Fri night and that's where I snagged it. With prime, I got it on Monday.****2-8-2012 update****There was an update today but I do not know if the following was due to the update or not.I tested my wifi using speedtest.net on my TFP and my wife's IP2. Both had similar wifi results. (make sure you select the same server).I also tested the GPS and was able to get a few satellites on the 2nd floor. On the 3rd (top) floor, I got lots of satellites and and was able to lock.****2-14-2012 update****Using the device to watch TV. NBC not supported. ABC works decent. History Channel works but a bit laggy. Don't have Netflix.****3-22-2012 update****NBC still doesn't work. I think it's because they use Silverlight though I heard they were changing. The APP has little or no content.CBS works.HULU Plus APP installs but video not supported.History Channel more stable now.TED APP works, though a bit buggy.****tips*****I though I'd post some tips I learned here.If you use google accounts (gmail, calendar, google++, ect.), it's pretty to sync it to the Transformer. Simply d/l the app and login. If you want to sync your bookmarks on your PC to the TFP, it takes a little more work. First, you have to d/l the latest Chrome browser. The you have to enable the syncing to google accounts. Then any bookmarks that you add to Chrome show up in the stock browser after a few minutes. If you are not already using Chrome, you can use Chrome to import your bookmarks from other browsers. After that, they will show up on the TFP.If someone sends you an invite from their calendar program (ipad, google calendar) to your gmail account, it appears in your calendar. Makes it easy to sync calendars with other people.Sorry if any of this is basic knowledge, but it took me a while to figure out how to do this.

As for the iPad 2, we had to plug it into the computer to sync for a few hours before getting to use it, and after all that we discovered that our apple accounts had gotten confused, so the iPad had a weird mix of apps from two different accounts, most of which were solely meant for the iPhone, so the screen resolution was off. Surprisingly, the Prime was easier to set up than the iPad 2 (I've usually found apple products to be very intuitive).Another thing that impressed me are the speakers in the Prime. I played some music and it sounded great. The Prime is also thinner than the iPad 2. I believe the processor is faster as well (it sure feels like it).After playing with each, I just feel like there is so much more that I can do with my Prime than with the iPad 2. My apps and games look better on the Prime, even the ones that were designed for phone use. When I am using it, I really get the feeling that Asus went all out to give us the best experience imaginable at this point in technology. The iPad 2 is cool, but it's not as nice as my Prime.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet for a regular user", "Author": "M. Reis", "ReviewID": "R2M90SZ4YEP9K7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I find the Asus Transformer Prime TF201 (32GB) to be an excellent product for what it was designed to be: A consumer tablet. Note: It is not a notebook or full slate computer. I will provide a review on what I needed a tablet for: an eReader for books and journal article PDFs, a way to do light work (minor document editing and posts to online classrooms) when travelling, surfing the web at home, watching videos, and playing games now and then.Because the tablet has been reviewed fairly extensively, I will just address the highpoints and issues others have experienced. I am running Android version 4.0.3 (ICS) and it is pretty flawless so far (this udpate happened automatically when I first charged the tablet and took about 10 minutes). I don't know or care about the bootloader issue others have reported on. The only thing I noticed is that I cannot delete the stock photos in the gallery.Screen and Resolution - Bright, vivid, awesome HD graphics, and smooth scrolling between panes/screens. No defects in screen or resolution (no light bleed). Glass picks up finger prints but very easy to clean and not really noticable whne screen is on. Gorilla glass seems pretty hard, so hopefully will never scratch with proper care and a case.WiFi - no problems whatsoever. Signal is pretty good several floors from router and has not dropped. My tablet works as well as all my other wireless devices. The signal strength indicator does vary from 10-52 Mbps depending on where you are, but it never has any trouble downloading at regular speeds. My expereince has been that the WiFi on the tablet works fine, but could probably be better for those with weak signals.Browser - The Asus browser works great! Loads as fast as any other WiFi computers on my 54 Mbps wireless(but slightly slower than hard-wired broadband computers, of course). I prefer the functionality of non-Mobile sites for Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes, so glad I can access these sites with a regular browser rather than a stripped-down App. Access is fast and trouble-free to all the major sites I have visited. I have encountered only a very few \"browser not responding\" boxes when loadig large pages, but as soon as you click \"Wait\" the page is immediately loaded and there have been no real \"crashes\" to report.eReader - Using Kindle and MyLibrary apps, books and PDFs open and scroll fine. One exception is that I can't open password-protected PDFs...seems to be a ProQuest ezproxy compatibility issue with Android OS and not the fault of the tablet per se.Apps - Have downloaded about 20 and all seem to work fine. No crashes.Battery life - It goes through about 10% an hour with moderate use and \"balanced mode\" selected. I got 11.5 hours on first full day of usage and still had 10% battery left when I shut down. very hapy with battery life. The keyboard dock battery should extend this to 16 hours - very nice!GPS - Did not buy for this feature, but it works fine with WiFi on or off. Inside or outside of house makes no difference either. Accurate to within 10-15 feet and updates in real time with your movements.I have not yet received the keyboard dock yet, so I can't comment on that, but I hope that it allows for easier full screen viewing while typing. The Asus keyboard works fine for an on-screen keyboard (certainly easier than using the one on my android phone!) and does not have any noticeable lag (but I am not a speed typist by any stretch of the imagination!).One thing I did not anticipate is how hard it is to hold with one hand for extended periods of time. It is not heavy, but it is thin and the back is not textured enough to provide good grip. I have ordered a case that should make one-handed reading easier and also converts for desktop stand use.Overall I feel this is an excellent tablet.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it until this: Serial Number \"Unknown\" bug.", "Author": "Louis Steele", "ReviewID": "RY55YTM5HP5LM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved my Prime. I didn't have any issue with wifi, and the GPS worked fairly well. I hadn't received any notification for the OTA .29 and .33 updates that came out last week, but didn't think much of it and updated manually off the ASUS website. Last night when the long anticipated Android 4.03 ICS update came out, I didn't get that one either. I went onto XDA this morning, only to find out that there were several threads including one that was 10 pages long, about a nasty bug in which some Primes were shipped without a serial number embedded into the software. Apparently it's a fairly large percentage considering all the people now stuck with no OTA updates. The bottom line is, if you go into: system info > about tablet > and see Serial Number \"Unknown\", you'll never get an OTA update. Not only that, you can't root (if you care), and can't boot into stock recovery either. I'd post the link to XDA, but Amazon will remove it, so either Google it, or head over to the XDA Forums. There's also info on it on several other forums too.

Tegra 3 Quad-core processor, IPS+ display, thinner than anything out in the market, and all for $499?  Not to mention that it would be out by November, well before Christmas season.  There really wasn't much reason not to place pre-order.  Then everything fell apart.First ASUS dropped amazon.com out of their pre-order partner, which gave that horrible gut feeling, soon to be followed by massive pre-order cancellation (there are just too many to count on how many were affected by this, including myself).  Outrage of not providing an option to just stay in pre-order were eventually met with an option to re-order this item in late november which were quickly sold out in matter of minutes.  Estimated release date thankfully moved from Valentine's Day (funny joke, if there was one) to mid-January, and eventually received mine few days ago.  By then, I completely gave up on any hope for Christmas delivery, but was hopeful about the rumored Ice Cream Sandwich update (Android 4.0).  To add one more twist to this possibly the most agonizing pre-order SNAFU, amazon.com sent me an email about providing $10 credit as a way of making up for botched pre-order, but even that was delayed, leading me to send an email to their stellar customer service (which I hardly ever have to use) inquiring yet another botched promise (eventually amended).Here comes the whole three days of experience with ASUS Transformer Prime:+Good:Beautiful, expensive looking product: Use of brushed metallic back gives the heft and touch that rhymes with \"I feel expensive, and therefore, I am an expensive product\".Great display*: Bright, outdoor viewable, great color reproduction, no color bending from extreme angle, and no noticeable edge bleeding.Quick Update: Less than 20 minutes after I unpacked this product, I saw update being downloaded, and within an hour, it was updated to ICS.Good software: ICS is truly what Android tablet meant to be.  Smooth transition, more logical arrangement, and ASUS control panel comes very handy.-Bad:GPS Performance, or lack thereof: Even with assistance from Wi-Fi, I can't get a lock at all.Wi-Fi Performance: This is where metallic back rears its ugly head.  Where I normally get 3-4 bars and decent speed, I struggled to get any reception with this tablet.Overall shape/form factor: Not entirely fault of this product, as 10\" can be bit unwieldy on your hands.  I was keep changing from portrait to landscape and could not get comfortable holding either way.  Lessons on actually seeing and testing out the product prior to purchase.-UGLY:Terrible Quality control: As I was looking at it in lighter colored background, I noticed darkened area, about 5 pixels long vertically just to the left of the dead center.  At first, I thought, \"Hmm, smudges.  I better wipe it off\".  Then to my horror, I realized that there were no smudge to wipe off.  It was dreaded dead/stuck pixels.  In darker backgrounds, it is barely noticeable, but as color becomes lighter, it was unmistakable.  It gives that horrible, \"there's popcorn kernel stuck in my teeth and my god, it feels like a boulder\" feeling every time I looked at it.Alas, but there were more issues.  Outer lens cover were discolored, much like someone accidentally scratched off UV coating, and pictures I took had discoloration on corresponding area.Further compounded by lower bottom lip where plastic outer ring connects metal back and front glass display were nicked as well.  I can most certainly understand shortage issue, delay issue and so on (which has become unofficial trademark of HOT and NEW ASUS product launch), but having three glaring quality control issues in one?  No, that won't do.  I cannot imagine any Apple buyers letting this go should these happen to their iPad.  I am not fond of mentioning their products, but I do expect them not letting this many mistakes in a single product to land in retailer.As much as I would love to keep this product, I returned it, pending refund.

So far it has been flawless for me.  Everything runs great and I've only run into the GPS issue which seems to have since been fixed.  I hate to write one of those glowing reviews for a controversial product that tends to get ignored but this has genuinely been my experience thus far.Wifi:I know this has been one of the complaints but for me I haven't found this to be an issue.  I have a two story house plus finished basement.  I can use the tablet from anywhere in the house and even outside without losing signal (that is not dropping connection obviously as I get further away the meter reports lower signal).  So I can't complain here, I was using it from my car as we pulled out of the driveway and it wasn't until after we got a house or two away before it completely stopped.GPS:Initially I couldn't get a GPS lock at all though largely I wasn't concerned since I never really considered that important for my use since my phone would be far more likely to be used for that.  After a firmware update yesterday though the GPS instantly locks and seems to work fine though (noticed this while showing someone the tablet today and they asked about the issue).  I've tried repeatedly and every time it has worked fine.Outside of those issues I think universally people have liked the rest of the tablet and for me I agree everything seems to run great and work well.  The screen is beautiful and displays crisply and brightly.  My only complaints would be that they should have just let go of the Christmas season and just waited a month to get all the fixes in right from the start and have supply on hand to fulfill orders.  They would have lost some sales but not nearly as much as has probably been caused by the complaints of those who got the tablets before the updates went out.My recommendation is definitely if you are in the market for a full fledged high end tablet that this one is worth getting without any reservations.

Updates from Asus became few and far between and after releasing the new version of this tablet just a short couple of months later they abandoned this and everyone who had initially defended this device in the beginning. I was able to salvage a bit of usability by installing a custom ROM, but just recently the camera has stopped working, which is apparently just par for the course for the Transformer Prime.

On the positive side, it is well built and sturdy, light, and very fast for a tablet. If not for one key issue, I'd give the TF201 a five star rating.Unfortunately, the ability of the TF201 to receive and hold WiFi signals is sub-par at best. I've now had the ability to compare the WiFi range to three different devices - My wife's Lenovo Laptop, a Droid X (yes, with Wifi, and not 3G), and and version 1 iPad. Compared to these three devices, the TF201 has a significantly reduced range. As an example, my wireless router is in my basement, and when I am in my master bedroom, which is located on the first floor of my home, I cannot get a good steady WiFi link with the TF201, which causes intermittent internet access at best. All three devices which I mentioned not only get a good WiFi signal, but are able to stream video flawlessly.This is a serious defect. First of all, if all I was using this device for is to look at youtube video's of cats transforming in to croissants, then who cares. I bought this device to do work on. In one case, I was unable to get to my online folders, send email, or collaborate online while I was away on business for work. Yes, I was able to wander down to the lobby of the hotel where there was better signal, but that really isn't the point.I consider this device to be a premium product - it was quite costly, and was designed to compete with the iPad, and Samsung Galaxy as one of the premier tablets. If WiFi is compromised, it limits the portability aspect of a tablet, which is one of the main features of this type of device. Getting WiFi right should be such a basic feature - ASUS should never have really let this device out of the lab, and they must have know that it's WiFi capability was insufficient.Also, the TF201, at the time of purchase also stated that it has GPS, and I assumed that it would function similar to an android phone's navigation. No dice on the GPS either - the signal is so weak that it can't be used reliably at all.I'm keeping the TF201, because I can \"work around\" it's deficiencies, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth w.r.t ASUS, whom I have bought PC components from before with no issues.

I could definitely see the weak wifi being a problem at public locations, such as hotels and airports. Besides the GPS, Wifi and BT issues, I noticed the tablet was considerably slow while browsing. It was almost painful - to the point that on one occasion, I put it down and used my old laptop to finish what I was doing.On 1/9, I was pleasantly surprised that the ICS upgrade was made available.

I was a little less familiar with some of the applications in it.  For example, there are \"hidden\" menus for many programs, and it took me a little while to develop the habit of where to touch on the screen to access these things, but not extremely long.  If you are a person how doesn't mind tapping a few places and finding where things are, this should not be a problem.  It's just the basic learning curve, and does not apply to this specific tablet, but rather the Android OS.The tablet itself is fairly light.  I have not handled a lot of other tablets, however, so I cannot compare.  But because I am used to carrying around a laptop and books for school all the time, this it seems light to me.  However, it does have enough wait that you don't feel like throwing it around.  I like that however.  It weighs just enough to make you think twice about throwing it around, which I would not recommend anyway at this price.  Which leads me to the price...It is certainly expensive.  And if you are looking for only an eReader, this is overpriced and overpowered for you.  However, if you are like me, where you want something much closer to a laptop/netbook/notebook, but want the general feel of an eReader, then this is a great choice.  It's cheaper than the iPad 2, unless you buy the iPad 2 on a contract, which ends up costing you more in the long-run anyway.  For a quad core processor and a solid feeling tablet, this price is actually much better than some of the \"last generation\" tablets which only have a single or dual core processor.  Therefore, unless you are planning to wait until the next round of tablets that comes out later this year and onwards, this tablet will meet or beat most (or all?) of the other options in terms of price and performance.With the newest update of the Android OS, you can control the screen brightness (ie. ICS - not sure what the abbreviation means).  Because of this, if you are in a low light area, you can turn down the brightness to the lowest setting, and this really helps me because you can still use it perfectly, but it doesn't strain my eyes as much as a bright screen does.  Even better, it only takes two taps on the screen to make this change, so it is much faster than doing it on a laptop, for instance.The battery life, because of the ICS setting, is much better than I was expecting.  I also turned off the GPS setting, which I don't really need anyway.  The combination of these two things, and turning off the screen when not in use, has allowed me to use it between 2 and 3 days.  Because a lot of the usage is me reading books (I am a graduate student, I read a *lot*), I actually keep the screen on a lot.  So, I would estimate that I keep the screen on, plus wifi, plus occasionally doing other things like checking email, for approximately 4-6 hours a day.  This is, of course, spread out throughout the day.  And so, I would venture to say that I can use it without the need to charge for about 8-12 hours of \"constant\" usage.  This is beyond what I expected when purchasing the tablet.  And that means I am really happy!The headphone jack allows for headphones, and the quality through that is pretty good.  I have not played a ton of music, so I cannot really talk too much about good or bad.  But it seems at least comparable to listening to music through my phone or laptop on headphones.  There is also a speaker, which is admittedly not amazing.  I mean, there isn't a tone of space for high quality speakers inside.  But it is not awful by any means, either.  In addition to the listening capabilities, the microphone appears to be pretty decent also.  I played 5 different songs (two of which were Chinese songs - from China, which Mandarin Chinese lyrics) with Shazam, and Shazam got all the songs correct within 5-20 seconds of listening.  There was not a huge amount of background noise, but the microphone picked up these songs well enough for Shazam to work flawlessly, so I have to assume that it is of at least moderate quality.OVERALL CONCLUSION:  No regrets after almost 2 weeks of owning the Transformer Prime (TF201).  It is a little expensive, but the quality and it's ability to take whatever I throw at it shows that it is worth the extra money over most other options.  If you are in the market for a good tablet, at about the average high-end tablet price, then the TF201 is highly recommended!", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Prime is great", "Author": "Eftyking \"Eftyking\"", "ReviewID": "R3PL7MNGJDH4TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess I feel lucky considering some people seem to be getting lemons.

They arrived and were all that I'd hoped they would be for ~1 month until I tried to dock the tablet to the keyboard today and it wouldn't go all of the way down into the keyboard. Closer examination revealed that one of the screws had come out of the keyboard and was rattling around loose in the clam shell.I figured that I would just pull the clamshell apart and put the screw back in with some of the blue lock tight as that looked like what the factory had done (admittedly not well given that it had come out on me) initially. I got looking at the tablet though, and there must have been a period of time where the screw was loose and rubbing up against the gorilla glass because I've got a circular scratch in the glass.It's a minor point, but my view is that the problem is completely the fault of ASUS.  It's a combination of the keyboard being improperly assembled, and a design that could have been better. Hindsight is 20/20, but they probably should have put a plastic facing over the screws so the if one came up like that it would push the plastic into the channel and stop the tablet from getting down far enough to get scratched up.ASUS support was spectacularly disappointing. I use my Prime every day as a laptop replacement and will be traveling over the next little while, so I asked them to ship me out another tablet and keyboard so that I could continue working, and I'd ship them my original as soon as I had the replacement model.The rep said that they wouldn't do anything because the tablet hadn't been functionally impacted. I pointed out that the docking station at this point had been functionally compromised, and said that while the tablet hadn't been functionally compromised, the glass had been scratched up through an error on the part of the factory in the assembly of the keyboard.He said that they wouldn't do any kind of hot swap to allow me to continue to work with my Prime, but that he could arrange for a shipment of my gear back to a repair center where it could be evaluated, but 'if the damage was judged to be user error' that the warranty wouldn't cover it.I told him I didn't think that was reasonable, but that I can't go without my Prime for the time required to ship it back and forth, so I'd just fix the keyboard myself as I originally intended, and then I'd leave a negative review around the quality of their support and the poor build quality on the keyboard.Pretty disappointed all in all with the overall experience.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "funkyshoes", "ReviewID": "R2OOB4NZ7CIEIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I ordered this tablet from Amazon but it was going to take maybe 3wks to a month to get here, and frankly I don't have that kind of patience.

I was very apprehensive because of all the mixed reviews about the wifi and the fragmentation, the tablet just shutting down all together etc etc. Since I've only had the tablet a whole 3 days there's not much I can say on other consumers issues; but what I can say is WOW!

I actually purchased mine from Gamestop because it was a package deal that included 5 games and a gamepad, but thought I would review here because I purchased accesories from Amazon...It is a huge fingerprint magnet, but my recent purchase of the Skinomi screen protector (dock compatible) has solved that issue.

Trust me when I say it wasn't easy but it was worth the trouble. This tablet is by far the most advanced and fastest tablet on the market (IOS or Android). That doesn't mean it's perfect because no tech product is. Those out there looking for a device that never has bugs or issues might as well stop now because you'll never find something to your liking. What I can say is that ASUS did a fine job with putting this together. I won't touch on every aspect of the Transformer Prime but here are some highlights:Screen- This screen is bright and beautiful. You can set the Super IPS display if you're outdoors but otherwise, the regular brightness is perfectly fine. The resolution is the same as most 10.1 inch tablets and is crisp and clear.Speed- This tablet has a Tegra 3 quad-core processor and it is blazing. You can multi-task to your hearts delight and it won't skip a beat. It opens applications faster than any phone or tablet I can think of. The encouraging news is that they are still really developing apps for the Tegra 3 so when that becomes more relevant this thing will be even better. Scrolling and touch sensitivity is \"buttery\" smooth with no lag whatsoever.Build- This is a very aesthetically pleasing device. What I mean is that it is an eye-catcher. Brushed aluminum backing and super thin, it looks fantastic. It's light and the weight balance is perfect when holding with one hand or two. Gorilla glass screen means that you won't have to worry about scratches. Those out there that complain about fingerprints need to realize that this is the case for 99% of tablets out there. (HINT: use the microfiber cloth that comes with it)Storage and Connectivity- One of the biggest selling points was the storage space. 32gb of onboard memory PLUS it has a micro-sd card slot for expansion. This thing can become an entertainment powerhouse.  It has a micro-hdmi out so you can connect to TVs or projectors. This means you can watch Netflix and other movies on a bigger screen if you'd prefer. You won't have to buy a proprietary cables just to connect. Of course, the big sell is the laptop dock accessory. I personally don't need it but its a great option if you want a netbook like experience. Oh yeah, you can also use PS3 or USB gaming controllers with this to play games!Battery Life- So I haven't done an \"official\" battery test but in my usage so far I easily get a couple days out of this tablet. It obviously depends on what the settings are (i.e. screen brightness, power mode) but trust me when I say that if you go on a long trip with this thing you'll be good to go with juice to spare.Ice Cream Sandwich- This may not matter in a month or two but it is currently one of a select few devices that has the latest operating system of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich. I won't get into all the details of what ICS is but I can say that it is user friendly and has loads of potential.Side notes:Ok, so a lot of people may have heard about certain users having issues with WIFI and/or GPS. On my end, I haven't had a single issue with WIFI. The signal is always strong even at a good distance away from the router. I think this just may be an isolated issue with some of the devices. I don't think this is indicative of all the tablets. I haven't used the GPS much but I can guess that the all-aluminum backing has something to do with the issues its having catching signals from satellites. Honestly though, it's ridiculous to use this as a standalone GPS device.As a heads-up, this tablet is currently (as of 2/21) extremely hard to come by. It is sold out at most, if not all retailers. I'm sure ASUS will eventually be able to keep up with demand but be warned that you may not be able to get one for a while. This obviously is a result of the shortsightedness of ASUS and should bear no negative reflection on the tablet itself.The Verdict:So is this worth $499.99 of your hard earned money?

It worked well enough for that but did have quite a few issues even doing just that, which was the primary reason for me to buy a tablet. There were 2 main issues that plagued me with this tablet.1) It would shut off sometimes randomly. This led to a large file transfer failing at some unknown time during the night. You see, we would shoot pics all day in Hawaii or wherever we were and then at night I'd pop the SD card in, start up my ftp software and transfer all files from that day. Some nights it would transfer them all with no problems but some nights it would randomly reboot leading to frustration that our nightly backup did not run.2)Wi-Fi reception. My Wi-Fi reception at home was great so I didn't notice anything when I first bought this tablet. I did see many other complaints about it so I was a bit concerned but had no real way to test. Well, eventually I found myself in a hotel room in Utah trying to use the hotel wi-fi and, of course, that is when I realized just how bad it was if you weren't close to the router. Despite my phone getting a full signal, the TF-201 just would not connect and if it did it was only if I stood at the friggin' doorway to the room. It was basically a paper weight on that trip with the exception of the music and movies I had on it. But no web browsing or checking email from it or using the keyboard to type on it, which is why I brought it versus just using my phone.I was able to live with most of this though and trudged along until Asus released the last update. That was when this became a brick to me as far as I was concerned. Ever since that last update the tablet has been sloooow and just plain crappy to use. I could have gone to the trouble of reinstalling everything or going to a custom rom or something but enough already. Time to look elsewhere for me!So as of this writing I have taken advantage of Amazon's trade-in program and I have never looked back. Thanks Amazon for bailing me out of this one!Changed my stars down to 2. Asus really should have done something for owners of this tablet between the GPS and the wi-fi issues. I did get a free GPS dongle. Sold it on ebay for $10. I also got $17 from a class action lawsuit. $27 towards a new tablet and NOT another product from Asus ever again.

My wife has an Ipad and I've used it to but not much. It works the same as an ipod touch so this all relates. Using an itouch, if you will, at least without an app you can't hide apps, edit music or video files, have flash support for webpages or just browse files. All of which you can do with my Android operated ASUS Transformer! It's little things like that that make me love this thing. What else do I love? Um...the resolution. Having a Tegre 3 processor, you can watch some very high definition movies on it. I have a bluray ripped Avatar movie that looks so damn clear I swear it looks like bluray on my tablet.

NOW! for my most beloved feature/ability of this thing. The ability to download and play SNES, N64 and Playstation games through emulators available on the Android Market aka Google Play. I don't know about getting roms from the apps because I've always had the roms on my hard drive but the emulators all work well with a controller.

It made a very good first impression on me - Just loved it's sleek design and smooth ICS UI ! The speaker failed to impress me though.There seems to be only 1 so it's mono sound. It's also towards one side of the tablet which makes it sound even horrible. Moreover the volume is too low too. Though if that was the only problem I'd still rate this tablet 4/5. However there's more annoyance that comes with this tablet. Since the speaker sound is low I recently tried using a bluetooth headset with it. With the bluetooth headset connected the internet speed falls drastically - in my case from a good 10mpbs to 1.5mbps (measured using Speedtest.net). I can then barely stream good quality videos, Netflix streams constantly stop and go into \"buffering\". Same is true about Youtube. As soon as I disconnect my bluetooth headset the speed is back.I can also not use my bluetooth headset for any kind of communication. Both in GTalk and Skype no audio can be heard on the headset. Gtalk gives you an option where you can use bluetooth for communication, but if you do, nothing is audible at all. And Skype audio just skips the headset and comes through the speaker. So basically the speaker volume is low and you can't even use a bluetooth headset so if say the surroundings are even slightly noisy (say a running fan) you feel pretty helpless. This is a major drawback as far as communication using this device goes. I will thus give it a well deserved 1/5. It's got potential to be a great device but this major communication related drawback badly kills it.Oh and the Netflix App is horrible to scroll .. it's like a rusted wheel. Putting the device in performance mode barely helps it. Not rating the device on this point though, just saying.PS: I'm running the latest firmware as of today - 9.4.2.15, with Android 4.0.3 (that's ICS)", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Transfer998", "ReviewID": "R1H48JTS4QU97P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off if you want to buy one DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 499.99 for 32Gb.

If you go on ASUS's store and look at the accessories that will give you the max you should pay for them.  Anyways, this tablet is top of the line end of story. The quad core Tegra 3 gives great performance and great battery life.  The tablet can output thru the micro-HDMI port full 1080p and 3D for certain games, tested the 3D on my friends TV and no hiccups or performance issues.  The screen is amazing also the IPS+ will be great for those summer days when im working on my projects outside, I have done some rough simulations indoors but I cant wait to see how it does in the noon sun of the Midwest.  Size wise it is thin and light, physically thinner and lighter than the iPad 2 but trust me you wont notice. The camera's are good don't expect professional quality but they can hold there own with any tablet on the market.  The battery life is great I squeezed out 16 hrs today (no WiFi, Bluetooth, no back-light and on power saver mode) but on the average i get 11-13 hrs, about 7-8 hrs when im playing games that use the full potential of the Nvidia Tegra 3.

Honestly I don't need a 1080p display on my tablet a) all my stuff on my computer is 720p which works fine with the Prime's display b) you're not going to notice much difference on a 10.1\" display other than 1080p files are going to be larger and c) its 100$ more.Overall great product. the only con i have about it is that amazon(us) didn't sell it, only amazon Canada did, and no I am not going to count the people or companies selling the prime thru amazon since they are not ASUS registered sellers.Update 1 year later with JB (4.1 waiting on 4.2):still the best tablet on the market in my opinion sure you don't have the stylus oops I mean S-pen as the notes but the killer feature is its keyboard dock, I average about 18-20 hrs running videos and over 20 doing simple tasks. the only down side is its wifi but its not as bad as people make it out to be.  Sure its not as sensitive as the newer ones but really there's not much difference, all the area's that are dead with my prime is dead with my friends infinity and speeds are comparable ~2%. ASUS has really worked hard on making the wifi and the GPS better and they have improved greatly since day 1.  Overall performance is still great even tho there are newer and shinier tablets, but the tegra 3 is showing its age with the tegra 4 coming soon, can you say xbox 360/PS3 graphics on a tablet?  finally I have read people complaining that the graphics look no different than on their phone, all I have to say is look for games labeled \"THD\" (tegra HD) they bring out the most of a tegra device, standard games like \"where's my perry\" or \"shadowgun\" are designed for all android systems but \"ShadowGun THD\" is going to be better since it was developed with the tegra in mind.  Just because you put an ps1 game in a ps3, doesnet make the game have ps3 graphics and physics, same applies for apps.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great ICS Tablet; Incredible

It refused to power up or show any signs of life whatsoever. After spending many hundreds for all its peripheral items, I was far less than impressed. In its defense, I bought a refurbished model that I guess was never reconditioned properly I hope.

It was completely dead. I plugged it in and within a few minutes it started up.I must of gotten a newer one since it already had ICS 4.0 when i checked.There were a few setup steps but it recognized the wi-fi with no issues. big reliefThe only SMALL issue i had was with setting of the time.  I configured it to automatically to set the time based on my location but the system didn't know that until I powered it completely off and turned it back on.other than that one little issue its been a dream to use.I used it the first day with about only 50% charge the whole time while it was charging.  I let it charge over night and started using it in \"power\" mode and after 3 hours of emails/surfing and downloading magazines/books its at ~90% charge... all i need is it too last 8 hours.  I also can get more out if it by putting it in power saving mode - which activates the 5th hidden cpu core.while in power mode i didn't get any crashes or notice it getting warm.its very crisp and fast... I don't notice it being obviously faster or sharper image than an iPad 1 or 2 ... maybe you can tell if you hyper analyze the two screens in a side by side comparison.  Technically its got less pixels than a iPad 3 ... but the gpus play a big part in making a movies seem crisp. i noticed that going from iPad 1 to 2.The prime has 12 gpus while the iPad 3 only has 4.  Asus needs to advertise that fact better. the prime also lets you choose power consumptions modes.. its sort of like a hybrid car.  there a \"Power\", \"Balanced\" and \"eco\" modes that effect the battery use.Our family had 3 iPads before i got this one. my daughter has the original iPad(64 gb)  and my wife and i had ipad2s. I gave my iPad(16gb) to our parents so we can FaceTime with them easier. it also let me have a reason to get the prime. I was constantly running out of space on my 16 gb iPad that won't happen for a while on my Prime with its expandable memory.if u want a device \"just to use\" just get a iPad... if you want to tinker get a prime. I have two CS degrees so I obviously fall into the latter category. :)From a usability POV different android applications do everything slightly different enough to make the experience not as perfectly smooth as using an iPad... but thats the sort of thing that makes apple so much better at appealing to grand parents and non-techies. I've had two other android phones an the UI drove me nuts to the point I sold the samsung galaxy s2 for a iPhone 4s... but a phone is something I use primarily for very frequent brief activities like making a call or quickly checking emails so the little hiccups with the ui annoyed me more.  With a tablet i tend to use it less frequently but for each instance for longer periods so the little ui discrepancies bother me less.overall its a phenomenal tablet! between the hardware and ice cream sandwich this tablet is the first one that made me turn my back  on the iPad.for 32 gb its actually $50 cheaper than the 32 gb equivalent iPad PLUS you can expand it by 64 gb for about $99 for the price of a micro sd card... which I'm sure in 6 months will be half of that :) while apple 64 gb will still be $700!Get it if you can... if it doesn't work Amazon will let you return it, so your covered that way", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent tablet, GPS dongle has issues", "Author": "Tiago Pereira", "ReviewID": "R8Y2NG2GAYQJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet, so I don't have much to compare. I have played with it for more than a week and got the new GPS dongle today from Asus (Fedex'ed from Sunnyvale, CA, surprisingly quick!).In terms of the tablet, it is responsive and seems to work reliably. Mine is a 'C3' serial number and came with ICS pre-installed. There was an issue with the Netflix app that kept crashing. Upgrading would not work in the tablet, but going to <...> on my laptop I could reinstall and the issue was fine. I don't use many of the pre-installed apps, although I was negatively surprised that the google voice does not allow one to make calls directly from the tablet. Instead, you can only connect calls to gmail (on a computer?) or to your phone(s). Reinstalled to no avail. Not sure if this is a limitation imposed by Asus or Google, given that it works on android phones.The HDMI out works ok. When connected to an external monitor, it assumes that it also takes sound and mutes the internal speakers. Because my monitor doesn't have speakers, I would like to hear the sound from the tablet, but it doesn't seem possible. It also only seems to output 720p unless you are playing a 1080p movie, which is annoying if you want to work on a 1080p monitor. But I guess all of these are limitations of Android, and not necessarily this tablet.After reading the reviews, I was concerned with the wifi performance. Did some tests at home and was really worried. My room is about 20 m (60 ft) away from the router, and the download speeds I was getting were about 5 times slower than at the router. My laptop in the room worked almost the same. And not only the speed, but the latency was also affected. Sometimes connectivity was very poor, and I believe I was getting some packet loss. I was almost at the point of returning the tablet, until I decided to change my wifi channel. Turns out I was on channel 1, a popular choice in the neighbourhood. Changing to another channel (8) seemed to work wonders. I have repeated the test a few times, and here are the pseudo-scientific numbers:* At the router: ping 36 ms; Dl 22708 kbps; Ul 6408 kbps (4 bars)* One room away (1 thin wall, about 7 m): ping 23 ms; Dl 16075 kbps; Ul 6901 kbps (3 bars)* Two rooms away (2 thin walls, about 20 m): ping 26 ms; Dl 13507 kbps; Ul 6348 kbps (3/2 bars)* Three rooms away (3 thin walls, about 24 m): ping 25 ms; Dl 14598 kbps; Ul 6600 kbps (2 bars)For reference, with my laptop at two rooms away I got: ping 22 ms; Dl 14684 kbps; Ul 6348 kbps (all bars).So it seems that this tablet has good wifi capabilities but is very sensitive to wifi interference on the same channel. Unfortunately this is not something one can control when on the go, but for home use or in places without many networks it should work fine.Now, about the GPS dongle. Received it today, and seems to work very well indoors (did not check outdoors). I can immediately connect to more than twice as many satellites, and it is much faster. Unfortunately, leaving the dongle on causes the tablet to reboot. While I had it on navigation there were no issues, but when I left it on and the screen went to sleep, a few seconds later it was rebooting. First time it was strange, so I repeated the procedure and it does it every time. I have caused it to reboot three times this way just to check. Hopefully Asus can fix this in a software update, otherwise I will come back here and take one star from the review.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great aside from WiFi issues", "Author": "Devin", "ReviewID": "R3T7VBJBO0ITH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, like many others, I had WiFi issues with this device.

I ended up replacing our old Linksys WRT160N v3 with an Asus RT-N56U and now the Transformer Prime stays connected without issues.  Now that the WiFi issues are fixed, I don't have any complaints about the tablet.  The interface is extremely responsive and games are smooth.The only complaints I have are in regards to Asus support. First, they aren't very responsive.  The online ticket system states that they will respond within 48 hours of submitting a ticket.  It took them 2 weeks to get back to me, and then they just said to put in an RMA request as this may be a hardware issue.  I put in the RMA request, and that was approved in about a week. After shipping the tablet to Asus, I received no confirmation that it was ever received or an ETA for when it would be finished. Even so, the device was fixed in about a week and a half, and I received notification that the tablet was being shipped back to me.

All reviews praised about how fast this is.  But I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed.  Once in a while, the browser would hesitate and even pop up asking me whether I want to kill it or wait.The 2-finger pinch/zoom is too sensitive and it often over zooms it.  My HTC android phone has a better browser pinch/zoom than this.  Also, the browser on my HTC seems to have better auto-size capability than the browser on the Prime.I am a bit baffled as why some common 2-finger gestures do not work in the browser.  e.g. 2-finger swipe left/right to back/forward web pages, which are quite common on Acer or Asus laptops' touchpads.The keyboard dock is solid, well-built, and it integrates well with tablet.  Keys are fine but I find myself missing the right \"Shift\" key often.  So far, the only 2-finger gesture is just scrolling web pages on touchpad.  Again, my Acer and Asus laptops' touchpads could do a lot more by default.Overall, it's an excellent product.  I just feel I was disappointed on a few areas.  Perhaps, due to my own unfamiliarity with the product at this point.  Will provide updates later if I feel any different.==============UPDATE================================================Today, I suddenly noticed the face panel of tablet is slightly warped on the left edge (where the volume control is).  When running my finger across the panel, I could feel the \"curvature\".  If looking closely, I could see a gap between the face panel and the casing.  The length of the gap is about 1.5 inches.  I am taking another star off the rating.  Good thing is that I could still return this tablet with such defect back to Amazon for a full refund.The reason I am returning instead of getting a replacement is that, as much as I want a tablet, I find myself tired of holding the tablet when using it.  I want to put it into its keyboard dock most of the time.  However, the keyboard is just too small for extensive typing and the touch pad on the dock isn't really that good.  Therefore, I ended up wanting to use my Acer S3 Ultrabook instead because of its larger screen and excellent touch pad.So, I have been asking myself a hard question this week: Do I really need a $650 tablet & dock if I use it like a netbook most of the time???The finding of the warped face panel finally made me face the reality: I do NOT need a tablet because of my usage pattern.  A thin, light-weight, and instant-on Ultrabook can best meet my needs.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flawless, does all I need and more", "Author": "Don Alan Uhrig", "ReviewID": "R1GAWLRLKBXR6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I could, I will not be writing a long technical review. Others have done that, and I have read all the pros and cons.Short story: The Asus Transformer Prime has been in my hands for two weeks now and has performed flawlessly. Not a single program has crashed. I have not had any forced closures. I have not had to reboot my tablet. (Makes me wonder what these other people are doing.)The tablet is beautiful and perfect. I like how easy it is to get to settings when, for example, I need to add a wi-fi location. One or two taps is all it takes to get to the most frequently used settings or applications.The tablet runs nearly every app that I had on my Android phone. What doesn't run is accessable via web browser - and actually using my banking in the web browser gives me access to ALL features whereas the bank app did not.One concern some might have with a tablet is some things only work when you are connected to the internet. I have no concerns about wi-fi access, because my android phone can be turned into a hotspot (yes, slower than broadband, but it does work).Only once have I run the battery down to 20% and that was during my longest day on my college campus - Thursdays - and I was showing off the screen by running in Super ISP mode quite a bit, and watched a movie. I actually didn't realize the 20% till I got home.

My first impressions when it arrived was that there were a few minor scuffs on it.  Not a huge deal but I expect like new to look \"like new.\"  To me, there's no wiggle room in making that claim.  \"good\" or \"very good\" are another story...But anyway I felt it was just good enough to keep so our adventure began... with a thud.  After the first couple hours I was honestly going to send it back.  The screen went fuzzy and I had to restart it, there were several hang ups and freezes, The Wi-Fi reception was terrible if at all.  The next day after several updates it started working much much better, no more freezes or screen problems, the Wi-Fi while still not great, didn't go below 2 bars even with the router in the basement of my Brick Ranch House and me being upstairs as far away as I could get.  It just kept getting better over the coming days.  I installed about a hundred free apps from the Playstore and most worked great no matter how graphicly demanding the game was.  And with 32GB of built in memory you can hold alot of em.  I added a 32GB micro SD card so I could easily put 720p HD shows and movies on it and watch them on the Asus Prime.  They play seamlessly and look great on the screen.Several days ago the Jellybean update came available to my Prime, I downloaded it and to my surprise, its running even better yet.  I usually get 3 bars of reception in the house and it seems faster and snapier yet.Pro's:  Fast Quad-Core processor with Tegra 3 graphics chip.  Great Graphics and better Tegra 3 apps are yet to come.  Super IPS LCD display.  This thing gets really bright and vibrant.  Best screen I've seen on any tablet.  32GB of built in memory, holds alot of stuff!  And another 32GB can be added with the micro SD card slot for cheap (under $20).  Has HDMI, and looks very good using your HDTV as a monitor, full 1080p output.  Gorilla Glass, that's very tough stuff for a screen.  My Droid Bionic has it and hasn't scatched yet after a year of constant use with no screen protector on it. 1080p rear facing camcorder with 8MP Digital Camera.  Takes some really good natural looking pictures and video.  Does decent in low-light.  Not the best HD I've ever seen, but very decent.  Some of the newer tablets are ditching the rear camera and that's a shame.  It's nice to take some video and watch it right there on the 10.1 inch display for all to see.  Has a 1.2MP Front Facing camera,  Works surprizingly well.  Shoots video at 480p and is perfect for skype.  Has a metal body, you just don't see that kind of quality much these days.Long Long Battery Life! and lasts longer if you turn it down to single or duel core mode.  Touch Screen is perfect! Totally responsive but not overly sensitive, just right.  Full access to Android App Store.Cons:  1280x800 screen, looks great in my opinion but may turn off some looking for 1080 or 1200p displays.Metal Body, on this one, its blessing is also its curse.  Some say the metal body makes the GPS unfunctional and hurts its WiFi reception.  My WiFi seems fine but I can't speak of the GPS, I don't use it on this device and could care less if it works or not, but if GPS is important to you, it might be wise to look elsewhere.  The rear camera has the most Un-wide angle lens I've ever seen on any recording device.  Wow, how did Asus achieve such a narrow field of view?  I'm not sure?  You could of done better on that one guys...  The speaker.  Really bad and tinny sounding.  It's a single speaker, not duel, so it sounds even worse then most.  Bad sound aside, you also you can't turn it up very loud.  There are free apps available that allow you to turn the sound up louder, get one.  Also  plan on adding a portable plug and play speaker, I did. I bought a Logitech Tablet Sound Bar due to the affordable price and the fact my Logitech laptop soundbar worked so well.  However I don't recommend the Tablet version, better sound then the built in speaker but doesn't get loud enough.  If you know of a better option then go with it.So that's my review of the ASUS Transformer Prime.

The Asus speaker is adequate and I bought the Altec Lansing Orbit mini speaker that plugs into the headphone jack and delivers unbelievable sound-- great for traveling. That said, I still prefer the Asus Prime, with a mini sd slot and more flexibility than the more proprietary Apple.

It immediately updated to Android ICS, and it worked very well... As long as I was within a few unobstructed feet of the wireless router and had bluetooth turned off.  If I am about 30 feet of the browser with a closed door, it would lose the connection.  If I turned on and used bluetooth for a wireless headset, it would lose the wifi connection.  My cellphones and computers and computers got strong signals in these same conditions, even further away from the router.

This means that you'll have to send your Prime to Asus for the fix.[...]The last few pages in the link speaks to using POGO pin connections instead of soldering them as with the Transformer 101, and that some people have said that pressing on the back of the prime can make your wifi connection either improve or get worse.  This site may explain why this can happen, which speaks to an overall great design but poor build quality and quality control, and specifically about finding yellow tape covering all of the connections.[...]I had decided that, after the connectivity problems had been worked out, I would seriously consider buying it again, but the build quality of the Prime is making me question that decision.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really pleased", "Author": "Justin D. Turner", "ReviewID": "R2IF74OPE6VXNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been considering purchasing a tablet since the original transformer was announced last Spring.  I am glad I waited for the Prime, as I feel it is something powerful enough to grow with me in the years ahead.Pros:- The biggest advantage of the prime is the option to add the keyboard.  It really adds a level of versatility that is currently not matched by anything on the market.  Feel like just browsing around the web or checking email?  Use it as a tablet.  Need to write longer emails or documents?  Attach the keyboard and you have a laptop that is considerably lighter than any laptop I've used.- Battery life is really impressive.  I've been blown away.  It lasts for days.  As in, I charge it Monday and it still has a charge on Friday.  To get these results, I'm obviously not using it constantly, but for my nightly email and blog reading, it's great.  The keyboard has it's own battery that charges the Prime when attached.  Together, the Prime lasts about 16 hours which is 6 hours longer than any tablet available.- The screen is very sharp, and the ability to turn the IPS mode on and off (and with just two taps) makes it that much more easy to use.- The Tegra 3 processor really hums.  I have played a few games and it has no problem keeping up.  Also, I am able to browse with more tabs opened in my browser than I can on my netbook.- Android ICS Operating System is a great user experience.  I love all of the flexibility Android allows, and firmly believe it's the best mobile operating system right now.  As a gmail user, I absolutely love the built in Gmail app which is better than either the web page or what's available on non-Android tablets.- Great support from Asus.  Early on, some units were having stability issues.  Mine was one of them.  Asus was on help forums reaching out to customers, letting them know they were working on a fix.  I'm happy to say that after 2 weeks, my Prime received an OS update and I haven't had any problems since.Cons:- The only real con is the GPS issue.  Many units don't have a functioning GPS.  I don't even know if mine is one, because since it's WiFi only, I have really no use for GPS.  But it's a real issue, acknowledged by Asus, and if GPS is important to you, I would wait until the new Transformer TF701 or 300 come out in the second quarter, if you want a keyboard, or get something else in the mean time.- Supply chain problems also left me waiting a month after my order for mine to arrive.  Not the end of the world, but it's hard to get excited about a product when if you brag to your friends about it, they can't even go get it because it's so hard to find.- The speakers are kinda meh.  There really should be two for stereo.  But really, how often am I using the speakers on a tablet anyway?  On planes, trains, etc, I use headphones, but it's worth mentioning if it's a feature that's important to you.Overall, I think the Prime is a really impressive product.  As a tablet, it allows me to check gmail, read blogs from my reader, and the Washington Post from Press Reader (pre-installed, and really nice) in a great, light, portable form factor.  Add on the keyboard, and now it's a light weight laptop that allows me to review and edit photos on my SD card.

I am a traditional Windows user, but the leap to Droid wasn't that big of a leap at all.I am preparing this review on my tablet.I have also read many reviews saying there aren't many Apps for this tablet, from what i have found, there are thousands.In closing I like the new ICS operating system and like the tablet overall.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "love the heck out of my new asus t prime!!!", "Author": "Alan McGaughey", "ReviewID": "R5XLGPWC919C5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been waiting for months to find one of these. I lucked out and found one locally. I read all the hype, and was looking for a mind blowing piece of hardware. Well, the Prime is everything I hoped it would be, and more.

Four performance cores and companion core which takes care of a lot of the system overhead.The display is super crisp and clear, displaying stunning, extremely smooth and fast graphics. Water physics is unbelievably lifelike on the Prime.Super thin and very light.Yes, it has one External speaker, but the sound is very good and if I want louder, I use earplugs.Plenty of apps, games are wonderful on this beast. I also installed Ice Cream Sandwich with no probs.I have had no problems with GPS or wifi.

I had no fear of shipping damage after I held the box in my hands. Inside was 10.1 inches of widescreen gadget glory, and a few accessories, (Charger, USB cable, microfiber cloth, manual)Tablet was heavier than I imagined, but had a GREAT feel to it. Mind-blowingly thin. The back of the device has a nice matte feel due to the anodized brushed aluminum surface. It is a pleasure to hold in both hands, and absolutely is nice to look at. It is a little bit heavy when holding with just one hand, but that is to be expected with 10.1 inch tablets. The edges are a little sharp, not annoyingly so, but definitely noticable. The finish on the back is a very dark grayish-purple. Yes, purple, but not immasculine. Its a great color for the device, absolutely no complaints on style.Screen:This thing is gorgeous. The pixel density is just right for this size device, and reading web pages is an easy process. The contrast is fantastic for an LCD, and the colors absolutely pop. I'm no display expert, but I know for certain this is the best display I have ever seen on a tablet, smartphone, netbook, and 99% of laptops. It can get obscenely bright in \"Super IPS\" mode, which is great for using outdoors, which was once no-mans-land for LCD displays.UI/SoftwareIt is running Android 3.2.1 Honeycomb. Just that sentence alone will give you some insight on the UI's look and feel and responsiveness. I like the look and layout of Honeycomb, but the optimization and snappyness is subpar. Of course I will attribute this purely to the sluggish mess that is Android Honeycomb, and not to the blazing fast quad-core monster inside of the deivce. The included Asus UI is great, I have no complaints about any of the menu layouts or widgets etc, in fact, it is very nice to look at. Props to Asus for making a smart, sensible UI layer that anyone can use. The included cloud storage, \"Webshare\" or something of the sort is nice to have, but I will probably stick to dropbox for my cloud storage. Asus includes remote desktop software that works flawlessly, and a DLNA streaming app that I find intuitive and well executed.Honestly, any software problems or sluggishness will be addressed with ICS on January 12th, so I am not worried about it for now.Hardware/performanceHoly crap.This machine is fast. It absolutely slaughters every other device in EVERY benchmark. Well done, NVIDIA, this Tegra 3 chip is a phenom. The performance is most apparent in gaming, when all four cores are working to their full potential. Games have that extra layer of realism that really makes the difference between mobile gaming, and real, console quality stuff.One spec I did not realize was included in this machine is the ability to play games in real, stereoscopic 3d when connected to a 3DTV. I played Riptide GP in 3d, and Shadowgun in 3d as well on my 50 inch samsung plasma, and I was floored! Definitely a huge statement to the performance of this machine. Well done, everyone.Really no more needs to be said about this device's performance other than \"its fast. really fast.\"CameraCameras on tablets look ridiculous. This is true with any tablet. One cannot pull out a 10.1 tab and casually snap a few shots. The whole thing is a rather hilarious affair. Otherwise, the Cameras on the TF201 are absolutely top notch. Video is clear and smooth in 1080p, and still shots look better than my point'n'shoot. The webcam works great for skype. Good work team.Video playbackFlawless with MX Video Player. 1080p30 on a 50 inch plasma is fantastic. No complaints, and no more needs to be said. It just works.And now for the bad.The GPS issue is a well documented problem. There are ons of explanations for why the GPS is not as accurate as one would hope. Basically, Asus missed a key design point here. The aluminum construction blocks radio waves in a big way. It is a simple fix that could have been prevented by Asus when designing the thing.Wifi performance is also affected, though less noticably. The range is not as good as my thinkpad's. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a rather glaring oversight.EDIT: (Lighthearted sarcasm alert)Who uses a tablet without 3G for GPS anyways? I mean cmon guys. Its a wifi tablet. Using this as a nav system in my car would give me a good chuckle, and really nothing else.Ignore the one-star whiners that don't even own the thing.

Then a few months later another friend showed me her new iPad2 and I started looking again.

I ordered the device through amazon and it was delivered within one day with free shipping (nicely done Amazon)!!!  When I started using the device I started noticing minor problems with WiFi connectivity and connection speeds.  When I was next to my wireless router, the connections were good as expected (16Mbps give or take).  When I moved one room away in the house I would get a speed of about 8Mbps.  When I moved even further away in my house the speeds would plunge down to about 300Kbps.  Just for comparison, my smart phone and laptop don't suffer these slowdowns while connected to my Wireless N router anywhere in the house. I was hoping that some software updates promised from ASUS would fix this unacceptable WiFi behavior within my product return window but alas this did not to happen.  When I started using some applications which make use of GPS, I noticed how badly the GPS data reception was on this device.  When outside I could weakly detect several satilites after waiting many minutes.  And even after all of this time it was unable to get better positioning accuracy than about 75ft.  This was evident when using google maps with GPS enabled - The map was centered over my neighbors house across the street.  No updates that ASUS furnished resolved this problem.  These were the problems that finally drove me to return the device since it is unsuitable for my use.I should also mention that the rest of the tablet features (32GB storage,microSD,keyboard dock,CPU/GPU performance) were really great.

I did all of this wilh the standard Android Honeycomb 3.2 that came on it before running the update to ICS that I was prompted to install.

I use my droid with car dock for GPS if I need it and will not use this for that purpose.

I have to say that they seem to have done a great job with the Tablet. Ok ok they have charged me 28 euros for the connector, but the screen (white spots issue) was fixed within the warranty. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the customer service. Although the online status of the repair was a dreadful experience, the ASUS representative that contact me initially with the status of the RMA was very helpful by email and I had a prompt response. After receiving the tablet fixed and working properly (like new) I would give 4 stars for the customer service. Considering my initial 2 stars for the table I will raise my review to 3 stars, hoping that my tablet will last long enough.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "asus tf-201", "Author": "Timothy Harrington", "ReviewID": "R124HIM7225P52", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got tablet and everything was fine.

I'm just pointing out some flaws of most tablets for those that may not know what they're getting themselves into.It's one of the better tablets out there but tablets are still a novelty item.  They have their uses but they definitely aren't notebook replacements and have a place where you don't want to wield a notebook.  Overall it's a good addition to my device collection but my Dell Inspiron Duo provides a better \"real web\" experience because it has a real desktop OS.  The color doesn't look gray to me but what a champagne would look like.  I've never seen a champagne in person and I've verified the model numbers in store as well and they say gray.I've used the Android OS since the HTC G1 came out and have every major version up through 4.x.  Once mobile Flash was finally introduced, pocket web browsing became a much better experience.  The worst thing about stock Android is they never fixed their e-mail client (no, I don't use their gmail and use an ISP) and it still has the same basic problems since the beginning.  They obviously don't care since they want you to use gmail.The apple crowd have it worse with the lack of flash support but everyone hates being redirected to a mobile site when they've paid good money on a capable machine.  Changing the UserAgent usually doesn't work much these days.  Some sites provide you the option to go to the full site but many don't.  And some sites want you to download a stupid application for a web site.  Hmmm, I just want one web browser for every web site I visit, not an application for every web site I would visit.  I don't need the appcrap kind sir.  The googletv falls into this category as well.I also don't enjoying going to YouTube and getting a notification that the video is not allowed to play on my mobile device.  It's bad enough we get notifications that the video isn't allowed in your country.  Some streaming web sites will also give you the 'no mobile devices allowed'.And the applications.  Everything I ever downloaded for the Android platform has been free and I like it that way.  Maybe I deserve what I get for not paying for the full version but I'm sure that's not the case.  One size does not fit all...installer beware.  Because of the splintering between manufacturers and wireless carries (talking versions) on all these mobile devices, not everything works the way it should or even at all.  The same goes for OS updates.  If you're on a telephone then you're pretty much at the mercy of your wireless provider and what they determine the shelf life of your 3-6 month product.  Good luck getting updates up through your 2 year plan.  Tablets are another story if they're WiFi only models.  Good luck with the vendor.  At least Asus has been okay thus far but I'm sure we've seen the better days of updates.  What if Microsoft didn't provide you Windows Updates after owning your shiny new Packard Bell for 9 months?Oh how I hate virtual keyboards for anything more than inputting passwords....Complex passwords?  Fugetaboutit!!  I picked up the keyboard for this and it's a lifesaver for typing.  I'd like to see Microsoft Surface users enjoying their spreadsheets with a touchscreen.  I'm looking forward to the Surface platform because if it solves the issues I state above, so long Android.Life's Connected Rules:You shouldn't tote around any mobile telephone with a screen size larger than 4\".

The main reason that I selected the Prime was its expandability, compared to the iPad. The Prime starts with 32G, plus 32G microSD make expanding memory for movies and music a big plus. Then, add the keyboard and you have another SD card slot, and unlimited memory expansion via the USB 2.0 port.The main Con is that the network sensitivity is poor. My wireless access point is located several bedrooms away, and the performance is marginal; and sometimes will dropout entirely. My Dell laptop and desktop network adapters in the same location are almost full strength, and have no signal problems. Trying to watch Netflix is a bit irratating, due to network data freezes; and it seems to be getting worse.The other thing problem is the 'free' GPS dongle to address the GPS antenna problem. It significantly improved performance; but makes it so that you can't have the docking station or power supply plugged in at the same time. I tried using the pad and GPS dongle to navigate in my car, with very limited success. The Prime got noticeably warm, since the display has to be on constantly, and GPS performance was marginal (I lost signal if I laid the pad on the passenger seat.) The battery was about half drained after about 30 minutes. I have kind of given up on using for navigation purposes.Otherwise, the Prime's performance is pretty good. It locks up about once every 3 or 4 days, forcing a restart. Avoid the Prime, unless you plan to be in the same room as your wireless router. Overall, the Transformer is a really great idea, but unfortunately, the Prime has some engineering issues. Given that Prime problems have been addressed in the T300 and T700 models, stay away from the Prime T201. Now that the T700 is out, I wish that I would have waited. The Prime is destined to become extinct real soon.Updated Review 10/1/2012:ASUS issued an RMA for the weak WiFI performance, and I got the tablet back a few days ago. WiFi performance has improved, but still not stellar. Anyhow, I increased my rating for the tablet from 3 to 4 stars based on ASUS customer support for RMA. An ASUS representative actually contacted me due to my Amazon review and set-up the RMA, which included covering shipping back for repair. Repair was pretty painless, though I did miss my Prime while it was gone. I still would recommend a T700, but am throughly impressed by ASUS customer support.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "prime review", "Author": "David C.

I believe this is a serious design flaw that still has not been addressed even on the new infinity! the charging node is not protected and will loosen up with wear as well as the teeth are very brittle and delicate! my advice be very careful connecting your prime to your dock as well as your charging cord but my opinion is this problem is gonna happen to every prime owner in time! so there is my review truth be told i really liked my prime! but i had to send it back because you cant use what you cant charge!So good luck in the future with your prime everybody your gonna need it!", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS Transformer Prime Questionable", "Author": "Yan", "ReviewID": "R1705KQVGBJZW2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's been few weeks using this machine and not satisfied with it.

We bought this tablet in May 2012 and in July 2012 we were unable to use it. The device just all of a sudden stopped working. Of course we tried all the possible things, went online, red about what we could do if something like this occur....but non of the options helped. We tried holding the power button down for a longer period of time, we tried holding the power button along with the volume button, we even tried to reset it...nothing. Also noticed a weird design of the charger area on the tablet, the pins are just kind of standing there freely, some of them seemed to be bent. A few days after finding out about the problem, while considering what to do,we tried to turn the tablet on again and it worked. All the data were there, nothing was lost.But after turning it off again and back on, just to see, if this is permanent, it didn`t turn on again. So decided to have it repaired. The ASUS customer service also recommended the previous steps, but as I explained them that they don`t work, we started talking about repairing the device. We are a military Air Force family currently stationed in Germany so we have an APO address. We have bought the tablet online from US. The agent recommended us to ship it to somebody we know in the USA (family member or so) and the service team would come and pick it up for repair, bring it back and we would have it shipped back from friend or family. The problem we run into was, USPS no longer ships anything overseas with lithium batteries in it. We purchased the tablet just barely before this came out. So after calling the customer service again and explaining the situation, we were told to contact the ASUS German customer service and have it repaired there as our tablet does have a global warranty.So we did. The device was sent using the pick up service, everything went smooth, it made it to the service center and today I received and e-mail saying the the problem they detected is not included in the warranty and in order to have it repaired we have to pay 53,92 EUR. If we don`t want to pay for it, they will ship us the unrepaired device for 36,89 EUR or trash it for free. So kind of surprised I called the German customer service about why is this so, I got an answer, that one of the connectors was physically damaged and it is not included in the warranty. Now we have a few days to respond. We are people who care for their electronics and try to take care of them. We can`t see how this went wrong. I`m not an expert on designing tablets but just from my point of view, I would have chosen a different design for the connection parts. We never had this issue before with anything else but this ASUS tablet.

Here is the catch: I bought a ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 in March 2012,and almost 2 months ago I started having problems with the vibration module of my tablet. I sent it back to ASUS twice already and it is still broken. I asked them to replace my tablet since I would have to send it for the third time and all they said is that they \"know what the problem is\" (like they said in the previous 2 repair trips) and that they will fix it but they cant replace it. Also, their Costumer Service in general is one of the worst I ever seen!They usually take 3 days to answer your email and they don't give you feedback on the repairing status unless you call them. I am attaching a video of the \"noise\" the my vibrating module in the tablet is doing. STAY AWAY from this tablet if you can!Not worth 650 dollars!", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor cable connection design, worse customer service NOT RECOMMENDED", "Author": "W.

I've 'owned' the tablet since March, but as the first one was exchanged due to the cable connection and the second one had to be sent in for repair within a month of reciept, it's only been in my hands for about 2 months.Now it seems to be operating OK, expectthe poor GPS reception.  Asus never informed me that for a while they were providing 'free' external adapters for them; but only through July 31st apparently.Also, it seems I cannot charge using the USB cable excpet when it is plugged into the Asus 120V adapter; the tablet won't charge from my PC or laptop USB ports or any other 120V/USB adapter I own.I think now it is a decent tablet, but expect better at the price point.  I much prefer the Motoroal Xoom I had and gave to my wife when I bought the Asus (heck, my old Archos 10.1 was more reliable and easy to operate).  Customer service is very poor; though someone from Asus that read my original review anmd contacted me within 48-hours, a much better response time that their customer service (more interested in their imgae than their performance?).ORIGINAL REVIEW.I have owned dozens of portable electronic devices over the years, as well as many PCs.  I have never experienced anything like the problem of the proprietary cable that comes with this tablet.  The first one I bought in March worked for about a month before the metal pins inside the tablet (the 'male' portion of the plug system) became bent, rendering the connection useless; I was unable to charge the tablet.  Amazon replaced that one.  My new puppy dmamaged the cable on the new tablet, though it was still able to charge the tablet; so I ordered 2 OEM cables through Amazon; the first time I plugged one in it bent the pins on the male side of the plug.  Again, not able to charge the tablet.Amazon Cusomer service gave me a link to an Asus \"Live Chat\" site.  For almost two weeks I have visited the site at least daily; the site has either been closed or no Eee pad support personnel are available.I have never expereinced a similar issues with all the other cables, tablets, media players, etc.  I've used many types of cables(everything from ribbon, to parallet, to USB, firewire and lots of proprietary cables) and plugged and unplugged devices countless times without any problems.Asus customer service doesn't seem to exist.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS Transformer Prime with Keyboard", "Author": "Ray H", "ReviewID": "RP123L1Q4QPXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is positively a great product. I bought the ASUS Transformer Prime, Keyboard (sold separately,)and a leather portfolio case (Bluecell). All are excellant.I originally bought the ASUS for a friend who is vision impaired so that she could read the newspaper more easily (needs large print). The ASUS is serving that purpose well although it did take an e-mail to the local newspaperpaper requesting support for an Android Tablet. If you use lancasteronline.com, do not download their Application - it is for Android cell phones and isn't at all helpful for the Android Tablet. Just use their main website which now works well on Android Tablet. Their support is very good; I received an almost instant response. They have provided any necessary adjustments to their website that was necessary to accomodate the Android Tablet (Thanks lancasteronline.com).Additionally, I have found the Transformer Prime WiFi to have limited range and needed to install a CISCO RE1000 which easily eliminated that problem. I also found the GPS receiver to be less signal sensitive than I expected and requested a bongle (supplied free for the asking from ASUS) which arrived about a week after I registered the Transformer.One additional issue - I thought I understood all I needed to watch streaming baseball games on MLB.COM was Adobe Flash and an MLB.COM subscription; but that isn't correct. The Android version of Adobe Flash is not the same as Adobe Flash for the PC. I'm more than a bit disappointed about that, but that is not a problem with the ASUS Tablet.Having these \"side\" issues I have no problem assigning a 5 Star rating to the product.

The seller was very good the parcel was delivered on time and in mint condition. I have the table for almost 5 months now and i never had any issue what so ever. people have complained about the WiFi and GPS but I have never experience such issue , my transformer picks up the signal pretty well , sometime even better than my Nexus S.This little thing has saved my life several time, it possibility to act as net book(Very portable and fast net book) make this tablet an life changer and although people argue that it pricey, i would say that it worth spending some cash on it . It is solid, the screen is scratch resistant thanks to it gorilla glass and the metallic body make it look very posh and yet durable. Also, ASUS is very good at assisting their customer so far they have been pushing updates very often and fast and I believe it will be even better now that they have sign partnership with Google.The prime is a powerful entertainment gadget, sometime it beats my PS3 as it plays 1080p MKV file very smoothly. Hook it up to the receiver for the best High Def experience. However I have noticed that the sound output while using the HDMI cable is some how mono or only stereo. I hope ASUS or Google find the way around it.The prime came with loads of cool app. My favourite one is MyCloud, which let you control your home pc from where ever you are as if your table was running Windows. All touch gesture are supported (unlike other like Teamviewer)the experience is amazing . one day I went to a party and they didn't have music, thanks to the Prime and the Mycloud app, I was actually playing the music from my home PC but the sound was output on the Prime miles away from home.This is just a little overview of what the Prime has bought to my life...

The TF300 came out right after I ordered it for a hundy less, and looks like, if you are willing to make sacrifices in the storage and display dept., a pretty good deal. But back to the TransPrime. The display is remarkable. The form factor is comfortable and gorgeous, even though there are a few changes I'd make (power button placement being #1). The sound is some of the best I've heard on a portable device, crisp and clear. The tab comes with ASUS WebStorage (8GB free) and being an Android device you also have access to the Google Drive Cloud (another free 8 GB). So if you have a WiFi signal you'll be money in the drive department. Speaking of, a lot of people gripe about the metal back and connectivity issues. I've had none, so far but ASUS will throw in a GPS dongle pro bono. In the case I bought for it, it's about the size of a Harry Potter Hardcover and half the depth, so if you can carry a book with you you can carry the tablet.

There are lots of apps available to chose from that are both fun, useful and informative. They load quickly and are fast and ready to use with their own icons. If I had to chose between a laptop or tablet strickly for versitility and productivity I'd still pick a laptop but the tablet interface makes it quicker to navigate and to checkout your favorite web sites with finger tip swipes in half the time while enjoying a morning cup of coffee.

The battery life is better than advertised and the GPS is functional if not phenomenal. I have not had any of the wifi issues reported, but I did do the squeeze trick before turning it on the first time so that may be part of the reason.

Using a wi-fi analyzer I was able to determine that the other device had slightly better reception, but not to a point of affecting performance.

I have a DroidX which was my first smartphone just a year and a half ago. I didn't get an iPhone because I didn't want to use AT&T;, and when Verizon picked it up, I decided I wasn't going to change phones and stick with Android. It's funny, but some friends were sooo excited to get \"new\" things on their iPhones recently and it was stuff I've had on my DroidX since I got it. I don't get the hype. I know PCs like the back of my hand, and we have a MAC at home which drives me nuts sometimes because I can't clean it up or really find where files are stored (and what's up with not being able to copy cd's?).So I finally really really wanted a tablet, but which one to get? Here's what I was looking for:1) Wanted the 10.1 size, not the \"mini\" 7\"-8\" tablets that are out there. I have a smartphone, so I don't need a slightly larger one.2) WiFi only, did not want another phone/data plan.3) Front facing camera so the grandparents could Skype with the granddaughter and not be tied to the desktop computer. So this ruled out the Kindle Fire.4) Removable/upgradable storage. I like having an SD card on my phone to transfer photos and stuff, and wanted to have the same option on my tablet. Also allows to upgrade from 32GB to 64GB without spending the extra $$ for it internally. Sorry iPad, I guess this rules you out. The thought of having to sync through iTunes made me cringe, I like to be able to just select what files I want and copy to a thumbdrive or SD card and move it over.I was originally looking at the Xoom2, but when it finally released it was 3G only and pretty expensive. In reading reviews for that one I found out about the Transformer Prime. I knew of Asus only because I had bought my husband a netbook a couple a years ago by them because of great reviews.So I read the early reviews for the Transformer Prime and waited patiently to order (this was early December). Finally ordered on the 19th and waited patiently again. I received my Prime on Jan 21st, which was ok with me since all the updates were rolled out (like Ice Cream Sandwich) while I was waiting.I love my new tablet, it's bright and sharp and quick. It did it's upgrades right away and Ice cream sandwich is great. I never used Honeycomb but I like ICS better than Gingerbread. I don't have any WiFi issues, always have 3-4 bars in my house. I haven't even turned on the GPS yet because I have my phone for that when I'm out. For those Apple versus Android people who love to do comparisons, the iPad2 doesn't even come equipped with GPS on the WiFi only model.What makes this tablet great compared to others is that you can buy the dock and turn it into a \"laptop/netbook\" and also get an extra battery. This was really cool to me since I get tired of pecking/Swype. The USB port is also a bonus for transferring stuff off my thumbdrive.I'm not concerned about the 700T tablet with it's HD display, 2Mp camera . Don't think I need that for an extra $100. The battery life will probably take a hit, and there will always be something better a few months later. I'm sure after HD tablets they will start making 3D display tablets.So there's my 2cents for what it's worth, now I can start wondering what phone to get with my \"new every 2\" on Verizon.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thanks ASUS - this tablet in now useless junk.......", "Author": "RoyHobbs", "ReviewID": "R3R78H9SY8NAHN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update of July 2013This tablet is now a piece of useless junk.

I don't seem to have any problems with WiFi strength or GPS but I haven't used the ASUS GPS app that much. I used to live on my XP laptop but I hardly touch it anymore (Linux next maybe?). At first, I thought this couldn't do as much as my XP laptop but the more I use the Prime the more I see it is truly better, easier, more versatile and the screen is fantastic. I can't say Droid or Apple tablets are better but both are better than a traditional windows laptop. I am especially impressed with the way the Prime and keyboard work together when you need it. I take it every where and still leave my emergency phone in my pocket. The smartphones are too small for me and I don't hang on a phone - no twitter/facebook/etc. Great Tablet -  End of update.-----------------------------------------------First of all here's where I'm coming from - I use a windows XP Laptop, an emergency cell phone (no smartphone), and no tablet so this was my first \"upgrade\" in awhile.I'll let everyone else review the apps and technicals - all I want to say is I don't think I could have done any better with my \"upgrade\".1. It's the right size, reminds me of the Mac Airbook I was considering.2. The keyboard dock is great. Keys are comfortable for typing. Quick to dock/undoc. I have several 4G SDHC cards for it. The additional battery life it affords is great.3. The screen is bright and beautiful. I'm downloaded my first Kindle book and reading on the Prime is a quantum leap beyond reading with a Kindle.4. I also bought a 32G microSD chip for the screen, a real plus. I have a USB phone that I will try to use Google Voice with.I'm not committed to Windows or Mac but I use alot of Google apps and, in the final decision, that's what drove me to the Prime over the Mac Airbook, 17\" Windows Laptop and the 2nd place winner Ipad.I'd give it 5 stars but that would be over the top as I'm a newbie with Tablets, Droid/Chrome and haven't used the variety of what is on the market.I highly recommend the Prime and, even more, get the keyboard with it. Carrying the Prime with the dock for me is a no brainer: it protects the Prime, provides extra battery life, and the keyboard is a pleasure to use.Does it do what my laptop does? No, (well, almost) but it doesn't have to - it boots fast, gets me to the web fast, is an excellent reader for Google Currents, NYTimes, Kindle, and is light as a feather even with the keyboard.Are there as many apps as the Ipad? No, but there are apps for everything I need (how many apps do you need?)I do all my shopping at Amazon but, for the first time, I bought this at the BestBuy down the street in case I needed technical support or wanted to return it in a hurry. I'm using the Amazon App Store - easy smeezy.Nice surprise today - I spend way too much time on Baseball-Reference and today I used the Prime to get there instead of my Windows laptop.

However, it has been great.  The UI is snappy, the wireless range is perfectly fine, there are plenty of apps (many mentioned limited availability of apps on Honeycomb, I have yet to not find something I need/want), and the charging takes as long as I expected it to.This is a good, solid product.  I think some people are looking for absolute perfection, and I'm just looking for something that works damn well.  The Prime clears that bar easily in my opinion.The one thing that I am disappointed in (that I did not see mentioned in any other review) is the lack of 5 GHz wireless N.  It supports 2.4 GHz, but not 5 GHz.  From what I've read, the hardware supports it, but ASUS has disabled it in software.  This could be due to the aluminum case, but I do have 5 GHz N deployed in my home, so it would have been nice to use it.  That being said, now that ASUS has announced that they will provide a bootloader unlocking utility, I'm sure CyanogenMod 9 will make 5 GHz wireless N available, regardless of range.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet I own to date!", "Author": "Fabian Salazar", "ReviewID": "R1SMV9LBS6RY5A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initial:I owned a Ipad before aand thought it wasn't bad for simple entertainment.  The reason I decided to invest in a android tablet, especially this, was because of the upcoming update of ice cream sandwich Android operating system. The lowness of Google is also what attracts e to go Android.  Onto the product build itself, its no mystery that Asus is trying to step its game up by build such a marvelous device. Lightweight feel, extremely thin, extravagant docking keyboard (sold separately; the dock adds USB ports and a HDMI port),and a back and front camera. Though there are cons to this device, I recommend it to users familiar with Android devices, it does need getting use to to this unfamiliar with Android.Pros:-lightweight device able to grasp easily.9-dock sold separately adds more battery life and physical keyboard function-fast fast fast and vibrant screenCons:-GPS has some slight glitches admitted by Asus themselves.  Updates provide some slight fixes-Stock browser is slow but I will link a fix for those who have it now-some crashes through applications,causes much frustration at timesOverall:This tablet is a must have, 32gb is plenty of space for those who don't cram much into their machines and with the slim and lightweight design it is a thing of beauty.  Though the cons might scare some people away (also the reason I subtracted a star) I say buy it and wait it out, the upcoming ICS update will add better functionality to the tablet and increase the smoothness of the device.**Update**So with the new ICS updates now out, I thought it would be appropriate to update you potential buyers. First off here have been many reports of people still suffering from wifi, Bluetooth problems, and update serial number errors. I seem to be part of the lucky few who suffer little to no problems (GPS locks on quickly for me now since update and wifi never seemed to be an issue for me). Only complaint I have so far is the browser seems to run streaming videos slower at HD quality. There was a fix for the previous version but now with ICS I have to look up a new one, till I figure that out this is my only gripe with this tablet. THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE with this tablet, as you can see there are varying opinions and experience people seem to be having. Maybe the new batch of tablets that come out will have less hardware/firmware problems. I still recommend this tablet by the way!

While I feel like the apps are really what make a tablet worth while, there are too many differences between the same app on both devices that come down to quality of programming spend for the device. Being honest, most developers spend more time/money on the iPad version, then attempt a conversion to Android.I only got to play with the Honeycomb version of this tablet for about 4 days, and it felt very similar to an iPad2: transitions between desktop screens flickered, WiFi worked ok with issues connecting to places like Chic-Fil-A, GPS so slow to connect outdoors but then worked great (not so great indoors). Main drawback to the Prime/Honeycomb tablet was it was constantly referred as a \"phone\". Prompts about making calls, ringtones, vibrate feature etc. It really took away from the tablet only (no 3G/4G available). There WAS no reason to accept this tablet over the iPad2...All this changed with the update to Icecream Sandwich (ICS), transitions between desktop screens is SMOOTH, better than iPad2. WiFi update stablized the issues connecting at Chic-Fil-A, GPS connection improved with an update. All these updates to the system were out within the first MONTH of product release.Now for my tidbit on the app areas: Apple has better apps and more of them, no surprise being the leader. Once you select iPad your into the WHOLE Apple bandwagon with iTunes and iCloud. Now their products just work very well together which is very appealing if you like all their products. Android Marketplace has a lot of great apps, most the same as their iTunes conterpart, however \"some\" are more finicky on Android than iOS. However, the best app reason for Android the ability to install apps from other sources, like Amazon or GetJar. This allows you to bypass Google if desired and pick your own sources for apps.I am in no way an expert and this only represents my opinion. Only trying it for yourself can you build an accurate picture.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best android tablet on the market and only competitor to the iPad 2", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "R27ABOQ6PJH119", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have to say I was really impressed with this android tablet initially. I really wanted it to replace my iPad 2. My iPad just isn't cutting it any more. I wanted something that was more powerful and verstile. The main features I was missing in the iPad were: flash support, better multitasking, more inputs like USB, sd, micro sd and micro hdmi. I also wanted to be able to customize my tablet more and have more options in terms rooting. Jailbreaking my iPad was still very limited for me.This tablet is far superior than the iPad in many areas. The iPad also has alot advantages over the prime. Although the iPad 2 and the prime are not exactly in the same class in terms of specs and the prime came out 9 months after the iPad 2. I will still be comapring the two since they are the best tablets on the market at this point.The prime has a much better screen in just about every aspect. It has a higher screen resolution and a much brighter screen. I definitely enjoyed watching videos much more on the prime than the iPad 2. The images displayed are much more sharper and crisper. Also the prime has a 16:9 screen versus the upad 2 which has only 4:3 screen. The 16:9 is much better for video viewing. I didn't really enjoy the prime in portrait mode when viewing web pages and reading in general. I much prefer the iPad 2's  4:3 screen for viewing web pages and reading. I really liked the fact that the primes screen can get very bright. This comes in handy when outside with the bright sun and glare. it's very hard to see my iPad 2 in these conditions.The prime is lighter, thinner and easier to hold in landscape mode than the iPad 2.I found the prime overall to be slow, buggy, freezed alot and also crashed quite a bit. In general I was expecting the prime to be faster than the iPad 2 in most tasks. The iPad 2 is much faster in normal tasks like switching apps or launching apps or even just exiting apps. The iPad 2 is also much faster at booting up.The browser seemed to be much slower than the iPads even when I had flash disabled on the browser. The browser seems to crash quite a bit also. I tried a few different browsers and I got pretty much the same result with all of them.I really did enjoy ice cream sandwich. It has some nice features and seems to run pretty fast overall and definitely an improvement over honeycomb.I did experience the wifi issues every one seems to be talking about. My wifi signal strength and speed was alot lower and slower than any other wifi device I own. When compared to my iPad 2 from the same location the prime always had at least one less bar in signal strenght and at least 5mbps slower speed. When observing the wifi signal strenght I noticed it fluctuating up and down for no apparent reason. I have read the wifi speed can be improved by changing the channel on your router to a lower channel and also setting your n router to g only mode. I diidnot make these adjustments to my router so cannot comment on that. In the end I found no matter how low signal or how slow the speeds I was still able to carry a signal and stream hd video.Although I already knew that there aren't that many tablet based apps on the android market. I was still suprised at how few their were when I compared it to my iPad.  Out of my almost 100 tablet based apps on my iPad there were only a handful of the same apps availble on the android market. Initially and I do still beleive when you have a tablet like the prime with a full browser you don't really need apps that muc. Most apps are just differnt versions of a website that actually limit functionality. This is mostly true for Facebook and twitter. I still found myself missing alot my iPad 2 tablet optimized apps.  The number of android tablet apps will get better very soon. I'm sure by may or June there will be alot more and definitely by the end of the year it would have improved significantly as ice cream sandwich is still new. Currently the prime is the only tablet that has ice cream sandwich officially.I was really disappointed when I found out that the prime doesn't support USB mass storage. When connected  to your pc the prime is only recognized in mtp mode. This makes it much harder to transfer files to the prime via USB. Makes it much slower and also which files you can transfer.The speaker on the prime is not as loud as my iPad 2. There are apps that can increase the loudness of the speaker but i expected it to be loud out of the box. The audio quality is better than the ipads speaker though. The llocation of the speaker is very poorly placed. It's placed in the same spot you would put your hand on the right side when holding it landscape mode. Also the position of the other inputs like the mic, headphone jack, power button and volume rocker just didnt make sense to me. Just didn't seem like it was well thought out.One of the other reasons I got the prime was the keyboard dock. Which is a great idea. Combines alot cool features I would love to have. I will be writing a separate review on the keyboard dock at a later point. So please check back later for it.Overall I really liked the prime. Definitely a very good competitor to the iPad 2. But in my case it just wasn't good enough to replace my iPad 2. Many people would be ok with the primes buggyness and instability or it's lack of tablets apps or it's slower browser performance or it's flash issues or any other issues I mentioned. I will eventually replace my iPad 2 with an android tablet. I much prefer android over iOS especially since ice cream sandwich is out now. I am confident the tablet market is going to change alot and very fast in the next 6-12 months as more tablets and apps are released to optimize and take advantage of ice cream sandwich. Another note is that asus has already anounced yet another large tablet which has a better constructed wifi antenna, 1080p screen, better camera and other enhancements. So in just a few short months asus has already updated and made this prime obsolete. Most companies including apple wait a full 12 months to release a new model to their line. This just shows what asus is all about. When there were already major issues with the prime they release a new model without addressing the current primes issues. I have to add that in UK asus has anncounced that they would extend warranties on the prime by 6 months or allow customers to return their primes for a full refund. Asus has not announced anything like this for north american customers. I would hope and think they would offer the same option to us but it's asus so who knows.At this point I'm sticking with my iPad 2 because it just works and it's stable.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet except intermittent WIFI issues.", "Author": "Bino Manjasseril \"Bino\"", "ReviewID": "R2WZ6RQR3Z3KRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEW....Few more weeks after I wrote the below review, I started seeing WIFI issues on the tablet in certain areas of my home. The youtube videos started buffering (almost always) while the same videos worked without buffering on the galaxy tab which is connected to the same wifi.By now, I received the keyboard I ordered through target.com and started using the tablet with the keyboard. While it is easier to type using the physical keyboard, it is still not a great user experience compared to a laptop (going back and forth between using the keyboard and the touchscreen for navigating). I tried to convince myself of the several advantages of a tablet over a laptop such as portability, touchscreen feature etc. Well, until I went and checked the new ultra book product lines in bestbuy. 13 inch ultra books (made by Asus, Toship and Samsung) are so lightweight, portable, with several ports (USB, memory card reader etc), and more importantly 3 or 4 times powerful (processor speed and internal memory) than these tablets. Long story short, I ended up returning both my tablet and the keyboard and bought a Toshiba Portege ultrabook. Now, after few months of making that decision, I can testify that I get more done with my ultrabook with more ease with a comfortable keyboard and 13 inch screen.Don't get me wrong. I am not disputing the fact that there is a place for tablets as opposed to ultra-books (or laptops) in our computing needs. But for me, I find using an ultra-book much more convenient and productive.I am taking one star down due to the WIFI issues. Wifi issue apart, all my points in my old review (below) still stands.P.S: I heard that Asus is releasing an improved version of this tablet later this year. Hopefully it comes with a fix for the WIFI issue.---------------------------------------------I can't speak for others but after owning the TF201 for about a week now, I can attest the following:1. As a person a owned galaxy tab (which is also a great tablet) for an year, TF201 outperforms galaxy tab in several major areas.2. WIFI: Stronger than galaxy tab in the same area in my home (My WIFI router is placed in the basement and I can access WIFI on the tablet anywhere in my 2-story home).3. Speed: Way faster than probably any tablet out there (However, you need to change the performance settings from \"balanced\", which is the default setting, in \"balanced\" mode the tab is not using the full power of quad core processor always)4. Screen resolution: Beautiful!5. Style: Supreme!6. Lay out of power, volume control buttons and ports : Brilliant.7. ICS advantage (Apple's iOS would look like a kiddie OS comparing to ICS. Apple: How about copying the re-sizable widget idea (for example) for your next iOS version and market it as is you 'invented' it?)8. Beautiful and powerful Key-board docking option - adds battery life, more ports and convenience of typing using a physical key-board.9. No comment on GPS performance because honestly I haven't tried it and I am not planning to use GPS on a 10.1 inch tablet anyways.10. The only 'con' (which is not really a 'con' of the tablet itself) is the lack of ICS and quad-core specific apps/games available currently. But it's only a matter of time (may be a few months). All the major apps in the market (facebook, g+, gmail, weather, netflix, youtube etc are already upgraded to work on ICS)", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet when it worked", "Author": "B.

Unlocking the bootloader to install a non-Asus firmware voids your warranty, which is annoying, but was presented clearly.After unlocking, I thought I'd try the warranty service nevertheless to get the terrible display replaced.  I figured the worst that could happen is that I'd lose the shipping cost.  Unfortunately for me, Asus did the warranty service despite the voided warranty.  When they returned the device, I found the bootloader relocked, and the power button had been damaged in such a way that the tablet would no longer function.  Now that they've damaged the device, they are refusing to do any further service because the unlocked / relocked bootloader.Asus has given me excuse after excuse as to why they won't service the device.

Then my son bought a new iPad2, which is nice as well (Can't tell that the resolution is higher unless you zoom waaaaaay in on the text) but I'm not an apple guy (Don't drink the Kool aid!) and it was apparent to me that there was equal competition out there in Tablet land.After researching for 6 weeks (Using hands-on demos, Tabletnation.net, and CNET.com for references) I pulled the trigger on the ASUS Transformer Prime.I bought the keyboard accessory as well.After 8 weeks of purchase, my Dell XPS 8100 gathers dust (except for post-processing video) and I am thoroughly happy with this tablet. I use it for travel, at work (accessing my cell phone provider data plan on my Android phone, WITHOUT rooting the phone nor the need for a 2nd data plan, thank you) and it is very nice to have just the tablet in bed at night to read.

It's lightning fast and plays 3d games like they're angry birds on the original iPhone.However, there if one (yes only one) downfall. (Well, maybe two, I'll get to that later. The Wifi connection on the device is a little sketchy. I currently have two \"smart\" devices (not including my laptop), my Asus Transformer Prime, and my Motorola Triumph.I have a Netgear Router that has an \"N\" connection, also compatible with \"a\" \"g\" and \"b\". Ok, solid. So the Prime can connect to N connections, therefore it should have lightning fast speeds... no? Well, despite the fact that there is a router probably a solid 30 feet away from me in my office while I'm in my living room, I generally only have one, maybe two bars. Ouch. Data speeds are not as lightning fast as they should be. If I decide to walk into my office though, I'll just about instantaneously get a solid 4 bars. I have yet to try out anything on Speedtest or any equivalents for that matter, but I can tell you from personal experience that there is a noticeable difference.Now, let's get back to my Motorola Triumph, the small thing only has a 1 Ghz Processor (an old one at that) and can only connect to \"a\" \"b\" and \"g\" networks. Despite that, it gets a solid 4 bars in the exact same place in my living room. And despite the fact that it only has a single core processor that clocks in at 1ghz (well really 1.3 now that I've rooted it, and no I have NOT rooted my Prime... there could potentially be a yet there) it has comparable speeds to my Transformer Prime at times. When we compare that to my Transformer Prime with a quad 1.6Ghz Tegra \"beast\" you can sort of see how come it can get a little frustrating. Now, let's be honest here, the Prime is usually loading full size sites in comparison to the bite sized mobile sites my Triumph usually loads, and it most definitely has faster speeds with all of the \"important\" things like Facebook, so I'll be honest here and say that speeds are if anything slightly faster, but the thing is they should be miles faster. In the words of Samsung, they should be another GALAXY faster... no?The other thing that doesn't work so perfect is the GPS, not always the best, and while I hate to bring up my Triumph again, although I can NOT tell you the exact details of how much better the GPS is, it's certainly better on the Triumph than the Prime...Let's wrap this up before I go write a book. So to finish, even after all that, I would most definitely still recommend the Transformer Prime, the specs are great, the display is beautiful, and the battery life is just incredible (no official tests, but maybe like 10-12 hrs off a charge). On top of that, it's thinner and lighter than an Ipad 2 (thereby making it thinner and lighter than an Ipad 3 as well) and has by far the most responsive touchscreen I've ever used. While most people are probably going to shy away from this product, because the 300 series is coming out for a slightly more affordable price, and Asus is eventually going to be releasing a 7 inch tablet with the same processor specs as this for $250 (rumor), I'd still highly recommend it. As this review mostly seems to focus on the negative, I'd suggest that you check out all of the amazing things that are on the Asus website, because just about every last one of them are true, as long as you can keep in mind that you just might have spotty wifi and bad GPS (although I don't really see the point of GPS on a tablet).", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "After ICS, it is amazing.", "Author": "Ryan Barnes", "ReviewID": "RAEUGHPXSCMM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I was experiencing a bit of buyer's remorse after having the prime for about a week due to poor wifi range, ICS and yesterday's update fixed all of that.

The problem on new units is still not resolved.When starting up the tablet, about 20% of the time, it does not connect through WiFi to the internet. On going in to settings, the WiFi is off. About 20% of the time, the 'off' button will not move to the 'on' position. It must be turned off and started again. Usually, it  then usually connects to the internet, often showing an excellent signal.

When I recieved the tablet I was so anxious to open it and worried because it is refurbished. Well, I opened the box and the the tablet was in near perfect condition to the naked eye on the physical aspect. Charged it till the light turned green and turned it on. After it loaded up and I looked at the display I noticed a blueish , teal colored line that ran vertically down the left side of the display. No matter which way I held the tablet , landscape or portrait, this blue line seemed permanent. I was very unhappy because it came in perfect condition except for the display problem. I have had to send it off to ASUS for RMA in Texas to fix this and my experience with them so far has not been a good one to say the least. To make a long story short , I took a shot and purchased it and became one of the unlucky ones. If it came with nothing wrong with it , the Prime is an awesome , fast ,tablet, with an excellent display.  I gave 5 stars because if it wasn't flawed, it would be mint.I love and miss my Prime, yep that's right , still haven't gotten it back yet and its been like over two weeks in there posession over at ASUS.  I recommend this tablet if you dont care about the GPS issues. It's awesome.

I chose to stick to droid-based OS devices, so this ASUS tablet seemed up my alley.  Some of this review may touch a bit more on the software issues (which isn't necessarily the product's fault).The first big problem is with the wifi connectivity.  I have carried around my netbook, cell phone and tablet around the house with me to test out the connectivity.  The tablet completely loses contact with my wireless router about half the distance of my other devices.  I've taken off the rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Black) Leather Folio Case to see if that was part of the problem.  However, it isn't.  I've tried firmware updates with no luck.The tablet works in about a 35 foot radius from the router.  For me, that doesn't cut it.Support for this particular droid device is rather poor.  The manufacturer seemed to point me to an independently run forum for support questions.  Out of the box, the tablet could not run any flash video (such as stuff on youtube) in fullscreen.  The system would simply hang.  I got no solution to that.  Even 1 year after the fact and with a new droid version the problem still persists.Another issue is the browser window randomly closes.  Manufacturer solution?  Reset to factory default.Some good stuff: It seems to hold a charge for at least 5 days on standby.I've found a few niche uses for it, but I don't recommend this to someone that plans to stream video to it or anyone that thinks it can replace a computer or laptop for internet browsing.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Ronald Rios Rivas", "ReviewID": "R184QKEO6AL1AJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good quality item.

Hiltbrand", "ReviewID": "R17NRXJQDFR4SI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet a year ago in April. it is a wonderful tablet with more than enough computing power to get the job done. So, let's get to it -Packaging - The Asus Transformer Prime comes in a typical box. It is nicely packaged with instruction manuals, cleaning cloth, and power adapter / cable. The package is sturdily built, which helps with shipping.Transformer Prime Features - The TF201 features a Tegra 3 quad core processor. This processor allows you to use the latest apps, and multitask between them, with ease. It features a super IPS+ screen. This screen reproduces images with clarity and detail. However, I have found that it does not do very well in sunlight. It features an 8 megapixel camera, which is great for a tablet. The pictures produced are clear, and the camera app features a lot of great customizable settings. The tablet is equipped with a mini HDMI connector, so you can view the contents of the tablet on the big screen. The TF201 has a dock connector that offers many expandability options. There is a keyboard dock, which allows the tablet to become essentially a netbook (as it adds a keyboard, extended battery, and USB support). I currently use a USB adaptor (which allows me to connect thumb drives, a mouse, an external hard drive, etc.) and a GPS dongle to get a GPS signal (See Below).TF201 Issues - The TF201 has a great, all aluminum case. The problem with that is the Wireless radios (Wi-fi, Bluetooth, and GPS) are adversely affected, since they can't get a very good signal. The wireless problems can get annoying, since you have to be right by a router to get any sort of consistent signal. The Bluetooth doesn't seem to be affected that much. The GPS is rendered totally inoperable as a result of the case. Asus offered a connector to alleviate the GPS issues. It is a bar that connects to the versatile dock connector. However, this has only slightly improved the quality of GPS signals. At least I'm able to get a signal now.This tablet is a great tablet, packed with tons of features. It suffers from a design flaw however that really hurts its capabilities. If I were to do it again, I would have waited a couple months and purchased the TF700.

It overheated and would no longer charge.  While it was with Asus, they discovered that it also had a Touch Screen Function Error.  Both parts were replaced.  The next return was for lack of HDMI output among other things. Parts were replaced for an I/O Error, Touch Mis-action (same part as the first time), and finally ECN, ECR, ARN rework.  Even after getting it back the second time, it still was a little wonky, but at least the HDMI output worked.  The next step in the saga is the update to Jellybean.  Yes!

Since it is too late to return it to Amazon, I guess I'm on the hook to return it to Asus for repairs again.My recommendation - Don't buy this product.  The idea is fantastic and my tablet is nice when it works.

Most products are not good or bad enough for me to care. This is honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a product. My need for a laptop replacement for college is the only reason it wasn't immediately returned.The short version: don't buy it. The customer service is worthless and the quality control is nonexistent. Go buy a Nexus 10 or something else from Samsung.PROS: None. There isn't a single good thing I can say about this tablet that matters at all to me. The closest I can come is that it's a nice looking paperweight. But honestly, looks are only a pro if it works. Otherwise, who cares?CONS: This one needs categories  BEFORE REPAIR TABLET: The tablet itself was glitchy from day one.  GPS: Like everyone else has said, they suck. The GPS, I can deal with. I wasn't really planning on using it much for that purpose. That said, if you advertise a feature, that feature had better work. If I buy a tablet that advertises GPS, I want to be able to use it whether that's its main purpose or not. The GPS dongle that was ASUS's fix is ugly and prevents the use of the dock, which was a big selling point for the tablet. Before repair, the dongle failed to improve the GPS. It still could never get a lock.  WIFI: Again, it's as bad as everyone has said. I had read that some people had decent signal strength. Mine did not.  GRAPHICS: This was one of the biggest problems. It never could render the graphics properly. Anything displayed on the screen was distorted and shaded oddly. Instead of smooth shading, there were only a few very noticeable breaks where the shading changed. Everything had distorted edges. If I were to guess, I would say the graphics processor was damaged or was not properly attached. This was the one of the reasons I originally sent it in for repair.  FREEZING: This was the other big problem. This thing has a quad-core processor. It had more processing power than the broken laptop it was replacing. It had more than enough power to run everything perfectly smoothly as advertised. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It constantly froze on the simplest tasks. Browsing the internet wasn't possible through either the stock browser or any Play Store replacements. The tablet would always stop responding.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: ASUS has the worst customer service period. Honestly, I would get better results from beating my head on a rusty nail. I can't adequately describe how amazingly awful it is. When I first contacted them, they were quick to issue an RMA. That was the only thing they did quickly. The repair center had the tablet for 6 weeks. I had no contact from ASUS about what was going on. Their repair status website had some cryptic code that meant nothing to anyone who didn't work at ASUS. I had no idea what was going on. I honestly think they just dumped it in a corner somewhere and forgot about it. Things finally started moving when I filed a complaint with ASUS. However, they still did not tell me what was going on. They intentionally waited almost 2 more weeks to respond to my complaint after the delivery confirmation informed them I had picked up the tablet. This response actually took me longer than necessary to decipher since they couldn't be bothered to glance over the couple of sentences they wrote. This pathetic example of how NOT to conduct business would have concluded here if the tablet were actually fixed. It was not.  AFTER REPAIR TABLET:  GPS: Without the dongle, the GPS was unimproved, but it works with the dongle now.  WIFI: Wifi is about the same. It will never have perfect signal strength because of the design flaws.  GRAPHICS: The constant bad shading and edges were mostly fixed. I say mostly because while it isn't constantly messed up as before, the graphics still freak out periodically.  FREEZING: The freezing is much, much worse, and it continues to get worse.  TOUCH: This is a new problem since the repair. Many times when I touch the screen, it will react as if I touched a completely different area. It won't always recognize swiping to scroll a page. This is also getting worse.  MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE: Since the repair actually made the tablet worse, I unfortunately was not done dealing with ASUS. Instead of offering a replacement or an advanced RMA, they continued to insist that I send them the tablet again. Surprisingly, I don't trust them any more. After waiting 6 weeks to receive a tablet with more problems than it was sent with, I just don't think this particular tablet is reparable. Since they refused to help, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I won't give any details from that other than the complaint is still open after 5.5 weeks.If you've made it this far, I should add one more thing. ASUS knew about every one of these problems before they released this model. It was replaced in less than a year by a fixed version, the TF700t, aka the Transformer Pad Infinity. The only difference in specs is a slightly higher resolution screen. The tablets are sold for the same price. Actually, I just checked. Amazon sells the 64 GB version of the TF700t for less than the 64 GB version of the TF201.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke way to easily", "Author": "Jose", "ReviewID": "R1YZCZ3AP2VZAH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned my Asus Transformer Prime for less than 6 months and the cameras just stopped working and now it will not even take a charge.

I've contacted ASUS support, they helped me via email support and then from there, they asked for it to be shipped to them (I believe Texas).

Not sure if that's only with that application.  This happened right after an update provided on the air.  I did a full wipe on the tablet and it appears to have resolved the issue... I'm hoping this is permanent.The good stuff:Gaming on this is beyond my expectation.  Fluidity on all my applications, and usability is excellent.  There are many apps available in the market, and they work great with this tablet.Overall:I highly recommend this tablet to anyone who is in the market for another tablet.  If I had to compare this with the iPad, iPad is much more stable.  From my experience with Android tablets, this is as far as I know the best tablet in the Android tablet category.

The tablet is light, really light but feels sturdy in my hand. The gorilla glass is scratch proof (I have rings in my fingers). The screen quality is very good but I use the tablet mainly indoor so can't comment on much-advertised IPS+ display. However, for indoor use the display is quite good and I didn't face any reading or viewing problem.The faster Tegra3 processor and GPU was able to run any games I threw at it. All the apps opened quickly and although I ran lots of apps and never closed them using menu items, the tablet never felt like slowing down. One concern is some of the applications I use, are still not updated to ICS tablet screens, so they stretch to fit the screen. That's poor from app developer's part, not tablet's fault.The volume is a bit low, but any free amplifier/equalizer app from Android market can take care of this issue.

It was on backorder for nearly two months, and in the meantime, I heard all the reports of issues with GPS and wifi reception.  I debated cancelling my order, but couldn't justify buying an older tablet for nearly the same price.The construction of the tablet is good; it doesn't feel as cheap as some of the other tablets I looked at in the stores.  The screen looks good, but like most, it is a fingerprint magnet.  It either immediately shipped with Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), or the first update I installed out the box upgraded it.  I like the improvements of ICS over Gingerbread, and ASUS adds a few tweaks of their own.  I'm fairly happy with the camera output, especially the rear facing camera.  The front camera works well for quick Skype sessions.Testing of my unit shows that the GPS is lacking against my Galaxy S phone, but what has really hurt has been the weak wifi reception.  I wound up taking a class this semester in an area that gets awful wifi reception.  It's fine for laptops, but not strong enough for phones or tablets (at least I don't see any other students using their tablets in the classroom, either).  This rendered the tablet useless for my main intended purpose, but that's not ASUS' fault.  I was able to get the GPS extender from ASUS, and hope to give it a try.  It is a kluge, but at least they did something to try to address the issue, besides roll out a newer model tablet without the issue.The tablet has demonstrated great battery life.  I would like to get the signature keyboard, but that is still down the road.  I hope to be able to use it as a light duty laptop replacement, card reader and extra battery.

Wrong. Yes, it was small and light, but the need to fold it as well as the limits of battery life in my experience significantly compromised what I could do on the road. Add to that the Windows operating system and an underpowered Intel Atom CPU and it made for a miserable surfing and computing experience, whether on the road or not.Fast forward to late November of 2011 when I first heard of another robust ASUS ultra portable computer in the form of a tablet running on the Android platform and you can imagine I was skeptical, especially at the price points mentioned in the press and with the claims that HD quality video would run smoothly, that surfing included fast screen updates, and that the tablet delivered an enjoyable gaming experience.  After considering that I had an Amazon gift card for $100, but recognizing that Amazon appeared to have stopped taking orders and the fact that I had an upcoming vacation trip for which it was necessary to travel light, I took my chances and ordered the Transformer Prime from B&H; on November 25. B&H; could not provide a reliable shipping date or even explain if they shipped on the basis of who placed orders first. Thus I indicated my travel destination as the shipping address thinking there was no way the product would take that long to ship. Wrong again. Weeks later, when it was clear that my vacation would end before I received the tablet, I asked B&H; to change the shipping address to my home. B&H; explained they could do that but that would place me at the end of the line, which was apparently established after my initial call. I had previously had good experience with B&H;, but it was very disappointing to hear this. Considering the experience and the still unused Amazon gift certificate, it was easy for me to cancel the order through B&H; to order through Amazon instead. I have never had a problem with Amazon and they just happened to have started taking orders again. I placed the order in late December and it arrived on about the 14th of January nicely boxed to prevent damage during transit.I unpacked, quickly went through the abbreviated user guide, charged the unit as directed, and the following day attempted to run the setup to link to my wireless home network. Based on news accounts and Transformer Forums I was concerned about problems with both GPS and wireless connectivity. I hoped my experience would be uneventful, but it was not to be. When the setup attempted to log into my Gmail account, it was apparent to me that I probably had hours of troubleshooting ahead of me. I had some hope, however, that since the Transformer Prime was connecting to the home network but failing at the point of internet access, that my problem would be easier to diagnose and fix. I did a fair number of fruitless Google searches before I resorted to ASUS customer support. ASUS had me reboot my router (which I had just updated the firmware for) and then walked me through the process of resetting the Android software. Still no luck. Customer support told me I had two options at that point: one, send them the Transformer Prime for repair since they concluded it was faulty or, two, return it to Amazon for an exchange or refund. These options were provided to me after no more than 5 minutes of conversation and I was surprised that ASUS was not suggesting other options. I reminded the representative that I was able to establish a wireless network connection and that the issue was simply internet access. He was insistent that the problem was the tablet and I didn't argue. Nonetheless I was determined to try other options before returning the tablet.I started by driving to a nearby mall, figuring that if I could connect to the internet there I would have some assurance that the tablet was not the problem. Within seconds of my turning on the tablet, I did indeed establish the internet connection while sitting in my car about 30 feet from the nearest building. I completed the setup, went to the settings menu, saw that there was an update available, and proceeded to download and install what turned out to be Android 4.0_. I then drove home monitoring the access points and signal strength along the way. I was very surprised by the number of unsecured access points in residential areas. I hope that people are taking precautions in safeguarding their privacy and data.When I got home I called my internet service provider to make sure that there were no service interruptions. I was assured there were none. I then powered on the tablet hopeful that the operating system update solved my problems. It did not. At that point I knew the problem was my router. Since I purchased my D-Link 655 from Costco at a time they had a promotion that provided free lifetime technical support, I wasted no time in getting them on the phone. Within 30 minutes of trial and error testing, we traced the problem to an IP address for the router that limited functionality. We changed that and immediately had the Transformer Prime on the internet.One thing I am extremely thankful for is the free router technical assistance. I have an extremely complicated home network with multiple routers, switches, and extenders for both wired and wireless connectivity. We also have multiple media servers and at any one time can have more than 10 devices competing for wired and wireless bandwidth. My technical knowledge is limited and as much as I enjoy tweaking, a prime consideration for me in any future router purchase will be the availability of free technical support for those times that I can't troubleshoot a problem.As to the Transformer Prime, now that I've put it through hours of use, I'm impressed. I have not taken it on a trip yet, but I can happily trip through my home and yard while surfing without problems. The available aps are numerous, performance far exceeds that of a netbook, the screen is gorgeous, and while I have experienced occasional browser crashes, they are thus far tolerable and I hope fixed in future software releases.This is what the Netbook should have been.I recommend a Griffin stylus and a stand to go with the mini HDMI cable in your accessory kit. I am still waiting for the leather jacket that I will protect the tablet in. If that allows me easy tablet access, this product is a winner since it seems I can use this product all day without a charge.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Deal Breaker for me", "Author": "Leining Lu \"Leining\"", "ReviewID": "R325RR62XH4XJJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Different people use a tablet for different purposes. Therefore they form different opinions about the tablet. Please note that if you don't use ASUS Transformer Prime to watch high resolution HD movies but just for other usages, this review should not affect your purchase decision.I have waited for a long time to buy an ASUS Prime (TF201). I have done extensive market research. To my dismay, it was out of stock with Amazon in the first two weeks of 2012, though there were quite a few from third parties with much higher prices. During those weeks, I kept logging on Amazon several times in a day just to check if there would be any ASUS Transformer Prime available. On 1/20/2012, to my pleasant surprise, suddenly a handful of ASUS Prime units became available from Amazon. I was so excited that I quickly snatched the opportunity to order one for myself. I had very high hope with the ASUS Prime based on so many positive reviews that I've read. I am sure it has many great features and most of them are the best in the industry. But I also had a little concern about one thing, the color of the HD video that the Prime plays. I use a tablet mostly to watch HD movies with resolution of 720P (1280x720). Most reviews seem to be focused on its superior build quality, being thin and light, high processing speed, and screen brightness etc, but very little mentioning of the quality of color. Only one review from CNET website has brief mentioning that the reviewer said that he was more impressed by Samsung Galaxy's image color compared to ASUS Prime. That information concerned me. But I still ordered it from Amazon just to give it try. After I received it on 1/23 and tested it, my concern about the Prime's video color proved to be true. I use an app called MX Video Player downloaded from Android Market to play 720P movies in formats of MKV, MP4 and AVI on the Android tablet. Before I bought ASUS Transformer Prime, I had bought two tablets, Ipad2 and Samsung Galaxy 7.7. IPad2 is a great tablet, except that Ipad2 has weaknesses with its screen resolution and the video color. That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 later on to make up for it. Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is still not available in the US market yet. I ordered from a retailer in Singapore. The image quality and screen color of the HD movies of the Galaxy 7.7 are absolutely stunning. I haven't seen any tablet better than Galaxy 7.7 in terms of that.The screen of the ASUS Prime is very bright, as many reviewers have said. However, the color of the 720P video being played on ASUS Transformer Prime is very pale. The ASUS Prime seems to have diminished large amount of colors, most noticeably the redness. The colors of wallpaper and photos from the internet browser have no such problem. They look very good. I noticed the lack of colors only when watching 720P HD movies or TV shows. I was disappointed and I returned it to Amazon the next day. I would wait for the Samsung Galaxy 11.6 coming out later in this year. When it comes to the color richness, Samsung products (TV and tablet) seem second to none. I heard Samsung makes screens for many other brands including Ipad. Perhaps they have held some technology related to the screen color to themselves and use it exclusively to their Samsung Galaxy tablet.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Android Tablet on the Market as of today", "Author": "J.

I had removed the apps and wanted to get back to factory reset, so I booted in \"safe mode\" and performed the reset from there, and the tablet never booted again, well it turns on to the asus logo and goes no farther.This happened because the update and / or rom for jelly bean was installed without a recovery. These updates and rom were stock and came from asus. So the option was there, but no dice. I called Asus and set up to have it fixed (reinstall) but the worker who dealt with a very angry customer did not give me a quote. I called back to get a quote and I asked what the repair ticket said was the issue, He replied \"customer broke the bootloader when they unlocked it\". This was false, the tablet worked after the bootloader was unlocked. I corrected him and got the quote, 300+ dollars + shipping just to reinstall OS.This was a mistake by asus and they wanted to charge me 300+ dollars! no way!

I own a Dell streak, rooted Nook color, Motorola droid pro and Motorola Xprt. (Wife is sprint I'm on Verizon for work) All of them get the same signal except the nook color just looses all signal once I get across the house.Haven't used gps don't know why anyone would on a tablet especially a wifi only one.Haven't had any forced reboots or lockupsThe storage on this is great. Base line of 32 gigs will suffice for even hard core app users. For people that like to store movies on it you can get a 32 gig micro sd card which i did and store them on there. Also with the dock (which should almost just be a requirement its that good)you can add up to a 128gb sd card which i got a class 10 32 gig one on sale for $22. That's 96 gigs of storage not even counting the flash drives and external drives you could use with the usb port.Last and my favorite is gaming. Games are smooth and look great and for more fun get a blue-tooth controller (in my case ps3 controller) and get a cheap micro hdmi to hdmi cable and play games on your tv.

Everyone has covered the tablet and it does work rather well however, the WIFI is probably worse than described.First off, in some cases you could be sitting ON the router and it still wouldn't work, ASUS has essentially no fix for it - they have tried this that and the other to pretty much no avail and those that own these are just plain stuck.  However, what makes this even worse is that if there is a weak WIFI sginal that the 201 can't stay connected to (oh it will find it and try - forever it will try) and you want to hook up to your phone WIFI that won't happen either because it keeps looking back and forth and won't attch to either.....

Many circumstances after owning for a week  lead me to return my Asus Prime Transformer.  First of all, I am an Expert in using the Android OS.  This tablet out of the box was an error.  I tried to register the tablet and the serial number was not recognized by the manufacturer's website.  I called Asus and they manually registered the tablet for me.  I purchased the Ipad 2 for my daughter and registration was an ease and a registration link was part of turning on the Apple Ipad 2 for the first time.  This not the case for my Asus, I had to look for product registration.  Secondly, half of the apps I use on OS Gingerbread were not available on my tablet.  Either they were not Tegra 3 qualified or ICS qualified, but the apps were not available in Google Play (formerly Android Market).  To be exact...USPS and UPS apps are not available on tablets running ICS.  I use these two apps extensively and my tablet was crippled without these two apps.  Of course, I could have gone to the internet on my tablet, but this was a downside for me.  This defeats the purpose of a $500 tablet.  This is fragmentation.  Manufacturers are building t tablets in record numbers and specs to include quad core.  But the majority of the apps that run Gingerbread are not available for tablets running ICS.  I don't know the reason why but I relate to either ICS or quad core functionality.  The problem I see is that manufactures are building tablets to enormous specs without an OS to run on. Develops are not producing apps that only 1% have the OS to run on, meaning ICS.  Developers are not producing apps with quad core capability..This is the fragmentation that is wreaking havoc across Android .  GPS, all but non existence on the Prime.  Although the user manual says there is an icon for turning on the GPS, no such feature is available on the tablet.  The feature was removed.  Wi-Fi--so-so.  Not as good as I would like to see for a tablet costing $500.00 plus dollars.  After comparing the two, meaning my daughters Ipad2 and my Asus Prime Transformer, the new Ipad would be my choice--even though the Ipad2 lacks many features the Prime has...like Flash, HDMI out, sd card, to name a few.  But the IOS is not fragmented.  All the apps are available for download, no matters which Ipad you have and the apps look and have more functionality than the apps in Android.  For example, the USAA banking app is ten times better than the USAA app in Android.  I have to admit and having been an Android fan since the days of Cupcake and Donut, I have to admit that the Apple Ipad (new one) will be my choice of a tablet.  Maybe in a couple of years when developers start producing apps to run on ICS along with quad core processors may the Prime Transformers be a contender--It's just way before it's time launching on Android.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Washed out screen due to backlight bleeding", "Author": "Jerry Cuevas Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3OQKIWY9TIF99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item and waited several weeks for it to arrive from Amazon.

It was meant to redefine mobile computing in its entirety, but fell just short.This device's hardware are off the charts. With the specs given in November, it had my jaw dropped! I received the device nearly day 1.I've always been the biggest fan of Android (even an early adopter of ICS via cyanogenmod). Quite frankly, this device has me looking more towards a Windows 8 slate for my next tablet purchase.I use this device for work, school and leisure. When I first got the device, I was plagued by the dreaded WIFI bugs. If bluetooth and wifi are on simultaneously, they weaken each other significantly. Many other users have the same problem, and we continue to have it to this very day. Also, the WIFI antennas are surrounded by a metal body (poor design) which decreases WIFI reception entirely. My Samsung Galaxy S 2 gets around 100 more feet in reception on my campus (no joke), and around 30 more feet on a wireless home router. Also, the poor design decreases GPS reception completely (to the point where they actually took it off the device spec list - even though my receipt says GPS device).In terms of software, ASUS is improving it slowly. There were many bugs in Honeycomb, and even more in ICS. Very recently have they updated the device and removed a considerable amount of bugs, but there are still more, and they've even created new ones. Most bugs are bearable, but annoying.ASUS support is even worse. I would have attempted to RMA the device in hopes for a fix, but user reports are awful. Some have taken up to 2 months to get the device back. Some have even been returned devices with cracked screens. I've even seen circumstances where ASUS claims of customer induced damage (but the pictures of the damage are all in the exact same spot, with nearly identical damages). I use this device every day, so losing it for 2 months is not an option.For a NORMAL user, as in, slightly techy, I would say you could get the device and be happy with it. But, you could get a much cheaper device for the same average quality.  For an ADVANCED user, I would advise to not get this device and wait. More and more TEGRA 3 devices will be released over the upcoming quarter.In my personal opinion: the device was great at first! It was exactly what I needed. Once I became somewhat dependent on it, is when the bugs (hardware and software) really started to take their toll on me, and by then, there was no going back. I do love the device and it is very much usable, but it can be extremely frustrating to know your device works decently at optimal circumstances, and poor in any other.

I am currently typing on an Asus brand laptop. I was thrilled to be able to own a cutting edge tablet from such a trusted and reliable company. With that out of the way, on to the review of this product:This was supposed to be my and my sons Xmas gift last year, but the pre-order was not filled until a few weeks later in January, so the first experience I had with this product was an annoying wait. After receiving the item and getting used to the interface and doing all the updates I became very concerned about the poor WiFi reception only a room away from my router, and barely usable at the other end of the house in my living room. This not being a problem for any of my gaming consoles/PC's. On top of this there were tons of basic stability issues, especially with the browser. I had not responding messages come up every time I scrolled pages and randomly with most any functions and frequently had to force close. The Play Store is also fairly unusable on the system.I originally thought these were just early issues and they would improve... and they did, somewhat. The not responding issues have gotten better, but are still fairly frequent. I have since gotten an android phone (HTC One VX) and it is so much faster and more stable and fun to use I can't believe what I was missing out on. I pretty much just used the Prime for my son who is 3 and autistic as a therapy and learning device now. Well, up until last week, but I'll get to that.Other problems with the system include 5+ minute boots from the moment I first received the thing, way longer than my PC's take to boot! Also, randomly, it refuses to start and I will think it has finally kicked it, only to have it power on again the next day. Then there is the proprietary charger and the software based charging that often fails to work. Basically I plug the device in and it won't charge. And then another day I try and it will. I think what needs to happen is the power needs to run out completely before the charger is able to work due to the charging software crashing? This is just a guess, but it's quite annoying to tell a young child with autism that the computer isn't working because it doesn't have enough power to boot and it won't charge.Then there are the crashes that cause me to have to restart entirely, usually related to icons refusing to load and the OS basically being frozen. This again has never happened on my phone. On the Prime it could sometimes happen multiple times in one evening. After holding in the power button multiple times it would eventually reset, usually to power back on after a few more power button presses... then load for maybe 8 minutes and then turn right back off. At this point the system would then proceed to get super hot, so hot it would burn your hand to touch it. When attempting to turn it back on in this state, it would just start booting again. This happened often. I was very worried the components were being fried, but I didn't know what to do to keep it from getting hotter and hotter as it happened when the system was off! It never got hot like this when it was on.So after a year of just dealing with my 500 dollar gift barely functioning (was unable to play tons of commercial apps I tried due to games freezing and rapidly flashing after playing for a few minutes) and never once dropping or abusing the system (not a slight scratch or mark anywhere on the thing), the screen broke. While against the side of my couch sitting next to me while I used my DS. My son was in bed and I had just used it to check my email. I wanted to try to play a quick round of scramble before bed and picked it up to use it and saw what looked like something white on the screen. Having a not so smart moment I touched it to see what it was. I still have a piece of glass lodged in my thumb. I am completely unable to determine how the screen could have possibly broken while sitting on the couch next to me. I wasn't touching it. I wonder if the system getting so hot sometimes caused a weakness in the glass? I really have no clue, but we can't afford another right now and my son who is very set in routines and who loves the thing has been miserable all weak. I am afraid to just tape it and let him play with it as the cracking could become worse. It's a very odd pattern, like it got crushed in one area, as if someone had taken say a screwdriver and just drove it down to the corner of the screen.So anyway, long story short, this item has been a giant string of problems and disappointments and now I have to find it in the budget to find another tablet for my son so that he can continue to benefit from what the technology offers him. I can honestly say I will never buy another Asus product again, 500 dollars is a lot for a single income family, I am not currently able to work as I take care of my son and we have tons of therapies to pay for each week and drive him to. Really did not need this problem on top of everything, but that's life. One unhappy customer may not mean a lot to Asus, but a product like this with so many negative reviews is sure to make others think twice before buying from then.We had actually been considering a Nexus 7 for my sons birthday, but I'll be looking at another brand now, especially as that tablet was also full of early problems. Don't release products before they are ready Asus, it really has affected your reputation.Edit: Just remembered 2 other problems. The camera is broken, not sure how long as I really didn't use it, but a few months ago when I went to use it it was just a green screen and hasn't worked since. Also since summer, the screen won't rotate into portrait mode anymore on the desktop and a few other times when it should, but will rotate fine in games that support rotation and accelerometer games play fine. No idea.Another Edit: The tablet no longer charges properly at all, it will only \"trickle charge\". Basically it takes about 24 hours to charge the thing up and an hour or two to use up the charge. It's become my sons tablet as I can no longer be bothered with it and the battery issue at least serves to keep him from using it too much.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifi Issue Kill This", "Author": "H.

I bought it because it sounded like it was going to be a faster product than anything out on the market.  I've now had my Prime for about 5 months.  I've found the speed to be terrible.  Nearly every web page I open I will get a box that comes up and asks me if I want to wait or close the browser, again, nearly every web page.  It happens on many different WIFI networks I usually use and the pages can be graphic intense or not.  So it's not an issue with WIFI speed or the pages I'm opening, it comes down to something in the software being run.  On the flip side when I'm running a game on the unit the speed and graphics are terrific.  Nearly like a PC.Mechanically, the screen cracked a couple of weeks ago.  I bought the keyboard thinking it would act as a screen protector.  Just opened it up one morning and the screen had a crack right across the top about 1\" below the upper edge.  Didn't drop it or drop something on it.  Very disappointed that this happened.  Reading on the web that others had their screens replaced for $250, I figure I'll live with it for a while until I scrap this junk and buy an iPad.As far as the keyboard, the battery life isn't nearly as good as people claim.  There is no way you'll get more than 10 hours of actual use time.  I would put my use time at something around 5-6 hours with both batteries fully charged.  Also, the mechanical integrity of the keyboard is very poor.  Many of the keys don't register when pressed and require going back to correct spelling.  It was a ripoff.BTW, I'm writing this on my laptop not my tablet as that would be too painful.

I have spent a day or so with the thing, and I knew going into it that it was basically just a giant smart-phone, but I am not impressed.  Things I wish I knew...you can only run one app at a time, so if I am watching a youtube video for a song I like and want to go check my email, the song stops.  Also, Wifi is much weaker than my laptop.  The first youtube video I tried took about 30 seconds of buffering before it would start, from the same chair where my laptop would previously start a video instantaneously.  I was uncomfortable holding the thing and trying to type & navigate the web.  If you set it on your lap, you have to crane your neck to see it, otherwise you hold it with one hand and use the other on the touch screen, I guess. Also, there is no brief tutorial or help on how to use the thing.  Even 4 or 5 simple tips when I first turned it on would have been helpful, since I am new to tablet using.  You know, like where and how to load apps.  By contrast, I love my Windows phone (HTC Trophy).  It is easy and slick and intuitive.  Another complaint with Android in general is that I am having trouble loading some apps.  There is a pre-loaded netflix app, but when I try to use it I have to fix some security error, which I have no idea how to do since there was no brief tutorial or help option that I know of.  Also, the sound was advertised as stereo, but there is just one speaker, so i dont see how that is stereo.  I actually bought the PRime instead of the 301 because it had the stereo speakers, but really doesnt.All that said, some of my complaints are with tablets in general, android in general, and maybe some are unique to the Asus Prime.

There are just too many issues with this device and all of them are due to Asus' terrible software. Here are my main complaints:- Laggy interface: ICS optimized apps do OK on this tablet, but everything else is sluggish and rough, considering the horsepower on tap that is just inexcusable. Even MX Video Player, an ICS optimized app and the only hardware accelerated video player for Android, cannot play HD video correctly with the hardware video decoder. What exactly is that 12 core GPU in there for again?- Internal storage read/write performance: Anything you do that accesses the internal storage causes the entire system to slow down and stutter, so installing or updating an app, unzipping a file, moving files from folder to folder causes the tablet to become practically unusable while it's doing any of these things.- USB transfers: Transferring files to this thing from your computer is nearly impossible, I wanted to put the pictures from my phone on the tablet, about 4 GBs total, I could pull these files off my phone in about 30 seconds, but the same files would have taken about a day to upload to the tablet. USB transfer speeds are crippled, again due to to poor I/O performance of the internal storage. I've had to use AirDroid to transfer files, which still takes a couple of hours to move those 4 GBs.There is also the hardware issues with WiFi and GPS, the GPS is a non-issue for me since I always have my phone with me, but the WiFi performance for me has just been OK but not great.With the recent tablet announcements in the last few weeks I'm going back to the sidelines, I'll even consider the Transformer Infinity if it seems they learned from their mistakes, but mark my words: The Prime is nothing more than a prototype, released for no other reason than to make a statement about Asus' hardware designs and to be the first quad core Tegra device. This is proved by the fact the before the Prime was even readily available at retail there was a better Transformer already developed and ready with a better screen and a better antennae design.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shiny is about it", "Author": "C. Conchi", "ReviewID": "RKNHLWVFXH9V4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never write reviews since there are more than enough people who are happy to post their opinion about an item.  I'm writing this one since this is by far the biggest technology disappointment I've ever had, and I want people to avoid making the mistake I made by going for a brand new shiny unproven product that has been hyped up so much that it had me drooling over it for months.  If you purchased a Prime and got one of the good ones, or if this is your first tablet and you think it meets your expectations.... great... good for you... enjoy your tablet.  I, on the other hand, got one of the many devices plagued by numerous defects.  After researching tablets for over a month, I purchased an Asus Transformer TF101 for my father.  When I configured and set it up, I was highly impressed and I believe it to be one of the best tablets out there for the money.  This made me drool over the prospect of getting a TF Prime for myself.  With all the glowing reviews from the geek sites, I figured why not treat myself and get the best out there.  I placed my order in mid December knowing that I wouldn't receive it for about a month.  After Google's Ice Cream Sandwhich OS was released for the Prime, I got more excited and started reading all the reviews about how it was functioning for users who already upgraded.  That's when I came upon numerous reviews complaining about poor GPS, WiFi connectivity, and ICS causing issues.  I hoped that this would not be the case for me.  After all, my new TF Prime had not been stocked yet, and Asus would have already started addressing the issues and have a solution in place by the time mine stocked/shipped.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  Upon, receiving my TF Prime, I was indeed impressed by the stunning look, feel, weight, and screen.  I charged it up, and downloaded ICS update.  No sooner than the tablet downloaded ICS did it start to freeze, reboot every time I tried to open a standard app like the camera, 1 inch horizontal black lines plagued the screen, slow internet for the 20 seconds I was able to browse the web before it rebooted, and it litterally was unusable.  I am a technology guy so I know it wasn't a user error of interrupting the upgrade to ICS while it was loading or doing something like rooting it before upgrading... or any of the other basic mistakes most people make when they complain about their devices not working properly out of the box.  When I called Asus to troubleshoot, yes - they were nice, but NO they could not recommend any fixes for me but to do a factory reset of the item... which I had already tried 3 times and which made the issues worse.  They told me that I could send it (out of pocket of course) to the Asus repair facility, and it would be 'fixed' but not replaced with a brand new one unless it was truly in a state in which it could not be repaired... so great... best case scenario is that it is completely defective (hardware) or else I just paid full price for a refurbished model... in addition to the fix of replacing the back with the TF700 plastic back to 'improve on' the GPS and WiFi issues... they said they only had grey backs and not the Champagne... so again, great.  It's like bying a red Ferrari and finding out the carbon fiber hood makes the thing slow and clunky, then having them tell you they can replace it with a new plastic Orange hood that doesn't even match the original color.  Anyhow, I've returned my Prime to Amazon for a full refund... and now I see that they've jacked up the price on these by $115????  What a gip... and to find out that Asus is now launching the TF700 series near the end of Q2 with the only real enhancement being the front facing camera going form a 1.2 to 2.0 Mega Pixel and the upgraded screen resolution which is nice, but on a 10 inch. tablet is a bit much and a huge battery drain for an extra $100 that they will be charging for the 16GB model.  I might hold out for the TF700 which I'd recommend anyone cosidering a Prime, but then again for that price, I might just buy an original Transformer TF101 series, and get a docking station all for $350 less.  Asus dropped the ball on this one... and being in Software/Hardware Quality assurance business myself... I can tell you this whole launch reeks of Asus going on a complete money grab with a FUBAR release schedule, numerous missed deadlines, rushed manufacturing process to get these out to meet the demand caused by the buzz, ZERO QA on the machines being pushed out, and then realizing they've failed massively and as a result rushing to launch the TF700 in hopes people will forget what a huge bust the TF Prime was.  If I'm and Apple marketing person, I'm using Asus as prime example on why customers should by an iPad 3 and not believe the hype that other tablets are catching up to them.... and that is hard for me to say being that I'm not a fan of Apple products.  I know even the best company occasionally has a few an occasional issue with one of their products, but I've read so many reviews and similar cases in the transformer/Asus forums that I know this isn't one of those isolated cases.  Again, save your money... go with an original TF101 with docking station for $450 or wait for the TF700 - 16GB for $600... or if you must have a tablet now look at the Samsung Galaxy or something along these lines...", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS needs to work on it more", "Author": "stjcampisi", "ReviewID": "RH0K5TOY2QHTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung Galaxy tab and thought I was upgrading when I bought my Transformer.

The tablet comes with 6 really bad songs on it for examples. You dont have permission to remove them. You cant get rid of them. I contacted ASUS and was told there is no way to delete them from the tablet. WTF???? I was told to download ASUS sync and use it to delete them. So I did, only ASUS sync does not sync music, it only syncs contacts and calender. What a waste of time. I use Windows Media Player on my computer. It sees the TF 201...sometimes. I usualy have to disconnect and reconnect the tablet several times. When it does it will let me see the music thats stuck on it, it will let me set up a sync from the media player, but when I try to sync it, it starts the first song and just stops. It will just sit there at 0% until it finaly quits and tells me there is an unknown error. With my Galaxy, it was all plug and play and I had no issues with syncing music or video. Ive contacted ASUS several times, and get cut and paste answers that have absolutely no effect.LOCKING UP: My tablet locks up at least once a day, for no apparent reason. I have to hold the power button to restart it. I got a notice that there was a firmware update, it downloaded until it got to 44% and just stopped, it never finished, wouldnt clear, and wouldnt restart.

There are lots of crashes and glitches...too many to put in this review.

So I have had nearly a month to mess around with it. But it is still not quite there yet. So I have decided to sell it. I'll explain why.1. Price - I am not saying that the hardware for the TF 201 is not worth the asking price, the build quality is really nice. But for $499 you should expect to get more performance. Compared to all of the other tablets on the market with Tegra 2 chips, the Prime is no comparison with its Tegra 3 processor, it makes everything faster and snappier. But for $499 ($650 if you add the keyboard dock) you can get a pretty awesome, and powerful laptop. The screen is excellent and is very bright, though some of the colors do seem kind of odd, but that is a matter of opinion. The Prime also takes really good pictures for a tablet, good 1080p video too.2. Web Browsing - I have upgraded to Android 4.0 (ICS) and I am still not happy with the tablet. I am not sure if it is the Android OS or the hardware but I just want more from this device. I want super fast web browsing, that's not buggy. But the Prime just cannot deliver in this area. Too often have I experienced numerous issues while browsing on the Prime, browser crashes/freezes, not loading properly, slow, etc. Considering web browsing is mainly what I use the Prime for, this is a major issue, ultimately the issue that made me sell the tablet.3. Gaming - This is kind of an android complaint in general. I love high quality gaming, but Android gaming is different, in some ways good, in some ways bad. Android has tons and tons of free and cheap games, some are fun, some are just dreadful. But some games are just not made for touch screens. Such as FPS games or games that require many different controls. Also, the quality of Android games is definitely on the rise, but is still no where near PS3, Xbox 360 or PC gaming. The complexity, story, graphics, sound, online play are all way behind that of consoles and PC. I think this will probably catch up in a few years but it is miles behind what is considered awesome today. Developers just don't spend the same amount of time and resources on an Android game as they do a PC or console game. The biggest selling point of Android tablets is its extreme portability and lower power usage (battery life) and developer support. I think they set out to reproduce and laptop like experience in a much smaller and slimmer form factor, but the truth is, they just cannot do it yet. Android gaming is super cheap, yes. But I prefer quality over quantity. You can buy a $2 game for your tablet that may give you 10 hours of entertainment. Or you could just buy a $5-50 well polished PC game on your laptop, that not only looks amazing and can do multi-player, but it will provide you with endless hours of entertainment. Like I said before, Android gaming just cannot produce the same type of quality content, period. I am going to give this area a few years to mature, I have high hopes for the future, but its just not there yet.4. Productivity - Without the dock, productivity on the Prime is more like a novelty, no one really buys it for this purpose. You can do actual work on the device, but it is sometimes very painful and slow. Sure there are all types of Word editors, PDF viewers, PPT viewers, etc. But compared to their Windows 7 cousin, they just cant come close. In any possible way. There is currently no substitute for a real keyboard, it is required to be productive. It takes about 4-5 times as long to type an email on a tablet when compared to a laptop or netbook. The virtual keyboard is a pain to use, it is hard to type without messing up often. The keyboard dock would have to be a must if you plan on being productive with this tablet.If you don't care about any of the issues I have mentioned in this review, then by all means, the Prime may just be great for you. But for someone who demands great performance and value, and alot of bang for your buck, you might want to stick with a laptop.The TF-201 is a big step forward for the tablet market in general, its processor makes it a much more capable device than its predecessors. But it's an expensive novelty that has no real function in my life, nor does it really excel at doing one particular thing in general. So my advise is, let it mature, it will be great in a few years, but its not quite there yet.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Prime versus Ipad2, Guess who wins?", "Author": "rdkmco \"rdkmco\"", "ReviewID": "R15WBKX252NJPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was real excited about receiving my Prime and did a lot of research before I purchased from this web site.  My wife has an Ipad2 and I have an IPod touch, so I was really leaning toward the Ipad2, but did buy the Prime, even after reading some (many) of the negative reviews.  For the Android OS market, the Prime is probably the best on the market.  That being said, I can now also concur that there are issues with the device.  It is true the GPS was nonexistent.  I knew this BEFORE I purchased, but did not care at all because I was not intending to use the Prime as a GPS.  SO if GPS is REAL important to you, do not buy the Prime.  I also concur that the sound/speaker was inadequate.  I am amazed really that ASUS did not create TWO speakers with stereo sound.  The single speaker does not do justice to the unit.  In fact, it is quite low on every application - Movies were ok and so was music, but CHAT via SKYPE or YAHOO was excruciatingly low.  The earphone jack was fine and adequately loud.  The issues with Wi-Fi do exist somewhat, although I did connect every time all around my house.  As compared to my phone and laptop, the Prime did have trouble obtaining as strong signal.  Compared to the other Android tablets (Honeycomb or ICS), the Prime would be a top contender.  However the few mechanical issues reduce the overall rating.  Now to the software.  Ice Cream Sandwich is a nice system and I did enjoy the interface.  In deciding to rate the Prime, I am comparing directly to my wife's Ipad2 and am comparing similar programs.  Overall, I think there are better Apps from the iTunes Store rather than the Android market.  For my HTC Android phone, I have found the Android market Apps to be great actually, but for the Prime, not so much.  The ITunes Apps are much crisper and I feel higher quality as compared to the same ones on Android. In comparing my HTC phone to my iPod touch, I would also say there seems to more quality control over Apps from ITunes versus the Android Market. One of the BIG issues I had was that  I could NOT send email from my exchange account on my Prime and after searching the forums and online, this seems to be an issue as well.  This was most definitely a deal breaker for me.  (It was the second one - more on that later).  The same MPEG-4's I played on the Ipad2 were better than when played on the Prime.  Pictures also displayed better on the Ipad2 than the Prime.  I did not use the flash camera but the front facing web cam I am told by several people was low quality and grainy- (via Yahoo and SKYPE).But the real issue I had with the unit and the reason I sent back for refund, was that on several occasions the Prime would not charge.  The proprietary connection is flimsy at best and the actual connector and cable feel low quality.  The connector does not really slide in very far to the Prime and due to the design of the Prime case, the connector sort of \"hangs\" with not much support.  There is NO comparison to the way the Ipad2 and for that matter ALL the Apple products, charging cables connect. I cannot trust a device that only after a few days of use, indicated charging troubles.In summary I wanted to really like the Prime as it was about $150.00 less than the comparable Ipad2 32 GB.  If you have the money, I recommend the Ipad2.  If you don't, the Prime probably will do for you.  I just do not think the quality control is really there for the Prime and I have read several European sellers have ceased to carry the Prime until these issues are addressed.  In fact, ASUS announced a new tablet soon after the Prime was released late last year. One last but nonetheless important fact, is that there is an abundance of Ipad2 accessories out there.  In fact, virtually every store and website sell some form of Apple accessory.  Conversely, the Prime uses a proprietary charging and USB system/plug and accessories are virtually impossible to find and when you do find them, are expensive.  The new Ipad3 is rumored to be out in early March and I am going to wait to see what the offerings are and either buy the Ipad2 if the prices are dropped or the new Ipad3.****update: I have now purchased an iPad 2 and even more strongly believe the Asus Prime is an inferior unit. Many people leave reviews based on no experience with another competing product.  I am sure there are people who love the prime who have never tried or owned an iPad . Many people talk about the kool-aid Apple likes to give, but I fell for the Android kool-aid. If you are able to buy an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb before they are gone, you wold do much better than buying the Prime. Each tablet has some differences, but overall I have fund the iPad far superior when it comes to build quality, OS, ease of use and much better App quality.  The iPad feels and operates much more solidly. Additionally there are significantly more iPad accessories than the prime, or any android tablet.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disapponted... weak Wifi signal and dull screen color", "Author": "Tuan-Khanh Tran", "ReviewID": "R2IVJ23L49P6WF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered mine from Amazon and was very excited to get it two days ago (2 weeks earlier than promised).

Just downloaded Android 4.0.3, Ice Cream Sandwich.  Speedtest seems faster, but still not up to other tablet and older Samsung notebook. But there is a whole section for DEVELOPER OPTIONS now!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are so many good things about the Asus Prime tablet, but the weak wifi makes it almost less than satisfactory.Here are some of the good things I noticed today after 7:55am delivery.1.  Looks - It looks beautiful, it's light, thin, and very attractive.2.  Screen is very bright, even at half brightness.3.  It seems fast, EXCEPT for the soon to be mentioned wifi problem.4.  The included Glowball game has amazing graphics.5.  Setup went amazingly well, and it updated firmware after asking.Now onto the wifi problem.  Much of the computing in our home is in our family room, about 20-25 feet from our wireless ATT Uverse router.  Every other device (older notebook, HTC Flyer) gets 10 Mbps or so at Speedtest.net in the family room .  Not the ASUS Prime, at this distance the ASUS Prime get about 10% of that speed, or about 1 Mbps.  Move closer to the wireless, and the speed is fine at about 6 feet.  12 feet away and the speed degrades a lot.  This is just totally unacceptable, there is a consistent problem with the Prime unless it is not almost next to the wireless.EDIT January 10:  Or put another way.  Samsung notebook gets 4/5 bars in family room.  HTC Flyer tablet gets 3/4 bars right now.  Asus Prime gets 1/4 bars or 2/4 bars in same place.  But the main thing is, unless Asus Prime is VERY near the router, the download speed is degraded.  (Maybe some of the experts can address this, but the upload speeds are all good, on all devices, even the ASUS Prime at all distances, all devices have upload speeds about 1.5 Mbps.)Called ASUS support (in Jamaica!), they are aware of this wifi problem (as well as the GPS problem).  No solution at this time, but please keep checking usa.asus.com SUPPORT for further information.And then today, ASUS announces a new Prime virtually the same.  Same dimensions, but better screen, one new camera, and fixes for the GPS and wifi problems.BUT WHAT WILL ASUS DO FOR US, TO FIX OUR NON-FUNCTIONING PRIMES?  ASUS, could you please fix ours, before you come out with a new model?  Please....I was wondering if I installed a WIFI ACCESS POINT in our family room to add to the existing ATT Uverse wifi router, would that solve this problem for me, at least at home?

The reception was terrible, and as a result, so was the download speed, and I couldn't justify keeping it around, so I sent mine back after two weeks.The device had a great looking display, and felt solid. It seems as if the design of the tablet got priority over the functionality. The added ports on the dock were nice, too. It definitely 'felt' nice and sturdy. I tried to get the GPS to work but it failed to lock (even on wifi), although I didn't care too much about it in the first place. Some of the software installed on it was also pretty nice (Polaris Office). Overall though, it didn't meet my expectations.I just could not justify spending a little under $700 for the tablet and dock to find out that it didn't work consistently for web in my home under the best of circumstances. That along with the fact that ASUS not only put out a product they knew was faulty to begin with, but had the nerve to show off it's replacement under the same name before the current model was even available. I also thought that the app selection from the android market was pretty poor, especially after the ICS update. It seems as if a lot of apps either didn't work with ICS, or hadn't been optimized for it yet, so they were unavailable in the market.To be honest, I just didn't get the whole 'tablet' thing. I had the keyboard dock which was nice because I didn't have to hold the tablet. It also gave a significant boost to the battery life (the dock has it's own battery). I found myself essentially using a $700 10\" android NetBook. I figured that I might as well just get a laptop so I can get more use out of it.

There were a lot of professional reviewers writing glowing reviews about the Prime. I couldn't wait to get it! Bottom line, it's a beautifully engineered disaster. Seems companies like Asus are hell bent on copying or bettering the iPad. Problem is Asus threw out all engineering principles in the process.An all-metal back simply blocks radios signals---GPS, Wifi and Bluetooth radios. This physical attribute CANNOT be addressed by software updates, which is why Asus is removing GPS----how long before they remove the other radios? Watch for a 3G version of this tablet to be released with a PLASTIC back instead of METAL.Pros:+ Nice, bright screen+ Good battery life+ Awesome keyboard dock (feels like a Macbook Air)+ Only one dead pixel. No light bleed.+ Awesome game performance from Shadow Gun (very fun to play with my PS3 controller attached).Cons:- GPS does not work (Asus confirmed). So much for using Google Maps or Navigation while traveling.- Wifi is weak (up to 10x weaker than my Xoom. Measured using wifi analyzer app.)- Bluetooth works, but cannot be used with Wifi (ie, can't stream Pandora to a bluetooth speaker.- Haptic feedback is faulty.- Software is sluggish (Honeycomb is a real dog). Maybe ICS will help.- Ergonomic it's not. Corners are sharp, almost weapon-like. Don't want to throw this than around!- Bad placement of micro SD card slot. The card will easily pop out by accident...and you wouldn't notice.- Fragile connections (audio jack, AC jack, HDMI jack) due to the thin, beveled design.Bottom line, it's getting returned. Even with Ice Cream Sandwich, this tablet will never overcome its current flawed design. I'll wait for one of the hundred other Tegra 3 tablets coming out this year. I'm begging for an ERGONOMIC tablet instead of shiny metal. It's like tablets are shiny keys for us babies to play with. I wish companies would value function over form. Thanks Apple.

Using the GPS while traveling in a car: The roof of a car, the insulation, bridges and other factors can affect signal reception.2. High density areas with large buildings and structures that can block line of sight communication with GPS satellites.Since this email ASUS took GPS off the US site.

Not lighting fast but acceptable.  After about 20 minutes of playing around going to the web opening a couple tabs.  Downloading an app or two from the market.  The tablet starts acting like a 10 year old pc with malware on it.  You pretty much have to reboot the device to get the speed back.  Actions tend to get stuck and you keep clicking thinking you missed the button/link.  Then a few moments (could be 20 seconds) the actions start popping.  That was when I went to bookmarks and tried clicking on amazon's link.  tapped 3-5 times and nothing.  I gave up and went to the address bar and typed in am... then the bookmark worked.  Amazon loaded then I would start navigating and every time I clicked a link it pulled my click from the bookmarks and I had to reboot to get out of the link loop.=================Bluetooth=================I have not been able to connect anything to this via Bluetooth yet :(Tried IPhone and Car stereo.

I had some trouble finding it on the Internet but Asus has a utility for this! My initial reaction was great; however,the instructions are abismal and of course we can't get it to work.  So I created trouble tickets with ASUS Support it can't be that big a deal, support will be able to get me through this easily.  WRONG, I've had no response from them what-so-ever in a week and a half.  This is totally absurd and abismal lack of any support what-so-ever!My view at this point would be to avoid this like the plague due to lack of support from ASUS.
