{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Nice Android Tablet!", "Author": "Lana C", "ReviewID": "R5Z3VQ7YW4NS0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hello, I didn't buy this tablet through Amazon as it was a gift for my birthday. They come in an array of colors and mine is purple. :) After discovering that Google Play wasn't pre-installed, I came to Amazon to read the reviews in case someone had posted a tip on how to download GP to the tablet, but none of the reviews addressed that.So, I decided to share how I downloaded it. I found this video and used it. It took about 15 minutes. Make sure you choose the correct version for your OS, i.e., Android 4.0 or 4.0.4 (mine), and so on. :)[...]This tablet is great for its class. It has a slight delay of maybe ummm 2 seconds when an app is tapped. It's processor isn't super fast (a nano second), but it's just fine for me. Now that I was able to download my favorite apps, I can watch HBOGO, Showtime and videos very well. It's camera isn't the best, but other reviews on the web say that the video portion is nice. :)  It's too large for me to use as a camera anyway. I have a Samsung G3 for that. :)I hope this is helpful!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Visual Land Connect 9\" Android 4.0 8GB Tablet", "Author": "Bert Murphy", "ReviewID": "R199QKKSX3IHGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Satisfied with the performance of the tablet.
