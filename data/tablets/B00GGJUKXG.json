If you want to play some android games, do websurfing, email, social media, and maybe watch videos, this is very good.  If you're buying it primarily as a e-book reader, I wouldn't recommend it, and if want the best possible speed or graphics, or want to do school or office work, you'll need something pricier, but this is a very good choice for an extra tablet to keep around the house for web browsing or to keep your kids off your own tablet.Design:  I'm surprised how much I like the functionality of the design.  It's basically a plastic shell with front and back cameras, a home button, and a series of ports.  The ports are quite functional - a probe power port, an microsd card slot, a 3.5 mm earphone jack, and a full size and mini usb ports.  I particularly appreciate that the Simban can charge through EITHER the probe power port or the mini usb port, which means I charge it with the variety of mini USB plugs I have laying around. 4/5Connectivity: It has wi-fi at the 2.4 gHz band, but no cell, gps, bluetooth, 5.0 wifi, etc.  That's enough to make it useful in a wifi enabled area, but be aware that you won't be able to use bluetooth accessories, only wireline ones.  It does make up for what somewhat with its wide variety of ports.  3/5Screen: The 800 x 480 screen is good but not great, even at the relatively small size.  Watching anime on netflix was a little blocky, although movies and tv shows looked pretty good for the 7\" size, and reading books on Kindle was a little blurrier than I'm used to.  If I were buying this primarily as an ebook reader or a platform to watch TV, I think I'd prefer to save up and buy a model with a 1200x800 screen, but this is great for games, web browsing, video chat, and is acceptable for occasional forays into literature or television.  3/5App Compatibility:  I ran it with a bunch of my favorite apps, and the dual core seemed to handle almost all of them like a champ.  Games like Hungry Shark or Angry Birds take several seconds to load, but then ran great, as did Netflix, Youtube, Kindle, Skype, chrome, the built-in mail program, myfitnesspal, etc.  Oddly, the only problems I had were with TVGuide, which crashed on opening, and Google Drive, which I couldn't install.  3/5.Overall, as I said, I think this is pretty good for what you pay.  If you want a platform for some basic surfing, videos and games, this is decent, as long as you appreciate that it won't run some apps.  Recommended for an entry level or backup tablet.Note: I received a review unit in return for an honest review.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great tablet for the price.", "Author": "elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R3AXHUUPYT7JYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son for Easter coming up.

This tablet has a beautiful display (7\") and displays images at 800x480 resolution. Text looks sharper, colors are more vivid, and games stand out. It comes with 512MB DDR2 ram memory and a 4 GB NAND FLASH hard drive for Storage. The camera comes with a rear webcam with Resolution 1 MP resolution. This tablet will not do as much as a Kindle HD Fire but it is perfect for simple application and games. I think this laptop would be great to use to play games or watch movies on.  I would definitely recommend this tablet.I have listed some more specifications that I considered important for this tablet.
