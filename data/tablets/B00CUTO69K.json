[...]For those who are looking at getting the best tablet out there at the moment, this is the one you should be looking at.My profile: Heavy tablet users for personal and business purposes.  I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF ) and use it 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.  Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.  For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle and iPad mini as they are the closest size to this HDX 7\"Speed (9/10):This is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD.  Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in.  This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.  It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.  The screen is in true HD 1080p (1920x1080).  This means any HD content I throw at it will view in its intended resolution.  The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.  I have this Kindle hanged in the middle of the car and at any seat it is view very clearly.  Last year's model was not as clear as this.  This is excellent for my minivan with my kids watching all the HD movies.  The brightness of the screen is also much brighter than last year's modelSound(8/10):The sound system in this Kindle Fire HDX is using Dolby Digital Plus with virtual 5.1 surround sound.  That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more \"angular\" than last year's device.  It's slightly rougher to hold in the corners than last year's model due to sharper edges though I doubt any users will hold their tablet by their corners.  The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).  This mean you can hold this for longer time without fatigue.The power and volume button placement on this Kindle Fire HDX is interesting.  It is behind the device which allows it to hide away from front view.  However, this can cause user to accidentally hit the on/off button or the volume button when not being careful.  Aesthetically it is great but it is definitely not a practical solution when you are trying to use this on the go.It does look sturdy enough to survive minor drop but I highly recommend getting a case for it.  Those sharp corners seems more prone to dents than round corners for last year's model.Battery (6/10):This is probably the biggest drawback for this device.  The battery life is not as good as last year's model.  This is quite logical as last year's HD has a 4400mAh battery while running 720p while this HDX runs Full HD 1080p but runs only on a 4500mAh battery (only 100mAh more than last year).  The 1080p screen pulls a lot of power vs last year's model when the screen is on, especially when running HD videos.  I'm able to achieve 5 hours of heavy use compare to 7 hours for last year's Kindle Fire HD at medium brightness with Wi-fi on all the time.  I tend to bring around an external battery pack but prefer something that is integrated (like a battery case)Software & software compatibility (8/10):The amount of app is still lacking compare to App store or Play store but has been steadily increasing which is a great sign. Games and software boot time has increased noticeably and compatibility is not an issueSilk browser has definitely improved compare to last year's tablet with multiple tabs actually now usable on the HDX.  For last year's version, it is practically unusable after 2 tabs due to the lack of hardware resource on the tablet (especially when the website is not optimized for mobile use).  The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.  I'm guessing some of these apps are only optimized for last year's dual core.I haven't got the opportunity to use Mayday yet but will review about it once I get more update on this.Complimentary Accessories (3/10):For all smart devices, one of the most important time is the number of accessories available.  At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.  This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.  Also the lack of case selection is quite astonishing for a flagship product on Amazon.  Hope there will be more cases such as battery case (due to above battery problem) or rugged case come out soon.Price (9/10):I got the special offer model at 16Gb (lowest end model) and it is enough for me to use.  The special offer ads are not intrusive like last year's model and sometimes does reveal some items I want. Compare to the ipad mini, this is practically a steal.  For those with the Nexus 7, it is quite comparable in price.Conclusion in one sentence: Amazon's iPad mini killer (8.5/10)For people who are justifying if this is a good upgrade, I say YES to that.  The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.  The whole user experience just improve drastically with the HDX.It use to be, for Kindle Fire HD, you will trade low price for slow performance, stutter and lag.  It honestly makes you think twice if the price is really worth all that poor experience.For HDX, this is no longer the case.  You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini. To me, the HDX is seriously Amazon's iPad killer.  It really marks how well Amazon has done to make themselves a worthy competitor in the tablet market. I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7\" and the 8.9\" HDX.  I also been using an iPad Air 16Gb Wifi and here are some updates, particular on the negative points mentioned previously.App Store - not so refined still.  Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.  There are some freebie deals during cyber monday which I jumped (who doesn't like free stuff?)but still nothing that either the Apple App store or Google Play don't have.  Amazon App store really needs some exclusive apps to become a \"must get\" device.Now comes the bad part - I tried to download Magic 2014 game (big fan of Magic the Gathering since teen) from the Amazon App Store and the HDX 7\" downloads this rather slowly.  In fact, I noticed that when it reaches 50% it drops back down to 30% and redownloads the package again!  Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.  However, this can be problem to some people who have limited bandwidth per month and won't appreciate redownloading the same thing again 2 times (or more but I didn't catch that).Once it reaches 100%, the app store attempts to install the software.  It goes into \"Installing...\" state for a while (at least couple hours).  Knowing that there's something weird going on, I rebooted the HDX 7\".  Once I rebooted it, the software shows it was never downloaded!Perhaps there's some application specific problem with this game but this really shows a rather poor experience on the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.  I would expect a brand new top of the line Kindle Fire HDX would have ironed out simple bugs such as this but clearly, the Amazon App Store have 2 things it needs to work on:1) If this is an application specific error, Amazon needs to proactively test this release on all their devices before allowing it on the Amazon App Store.  It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.  Literally half the reviews on the review complain about this2) For these buggy release, Amazon should proactively pull this application from the store - the experience that lead to all the hours of download and wasted bandwidth got the user nothing in the end.  I can imagine some users with capped bandwidth or using their cell data to download will be furious if they know an app less than 1Gb rack them couple Gb of download.App Store is a big part of Amazon's Kindle Fire ecosystem and poor experience such as this really deters client in continued use, especially when all Kindle Fire are locked down to Amazon software ecosystem.  When you cannot even use the Amazon software ecosystem, any excellent hardware that this machine has becomes inaccessible and worse of all, a waste of user time to figure out.Now most people may say this criticism is related to the game(in this case, Magic 2014).  I believe this is not the case.  The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store). I start to find all other game download and installation questionable and my own usage time in App store browsing and purchasing drops drastically.From the above download experience, I did attempt to find some help from Amazon.  Here is where the more problem arises.Mayday - speaking to rep reading off outdated troubleshooting guidesAfter noticing my Magic 2014 download is gone, I attempted to contact Amazon through the Mayday button.  It's really my first time using this function so I don't really have any prior experience in using it.My Mayday call was picked up by Hayley (if I recall).  You can see a big Amazon logo in the background beside the customer service rep and she looks pretty friendly.  I explained my situation with the App store problem to Hayley but it seems she wasn't able to help; therefore I got transfer to a \"Tech Advisor\".  This Tech Advisor can't be shown in the video camera and asks for my credentials.  She also made me explain the problem again which I explained to Hayley (I would have thought someone will note down my problem as I need to use couple mins to explain again).  She then pulls something that you expect from an Indian Call Center by asking me to disconnect my internet modem.  I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.  I also mentioned that I am running a server at home and pulling the modem disconnects it from the Internet which breaks other services I am running unintentionally.  She seems to be stuck so she forward me to another representative (which if I heard correctly, it is the app store support rep).Once I got connected to the 3rd rep, they ask me to check my tablet date and time (which is correct).  This rep later ask me to press on options that are not the screen.  I suspected this rep was reading off an old Fire OS troubleshooting guide as I recently updated the Fire OS system and that some options and buttons are changed.  Given the large amount of time spent and there's no resolution, I went to my iPad air and downloaded the game successfully in couple mins while still have Amazon on the Mayday call.  I informed the 3rd tech support of this and thank them for their time although there was no resolution in the end.I very much prefer having the game on my Kindle HDX as the 7\" is perfect to bring outside for quick game or two, but the amount of time spent on troubleshooting and resource wasted on this is honestly not worth my time.  I ended up having to play this game on the iPad Air larger screen but also paid for in app purchase because the game itself is very good.It's a good lesson to learn that the whole software user experience needs to be more streamline and fluid on the Kindle.  Amazon has done successfully in the physical good purchasing section of the kindle fire (in fact I spent thousands of dollars more on Amazon.com using the kindle fire than on PC and very satisfy with the results) and that if it can bring the same experience to the software app store just like the physical store, Amazon will have a winner here. I use my machine extensively for magazine reading / internet browsing but when it comes to app download, I currently have my doubts if it will be another bandwidth hog and a waste of time.Display - blue hue appears but not very apparentSome people ask if the blue hue appears on the edge.  I can notice this if I'm reading off a totally white page (like a ebook or magazine).  However it is not very noticeable and that your eyes will ignore it eventually.  After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.  However, still not enough for me to really go through the day without bringing an external battery charger pack along.  At the moment, I am still looking for a 2 in 1 case + battery solution but it is not available.  I hope this can be my daily driver but without the battery life, it may just be a brick by the afternoon.Purchasing on Amazon.com - becomes addictive (Could be good or bad for some people!)I realized my spending on Amazon went up considerable compare to last year thanks to this Kindle Fire HDX.  I will be browsing it online and have these items saved on screen, constantly reminding me to get it.  Amazon really done a good job at this and really met, if not, exceed their goal in getting users buying from kindle fire.  With last year fire, the browsing experience on Amazon.com was not nearly as fluid as this year's HDX.  This makes it hard to keep my attention and urge to buy.  For people who wants a good purchasing experience, this Kindle Fire HDX will surely provide that.  For ones who need to save money, you may want to get your finger off the buy button!My overall rating stays the same as Amazon keeps knocking off prices for these machines making it still the best bang for the buck.Apr 28 Update - Family Use----------------------------------------------Got my kids an extra Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for them to play with.  My HDX 7\" is still running well with all my Instant Video and newsstand subscription inside.Since my kids don't treat their new toys with much care, I went and got them and myself a zerolemon EVA Case on Amazon.  The case is useful for prevent dents and major falls on your Kindle.  Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).  Case works great for hiding some of the blemishes of the kindle fire hdx 7\"Overall still satisfied with my machine and frankly been the best bang for the buck tablet i ever have.As mentioned, I will update this review periodically.  Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition", "Author": "NF", "ReviewID": "R2KVHBC7NMNOGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\". This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature. See http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH700DOM9WN3/ for my review of the Kindle Fire HD and http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPITHVTYLCZT for my review of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\".Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their \"Learn More\" link with the following info:\"To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"\"As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.\"If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore. I've also uploaded a user image here of my HDX with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00DOPNO4M/).The Amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the Amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. With the free Prime trial subscription, you can check out the Prime Instant Video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. For videos, music, and books, the Amazon selection is at or near the top of the list; for apps, much less so. 90% of the top 100 apps are available on Amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with Google or Apple.It's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall I put this ... less than stellar (look up Sturgeon's Law). If there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. The apps that will likely never become available on the Kindle Fire ecosystem are those apps that require Google services (i.e., anything that uses Google location services). One ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the Google Play store onto an Amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto Kindle Fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. If the app you are sideloading requires a Google service to work, though, it will not run on the Fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.Like the other Kindle Fire tablets, as well as the Apple iPad and the Google Nexus, the Kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-SD slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. This is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi; not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7\" tablet for the first time. Also, if all of your content is on iTunes or on Google Play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. As is true of Apple and Google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.Something new this year is the ability to download Prime Instant Videos. I verified that I can download Prime Instant Videos to my Kindle Fire HDX. However, that option is not available for all movies and TV shows. It looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. So, for example, I was able to download \"Casablanca\" but not able to download \"The Avengers\" even though both are part of the Prime Instant Video collection and both are available for free streaming.Update: Adding a bit from a reply in the comments: Amazon is clearly looking at the Enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. They've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for VPN and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to Exchange, and are including OfficeSuite for productivity. There are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both Google and Apple, particularly the latter, have more options. When VPN support arrives, I'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.So how does this Kindle Fire HDX differ from the previous generation Kindle Fire HD?Display: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). It's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. This display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and I would have to agree. Amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. While there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. For that, you'll need an eInk reader like the Kindle Paperwhite.Sound: As far as I can tell, the sound is about the same. This was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with Dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.Size and Weight: Noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" vs. 7.6\" x 5.4\" x 0.4\"). This is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.Processor: It's a *lot* faster (2.2GHz quad-core, top-of-the-line CPU, compared to 1.2GHz dual-core). This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. Every game I've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. Scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.Build: A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! This is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it. It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype. Like last year's model, there is no rear camera. If this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9\" version.HDMI Output: This is the one area where last year's model wins. Amazon has removed the HDMI out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how Amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). No other tablet that I'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.Battery Life: The same, at 11 hours. However, Amazon has added a special \"reading mode\" to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. I did not test this. For my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.Price: It's more expensive ($229 vs. $199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a $20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is $10. For what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.It has an updated OS and updated feature software (including the free unlimited Mayday customer support feature). The software updates include the ability to download some Prime Instant Videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved X-Ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with GoodReads (coming soon), and the like.Where I noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. The default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. The \"Recommended for you\" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. If you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the About the Author link, the Sync to Furthest Page Read link, and so on.The Kindle FreeTime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. If you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, Amazon has you covered.You can now also schedule \"Quiet Time\" on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your Words with Friends game.Mayday: This is a huge gamble by Amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. This isn't a feature for a techie like me and I didn't use it (although I was sorely tempted). From the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (Amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, I believe, although I can't help wondering what will happen on Christmas Day!). If you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the Kindle Fire HDX your best choice.How does this tablet rank against the competition? There are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the Google Nexus 7 and the just-announced Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.Display: All three devices have retina displays, with the 7\" HDX and the Nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8\" iPad Mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). All three displays are stunning. Amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. While this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (I'd pick the Paperwhite), I can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.It's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the HDX and Nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the iPad Mini is 4:3. Where this matters is watching video. If you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus. Apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.Sound: The HDX has Dolby Digital Surround Sound; the Nexus has Frauenhofer Surround Sound; the iPad Mini has stereo sound. The iPad Mini also makes the same mistake that Amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. The HDX, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.Networking: The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi. The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3\" x 5.0\" x 0.35\" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9\" x 4.5\" x 0.34\" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87\" x 5.3\" x 0.29\" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here. All three are small, thin, and light. The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory. The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon. These are all pretty powerful tablets.Cameras: Both the Nexus and the iPad Mini have 1.2 MP front and 5MP rear cameras. The HDX only has a front-facing camera. If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours. Amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.Expansion: None of them have a microSD slot; they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.Parental Controls: All of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. Amazon goes farther, though, with the Kindle Free Time and Kindle Free Time Unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. If you are buying a first tablet for a child, I'd choose the Kindle Fire HD. At only $139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the HDX has.Enterprise: As soon as Amazon releases its update, it will add VPN and network printing support. I believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. For real productivity, though, personally I'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.Support: Amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new Mayday system. Apple comes in second, with Apple and Amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. This is an area where Google does not shine.Price: The HDX and Nexus win this one, hands down. Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini. Neither Google nor Amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets; they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.From my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. If you already have Amazon Prime, the HDX is a no-brainer, with the access to the Prime Instant Video and the Kindle Owners' Lending Library. If you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, Amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. If you want apps, Apple and Google both have far more choices. If you want to watch movies, I'd pick either the HDX or the Nexus, as Apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. If price is a factor, then you should pick either the HDX or the Nexus.If you're heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iPhone or iPad and all of your content is on iTunes, the HDX really isn't the tablet for you. Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). If you love your Google Now or Siri, neither of which will ever be available on Amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.The bottom line: This tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into Amazon content and Amazon services. If you have Amazon Prime and you have Amazon eBooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. It took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.Update:Now that I have a Kindle Fire HD and a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, I'm in a little better position to talk about which one I'd recommend:You should get the Kindle Fire HDX if:- You're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- You need a camera for Skype or other video app.- You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- The size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- You think you will need the Mayday technical support.You should get the Kindle Fire HD if:- Price is a factor. $90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. This really is an excellent value for the money.- You want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- All you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing Words with Friends, and the like. While the screen on the HD isn't as stunning as is it on the HDX, this is still a true HD screen and it is very good.I check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer it.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Tablet with Sharp Display", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R23F7ENQQQYOVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for $229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the $199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the $500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire.  If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the \"regular\" Kindle Fire HD that is only $139.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates.  Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots.  Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book.  It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50% more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series.  After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9\" HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7\" Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My \"normal\" website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7\" Kindle Fire HD; yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker.  The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.  However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am).  While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time? - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.  The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined; if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same.  Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about; getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be.  If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it).  For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app</a> here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader.  Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment.  I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger!  If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for $20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.\"Mayday\" button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's \"regular\" model of the Fire, is the introduction of the \"Mayday\" button.  Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent.  I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say \"I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review.\"What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting).  A case is very important in order to protect your investment.  Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.  If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at $139.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Performance Worthy of Upgrade", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Goode & Eiffel\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO1X1FKICIE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Netflix Issue:When I first got the KFHDX, I had no problems with Netflix.

If you already enjoy the Amazon ecosystem, crave responsively fast performance, love gorgeous high resolution screens, wish the Kindle Fire were noticeably lighter, all without sacrificing battery life, while being able to enjoy more benefits of Amazon Prime, plus many other great new features, then stop reading, save time, and hit the \"Add To Cart\" button and buy it.I wanted the Amazon ecosystem. I am a Prime member. I also own a Nexus phone, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, and a few other Android devices, besides the original Kindle Fire. I don't mind that Kindle Fires don't have Google Play. I have other devices for that. My wife has the iPad 4.If this is going to be your only Android device, then the decision point is which do you prefer, the Google experience or Amazon experience? You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.  The overlap is not as great going the other way around. However, with the new Fire OS, you do get a few more Amazon exclusive experiences. Weigh your needs and wants to make the best choice.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**SERVICE: Amazon service applies directly to this device since it is their product. Amazon had a one day only FAA 15% off sale for some of the Kindles. I opened up the MayDay and asked the rep if they would honor the discount to those who had previously made the purchase. I was told it would only apply for those who had made the purchase within the last 7 days. That was not me. The MayDay rep didn't really do anything wrong, but she just appeared as if she didn't care and seemed a little annoyed at my request. Because the customer CAN see the MayDay rep, in my mind, it would be very important that person have a smile and warm demeanor. I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call. The initial rep was kind enough to refer me to someone who could make that decision. The manager I spoke with made the decision to honor a partial refund, even though the 64GB model I had purchased was not one of the sale items. I didn't get the full 15%, but it was about 12% discount. I thought this was more than fair and I appreciated the fact that Amazon allows their service managers the freedom to make these kind of decision.I believe there were two factors in play. 1. My standing with Amazon as a shopper (not that they don't care about all their customers, but it's nice to be appreciated for being a loyal customer!) 2. I was still within my return window. I could have sent it back, bought the sale version and still come out ahead, in theory. It would have been a headache and extra cost for all involved, and this service manager was keen enough to save us all that headache. Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If I could make one request, it would be that there was a dedicated link within Amazon Shop for writing reviews. I find typing to be one of the more accurate experiences on the Fire HDX, much improved over original Fire, and would like to be able to write reviews straight from the new Fire HDX.After about 1.5 months use, I have no buyer's remorse. This is a great tablet and a great buy for Amazon fans.====================FIRST IMPRESSIONS====================The packaging, for those of you who care, was like looking at movie poster. It got you interested, excited and ready to open it up. Once the cover was opened, box unsealed, and then opened, the inside was simple and elegant. Inside is the Kindle Fire HDX, the 5 watt charger (not 9 watt), and a nice thick 5 foot long USB to micro-USB cord. That's it.Compared to the original Kindle Fire, the HDX 7\" is noticeably lighter and easier to hold. The angled edge harmoniously eases the hand into a comfortable holding position. This is great to hold! When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic. It attracts fingerprints but it actually adds to the grip. The Amazon logo that is recessed in the back is also this same gloss and also helps make the device less slippery to hold. Well done. Fortunately, those are the only places that are glossy plastic.Turning on the device, Amazon already had associated the device with my account. The carousel was familiar. But swipe up and there was the typical icon view.Overall, the device is snappy and responsive. No more lag. I love it! The screen is gorgeous. It rotates quickly from landscape to portrait. It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade. So far, I like them - a lot. The Mojito OS does take some exploring to get fully adjusted. I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE DETAILS====================-------------------------APPS (Added 2 DEC 2013):-------------------------One of the biggest CONS people mention about the Kindle Fire line is the lack of Google Play, which primarily means limited app choices. This is true. There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX. For some this may be a deal killer. For me, it is not.Amazon has really gone above and beyond to make the lack of Google Play so much easier to take. Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins. Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app. In the month plus I've been an owner, Amazon has offered a ton of free apps, good ones! In some cases, they offered a free app, plus more free coins. There seems to be no shortage of ways to get free coins. Even when I do spend the coins (and not my real money yet,) I've made a handful of purchases where I got more coins back, in one case, 250 coins just for making my first purchase using coins. Some of these deals equate to discounts of 30% or more.My new Kindle Fire HDX is loaded with games and apps I'd likely not have purchased on my own. Between this give-a-way fest and their daily free apps, I have a lot of great choices for full paid apps. Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are. It's worth checking out, especially during this Thanksgiving/Christmas time period.The Kindle Fire is meant for consumption and Amazon has done a great job making sure I can do just that without breaking the bank. Amazon makes up for its shortcoming in the apps department by being far more generous than Google is with their store.With the current Cyber Monday sale, the Kindle Fire HDX is a steal! Let me reinforce that the Snapdragon 800 processor/Adreno 330 combo is one awesome setup! It makes apps like Minecraft, RipTide 2 and others look gorgeous and perform without hiccup. It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side. It does take a moment to figure this out when being used to a button on the top or side has been the norm for so long. It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**I still find the button on back to be somewhat clumsy. Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I'm still flipping the device back and forth at night with little or no light. Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left. With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version. First, I could take videos with me when I had no internet connection, such as in a car. Second, when my kids want to watch videos, I can download their favorites so they won't be hogging the bandwidth at home!How does this work? Go to the videos, choose the desired video and an option to download will be there. My first attempt to download a Prime video, I chose Downtown Abbey Season 3, Episode 1, which was 1:06 hours long. I was given three options: Standard Definition, 720P HD and 1080 HD. I selected the 1080P HD option first.My internet is 10 Mb/s DSL download speeds. I made it to about 44% downloaded after about 50 minutes. Of course, I kept on checking out other features during the wait. While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me. I was stuck. I held the power button for a good while and it rebooted.The HDX then successfully upgraded the system, something that failed after my initial setup. Yes, an update already (for the Mayday button!) When I looked to see if the video was there, it was not. I had to start all over again. It didn't save.This time, I chose 720P HD. It took about 19 minutes to download. I was previously able to view the 1080P video while it was downloading. It looked awesome. The 720P HD looked just about as good. Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable. This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds. The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB. The video was a tad blurry, more choppy during action, and more noise, grain and artifacts. However, for standard definition, it was surprisingly passable. Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space. They won't care, and even you may not.Finally, I retried the 1080P video with Episode 3. This time, it took 44 minutes 38 seconds to successfully download. The quality, as mentioned before, was excellent. The colors were vibrant, the video sharp and fluid. It took up 2.07GBs of space.Here is the rundown. About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download. 267MB. Quite decent quality.720P = 19:12 minutes to download. 1.24GB. Very good quality.1080P = 44:38 minutes to download. 2.07 GB. Excellent quality.For those who are new to the Amazon world, yes, you can download the Netflix app and watch those, too, minus the download for later option.**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:Yes, there are 3 quality settings for downloading Prime Videos. After digging around, I found a few more choices.After swiping down system menu in the Home screen, go to:Settings / Applications / VideosHere you will see individual settings for HD and SD downloads. It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.  I chose to ask for each setting.Also, in this menu, you will find the option for Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio. Because this increases the size of the video while streaming, it is turned OFF by default. I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones. The video you are watching will need to support this feature.In this Video settings, there is also the option to clear video search history.Another discovery with Prime Video downloads is that most videos do have a time limit for viewing offline. As long as you connect back online, it resets that time, so not a big deal in most cases. So far, I've noticed videos such as \"Under the Dome\" have a 48 hour limit offline before needing to reconnect. Other videos have a 30 day window. It seems as if some of the kids' videos had no such time limit for offline viewing.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**I am discovering that not all Prime videos can be downloaded. This seems to be true with a lot of newer Prime movies and some TV shows. I'm hoping it is a licensing issue and not a decision made by Amazon. If possible, please make ALL Prime videos downloadable!I also find the ability to browse videos to be tedious. Similar to Netflix, on the Kindle devices, Amazon pushes out choices to you in limited quantities. If your watching habits change on any given day, you will need to really dig into the menu choices to see all the viewing options out there. The menu choices overlap and can make browsing confusing, and a challenge to track what one has already browsed.In the Videos, in the side menu under \"Prime Instant Video\" there are three main choices:Top TV ShowsTop MoviesFor the KidsWhat tipped me off, is under \"For the Kids\" there are very few choices. I knew from my Roku device and from browsing from a web viewer, there had to be more choices for the kids.Regardless of which of the three main categories one chooses, each has a sub-menu found by tapping the little down arrow that is right of the category description, such as:MOVIES (Upper left hand corner once this choice has been selected)Top Movies, Prime (Right under, MOVIE, in smaller letters) and the arrow is just right of this.Each main category has sub-menu items, as noted before. But each sub-menu also has the same choices. These would be the same regardless of which main category one came from. Hence, this is where some confusion can come into play.What each sub-menu has, within each main Prime category, is an option called, \"Genres.\"  This is where one needs to go to find the rest of the Prime viewing choices. Unfortunately, there are even more sub-categories within each Genre choice. One will never find all the choices in one place for mass browsing.Are you confused? That is my point. Browsing could be less confusing and easier to navigate.For these two points within Prime Video, I'd knock off a half star. But since I can't, I'll leave my rating at 5 stars because overall, I'm still very happy with the device.----------AUDIO:----------I found the speakers to have decent sound. It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder. The new HDX is sufficiently loud enough while holding it, but I do wish it could go a notch or two louder. With my Klipsch X10i head phones, the sound was plenty loud. It sounded better than the speakers and was OK. It won't win over Audiophiles, but good enough for entertainment purposes.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default. Turn it on. It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers. I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it. There is more meat to the sound than I initially thought. For personal use, the loudness is good in a quiet environment. The sound quality is good for a tablet. The sound stage is narrow. The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent. The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet. I listened to the built in speakers on the new iPad Air, and the Kindle Fire HDX is much better. The iPad Air built in speakers takes a big step back compared to the iPad 4. The Air also has mono speakers and it really sounds mono, in a bad way.**UPDATE 2 DEC 2013**Rather than relying strictly on my memory, I went back and tested the audio side by side with my wife's iPad 4. I would say the sound quality is about the same. What I overlooked was the fact the iPad 4 only has one external speaker. It is mono. In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX. With some surround effect, once turned on, the HDX separates itself even more. From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone. The more I use it this way, the more I am enjoying it. In most cases where disturbing others is not a concern, I don't feel compelled to need headphones. If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder. The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor. Yes, it is a huge upgrade from the original Kindle. Huge!Playing the Temple Run games, I'd get frustrated with the lag on the original Kindle Fire. No more lag. Graphics look great. No video tearing.In Minecraft PE, the original Kindle can play it, but It's not a great experience. The HDX plays it with the best Androids out there. Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The screen is sharp. Texts are very crisp. Colors are accurate and beautiful. There are no pixels to be seen by my naked eye.One nice surprise is that the screen itself seems to be somewhat oliophobic. While fingerprints are there, they seem to disappear some. It is one of the better screens for this, at least that is my initial impression. I don't think this was even intended. I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy. It does reflect a lot. But once turned on, it can be noticeable, but also easily forgotten. If you are prone to glare and easily distracted by it, keep this in mind.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean. It does collect finger oils, but I find it still keeps on cleaning off easier than any other device I've ever used. I don't even need a special cloth. Just by cleaning it off with the palm of my hands, the screen looks nearly clean again!----------MAYDAY:----------Yes, I tried it. I really had a question! No, really! I knew that while reading a book, the HDX could have its contrast adjusted for better reading in sunlight, as well as longer battery life. I looked everywhere how to get to this setting. I couldn't find it.I opened up the Mayday feature and waited about 30 seconds to connect. After confirming my email, address and name associated with my account, I was asked how they could help. With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste. I asked her my question and she did need to seek help to find the answer, but I got the answer. She was friendly. I could move the little window wherever I wanted. At one point, she took control of the screen.The answer was that the screen brightness setting had to be set to auto and it would then recognize when to make the adjustments while reading.It might seem a little daunting to do tech support via video conference. Don't worry. The video is one way. They don't ever see you. The tech can only see your screen.The Mayday button is added with the first initial system update, which should take place during the setup. But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen. Manually update the Kindle by swiping down the top and finding it in the settings.I really don't see Mayday being a feature I'll need much, but it's a nice touch for the tech challenged.----------X-RAY:----------This could be one of the most underrated features. I didn't bat an eye about it before the purchase. Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side. X-Ray detects which characters are in the current scene and you can find out more about the actor. Trivia facts are also there. It's like watching a DVD with narration on, only much less annoying and much smarter.In the Music player, X-Ray provides scrolling lyrics that follow the song as it goes. If you are a karaoke fan (I am not much so) then you will love this.Yes, even in some books, X-Ray is there. It provides footnote like data about characters and terms. I've only seen it in the book Les Miserable. There could be more. I'm guessing it depends on what the publisher provides.----------------SILK WEB BROWSER:----------------It's pretty fast for an Android tablet. On a tablet, I still find the Ipad 4 is the best experience with Safari. There is the option for mobile website, desktop version, or automatic. This is a bit misleading. I prefer desktop version of websites. However, with Silk, you won't get a real desktop experience. Silk still customizes the website to fit the HDX screen. The accuracy will depend on each website.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***I find I don't use the Silk Browser much unless I need to quick look something up. I really wish the option to have a full desktop view did just that. On some of my sites, like Yahoo, it does a bad job of rendering pages. I may have to side load Chrome.---------------KINDLE FREETIME:---------------I just set up Kindle FreeTime. I did the Family Plan for up to 6 kid profiles for $6.99 a month. The other option is for one child for $2.99 a month.Once I set the age (but not actual birthdays, just close to their age) for each child, and subscribed to the unlimited family plan, I tried using it.It was a bit confusing at first. I wanted to set the content for each child. I couldn't find all these \"unlimited\" apps, books and videos for kids. I could only see what was already on my device or what I owned in the cloud.Only when I actually logged in as one of my kids, did I see all the kid's content I had subscribed. There were plenty of choices. The initial choices were for me to determine what I wanted my kids to be able to access that was for my main account. No, I don't want them to have access to all me and my wife's content. But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased. That was what the initial content filtering was all about.My first impression of Kindle FreeTime is that I may end up having to buy each kid their own Kindle. I can see them fighting over MY, I stress MY, Kindle HDX. I may never see it again once I let them on it. I think it's going to be that good. Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime. That seems to be an Amazon Prime video benefit.Only certain books could be downloaded and viewed while offline.I did like that some books can be set to have a narrator read the books to the young child. This is good for my 3 year old. He loves the Thomas books that do this.------------BATTERY LIFE:------------The HDX came with about 60% charge. I'm making an educated guess since it was a graphic meter that is the default battery indicator. I changed it to show percentage after I'd used the Kindle for a short while. It had 54% by that time. After about 4.5 -5 hours of very heavy usage setting up, testing and downloading, I'm at the last 1%.After completely draining the battery to where it shut off by itself, here is what I've been able to measure for recharging with the standard 5 watt included charger, which does eat up 2 outlets on an older power strip:15% in 28:44 minutes30% in 1:00 hour40% in 1:22 hours50% in 1:42 hours60% in 2:03 hours70% in 2:21 hours90% in 3:05 hours95% in 3:15 hours100% in 3:34 hours Whew!Note: There is no indicator light to show charging status.**UPDATE 25 OCT 2013**:I let my kids use the new Kindle Fire HDX during a 4 hour trip to visit family. With some video, lots of multiplayer MineCraft use, it lasted from Noon to 9 PM with about 35% battery life left. It wasn't on all the time, but it was being used frequently.In a more detailed drain test, here are the results:5:41 Hours = 100% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)9:28 Hours = 50% Brightness playing constant video (downloaded)During the 50% brightness test, it took 4:52 hours to drain down to 50% battery life. It took 4:36 minutes to drain from 50% down to 0% where it powered off on its own.50% brightness is still viewable even in a well lit room. However, I'd at least go 70%. In dimly lit areas with some light, 50% is plenty bright.The Kindle HDX is very efficient with power. It barely warms up and it never gets hot. The claimed rating of 11 hours with mixed use seems about right and that's using it constantly. With light to medium use, one could easily go a full day and likely two or three away from a power source.----------------------------HOW MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229. To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40. Compared to Apple's memory upgrade practice, this is a cheap upgrade. To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80. This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size. Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover. I love choice. I love freedom to use even when speedy internet is not available. I want to be able to download videos for my kids when travelling in the car. Even at home, I'd rather they view videos locally from a device so I don't have to fight bandwidth with them! Data these days can add up fast. 8 GB on original Kindle Fire was definitely not enough for me. The new HDX can't be upgraded later, so I did it now. 64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB. Your reasons may vary, but maybe that will help you decide what's best for you just in case you haven't thought about a few of those points.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013**If you want to save some money, the 32GB should be enough for most people. I consider myself a heavier user. I currently have about 17 episodes (most an hour episode) and 2 full length movies, all in 720P HD and I have 31.5GB space left. I haven't loaded my own videos yet, but that is something I plan on doing. I'm glad I got 64GB.For those of you that don't care about storing large files on the Kindle device, the 16GB should suffice. If you change your mind down the road, you'll need to buy a whole new device, so be sure of what you want. I will say that I'm glad 8GB option is gone. That just didn't cut it.If you are buying for kids, 16GB could be enough. Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality. Also, with some diligence, simply delete content you've watched and you'll get that space back. If you can live without the convenience and willing to work at it a bit, 16GB is still a good choice. For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL OFFERS OR NO SPECIAL OFFERS:-----------------------------------I opted to keep the special offers. Why? Because, they don't bother anyone. You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on. Special Offers don't show up at any other time when you are using the device. If you like Gold Box deals, supposedly, some of these offers can be exclusive and even better deals. Why not? I'll save $15 for that. I think people make way too big a fuss over this. Spend that money on some apps, songs or other content. The fun you'll get from that will far outweigh the seeing a few ads that barely intrude on your life.----------PORTS:----------I have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle. The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX. Don't force it in straight on! Be gentle at first until you get the feel of it.**UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit. It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device. We'll see how it holds up after more time.----------------------KINDLE ONLY EXCLUSIVES:----------------------Try watching Amazon Prime videos from an Android device post ICS. Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more. I find it frustrating. I can watch Amazon Prime videos from my Kindle devices.I am one that does like to listen to my books while driving. You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices. Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices. I'm not sure if the text to speech voice changed with the Mojito OS, but I like the new voice better. It is still mechanical, but much better. My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates. Please change this! Let text to speech stop when I choose to stop it, especially when driving in a car.====================PARTING THOUGHTS====================The Kindle 7\" HDX is meant for consumption of content for Amazon lovers. It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software. If you love Amazon, absolutely get it. Navigating Amazon's skinned Android is simple and easy to use, but not meant for the tinkerer. It's definitely not Apple in design. But, it is functional. It knows what it is and the latest Kindle Fire HDX, to me, is even more exciting than the original. The improvements are that good.====================PROS & CONS====================PROS:o Top of the line hardware, super fast and responsiveo Gorgeous screen for both resolution and coloro Screen handles fingerprints very wello Lightweight and easy to holdo Download Prime Videoso Long battery lifeo Crisp text for readingo Great price for the hardwareo Kindle FreeTime for the kidso Parental controlso X-Ray provides useful information for video, music and bookso Kindle exclusive featureso Mayday offers free support and helpCONS:o Back power and volume buttons need getting used too Speakers sound OK, but could be a little loudero Text to speech in books stops with screen rotation or manual turn of pageo No rear camerao No HDMI out porto No GPSo No Google Play", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue/purple border on white pages!", "Author": "LindaFus \"lindafus\"", "ReviewID": "RXJ3VD36FN0O2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX from Best Buy. After trying to read a book, I noticed a pretty bright blue/purple streak that never went away on the sides of the pages. Going into Sepia and changing the background pages did not help this issue.  I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has the same blue/purple border on white and light background pages. The Amazon replacement is more subtle and even around the edges, so I opted to return the one that had the darker boarder.I now see on Amazon's  description of the Kindle Fire HDX that they actually mention this defect as being normal and I quote below:----------------We want you to know...\"The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"---------------This glow is not light nor is it narrow.  The text of a book runs through this and it is very uncomfortable to read this way. This is also true for the Silk Web browser.  I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.  Buyer beware:  Reading with this blue/purple glow is not the same as it is on your Kindle HD or older.After stating the above, I will say, other than this serious screen flaw, this device runs everything else flawlessly and I love streaming movies on this device. Netflix runs great as does Amazon Prime movies. Apps load instantly and web pages as well. This screen issue not so much. I am a bit confused as to why Amazon thinks this blue/purple haze is ok.  I will try to get used to it.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most amazing device I've ever owned!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NFRVWEUS01UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 64 years of age and a teacher. I am no techie, but really enjoy the electronic gadgets that are being invented these days. I preordered and purchased the very first generation Kindle 2 years ago and felt that it was time for an upgrade. This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order. I'm sorry I waited. This tablet is AMAZING for my purposes! It is designed for media consumption and anyone who purchase it ought to be aware of it. It does a great job in that aspect.The \"purple haze\" a number of reviewers have complained about seems quite inobtrusive to me. I don't know that if I were not previously aware it would even be in the discussion. It is a very faint, but discernible border around thedevice when reading.  I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web. I'm even able to download my students' grades and attendance records from the school web site more rapidly than my hardwired computer in my workplace! The screen picture is more than outstanding...it is unbelievable! The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen. And lest I forget the Mayday button, this whole concept is unreal, when I consider the time spent with most customer service outfits on the phone line waiting for my cal to be answered. Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick. I have installed Netflix and Hulu Plus on the device and they work flawlessly with the device. As a Prime member as well, it works seamlessly. My digital subscriptions to several magazines were a snap to transfer to this device. All in all, my expectations were far exceeded by the product.The device is lightweight, beautiful and so cool I purchased an inexpensive ($4.95) case on line from Poetic that provides a lightweight shell and keeps the sleekness of the device intact, yet still allows me to prop it up for video viewing. It also puts the device in sleep mode when the cover is closed and the device immediately awakes when the cover is opened.While I understand the criticism, why buy the device if you knew it's limitations? It is the best at what it is supposed to do and the price when compared to other tablets on the market is a steal, if you consider what it is able to do (and not what it WASN'T supposed to do.In summation, if you are not a techie and just like to relax with a movie, read a book or magazine or play a game, start ordering your HDX now. Media doesn't have to cost you a fortune, is thousand of books I have ordered over the years have been free, and for a couple of hundred dollars a year I and my wife get all the video we want for all our devices from Prime, Netflix and Hulu +. It's the best toy I ever bought. Final rating: 9 out 0f 5!!!!!", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" tablet on the market?", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3N1QB8TWW0WRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: This review is for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet with 32GB, special offers, and Wi-Fi only.I pre-ordered both the original Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablets when they were first announced. It was love at first swipe. The second generation HD was a huge advance over the first generation, with the welcomed addition of an external volume control, an HDMI port, and higher screen resolution. The HDX is also a big step-up from its predecessor. The most obvious improvements:* Higher resolution - 1920x1200 (323 ppi) in the HDX versus 1280x800 (216 ppi) in the HD. That's a huge difference, especially when viewing HD videos. The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD. This is really advanced hardware for a tablet, putting the HDX at the high-performance end of the tablet market. Also, the HDX has 2GB of RAM, compared to the HD's 1GB.* Longer battery life - 11 hours (up to 17 hours in a \"reading mode\") for the HDX versus 10 hours for the HD.* Lighter weight - 10.7 ounces for the HDX versus 13.9 ounces for the HD. That's a noticeable difference when you're hand-holding the Fire. The weight reduction comes from a magnesium body covered with a rubbery material that's easy to grip. The shape is different, too, with beveled edges that help with hand-holding the HDX, since your fingers curl around it better. Also, the speakers have been moved from their position in the HD to the top of the beveled section (in the landscape orientation). This is a nice improvement from the HD, since your fingers won't cover the speakers in the HDX. And speaking of audio, X-Ray lyrics for my downloaded songs is a really cool feature. Really cool.* I like the new display. The display on the HD was the carousel filling most of the home page. This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.* The power button and volume control have been moved. I hated the ones on the HD. They were hard to see and hard to find by feel. On the HDX, the concave buttons are on either side of the tablet when it's held in landscape position. It's not perfect, but I like it better.Those improvements alone make the HDX worth upgrading from the HD in my opinion. My biggest frustration with the HD was how the Silk browser was unresponsive sometimes, sitting there while I tapped a link several times. Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating. I've been using the HDX's browser for several hours, and it's been very smooth and responsive so far.I've already noticed a lot of fairly minor changes from the HD. For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit. The most obvious change was to kill the long-press apostrophe from the period key. Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard. It's not a big deal, it just takes some getting used to. Also, from some of the first reviews of the HDX that I read, some users are complaining about a purple border around web pages. To be honest, I barely noticed it. It's a very light purple about a tenth of an inch wide on my HDX. I don't know why it's there, but it doesn't bother me.Amazon will now allow some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows to be downloaded onto the HDX and viewed later. I haven't tried this yet (and I don't know how you identify these videos if this feature is active), but it may be a good enough reason to go with the 32GB or 64GB versions of the HDX if you watch a lot of videos and aren't always connected to Wi-Fi. By the way, the HDX's memory is in a single partition where you can store anything, including books/audio books/magazines, apps, music, and videos. With my 32GB version of the HDX, about 25GB was free when I got the device.The most innovative new feature in the HDX is the \"Mayday\" button. Amazon says this will connect you with a real person who can in real-time walk you through a problem. (You must have an active internet connection to do this.) I just had to try it, so I did. \"Katie\" came online in just a few seconds, and after verifying my name, home address, and email address, she helped me with a couple of questions I had. That's remarkable customer service.As good as it is, though, the HDX isn't perfect. Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away. Granted, with Prime streaming videos and our Roku box, I didn't use it often, but I wish it was still there. Amazon has announced that there's a software update coming that will let you send video through a PlayStation 3 or to certain Samsung TVs, but I don't have either of those.* There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much. In any case, you can still use apps like MapQuest for trip planning.* No speech recognition. I really hate this. Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant. Actually, you can install Speaktoit Assistant from the Amazon appstore, but you have to type in commands instead of speaking them. (Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.) There is a microphone, though, so you can use voice recorder apps and music recognition apps like Shazam and SoundHound.But despite a few disappointments, I'm generally very pleased with the HDX. It's a superb tablet. Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me. The very smooth Silk web browser is greatly improved, and setting up email accounts and using email is very easy.I haven't bought a cover for the HDX, although I'm sure I will, since my old HD case won't fit the HDX. Amazon has its \"Origami\" case, and other companies are already advertising their HDX cases, but I'll wait a month or two and see what all is out there before buying one. Fortunately, the HDX's size is close enough to the HD's that the padded sleeve I got for the HD is big enough for the HDX.And a pleasant surprise: Kindles always ship with a USB charging cable, but I was surprised to see a wall charger in the box too.Bottom line: I really like the HDX, and for me it was worth the upgrade from my year-old HD.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems", "Author": "Wayne \"wyadams\"", "ReviewID": "R31UC33XHKN8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems that Amazon is aware that the Kindle Fire has problems connecting and staying connected to wireless networks, and has chosen to ignore the problem and continue to sell this piece of garbage.

It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day. At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem. In fact no other wireless device on our network has EVER had connection problems.My recommendation is to find some other HD tablet and wait for Amazon to get the message that they can't foist this kind of garbage on the public and expect us to buy it.In addition, though the display and sound are excellent, there is not enough difference between the Fire and other HD tablets to make it worth the aggravation and hours of dead time.

This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Author": "Kendall Giles",

the buck, the Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033.Here's what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY DOESNT LAST, AMAZON.COM SENDS REFURBISHED REPLACEMENT", "Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.  I'll update this review, as I learn more.Enjoy!", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Pavic", "ReviewID": "R2OIC7C543S2IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Amazon for another wonderful product, it came right on time for me!I'm an avid reader, so when someone stole my Kindle Fire three weeks ago, it was as if a good friend was taken away from me. Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sublime!", "Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle HDX 7\" Wifi 32 GB", "Author": "Rita", "ReviewID": "R1IWS6AOYTRZS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I want to say that I was 4 star happy with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and have been just as happy or happier with past Kindles.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" will be the fifth one for me and my family.I find that the HDX is a good upgrade from the HD.  I haven't found anything yet that would make me want to return it.  There was 60% battery out of the box and for me, setup was a snap.  The HDX connected to my account, downloaded all the info, upgraded and came back up in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was opening the box.I was very happy to see the charger when I opened the box and not just the wire.  I really hate to buy the extra charging plug.  The one that comes in the box is a smaller charger than the square one Amazon sells.  I don't know all the specs, but I assume it charges slower, but has to be faster than charging through the computer.  I haven't had to recharge completely yet so I don't know how long it will take.  But I am assuming it won't be any longer than with the HD.  I found that so far the power usage is about the same at the HD.  I was on it for several hours last night and used about 15% without running video.  That was setup, book downloading and cruising the features and some internet just to see how the screen looks and check out loading times.  The charging wire does stick out from the kindle at greater than 90 degrees, so one will have to be careful when plugging it in and removing the plug.  Also, you wouldn't want to lay the kindle on it's face when charging, the plug will get in the way.The screen resolution is fantastic. The sound is very good for such small speakers and I haven't seen any buffering with the videos.  Although the cloud did have all of my books, the cloud didn't seem to know which books were still on my HD. The only books on the HDX when it arrived were the ones I purchased since I put in my order for the HDX.  When I set up it pulled in the cloud but not the unread books on the HD.  So, I had to run through the HD and download the books I haven't read yet from the cloud to the HDX. The speed is faster than the HD, although not remarkably faster.  It is lighter than the HD which is good for me because I have arthritic hands and can't hold a book. So far the best one from that standpoint was the Touch.Many have complained about the bluish/purple light around the boarder on white pages.  I would not have noticed it if it hadn't been mentioned in the reviews.  It doesn't distract from my reading (and I read a lot), doesn't cause me any eye strain, and I forget it is even there. People complaining because Amazon is trying to put a positive spin on this are na\u00efve.  All companies are going to try and give their products the best spin.  It is up to the customer to like it or not.  Return it if you don't like it.I am happy for the mayday button, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  I don't want to contact someone just to say hi.  But I am sure I would use it in a heartbeat if I needed to.  I have never had a problem with phoning tech help, even if it is in India. The user guide was pretty easy to find and I am going through it tonight to see if there is anything I haven't figured out yet.The origami cover isn't really great and hugely overpriced.  It's a little floppy when opening it but the magnets put it tight when you  flip it to the back for handheld reading.  I do like the way it feels, and the magnets that hold everything together and creates the stand are solid.  The kindle is held in the case securely, although it looks like it might fall right out, it won't.  The cover doesn't block the speakers, but seem to enhance the sound by holding the kindle slightly away from the back cover and aiming the sound at you in landscape.  When I stand the kindle in landscape it wiggles a little when I swipe or tape to change pages and seems as if it wants to fall over.  It hasn't yet, but it doesn't seem very stable. The worst is when I stand it in portrait.  The kindle turns itself off and restarts repeatedly.  I don't know if it is the cover on button thingy hitting the table or if the new location of the on button on the kindle itself is poorly thought out.  The on button isn't in the way no matter which way I hold the kindle, it is only a problem when it stands in portrait.  Maybe another cover would work better.  I am going to wait to see what other hard cover is created by other makers.So, I am happy with my purchase and I am glad I upgraded.  I don't use my kindle for more than reading, email, facebook, twitter, and the internet, but I am looking forward to the software upgrade in November.  I am curious to see what kind of business items will appear.  I wish Amazon would notify kindle owners when a new update is available or make it possible to update software automatically when one connects to Kindle.UPDATE 11/3/13 - I am happier than ever with the HDX.  I am experiencing a weird thing with it though.  It may be the Origami cover that is causing this, but 4 times now in the last week the HDX has decided to just restart all by itself.  When it does, it doesn't save a book where I am reading.  I have to hunt for the page I was on.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "couldn't agree more", "Author": "Debra Ann Fescina", "ReviewID": "R199IHRUR3XORN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Found the following on the 1-star reviews:  \"From somebody that has owned both products, I was never happier to sell my kindle fire on Craigslist. I've had two apple computers and 4 iPhones as well as two iPad's and I couldn't be happier with them. Everything else is just an imitation. Save yourself the trouble and go straight to the apple store.\" Again, I couldn't agree more.I purchased FOUR Kindle fires last year for grandkids for Christmas.  I have two of them in my home right now that will not charge AT ALL.  The other two, I am waiting to hear from my other grandkids to see if they are having any similar issues.  I have spoken with three representatives from Amazon, and I am hearing the same thing from all of them:  They would be happy to sell me 2 replacement Kindles .. it is the best that they can do.Amazon needs to put into place a remedy for people other than what is written in black and white.  The fact that your people, one who is supposedly a supervisor, cannot stray from the rules and make an exception to a customer who purchased FOUR Kindles and now has TWO not charging at not quite 13 months later is amazing.  There SHOULD be some sort of empowerment to Amazon employees, especially supervisors, to make decisions that are fair to Amazon's customers.  I asked if I could get an exception to the 30 days past warranty; and when told \"NO\" I asked if I could get a discount from the normal $79 replacement cost since I would have to purchase TWO refurbished Kindles.  Again, I was told \"NO\".  At a minimum, Amazon should replace the battery at a REASONABLE cost.  However, that offer was not on the table.Apple, Nook, Nintendo, Bose, Dell, HP.  I have them all (I have a hand-held Nintendo that is literally more than 15 years old - it still works!).  I have never had a product quit working at 13 months ... the only thing close to this is an iPod that only works while on the charger but it is FIVE years old AND it does still work while on the charger!

I now prefer using my HDX over my HD model most of the time.  The performance  is way more solid than my HD.  I still use my HD for my missing Weather app  WeatherBug...and the older version of AccuWeather.  The HD and HDX clearly  use different stores.  I got notes back from app developers....no estimate  of when these apps will be in the HDX store.  Does anyone really care?2.  A new minor app issue for my ESPN scoreboard which nobody wants to address.  The standings font for the stats is too large and overlays the city names  such that NFL Won and Loss numbers overlay the city names.  Very annoying.  Does anyone ever test these new/modified HDX apps?3.  Battery life.  As noted below....it is directly proportional to the brightness  setting.  If you want to conserve your battery life...turn the brightness bar  down to 70-80% of the bar length....to get at least 2 more hours out of your  battery.4.  No HD solid black matrix...more dark grey on the HDX.  I guess I am getting use  to this change.  Still like the black LEDs better.  I also don't notice the  blue edges as much on white screens when I am reading.  With time, we can all  get use to just about anything.5.  I did get the HDX Marware screen protectors.....a must accessory...although way  too expensive.  $14.99 + tax on prime for just 2 plastic sheets.**********************************************************************************First, let me say I really like my Kindle(s), but for those who are consideringan upgrade, I will post my quick review to help you decide if now is the timeto make an upgrade or not, and whether to keep your HD around for certain apps.I am still testing out my new HDX and will update this review as I discover moreabout it.  Normally, I wait a few months before I buy an upgrade for any pieceof hardware, but this time I pulled the trigger early on 11/4 to take advantageof the extra 1 day 15% discount which Bezos gave us for the FAA ruling on wireless devices.

Great price performance (Cheaper and Faster)2. Size and weight (Smaller and lighter footprint for jacket pockets)3. Origami case is ok with fixed magnetic angles but not adjustable4. Mayday Help (Excellent) - Fast response but some advisors are still  learning and some are not familiar with HDs and need 2nd level help.5. Apps and movies seem to be running much smoother with fewer freezes than  HD model.HDX vs HD CON:1. Most disappointing:  Screen background matrix is not a black matrix like theHD...more of a very dark grey with lighter gray spotlight in the middle of the display and shadowing of icons and other objects.  HDX screen seem less sharp than HD despite higher resolution when viewed side by side.  I tried all positions of the brightness bar and turned auto feature on and off with no improvement.  There is no contrast control either per my chat with the Mayday folks.2. Others are correct on the white screen blue edge lines on the bottom and rightside of screens.  The HD would probably be a better choice for those who readmore on their Kindles white screens. I did not notice blue line edge problems for movies and pictures. Choice of the blue LEDs for the HDX might explain this problem and the \"dark gray background\" matrix on the carousel screen.  I am surprised there was apparently not more human factors testing on this model before this release.3. The standard font size for the HDX seems 1 or 2 points smaller for more text than the HD. An issue for older reading glasses users.  Portrait viewing will help this a little.4. I don't like the non-carousel device app icons to be half-way visible at the bottom of my HDX.  There is no * (star) feature on this operating system to hide the apps you don't want visible on your carousel.5. Not all HD apps you have now are available on the HDX.  I am not sure if the Kindle \"Store\" is the same store for the HD and the HDX.  If so, they have a problem.  A good example is one of my favorite free Weather Apps, WeatherBug, which has the blue ladybug icon with rain and snow symbols on shell.  The HDX store says it's there and you try to find this icon in the store and all you get are apps the look or are spelled like it but not the real WeatherBug app.  Meantime the HD Kindle \"Store\" has the real one...and I use it on my HD all the time.  When I called the Mayday folks...they said it probably is still not available for the HDX.  If so, then why does the HDX app store search say it is there???  Another free app, AccuWeather, is there in the store, but has a totally different look andfeel, on the HDX. I still like the HD version better.6. Still no .AVI .MOV or .MVI support for movies, only .MP4.  I had to get a desktop converter software for all my Canon camera movies. (ArcSoft Media Converter 2 is a good one)7. Miss the HDMI port on the HDX.  May use the HD for playback of movies on my HDTVs.  Not sure how fast the wireless \"Mirror\" display will be on the HDX...or if I will have \"Miracast\" compatibility. Seems like the hardwire cable would be faster.8. Battery discharge seems to be faster than the HD for same apps...may be underpowered for the higher screen resolution.  Might require lower brightness setting to conserve battery reserves. Requires additional benchmarking.Final Analysis:I'm sure many of the early \"bugs\" will be worked out of the HDX before the holidays and many of the \"missing apps\" will show up at some point.  I will probably keep my HDX to keep testing and benchmarking it against my HD.  I will not get rid of my HD until I see the improvements on the Con side addressed here and I would advise the current HD users to do the same.  Even if this generation proves to be a disappointment, there is still a lot to like about this one for a new tablet owner.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my Kindle FIre HDX!", "Author": "Sara Karolina", "ReviewID": "RJELLQHFEYV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Kindle Fire. You can read, surf the net (let me just suggest downloading the Dolphin browser, since the Silk browser it comes with isn't that great). And that blue LED light on the side that everyone is complaining about isn't actually flawed, it was a design decision based on lower LED battery using power. The blue LED lights used less power than the white, so they went with the blue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me and I don't really understand what the big deal about it is. You definitely notice it, but more so if you are reading a book but still, it doesn't even matter. The clarity of the screen is amazing. I highly recommend going with the 64 GB, that's what I got. I already have a ton of apps on there and am watching tv shows and movies and barely have any memory used up. I also got the Amazon origami magnetic case for my Kindle Fire, and it's also really good quality.

Size & weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2.

I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4.

LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear & rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border !!!!Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device & Merry Christmas to all !!!!!! ;)ps what is the best screen covers & case to get ???On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker !!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shocked by how bad this Kindle is", "Author": "alana", "ReviewID": "R13VX6O3LRMI2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this tablet.  I love the variety and price of books available in the Kindle store, so I thought I would step out of my Apple cocoon and try a Kindle Fire for an e-reader.  I was so excited, but within 1 HOUR of owning the Kindle HDX, I quickly became really, REALLY bummed with it and decided to return it right away.  For the price, you would think you would get a decent quality tablet, but there were some major red flags right away.I will start with the GOOD news first (and the only reason why I give this item 1 star):- The MayDay feature is amazing.  GREAT job by Amazon on this one!  The tech supporters were friendly, helpful, and excellent with customer service.  I used this feature a couple times, and each time a tech person responded in about 10 seconds.  Obviously, as more Kindle HDXs are sold, and the tech department gets busier, they will be slower in their response time, but that's fine!  It's such a great feature, that it's worth waiting 20 min for.  Even though I was ultimately disappointed with the Kindle HDX, I was really impressed with the tech support available.  This is one major feature missing from Apple.Now, for the BAD news:- Froze 3 times on me in about ONE hour.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't download anything on there except for a couple books, so there's no real reason for the damn device to keep freezing on me.  That's the biggest red flag for me with this device.  One hour in, and the damn thing keeps freezing, so I can imagine how much worse it's going to get as the device gets older and I download more things.- Kept getting error messages when the device would automatically update after turning it on.  First of all, I don't want it to automatically update when I turn it on, but I guess there's no way around it.  And to top it off, brand new and it's not even updating correctly?  C'mon Amazon!- Apps wouldn't come up correctly after it froze and turned back on.  So after the device kept freezing and I turned it back on (3 times), on the main page where you can see the big books, apps, etc... that you can scroll through, the pictures of the apps wouldn't show up.  It just came up as gray boxes with the Amazon \"box\" logo on it.  Again, I shouldn't be having these type of basic loading issues one hour after opening the box.- There is NO WAY to create \"collections\" in your books library.  Say what???  I've been reading my Kindle books on my iPhone through the Kindle App, and I'm able to organize my books into collections.  But the Kindle Fire doesn't allow me to do this?  This is the most asinine thing I've ever come across!  You'd think that you'd get more features through a Kindle Fire than you would on the Kindle App for a different company's device.  Using MayDay, I talked to a tech who confirmed that yes, you can't organize your collection on the Kindle Fire, but that there were other third party apps that let you do this.  She also said that maybe, with the new software update coming in November, the Kindle Fire may include this feature, but it's a \"maybe\".  I'm sorry, but this is a huge no-no for me if a company can't get their s*** together enough to offer basic organization of your library on their own device, when it's a feature already available in an app for a different company's device.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm just so shocked that they can't even get this kind of basic necessity worked out...- THE WORST PART FOR LAST: the BLUE HUE around the edge of the screen.  I read a lot of reviews about how horrible this is, and I thought that I would still give it a try.  I thought that maybe the blue hue isn't visible when you change to the \"sepia\" tone for books.  Um.  Yeah... No, it is still very visible, and it is as annoying as everyone else made it out to be.  I can't concentrate on reading anything bc my eyes kept looking over at the blue hue.  My eyes unconsciously kept floating over to it like a mosquito to a bug zapper.  While I was trying to read, I caught myself thinking, \"wow, that blue hue is ridiculous, it's really visible, how horrible, I can't stop staring at it... so weird...\"  When buying an Amazon Kindle product, I expected a seamless and easy screen to read off of, and this totally FAILED.  So again, when I talked to a tech rep about it, she kept saying that the blue hue is \"completely normal.\"  Um, no.  I spent $250 for the device (without \"special\" promotions) and as the client, I will tell you what I think \"normal\" is.  Trust me when I say that the blue hue is NOT IN ANY WAY \"NORMAL\".  I know this is what she's trained to say, but I felt like Amazon was just trying to CON me. LIKE INSISTING THAT I'M EATING CHICKEN WHEN I HAVE THE SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M EATING CAT.  After looking at countless of different types of computer/device screens, we are intelligent enough consumers to know what is a \"normal\" screen and what isn't.  A blue hue around the edge of a device does not feel \"normal\".  Amazon should seriously listen to all the reviewers' comments about how bad this screen is and just apologize instead of trying to tell us that it's \"NORMAL\".SO - after all these problems within one hour of using the device, I have decided to return to my Apple cocoon and buy an IPad Mini.  Yes, it's much more expensive, but in my opinion, it makes no sense to pay $250 bucks for a device that has so many problems that make it unusable when you can spend an extra $150 more and get SO MUCH MORE that works BEAUTIFULLY.  Sorry Amazon, but you completely failed on this one.  Please listen to your customers' complaints about this device.  We are especially right about the screen - it's HORRIBLE.  Stop telling us that it's \"normal.\"", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Edges and Yellow Tone Very Distracting", "Author": "S.

This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazon has outdone themselves!", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "RBJ4GF80COQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third KF - I had the first and second versions of the non HD Fire.This new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is simply amazing. I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle. You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Purchase, Fully Recommend", "Author": "I Shop Too Much", "ReviewID": "R2QJ79PRC99V0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first glance the Kindle Fire HDX is everything I had wanted, not to say that it still is not what I wanted...mostly.The Kindle Fire HDX earns a stable 4/5 stars, if it were out of ten however; it'd be a clear 7/10.*Device & Apps*The device itself is fantastic, the speed of the Linux OS mixed with the 2.2 GHz quad-processor really does make this the fastest 7\" tablet I've seen, there is no doubt about it.  In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

I am convinced it caused my first Kindle Fire HDX to lose its ability to start up.  I attempted to side-load my music again to the new replacement tablet and it almost stopped responding as well.  Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!).

I initially chalked the original up to a random defect, but I have read the others are having the same problem, so it seems less random. This is very disappointing as I love everything else about this device. Everything else. It's fast, light and the screen looks great (except for the bleeding). The backlight bleeding is a deal breaker. I am sending my current one back and hoping that the next one will be perfect, but I am not confident. If the next replacement is also bad, I will give up until Amazon fixes this issue.Follow-up: I recently received an email from Amazon telling me that the blue/purple light is normal and makes the screen nicer. This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges. If Amazon wants to challenge me on this, I will gladly post pictures of my Fire HD and HDX side by side to show just how much this answer makes zero sense. This is a defect not a feature. Own up to it Amazon.Second follow-up: Amazon is now publicly saying that the backlight bleed is not a defect and the fact that my third Fire HDX seems to back this up. Sadly I will be returning mine. I acknowledge that the blue light is not really noticeable when playing games/watching videos. However, reading and browsing the web is a truly poor experience with the blue light.

The Nexus 7 (2013) has a slower processor 1.5 GHz Quad Core to the Kindle Fire HDX 2.2 GHz Quad Core. This is the only reason I am rating this product with a 3 star rating.The sound is great but in a side by side comparison to the Nexus 7, the Nexus 7 has a bigger and crisper sound, but in all honesty not much of a difference. It may be a matter of preference.A lot of technology blogs are giving the Kindle Fire HDX a better rating for the screen quality but with the brightness settings set at max. The Nexus 7 (2013) has a much brighter and cooler picture than the Kindle Fire HDX. (Again a matter of preference both 1080p displays).The HDX only has one front facing camera compared to the Nexus 7 which has two. Albeit the front facing camera snaps great images, the Nexus 7 has two equally great cameras in the front and back.The battery life is a better than the Nexus 7 but both lasted around three days with average use.I also find myself fumbling to find the power and volume buttons. The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length.

Device settings are limited, and while I get the design philosophy of simple, a little too simple for my android-tinted desires to control my device.-Interface, while simple, is non-linear. Can be confusing at times. Like the tabs up top, and then the side tabs go to (sorta) the same place, and then the different media stores within the tabs, and from there...

Seemed a little glitchy at first start up (initial software update) but smooth sailing since then. Bright, colorful, fast, easy to use, etc.I had an Ipad 2 and sold it on craiglist after 10 months. Meh. Big, clunky. You needed 3 hands to use it. I bought each of my kids an Ipad Mini original. Expensive and nothing special. This is small and light and affordable. Completely different product.Various reviews complain how limited the apps are. I mean if 800k apps will guarantee your productivity, more power to you. I keep it to about 50 apps and all are important. Only thing lacking is no Facetime for apple user friends and family but no biggie.I strongly considered the Nexus 7. I have friends who love the original. The shape is just a little off and weird. It was a toss up. Happy about my Kindle choice.My coworkers have gawked at it all day. I wish the LTE option under ATT was cheaper so I would have bought that option but probably wouldn't have really gotten my money's worth.Other than that fancy Apple logo, this is a much smarter bet. Toss up with the Nexus 7 but this shape is better. Can't see why you would regret it.Lastly, I read a little bit with the blue ring glow against the white background (making headlines with the blue glow) but I don't see what the issue is.

The Search is Over, You were with me all the while...", "Author": "Phuong Ha", "ReviewID": "R2JUK2I68311BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry for the cheesy Survivor reference. But the search is really over. After weeks of reading, waiting and wanting, I finally came to a conclusion that not only have allowed me to sleep better but it also has allowed my wife to search better, surf better, and feel better.So, here is the low-down on the research I did prior to finally buying the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" vs. the iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" or 8\" or 10.1, the Samsung Note 8\" or 10.1, the Nexus 7\", and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.First the iPad Mini. She has the iPhone and I did before trading for a Samsung Note 3. We have tons and tons of apps bought from iTunes. But, truth be told, the pricing made me crazy. You get old technology for cheaper than the rest (last year's iPad mini) with lower resolution but cheap. But cheap to Apple is almost the same as the other tablets. If you wanted the new A7 chip then you had to pay for it with your first born. I was tired of being brain-washed into the Apple Cult so I opted out from the iPad Mini. Look and feel was okay but you needed to buy too many accessories to make it feel safe and secure and yes, cool. So no to Apple.Second, the Samsung Tab 3 and Note tablets. After switching to the Note 3 phone, I loved the pen and the many options Samsung added to a phone with an awesome screen resolution and size. So it was natural that I looked at the Samsungs as an option. But upon close inspection here's what I found.All are great screen resolutions, look and feel. All have access to the Android App store so that's no problem. In fact, most apps that cost me rent money on iTunes, was free in the Android Store. But, here's the deciding factor: price compared to processor speed. If you wanted a good price, you had to settle with last year's model or a not-so-up-to-date model. This went for the Note tablets as well. So, in order to keep up with the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\" you had only the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 version but that meant over the $500 mark. All the other Samsung models either ran off of the older dual-core processors at 1.5 GHz or you could fork over the money for the faster quad-core 1.9 GHz. So no to Samsung.Then of course there was the newly printed Nexus 7 but again, the processor speed was 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon Adreno 320 GPU. Fast but not the fastest one out there. Liked the feel and look of it but really, why use not put in the best processor and make it outstanding. But, I think it was to keep the price competitive. This was the closes one I would have gotten next to the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\". So no to the Nexus, sorry Google.Finally, it came down to the 7\" and the 8.9\". Considering I was getting for my wife, who has smaller hands, wants a tablet but one that feels snug in her hand without giving up screen size. I decided on the HDX 7\". If I would have gotten this thing for me, then I would have again gone with the Fire HDX 8.9\" because it has the Snapdragon Adreno 330 GPU 2.2 GHZ quad-core meaning that it has the fastest processor out there that will eventually last you the longest when it comes to technology.It basically boils down to the fact that technology now is at the speed of quarterly sells. They have to make products that can be introduced according to marketplace sells and holidays. Each new lineup will have a faster and slimmer look.I decided on the Kindle Fire HDX for 3 main reasons: 1) the processor speed is the fastest one I could find. It will last for awhile. It will keep up with everything we throw at it. 2) Price was a major deciding factor. But it was decided eventually on Cyber Monday when I bounce on it for the extra $50 bucks off at the lower price of $179.00. For what you get relative to the price, no doubt this was a no brainer. 3) the look and feel. The rubber back feels really nice and has a soft yet safe feel to it. You don't feel like it's going to drop out of your hands. When holding it from either landscape or portrait views it still feels nice. It has a nice size edge so your thumbs can still grip the tablet with interfering with any open apps. The speed is super fast and responsive. And with Google Gmail integration, again, a no brainer.Overall, truly an awesome tablet. Sorry for the long review.

My expectations were for smooth web browsing, Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming, movie playback (Handbrake encoded), and reading news/books.I have not been disappointed. The Silk browser works well, no issues so far. The screen has excellent picture quality. Netflix and Prime stream perfectly and look sharp. Handbrake encodes are sharp and play with no issues, at either 720 or 1080p. Feedly app works ok, and of course reading books works perfectly.

The whole Interface is quick and responsive, no lag at all moving from menu to menu or app to app. The speakers provide a good amount of sound for a tablet, and have more than enough clarity to hear dialogue in movies or tv shows.Learning curve on use of this tablet was very quick; the few questions I had were quickly answered on Google. Everything else on the tablet was easy to figure out; the menu and home page are well-designed for finding the way to what you are looking for, and there is a decent tutorial for the basic functions. There is always the Mayday button; though I don't see myself needing it, I imagine many people will find it useful. The Amazon App Store has many more apps than most reviews would lead you to believe. Every app I use was on there and functional, and I saw most of the other popular apps available as well.

I tried the sepia background and even the black background with white letters.  The sepia did not make much of a difference and I can't see myself reading books with a black background and white letters.  So I have to decide whether to live with this major flaw in an otherwise fantastic product or return it and hope Amazon resolves the problem in the future.  I think I will probably return it because the prospect of seeing blue tinged pages on every book I read in the future on this instrument is a depressing thought.

If anyone hears anything further let me know.10/24/13- EDITWell, I got a replacement in the mail yesterday. I was hoping mine did not have this haze, after opening up my new unit, it again had the blue haze around the border. Very unhappy. Although the haze was not a dark and fuzzy on the new one it still is annoying. I re-read some of the reviews again what concerns me is some people are stating their device is fine and has no blue haze. I want one! I reached out to a customer service rep and made another compliant and the rep was super nice and stated she was sorry. She is going to put in a claim for me and call me back about the issue and about getting me another replacement. I almost don't want to bother because it seems like I won't win. She did tell me this was normal and the blue haze is suppose to be there but it should be very faint and not to noticeable, that the paperwhite has the same thing. She also said it's because they used blue LED lights and not white LED lights. This is suppose to really make the picture look amazing. I agree the picture is awesome and I love it, but while reading this blue light really bugs my eyes out. Is it a defeat or really normal? I don't know what to believe. Why are some devices fine and others not? For spending this kind of money I just want a device that doesn't have this blue haze.

I charged my Kindle overnight, in the AM it was 100% ,I did not power the Kindle all the way off, just hit the power button so the screen went black. Mind you I have owned a Nexus and Ipad and never had the issue I am about to say ... I came home that same night from work got out the Kindle and the battery was at 20%! I did not even use it. I called and the tech told me that the battery did last almost 10 hours so what was the issue, really? No one used it all day, that battery should have been 100%. I looked more into the issue and after talking with another Rep they said that I have to turn the WiFi off every time I am not using it. This seem to be so ridiculous, I have never had to turn WIFI off  with any other tablet. My husband has an Ipad Mini and his charge was at 88% after a few hours of actually using it.

I was bored of Apple (I have an iPhone and MacBook that I love but still...) and I didn't want just a tiny computer. I wanted something that was an entity all on its own. Something that could do it all but in a new fun way. My main requirements: camera, good price, and toddler friendly. I liked that the kindle fire hdx not only met all my requirements but far exceeded them also. It has FreeTime for kids which is well worth it alone, my daughter has unlimited instant access to hundreds of books, videos, and games with her favorite characters. You can get a subscription (4.99/month for one child 9.99 for a family) or just set up the child's own profile and fill it with the plenty of free kids apps available. I love that it's an android operating system. The apps are everything I need, yeah it's not hooked up with Google play or anything but I haven't found that to be a problem. Every app I wanted and am used to using on my iPhone is still available and all of my daughter's favorite apps are still here too. The picture and clarity of the screen is amazing and I found it to be much nicer than any of the other tablets I looked at. It has a great design, easy to hold for both adult and child, the sound is clear and great, it's super fast, I enjoy the silk browser, it is easy to use (if you are familiar with modern technology), we have been using it like crazy for a week now and there's isn't a single fault we can find. My husband can't even believe how great the graphics are. I am thrilled with my purchase and couldn't be happier. I also love that it's Amazon, a company I trust, and provides easy access to anything I want to do. There's also an app that connects to your local library early so you can \"borrow\" books directly onto your kindle.

Besides, I have all of my bookmarks and notes that I haven't learned how to transfer to the Fire HDX. We chose the 7\" size because it's easier to carry in a purse or pocket. Keep in mind that the screen takes up the whole dimension, so it's a larger screen than the Kindle that has the keyboard at the bottom. It's really easy to read. We had our Kindle Fire in the car the other day and needed to look up a contact. That's when I discovered that it's like trying to read my phone's screen in the sunlight. Impossible. So I ordered anti-glare screen protectors. I hope that takes care of the glare. While we do love the Kindle Fire KDX Wi-Fi, I've noticed some problems that maybe aren't a problem to others. I had my Fire with me at church and wanted to jot down on my calendar something that I need to do on a date coming up in a couple of weeks. I noticed there was a Calendar icon, so I opened it to the date I wanted and discovered it wouldn't let me type my note. Why would it be necessary to have the calendar linked to the Internet if I don't care a thing about synchronizing it with my computer? I just wanted a nice little place to jot down the date of something. We don't use smart phones so I didn't think about this sync thing. I guess I just want something simple and old fashioned. At any rate, I had to wait a couple of hours until I got home and could link to the Internet simply to type my note on the calendar.Since this is high definition I was kind of excited when I saw the camera icon. I figured I'd get much nicer pictures than on my 7 year old digital camera. So I clicked on camera and saw myself. I read directions to see how I change the camera to showing what a regular view finder would see and had to chuckle when I found out it's just a one-way camera. Therefore, I took a picture of my Christmas tree by turning my back to the tree and holding the Fire over my shoulder so I could see what it saw. I got a good picture, but that's an awkward way to take a picture. So I guess I won't be using it for much more than Skyping.Things we love about the Kindle Fire HDX: the special offers (which I thought would be annoying) only show up when the device is off, so you don't have to interrupted by pop-ups. Wonderful! It's like the pictures you see on the old Kindle when it's off, only it is advertising instead of pictures of famous authors. It's quicker to manipulate between items. For instance, if you are reading the Sunday School lesson and want to go to a scripture reference, it's just a click away, then an arrow click back to where you were. It's faster to move between pages, chapters, etc. with a swipe of the fingers rather than clicking the page buttons on the old Kindle. (But we still love our old Kindles and will not be getting rid of them anytime soon). We love the bright picture and the fact that it can be read in low light (unlike the old Kindle which has no backlight). The high definition is really pleasing to the eye.We haven't tried Mayday yet, but from the commercials that feature appears to be a real boon to people who are not truly tech savvy (like we're not). I think this is a gadget everyone can find a good reason to own as it is much cheaper than an IPad and most other tablets. It looks great and works intuitively. Everything that's really important to us (and the reason we wanted it) is downloaded onto the device, making it unnecessary to be online away from home. The only thing that might have been nice and could be the reason we may someday opt for smart phones is that we can't use a barcode feature whereby you can skip printing a coupon and instead have the barcode on your device for the restaurant or store to scan.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "An electronic product for all ages", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3CZU05PRY4IVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Kindle reader 2nd generation to the HDX 7 - I truly enjoyed and used my kindle reader.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage. Hope that was helpful! It might've been common knowledge, but I would not know, as this is my 1st tablet ever, as mentioned previously.To use miracast for your Kindle Fire HDX and television, I recommend:NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000)B00904JILO", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Prime video download a joke", "Author": "Patriot1", "ReviewID": "R3MLJ9YWG0SFQP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the HDX for three reasons.

I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.

This second HDX does not have the unevenly lit border, but is \"shadowy\" even with the sepia background, which I find easier on the eyes.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down. Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX.

I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.  In the meantime, the third-party WiFi manager the rep downloaded onto my unit has worked perfectly.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing technical support", "Author": "Larry Sassaman", "ReviewID": "R2I5UIE6Y91PM2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HDX in early Dec. 2013 and until last week was very pleased with the Kindle's performance.

Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system.

Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine.

It looks beautiful and has a lot of features I enjoy. The quick menu at the bottom of the screen is great for keeping frequently used apps handy yet keeps the carousel uncluttered. I don't remember being able to set a passcode on the HD, which I've done on the HDX. The Mayday button is worth the Kindle's weight in gold. I was having difficulties getting apps I purchased on my desktop to download to the device. Talking to the techs I was able to deregister the device and reregister and all the apps appeared like magic.The loss of one star is for several reasons. I have noticed buggy issues with connectivity, downloading apps (device or desktop purchases), and connections with the tech during a Mayday call. I made 7 calls to get the app issue mentioned above resolved. it wasn't that the techs didn't know what to do (one had just fixed the problem for someone else so knew exactly what to do), it was that after 2-3 minutes the call would automatically disconnect. I did get very good at summing up the problem in as few words as possible but it was very frustrating to have to do it 7 times. At the end of all the calls it asked if the problem was resolved and I kept clicking no. I later learned that's probably held against the tech and felt horrible because they all were so friendly and helpful for the time I talked to them.Another feature I don't care for is the limited number of recommended items. When you have the focus on an item in the carousel, just below it displays suggested items you may also enjoy. On the HD, the list was 8-10 items and on the HDX it's only 4 with an option to See All. A bit clumsier than the old method.Overall, I would purchase this again and again and, if I could afford it, would buy one for everyone I know to ween them from whatever they're using now. Fix the buggy Mayday calls and the weird downloads and it'll bump back up to 5 stars.UPDATE 1/6/14 - I have changed it from 4 to 5 stars, as promised. It seems with a couple of the software updates (automatically taken care of) the bugs mentioned above concerning the downloads have been resolved.

Touch screen is easy to manipulate and calibrated nicely.  So easy to set up, connect all my accounts, downloading all my books from the cloud and set up only took maybe 5 minutes if that.  Sound is crisp, pretty loud for a small tablet.The Bad: Since only owning Apple products, some of my favorite apps aren't available.  I.E. Had to download a basic app for a calculator.  Screen does have a glare (somewhat expected), does smudge (just like my phone does, also expected).  Wifi issues.  Ill preface by saying I'm honestly not sure exactly where the problem is coming from, I have yet to try mayday to get suggestions.  Things aren't loading properly and I'm having to shut off wifi, restart the kindle, turn the wifi back on for it to work.  I've done this 3x today.  I made sure my phone and other wifi devices were working to double check bandwidth issues.  Seems to be working okay.  This will be a deal breaker for me so hopefully mayday can help me.  Lack of customizing you can do does bug me, Id love to see my sons big smiling face on the wallpaper, that is not possible.  Lack of additional memory options, though I knew about that.Overall I think it's a great product for the money.  It does everything I would like it to do.  Most of the negatives I can live without or deal with.  I'll be contacting amazon soon about the Wifi issue and will update this review.*UPDATE* 10/29/2013Wifi issue was a home issue.  We had to change a router to get better wifi distribution with more channels.  Thankfully this is fixed.  Couple other things I've noticed:  The battery take forever to charge.  Not a deal breaker, I charge it overnight but its a little annoying.  Kids Freetime, as I mentioned before my BIGGEST drawer to the HDX...BUT downloading the same apps as my iphone has (free kid apps), in-app purchasing is still there so when his little finger accidentally clicks an ad or \"buy\" buttons, the kindle buy box still pops up, now with 1-click buying I have noticed he has bought a couple things.

Pairs & connects quickly with a Bluetooth speaker. Ear Buds are great for personal listening.

There's an experimental player in this Kindle, and they are improving on it.  However, with the vast amount of content Amazon has available to us on Kindle(especially if you're a Prime Member, which I recommend) there is plenty of things to view.Speaking of viewing, the crisp, clear (no motion blur) image is among the best out there.MayDay has the greatest  access to TechSupport I've ever used and it's FREE, 24/7/365 .Top of the screen is divided up with all your function tabs, and additional are provided with a 'pull-down' finger swipe (MayDay is there).WiFi works very well and the front facing camera is for video chat (no rear camera on the HDX-7in) which I don't need anyway.Recharges quickly and the battery life is good (which always depends on what your doing with any device).Downloads and Installs are quick (never had a problem) and you can get right to the new app.I'll overcome this objection; the one about not being able to get the REAL youTube; yes you can without any side-loading.Kindle provides Google for search; if you have any Google account like GMail, pull up Google, sign-in to GMail and at the top right.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster, brighter, lighter, better!", "Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great.

When Kindle Fire came out he bought one of those. Loved it. Bought my daughter the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas when they came out (she's not in the home so I don't count hers as being in our home). My husband then bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". He watches videos on it all of the time. Amazon had a special around Super Bowl time so I bought the Kindle Fire HDX with 4G. Love it. It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down. This doesn't bother me because my iPhone and laptops have frozen also. There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation. I would really love to have Adobe Flash because some sites only use Flash for their videos, and one of those sites I pay $$ yearly to watch videos (yoga) but can't on the HDX, but I can on the Kindle Fire HD. I think that it is not Amazon's fault that Flash is not available on the Kindle, it has something to do with Adobe.When I took my new Kindle to Verizon they told me that the Kindle doesn't have 4G. Had to explain that it did. So then the guy tried to connect it - and it worked. He was VERY excited. He was telling all the other associates that Kindle has a 4G tablet. None of them knew. One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great. I've never used another brand, but I have watched others use theirs and I really don't see much difference, except maybe for the apps. And right now I have the apps I use.There is one negative to this device. It doesn't like to charge on any chargers/cables except the \"Kindle\" brand.

I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

I've been using a regular classic Kindle for book-reading for several years and I find the HDX 7 to be almost exactly the same size, slightly heavier, but just as convenient to use and transport - and with a wealth of great features! I purchased the upgraded version with 64GB memory, wireless only, and paid the $15 for \"without special offers\".  Great deal!  Colors are superb and the unit works fine with my AOL email & Facebook accounts.  Reading on-line news and FB text is a little challenging because of the small print but \"pinch & spread\" takes care of that pretty well although the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX would certainly be a bit better in that regard.  Book reading is fine, no problems, and the faint blue \"corona\" along the edges of the page is pretty inconsequential as far as I can see.Battery life is very good (especially when doing mostly book-reading) but if one is using a lot of battery-eating graphics a daily recharge will be a way of life.  Needless to say, my old Kindle shines in this respect because the battery typically only has to recharge once a month, but then the Fire HDX does *SO MUCH* more!Audio for music is adequate volume (although not ear-blastingly loud) through the speakers and great in headphones, and I find the audio quality excellent.  Controls are easy to learn and seem pretty intuitive to me.My only minor complaint is that the on-board camera faces the user, not the rear of the device - which is fine for Skype or taking photos of oneself if you're into that sort of thing - but then, who the heck uses a tablet for taking pictures, anyway?  I watched a fellow tourist doing that with his iPad when we were in Iceland and I thought - and still think - that it's a dumb way to take photos (I'll stick with my easier-to-carry and fractionally expensive digicam, thank you very much).FWIW, I'm 72 and strongly believe that any \"senior citizen\" who isn't embracing today's technology is missing out on a *LOT* that can keep life fun and the brain active. I've been using a compact netbook for several years while traveling but a tablet like the Fire HDX is a great and not bank account-breaking way to enjoy reading good books, catching up on email and news, following sports scores, using social networking, etc., etc., and all in a much more compact package.So, don't be an old fud, get with modernity!!!  ;-)", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best 7\" Tablet on the market!", "Author": "Mike R", "ReviewID": "R37ZK1X4Y66SO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best tablet out there.

Because it was an opportunity to try it for free, I activated the Whispersync Voice.  I was amazed at how easy it was to switch from text to audio and back to text.  Kindle  Fire HDX  keeps perfect track of the furtherest point you have read no matter which function you are using, text or audio.  I can listen to audio on the Kindle Fire HDX and pick up at the point I left off with text on my Kindle Paperwhite.  I think Whispersync Voice is one of the best features there is on this device.As I continue learning how to  use more and more functions on this, the more I love it.Bottom line, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX over any other device I have used.

The rubbery frame is easy to hold, and doesn't feel cheap. The viewing area (reportedly Gorilla glass) is generous and fairly smudge free.Integration with Google apps like gmail, calendar, etc is very easy. My inbox, contacts, and entire calendar were up and running in just a few minutes.Tunes sound good, whether it be from my own collection in the Amazon cloud, via Pandora, or on YouTube. Placing the Kindle face up on a hard surface optimizes tone and volume.Most website functionality is comparable to a PC, but there are the occasional pages that look funny. As an example, I use my Kindle as an auxiliary while playing Battlefield 4, and while it's usually easy to manipulate, there are times when screen resolution makes buttons/web parts awkward.As far as books, I only have a few so far. Some seem better adapted to the Kindle format than others; The Oatmeal's \"How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You\" is flawless, but Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has the occasional odd hard-return.Although the auto-brightness feature is a nice touch, but I've found that it sometimes it will \"adjust\" for no reason. Still not enough to drop it down from 5 stars.I can't comment on Facebook or Twitter functionality as I use neither of those, but the StumbleUpon app is fun.If my Kindle HDX gets broken, for whatever reason, I would buy another without hesitation.

I'm a guy and what I like I figure she would like - right?  So I bought it.  So as to be sure she realized the kindle is now something real and useful in so many other ways, I first prepared the Kindle introduction video. Kimble has a great video explaining all the benefits that it does.I prepared the TV which we have hooked up to a computer to first show her the video before opening the box to see what it is.  I figured once she saw all the cool stuff it does she would defiantly have a change of heart by loving it and wanting it.She saw the video, opened it up and began learning it all.  Kindle has a REALLY good feature.  Tap one button and a live person comes on screen to guide you through anything at all.  They can even do it for you by drawing circles around what they click and do so you can see and learn - really making it easy.My wife learned enough very fast as to contact this live tech person on Christmas day.And, she asked him for help.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond. Also typing was wonky.Most of the navigation worries seem to be a thing of the past.* It's nice and loud.Here is what bothers me a little :* Charging port is horrible. It goes in on an upward angle. Does not feel or look stable.Makes me wonder WHY is it designed like that.* Battery life is less than the previous model(2012 Kindle fire HD) Does not last long on standby.* I wish the power button and the volume were NOT located on the back of the HDX. I prefered the previous button locations.* I used the Mayday button to ask a question about printing from my HDX.Specifically I wanted to know where on the HDX could I  access the print screen amazon shows a shot of in the product tour video. Well my advisor answered fast but when I asked my question she kind of rolled her eyes and made an exasperated sigh. She then said hold on.Her screen went from a live shot of her to a graphic of a pair of headphones.Then another voice started talking to me.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

Harbour", "ReviewID": "R1DFMDLJ5LLNGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About fifteen years ago I had a Dell Inspiron that caught on fire and melted. Yes, I was one of those with the bad battery. I received such poor customer service that I went out and replaced the Dell with the Apple PowerBook, their main competitor at the time. And, I never looked back. I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps. And Apple made millions off of the apps. Then came the followers with cheap, poorly made tablets to try and compete and each got smacked down in the process.So here I am with a first generation iPad, yes you read that right \u2014 first gen, and I\u2019m looking to upgrade. I\u2019m thinking the new iPad mini because I want a smaller form factor for flights. It\u2019s before Christmas and I\u2019m in BJ\u2019s. The Christmas lights are blinking and everything is warm and bright. I spy an Amazon Kindle Fire on sale for $99. That\u2019s interesting I think and I move along with the tasks at hand. The thought sticks in my mind and I start investigating the Kindle line. I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member. I take a hard look at how I use the iPad. Email, check. Browse the web, check. Watch some movies, check. But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

Firstly I will address the many issues people tend to have with this device and comment on my personal situation.Wifi - Setting up Wifi at first was a little shotty as my router had to be reset a couple of times to allow it to access the kindle. At random times it seems like it drops wifi but this happens infrequently and isnt all that annoying unless it is during a video.Blue Tint - This is noticeable on my device on white screens but perhaps I wouldnt have even seen it hadnt I read so many reviews on it. It really doesnt bother me all that much and I turn the kindle to dark view when reading anyways. Unless yours is really bad I think this is just people nitpicking.Battery - So far it has been pretty strong. I watched a lot of media on this device and I have seen it last anywhere from 7-12 hours. I have noticed it depends on strength of wifi and screen brightness mostly. I watched 4 episodes of Justified last night and it only dropped about 25-30%.App Store - This is one of those things that people can research pretty indepthly before purchasing the device, so why people complain about it is beyond me. They are missing some key apps outside of google play store but many of them can be sideloaded using 1mobilemarket or an equivalent. I have noticed the apps through amazon are generally a version or two behind but its not a deal breaker.I understand you cant do this on an ipad either, but I wish you could rename apps. I hate when I download an app from Amazon and it has a weird name and throws it off alphabetically when I am looking for it.Now for the positives:Screen - The picture on this device is immaculate. Watching media is very crisp and enjoyable even on the 7\" device. The colors are accruate.Speakers - The speakers are very good on this device, much better than expected. It is perfect for watching on your lap, table or bed. They dont get too loud but I have never, as of yet, needed to watch something with them a full capactiy.Media - One of the key selling points is the ability to download videos to the device for offline viewing. I have noticed that the xfinity app allows you to do the same thing that Amazon has promised w this device. There are not many great movies to download and people are upset w this through Amazon Prime Video, however the list of tv shows is exceptional. They have a lot where you can either view/download the videos to the device. Amazon prime is strongly suggested if you were to purchase this device.Reading - Reading is a delight on this device. Very crisp and sharp and I love that you can download overdrive and rent books via your library. The Amazon Kindle Lending library is very weak and if you are considering this as a reason to buy then forget it all together.Overall I am very impressed with this device and at $229 ($179 on cyber monday) it is definitley worth a buy. It is more of a media consumption device then a tablet so to speak. I notice that when I am using it I seem to run out of things to do on it, unlike an iphone/ipad but still I think it is a great device for the budget conscious buyer.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift for my wife - she won't put it down", "Author": "J.

I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either.

Gorgeous.  I like the feel of it and its speed.  But, there are a couple of drawbacks that might have made me make a different choice if I had researched it better.  The biggest drawback is the lack of support for the Google Play Store - I know Amazon is trying, but at least 50% of the apps that I want, are not available on the Amazon Store.  I hope that percentage improves soon.  The other disturbing drawback is the lack of support for Flash Player.  I know that Amazon is working on a replacement player (I have had chances to try their Beta...and it's just OK), but why not just support Flash?", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Pad I own atm.", "Author": "B.

For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better. I'm not a techno-wiz or anything like that, I've merely had the opportunity to use different types of tablets since members of my family keep winning them in drawings (e.g. Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini). I actually bought this one because I wanted a tablet and it was less than half the price of the others when Amazon gave me special offers.I was initially worried about how complicated it might be to use, especially since I'm more familiar with the iPad interface, but I found the Kindle to be quite easy to operate. If I ever had a problem, I'd have the best customer support in seconds with the 'Mayday' button.It's fast- it's never really had a lag for anything that I've tried. The buttons are out of the way, but easy to find and use. The sound is by far superior to all other tablets, as is the display. It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time. Two notable apps that are absent from the market are Youtube and Instagram. I'm sure more developers will jump on board, especially since this tablet has proven to be extremely usable.If you are looking for larger text or screen size, the 7\" might be a bit too small. Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g. instant video, lending library, etc). However, it still is great as a standalone tablet (although I'd recommend using the Prime services with your Kindle if you choose to purchase it; they are definitely worth the price).All in all, it's a top-tier competitor in the tablet market and it's also one of the cheapest. If you're considering this and the iPad mini or Nexus, really look into the Kindle or try it out.UPDATE (December 2013)I finally had the opportunity to use the Mayday service due to a downloading issue. It was about 10:30 PM. I tapped the Mayday button and within ten seconds I was in video contact with a representative from Amazon. In less than five minutes, they were able to visually show me the issue with my tablet and help me to solve it. I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had. I can usually solve any issues on my own, but having this feature for the times when I'm stuck is very nice.Many other reviews have mentioned the display issues at the border.

After spending only a few moments, from setup to navigating through various apps (books, web, videos, etc...), I must say that the device is near flawless.  The unboxing and setup process were as effortless as anyone could hope for.  The performance is spectacular and allowed navigating around the various screens with lightening quickness.  The feel in my hands is wonderful, in terms of size, weight, shape, and texture.  Heck, I even tried out the Mayday button and I must confess it is probably the greatest customer service experience I have had in memory and probably ever.Finally, I come to the topic that has been discussed in so many prior reviews.  This display is beautiful, vibrant and precise.  Unfortunately, this perfection is inexcusably blemished by an uneven purple haze around its outer edges.  This haze is almost twice as wide along one length of the device compared to the opposite side and contrasts so much with the otherwise flawless display, that it provides a distraction I cannot live with.I literally fell in love with your \"near masterpiece\" in just minutes.  So much so that I mentally tried to convince myself that the many fine attributes outweighed this single flaw (\"Gee, maybe I'll get used to it?\"), but alas I realize that, like so many others, this is something that I cannot bring myself to \"settle\" with.I am returning your amazing invention with great regret and I hope that your talented team can resolve this unacceptable issue as quickly as possible.

From the beginning it would randomly shut down/reboot itself. When it did that, it would lose my place in the book I was reading, so I'd have to search for the new location by scrolling/paging through the book. I called tech support, we troubleshooted the issue. It performed ok for a few days. Then the random shutdown/reboot started, and this time the screen started flickering too. Finally I called, and a replacement was quickly sent.I've had the replacement for 3 days. It has randomly shutdown/rebooted six or seven times (and I've only used it for a few hours total), the screen flickers, and it doesn't stay connected to the WiFi. So, I am returning it (minus a 20% fee, because I missed the 30-day mark by a couple of days -- if I had just returned the first one, and not dealt with a replacement, I would have been within the 30-days.The replacement was also a refurbished model.I wanted to like it. I've had a Kindle since the beginning. I was considered an \"early adopter\" which, at the time sounded good, but ultimately really means nothing. But, the first Kindle was spot on perfect. Sure, it was \"primitive\" compared to the Fire, but from the moment I took the Kindle out of the box it worked perfectly. No issues at all. It's been downhill since. The next Kindle was not bad, a couple minor issues. Then the first Gen Paperwhite that flickered, had uneven lighting that made it tough to read, and now this disappointing experience with not one, but TWO Fire's in a 5-week period.I really liked how the app was integrated with the Kindle store -- buying media was easy (in fact, I think I bought quite a few more books than normal, because shopping was so easy).In defense of the device -- people have complained about it as compared to an iPad and not being able to use it as a workhorse. The Kindle Fire is, according to CNET and others, a \"media consumption device\" rather than a \"tablet\". The Kindle is meant to be used for books, music, movies (all from Amazon, of course). It's not really designed to be an alternative to an iPad, more a compliment to the iPad -- one would use the iPad for work, the Kindle Fire for entertainment. And, I'm ok with that. I use my iPad a great deal, as I also use a MacBook and an iMac (and iPhone) so everything syncs together. Having the Kindle Fire let me free up room on my iPad -- getting rid of the books and music files freed up much needed room.I think, however, that I'm getting weary of Amazon Kindles.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.

From not even considering this tablet in the beginning of my tablet hunt, to owning it now, I am so glad I bought it. I originally was looking for a tablet for school, so.I was looking more at Windows tablets. There's a lot of nice Windows tablets out there, but anything in my price range (200-400) had problems, if it was a high res screen and crappy processor, or a speedy prossesor and a cruddy screen resolution, or even if the item was out of stock or a bad operating system, I had never considered the kindle fire HDX. This runs a 2.2 gigahertz processor about .4-1 gigahertz faster than any Windows tablets I had considered, even the galaxy tablets I was thinking about only had 1.6 gigahertz processors. Galaxy tablets and galaxy notes have maybe 2 things that beat this tablet: the infrared capability and the multitasking capability. Nothing else. The  os on the kindle is just as good, the screen res is 1080 compared.to there 720, camera isn't as good on the kindle but I wasn't concerned about this as I have a nice camera on my phone,and  the processor on the kindle blows the galaxy tablets out of the water! The kindle has just as good productivity capability as the galaxy tablets, because if you buy a stylus and download a note taking app, you have the main selling point of the galaxy note!

I also am a longtime iPad user (and lover) but the iPad is a little hard to hold in one hand when I'm reading in bed.  So I had high hopes that the HDX would fit the bill as a nice, lighter-weight 7-inch device with iPad-like qualities.  I have to say, it really surpassed my expectations!  The display is gorgeous and the Silk browser is about a million light-years away from the original Fire.  The size and weight are perfect (don't underestimate the importance of the lighter weight if you're considering an iPad).  I've had no issues whatsoever with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivity etc that other users mentioned...my experience has been fantastic.As an Apple aficionado, I would still give my iPad a slight edge over the Fire, but only because of the availability of apps and the seamless syncing of all my stuff through iTunes with my iPhone and my Mac desktop.  But aside from those things I actually prefer the HDX purely as a device - the light weight and portability combined with the performance are all amazing.

Prior to the Acer I had owned a first generation Kindle Fire and a first Generation iPad. The Acer had a four core processor, like the Kindle Fire HDX, was HD, and had a 10.1\" screen. The HDX beats the more expensive Acer hands down in every way. The screen is beautiful, with awesome color and clarity, the processor is fast, and the battery life is very good. The sound from the stereo speakers is better than any of the previous tablets I've had, with great separation. The smaller size took a bit to get used to, although I've found I like the portability and light weight of the smaller device.Amazon's operating system works well, and is fairly intuitive, although I had trouble getting some apps to show me the \"home\" button a few times and I sometimes wish it had a physical sleep button. The \"special offers\" feature that keeps the price low is very unobtrusive and hasn't bothered me at all. It's definitely not worth the extra expense to upgrade to the version without special offers.I use Amazon products constantly: frequent purchases from their website, the app store, kindle books, Audible, music, and videos.

When given the choice between this and the Paperwhite, I chose this one due to the ability to use as a regular tablet when I'm not reading.Pros:- The picture is absolutely stunning, especially when watching tv/movies. The picture is vibrant, clear, and sharp.- It's faster than I thought it would be, including powering up and down. Much better than the third gen Kindles.- I'm able to play games like Candy Crush Saga and Wheel of Fortune without any issues.- Can access Netflix, Hulu +, and other tv apps!Cons:-The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped when playing games but it's still better than playing them on my tiny smartphone.- The weight of the Kindle, while lighter than previous generations can feel heavy after using it for a while. This isn't a huge \"con\" since there are those tablet pillows I can buy to alleviate the need for me to hold it while I watch shows or read.- Every now and then, especially when the brightness is turned all the way up, the screen vibrates which can cause dizziness. It only lasts for a moment at a time but it can get annoying when it does it more than once an hour. When I have the screen dimmed it doesn't appear to have that vibration problem.Overall, this is a fabulous buy, especially for those of us who were able to get a holiday deal on it. Even full price, it's worth it. The Nook was looking good simply because it has access to Google Play and Chrome whereas the Kindle only uses their own proprietary shop (Amazon App Store). But after reading reviews from experts and consumers it seems the Kindle is still the better tablet. Besides, the way Barnes and Noble is heading, they may not be around long enough to support the new Nooks into the future. At least Amazon seems strong and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon so the Kindle will be supported for years to come.I highly recommend this for anyone older than 10 years old.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars.

Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.

FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a secure device", "Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.  It would be nice to see Amazon step up security and regard for customer's privacy on their portable devices.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "anaconda", "ReviewID": "R2YNLEQJNKHA4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I was gonna like this...

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.  I have an original iPad and an 8.9 Fire HD from last year.  I never thought I'd be want the smaller size, but this is perfect.  I no longer play games on my phone, b/c this thing is easy enough to carry around I take it everywhere.  In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.

The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

The lighter weight of this tablet is fantastic and feels great in my hands.

The eink has no back light and it is strictly black and white.I had no problem copying all my books and documents from the old to the new using my computer.  I\u2019ve found that for just reading books the eink was a little easier to use was a lot lighter and the battery life was unbelievably long lasting almost a month between charges.  As for reading it takes a while to get use to the touch pad screen of the HDX and I find myself making a bookmark on every page which is a drag because if I fall asleep and the HDX drops I could be a hundred pages away or even on a different app when I sake up.  Yesterday morning I woke up to find I apparently bought the book I was reading when it had dropped from my grasp when I feel asleep.  Oh, this was easy to correct, so no harm done.  The only other negative things are its weight and battery life.  It feels twice as heavy as the eink and the battery life is poor at best, it has to be charged at least every day.Pros:The Mayday button is Great!  It didn\u2019t take me more than 15 minutes to get into trouble and rather trying to figure out what I had done wrong I pressed the Mayday button and had a person talking to me, explaining what was wrong and fixing the problem.  The app I was having a problem with this person had never seen before but yet stayed with me and helped me figure it out.  I had expected him to blow me off, after all how can he possibly know the intricacies if every 3rd party app, but he found a solution.  Kindle must be very proud of their Help Desk because it\u2019s one of the best around.  I\u2019ve had 2 other times I used Mayday and all the people that have helped found solutions, and were very courteous.Even though I love the eink reader for books the HDX overpowers with its apps and shear speed.  I find myself using the HDX to check Email, Contacts and my Calendar because it\u2019s faster than starting up my computer.  The Silk browser is 100 times better than the one on the eink.  The eink has only a handful of apps while the HDX is almost overwhelming with great apps.  The HDX has so much more to offer that I haven\u2019t gone back to my eink and never will.  Come on-- this thing plays music, videos, you can watch TV, browse the Internet, check your email, read newspapers and magazines, do work from the office and play games plus if you get into trouble there is someone at the press of a button that helps.

I have had ever version of it so far.  I love the screen....it is fantastic.  I like the layout.  I only see a bit of blue around the edges when I read a book, but it's really nothing terribly noticeable and it does not bother me any.  I like that it is thinner and lighter.  The only things I would change are:  I would have a HDMI port because that beats paying $50.00 for a converter to be able to watch movies on my TV.  I would not put the power button and volume buttons on the back, it's way to easy to touch them accidentally.  I like where they were before.  They were a bit less accessible before, but having a cover that put my kindle to sleep made it a mute point.  Also you can adjust the volume on-screen.  I would rather have the buttons where you can't touch them accidentally.  But none of these are game changers, it's still a better tablet than before even though I loved my Kindle HD also.  Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews to heart and use them when designing the next model.  It's a great value for the money!  I love it!  Update 1 month later:  I had problems with my first Kindle HDX, almost every time I changed it to Airplane mode off or on, it would turn off and then come back on to the home screen.  This was very annoying, so I returned it for another Kindle HDX.  The 2nd one had a blue spot on the screen that was like a small blue cloud that did not move and was there no matter what.  This changed the color of what I was watching or when reading, I could see it quite clearly.  I returned that Kindle also, because when you buy a brand new Kindle, it should work perfectly.  The 3rd Kindle that I got was REFURBISHED!!! The screen is fine, but guess what?  The airplane mode thing is happening with this one too, and guess what else - they will not take a refurbished Kindle back even though it was Amazon's mistake to send me one.  The offered me a partial refund instead, which I accepted, but I am not a happy camper.  A brand new product should not have these problems.  My Kindle HD never had any of these problems and still works just fine.

The tablet placed above the piano keyboard often replaces printed sheet music.I also find myself using the Kindle Dictionary and Thesaurus Apps instead of using my other PC's.I bought the smaller 7 inch model thinking it would be easier to carry in my car and camper but realize after one month of experience that the 8.9 inch model would have been better for me.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with My HDX", "Author": "Tyson", "ReviewID": "R1C1GHT05ZH9JJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the HDX on release day but wanted to play with it a while before reviewing it. After trying out most of the functions, I'm very impressed. This was my first Tablet, but of course I've used the iPad from time to time. I really don't see any difference between the two as far as speed is concerned and usability. The sound quality is great. The wifi speed is excellent. The apps work smoothly. Typing is a breeze. The size is fine for my usage. The price is very competitive.I've only experienced one problem. I ordered an app from Amazon and it did not automatically deliver to my HDX. I took the opportunity to try out \"MayDay\" and was immediately greeted by a helpful customer service rep who was able to fix the issue in a flash.The casing shows fingerprints a little more than I would like, but now I have it in a case so it's a non-issue. The screen also shows fingerprints, but that can't be helped and they do wipe away easily.OVERALL: Great tablet from Amazon.

I have to look for it to see it but it's very minor.  To be fair I do not read a lot on this, I use it for movies mostly, so I don't see the haze at all on anything but a stark white background.The buttons on the angled part of the rear are PERFECT for me.  Another thing that seemed to annoy others but it's a vast improvement from the way the buttons were hidden on the HD.  I had to hunt on my old HD for the buttons constantly and it was very frustrating.  The HDX buttons are concave so as to not push them by accident, the placement is perfect for easy use while holding the device.  I have never once turned it off by accident and I hold it from the back all the time.  I can see if you have a case that covers the back of the device that might block access to the buttons but this is not the fault of the Kindle, more of the case designer imo.The screen is beautiful, a definite step up from the HD when viewing them side by side.The audio quality is great with headphones and external speakers.  About the same as the HD.The battery lasts a LONG time (but also takes a while to charge up, even with the 9w charger)The speed of the device is excellent with the new quad core cpu.I had some issues with wifi dropping out from time to time but with the recent update to OS v3.1 that seems to be fixed.  fingers crossed.  I am very happy with the upgrade.  I got the 64G version (coming from the 16G HD) and it's so much nicer having all that space to download movies.  All in all, I was really on the fence about upgrading from the HD but am very happy I did.  The only real con is the lack of an HDMI output because I liked connecting my kindle to hotel TVs to watch my own movies while traveling on the hotel room TV.

If I hadn't been a satisfied Amazon customer for the past 15 years I would have returned my tablet and demanded my money back. But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. (It would be extremely helpful if the help files could be downloaded as a PDF) After many calls to Amazon, I was finally transferred to a very unpleasant technician who determined my tablet was defective and sent me a brand new replacement tablet exactly like the one I had. When I asked about all the books and apps I had downloaded into the device he told me they would be in the new tablet when I got it. He lied.......the tablet was empty just like the original, but it was a new replacement so I didn't complain. It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

I've owned Kindles in the distant past and have not been impressed with e-readers or tablets in general.  I'm an old-fashioned book reader and really didn't think I'd like an e-format.  Plus, I wasn't convinced that I needed another electronic device since I have a laptop.  When Amazon pitched the no-interest offer over 5 payments, I reluctantly ordered the Kindle.  I have to travel soon and the thought of lugging my usual pile of books was not appealing.  I have been absolutely blown away by the functionality, ease and intuitiveness of this little device.  I used it right out of the box and put it through a good workout.  In the few days that I've had this, I've already received a $3 offer for free music (which I snapped up right away) and a free book (which I learned comes once per month - cool).  I've downloaded free books - classics that I've really wanted to read.  I've watched my Prime Videos and Netflix and the sound without headphones is remarkable!  I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.  I like the Silk browser, and for what I need it for (checking and answering email), it works.  I don't game, so I don't know much about these functions.  You save a bit when you order with \"the special offers\" included and they're not annoying at all - in fact, that's how I learned about the free books.  In hindsight, I'd probably go up in size to the larger Kindle if I ordered again.  My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!  I also recommend getting a cover for this - it's a good investment.  I saved a bit by buying off brand, but you might want to invest in a true Kindle cover to protect your device.

I am not sure what use the camera on the front is, unless you like to take selfies holding what amounts to a book in front of you.  A camera on the back would be much preferable.  It is lighter weight and I like the on off button on the back.  It does not have an indicator light to show when it is charging which is unfortunate as the plug in is at an angle and a little hard to use.  I have never had a tablet so I can not tell you how this compares but I suspect that a real tablet with the amazon reader download would be better for web browsing etc.  Overall if you want an e reader that can also be used as a tablet on occasion then this would work for you as it works for me.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Mother's Day Gift", "Author": "Justin Wollenberg", "ReviewID": "R123QZX1TCZZAN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day.

First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it.

HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained. I don't see why they couldn't add a small slot for an expansion. This is where the HDX falls to the Samsung Note 8.0.Other than that, it's a nice little tablet... I do have a little buyer's remorse.

The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier).  I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite.  Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite \"seems\" to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver.  The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX.  It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening  and occasional viewing needs.  The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch.  So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't \"see\" an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated \"point and shoot\" camera).  But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses.  I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini).  My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops.  Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general.  The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite #1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010).  Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon.  And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line \"User's Manual,\"  for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and \"free\" User's Guide.  Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source.

The \"blue led\" and purple/blue/violet bleeding on the edges of the screen caused, at least for me personally, eye-strain and distraction (I wear 1.5-1.75 power readers).  I compared this side-by-side to a 7-inch Kindle HD and original Fire and these, as e-readers, were far superior.  When I contacted customer support I was told the blue led was intentional and that if I ordered a replacement it would still have the purple-blue edge.  If \"intentional\" use of a blue led means this wasn't thoroughly tested as an e-reader and is actually a major design flaw, then mission accomplished.  Since ~75%+ of my Kindle use is as a reader (25% video, email, apps), I returned this and am using my \"antiquated\" Kindle Fire.  I am hopeful the next generation will provide a spectrally pleasing balance of reading, web surfing, and video.  As technology, whether using at home or traveling, as an 80s teen and an avid SciFi/Fantasy reader I never thought I would see this. Considering this observation, a violet-colored edge and blue led affecting a white reading background is a minor complication, but does negatively affect the here and now of usage as an e-reader.The 7\" HDX does have amazing video pixel density and sound.  Much, much better than the 1st gen Fire and a readily observable improvement over the 7\" HD.  The speed of the HDX is fast compared to it's predecessors and Mayday, which I used for the purple-blue edge, far exceeded my expectations.  I never tested the camera before returning. I have found a very strong WIFI receiver with all generations of Kindle -- superior to my iPhone.  If you're not using the 7\" HDX as an e-reader, the value and quality is a comparably remarkable value.

I looked at the various types of Kindles. First I wanted a system that I could read in dark bedroom. Second, To get comparable internal memory to the newest tablet devices(32 GB), Third, the ability to change font & background color. Fourth, to be able to use the device on the internet. I got all of these features with the features with the Fire HDX.Given, I have an Amazon card which at the time provided $40 rebate on the HDX. I would have spent it for extra 16 GB anyway. The device has a three tier color format for color of font/background. I like the brown font on a light tan background which does not have the typical white background glare.  The HDX is perfect for a dark room.The SILK internet browser provides easy access to e-mail or wherever you want to go on the internet; Don't expect a Windows/Android type internet functional capacity but SILK is very good for things one would want to check before bedtime or any other time. The 7\" display is perfect for reading & mimics the normal size of a paperback; the size of words is easily adjustable to your personal choice or increasing to the size of hardback letters or bigger.The HDX is the first tablet I have owned that displayed perfectly at 50% setting(major reduction in battery charge drain) vs typical 90% to 100%. The HDX does not need to be charged till after 8 or 9 nights of 2-hour reading sessions. I turned off the WI-FI(10 second task) unless I need it for a book download or to go on the Web which greatly reduces the draining of the battery charge. I was a hardcore Hard Back reading but I love the HDX & have found myself putting off reading previously purchased books. The HDX has revolutionized my reading & I read 100% more now. I keep my Kindle in a zipped sleeve when charging or not in use. The sleeve also protects Kindle from the elements, display scarring & dropping. I highly recommend a similiar Kindle HDX to anyone who wants Kindle & internet access in the same device.  Somewhat of an answer to questions about  'archiving', 'collection', 'cloud', 'how to tell if a book is downloaded', 'remove from device' & 'remove a book, magazine, etc completely removing a item from your Kindle', etc.Put a note at start & end of the book to indicate you have read it when the carousel is on screen & you actually in the book. Press one to two seconds the book on carousel & move the book to 'Add to Collection'. Add a new folder in 'Collection' titled 'read' or 'red' or what ever title you want, check this folder to move the book you have finished to that folder by checking the folder & then save. Then press 'Remove from Device' which also pops up in the menu where you press the book for a second or two. That moved the book from being downloaded to your Kindle & into the 'CLOUD', the book title is still on your Kindle by being in your Amazon 'Cloud' but not using up your Kindle memory up. You can click on books & click 'Cloud' at the top middle beside 'Device' & re-download the book at any time. Removing the book from device is basically archiving the book. It is available but not using any Kindle memory.You can completely remove the book, magazine, etc by going to the Amazon home page, click 'Your Account' & click 'Manage your Content & Devices'. All your items are listed there & on the right of a item(book, etc) click the 'Actions' tab there. Select the option to 'Delete from library' & click yes to confirm 'permanently deleting the title'. This function also works in the Kindle app on a non-Kindle device.All this can also be done directly while in the Kindle mode but I am not going into the techniques. I assume there are kindle books that describe all things & more or probably in a kindle user manual/guide . Since I am using a Kindle HDX, some of this may not be available to basic kindle; if needed, check the Kindle help home or forum.Books that are downloaded & in the 'Cloud', have a small checked mark in bottom center of the the book to indicate the book has been downloaded. So all books shown in the Carousel or in Device that have a symbol like @ if you have downloaded it & then removed it from device. Some books in the carousel & device have the mark & have a X% in right top indicating % read, so that combo indicates it is downloaded.  \"Don't beat me up, just free info.

The HDX does its primary role, that of consuming Amazon prime media (I'm a Prime member) very well.  It's screen is sharp and the color rendering is very good so reading books and watching movies you rent, buy or get free as an Amazon prime member is a very good experience.  Thus, if you can live within that construct I think you will be happy.My problem was I wanted it to do more, and there's where it gets smoked by the admittedly far more expensive but also admittedly far more capable iPad min retina and also the similarly priced Nexus 7.  I found I needed my tablet to do some serious internet surfing, but folks, let's be honest, Silk may have improved over time but it's still arguably the worst browser out there.  It is slow, clunky, and struggles to render accurately many websites I visit.  And yes I did install the Dolphin bowser-not as straight forward a task as I'd hoped-and it's better than Silk but still weak compared to surfing on an iPad mini or a Nexus 7.Then there is the Amazon app market, or lack thereof more accurately.  The apps are poor in their number and often horrendous in their quality when compared to the Apple app store or Google play.  Yes, yes I know you can root the HDX and access Google Play, but if you're going to go to all that trouble why not just buy an equally affordable and very more capable Nexus 7 running stock Android?Finally, I have to say the stability of the Fire OS based on archaic the Android Jelly Bean version the HDX uses is bug ridden and ineptly designed and almost forces you to root it just so you can install an updated Android OS and dump the pitiful carrousel launcher for something far better.So, if you can live within the HDX's limited role of consuming Amazon media I think you will be happy, but the moment you try to go beyond that I think you'll envy anyone with an iPad mini or Nexus 7.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Australian (international version) lacking", "Author": "Vinny", "ReviewID": "R16X1M58ZS7AM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are expecting the Mayday button: Prime: Movies: Share your screen: print functionality (for now) to name a few for Kindles bought through the .au Amazon store then you won't get them.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device. In contrast, watching the exact same program/movie on Netflix with my iPad - I need head phones unless it's perfectly quiet in the room. With the Kindle HDX whatever I've watched so far, I haven't needed headphones/ear buds.I am also still totally flumuxed by the people who whine and complain about the blue screen edge thing. Seriously, maybe it's like migraine sufferers who see a certain blinking light that affects them because I have absolutely no problem with this \"blue edge\" and never would have even noticed it had not people here complained. You have to really, really look, I have to put my face almost on the screen - take off my glasses - and then I see a very, very faint maybe 1 milimeter sized super light blue rim. I don't get the fuss.The screen is absolutely amazing - it is now my go-to tablet - I carry it around with me all day long in the house or whereever I go. I am currently at my condo in Florida and I can't think of another tablet or device that allows you to read in the Florida sun! If I'm in direct sunlight I just change the background to black and the letters pop.I can't say enough positive things about this device. Below is my earlier review.First let me say I had a Kindle HD prior to this and was hesitant to upgrade because of the reviews specifically about the \"blue hue\" people found while reading (what I have, up to this point, primarily used my Kindle for). Either the Kindle HDX 7 inch 32 Gig, no special offers, WiFi has this problem fixed, or those who complained have some sort of odd sensitivity to blue light. I'm writing this review April 2014 having used my new Kindle HDX for almost a week now and I see barely anything noticeable with regard to this blue hue reading with a white or sepia screen. I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well. I even showed my grown daughter the \"offending\" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen. She said, \"All I see is a page.\" Exactly. That's all I see too. The screen for all other uses is crystal clear, amazingly sharp and one of the reasons I decided to upgrade is because even with an i-BLASON case:  http://www.amazon.com/i-BLASON-Leather-Automatically-Compatible-Warranty/dp/B00EA1PMBW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1397744874&sr;=8-2&keywords;=iblason+case+Kindle+HDX+7+inch  the difference in weight between the HD and HDX is very noticeable. I'm 56 and have arthritic hands and the HDX in the case feels feather-light to me. I can read for hours with little discomfort. Also the light weight is important for me when traveling. I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices. During take-off of a flight - I used to read without a problem because no one knew what it was. Then the airlines went to the \"shut off all electronic devices\" to \"now you may leave your electronic devices on during take-off\" recently. So I have had over a 1/2 dozen Kindles and given over another 1/2 dozen as gifts. This Kindle is the best one so far.I also noticed negative reviews about battery life. I can only use my experience - not sure what the others are using their Kindle for - but I played three back-to-back games of Monopoly - read for twenty minutes, went on-line to check a few things for about another twenty and the battery was at 23%. If you've ever played Monopoly - the games take forever (some games can take at least a few hours), with many animations during each game. I do not find that type of batter drain a problem. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and the battery drain on that device is much faster than the Kindle Fire HDX. I can only read for an hour or two - do nothing else on the Samsung no less play any games with high graphics and the battery would be at the same level . Compared to the iPad 3rd generation which I also own, I think the battery life of the new Kindle HDX is as good if not better.Amazon had their special offer for Prime Time users so I thought I'd give it a try despite the nay-sayers and I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase and haven't put it down since registering my new device. It is now my new, go-to tablet with the Galaxy taking a back seat to both the Kindle (in 1st place) and iPad.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.

Honestly I would rather view most pictures and videos on my Kindle than my computer or even my TV (well, the TV does have size going for it).  Performance is very quick and smooth most of the time. Silk (the browser) can stumble from time to time but gets going again quickly. No issues with games hanging (and they look beautiful). Wi-fi is good - nothing great but pretty reliable and good range. Battery life is solid. It doesn't last all day with heavy use, but it will keep you entertained for a while. I get 5-6 hours of pretty constant use before I start thinking I need to find the charger (drop below 30% and better safe than sorry). Camera is fine for Skype chats but it's not going to win any awards.  Apps definitely are limited, but if there's something I really need, that's what my phone is for.Overall I think this is a great product, especially for the price (but since Amazon puts them on sale a lot wait for the sales). The specs are top notch on paper and actually match expectations. It's not 100% as smooth as running iOS, but let's face it, tablets are not hard to get the hang of. Only used Mayday once (to test it) but neat service to have available if you really need help. They may not be able to answer down to every detail, but honestly if you're using Mayday you're someone who just needs help with the basics.If you want every single latest app, this isn't for you.

It searches the net very well, e mail great, music playback nice. Keyboard responds well to touch. Lastly I had to use the Mayday button for an issue on the keyboard. I somehow split it into 2 sections making half the board to the left the other half to the right, leaving a gap in the middle of the screen. I touched mayday and viola!  A screen appeared with a live feed from a tech ! He was courteous knowledgeable and marked my keyboard with a blue arrow showing me exactly where to go to fix the keyboard display. It was awesome.  It took maybe 3 minutes. Great addition. I have one gripe though. I' m not seeing my amazon account in its entirety on the kindle, nor is the order experience the same as it is from an iPad or PC. And I feel the amazon prime account has changed. From the kindle I couldn't find much in the way of prime movies. I was directed to other apps such as Netflix . Is Amazon getting out of the \"movie business\"? Experience with the book rental was similar . Not complaining really just saying.i love amazon! No one can beat them for their speed and accuracy in shipping. I got my new Kindle in less than 24 hours of placing the order. Overall I would buy thus as a gift over an iPad.

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

First, it doesn't give one the entire 64 gb. This is normal as formatted memory systems go, but where the misleading part comes in is that these also use storage memory for operating memory. Thus, when I downloaded so much that I only had 4 or 5 gb left, the device froze up and took forever to play streaming videos and execute files. This means that you don't get the entire memory block for storage, but that you must reserve a considerable amount of it just to operate the bloody thing!When it first began to bog down, I asked the Mayday people for assistance. They led me through a litany of things which did no good. Then when they suggested resetting the device, I asked if it would remove any of my content. No, absolutely not, they said. So I reset the device and the movies began streaming without a hitch. Great! Only when I went to my on device video library, everything I'd downloaded was gone -- almost 50 gigs of data! So I downloaded everything again and now my system barely moves.The video experts told me I should be able to fill my entire storage, but this isn't apparently true. Thus, when you buy a quality Android device that has 8- or 16-gb of memory with a storage of up to 64 gbs with an SD card,  you're getting a better system memory-wise. As far as the video help, out of five calls, three were with people who spoke such poor English that communication was all but impossible. If I'd had a heart attack while on the phone with them and needed their help, I'd be dead.If this device had an SD slot, this thing would get a raging 5-star review. But tech support is wanting, my memory is only about two-thirds of what I was expecting, and this thing isn't that fast. It requires a lot of memory, and that memory comes from the storage, regardless of what I'd been told. You may want to skip this until Amazon gives truthful specifications.

Mizell", "ReviewID": "RUV69N8BOQ6Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a casual user, mainly for Internet, news, e-mail, weather reports, games, and some other things of interest.I've had the tablet for 4 days now, and have found no problems at all.As for the reports of pages on the e-reader with the blue edges - If I hadn't read about it in reviews, I wouldn't have noticed it at all. It's barely there, and certainly not an issue.While I cannot go to the Google app store, I've had no problem finding what I need.  I found a nice Gmail app (Tab for Gmail) on the Amazon App Store. The Silk Internet browser works just fine.  I was able to get my favorite games (Flow Free and Candy Crush Saga), and there is no shortage of others.When I started up the tablet and input my Amazon log-on info, it synched up with all the books I've obtained in the past from Amazon, and had on my Kindle e-reader (old version with the keyboard on it).Setting up my e-mail accounts with the provided e-mail browser was quick and easy.So far, I haven't had to read directions, but I did buy an after market instruction manual from Amazon, which I intend to use.  Amazon has a Kindle support page on their web site, with loads of good info.  Though I've not had the need for it yet, the Kindle Fire HDX has the \"Mayday\" option for free, instant help from a real live person.The speed of the tablet is very fast. Moving from one screen or app to the other, or changing pages is FAST.  No problem with connecting with my Wi-Fi at home, or at work.The display is excellent, and very sharp.  We also have an Apple iPad Air, 10\" size.  The display on the Kindle Fire HDX is just as sharp as the iPad.  I see no difference.I spent the $15 and turned off the \"Special Offers\", and disabled the suggested apps thing just below the carousel view.  There are instructions on-line if you Google something like \"turn off special offers on Kindle Fire HDX.\"  No problem.  All gone.The tablet comes with a $5.00 credit at the Amazon app store. They call it \"coins\", and you get 500 of them to use when buying \"paid\" apps.  Once spent, you can re-up the coins for future use.Things you buy, like paying for apps, books, and everything else you might like, goes against your \"one click\" ordering account on Amazon.com.  Very handy, making it quite easy to spend money if you like.There is a good variety of cases/covers available for these tablets, many available on Amazon.com.  I have the Poetic Slimline case, in black.  Great case or cover, for a great price.I haven't found any negatives yet, and I don't regret getting the Kindle Fire HDX at all.  In many respects, I like the Kindle Fire HDX more than the Apple iPad (which is a great tablet - but about 3x the price - for one with 32GB). The price for the 16GB version is very reasonable.  I lucked out and got mine for free, using up my credit card bonus points I had earned.The battery seems to hold up quite well.  I'd estimate that I ran mine about 9-10 hours before charging it back up from only 5% left.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Kindle Fire HDX, but HATE customer service for Electronic Arts/Origin.", "Author": "Robin Setliff", "ReviewID": "R2R7ZCSPM7USE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire HDX, but absolutely hate that you can't get any answers from Electronic Arts/origin regarding a forgotten password.

Some of these devices I use as Amazon intended; others are modified to suit specific needs/interests. From a hardware perspective the HDX is outstanding and an attractive alternative to the Nexus 7 if you don't need GPS, NFC or wireless charging. On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer. With minimal time and effort my HDX makes an excellent Android tablet that still leverages the best Amazon has to offer.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product.", "Author": "exmptle", "ReviewID": "R1SEUURZHE3PB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this on a trip recently.

My bank app isn't available (capital one).  No YouTube app. No podcast player app. My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle. No decent weather apps are available. Second, you are stuck with the kindle browser, Silk. No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari. Silk is an ok browser but it doesn't handle embedded video very well. Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs. Bookmarks are awkward. Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad. The cursor jumps around randomly. Good luck getting the cursor to go where you want it to when typing. Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps. The OS stores everything in memory and the performance suffers if you use too many apps, and there's no way to close the ones you aren't using. I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently. Fifth, a big selling point was the \"one free rental book a month\" deal with the kindle. But the selection is SMALL and it's impossible to search the lending library. Amazon sells the \"lending library\" hard, but it's clear it's not ready for primetime. Finally, some of my favorite websites are slow and glitchy with the silk browser (like slate).

My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!  I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it. Guess what? When I was sent the new one it worked just as bad as before.My next issue is What happened to flash player?!  My old kindle has it! And now when I go to watch certain shows I used to watch or when I go to amazon to view a product video I can't view it anymore!!Next ..  i used to watch the network apps such as the cw ect..  on my previous tablet and still do with no problems. but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work! Once back in i have to fast foward to where i left off ! This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet. if this were true then why does it work perfectly on the old kindle? Again got the new HDX replaced and still have same issue to this day. It's not my Internet !  I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this ! It was a huge disappointment!In my opinion they took more away and only added a camera.  If they keep this up I don't think I'll be buying anymore kindles in the future.

One in three times it will work. What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words. I guess I am somewhat disappointed because we have an IPad and there is no comparison between the two. (In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well. The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate. They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.  I have to disagree, because of having both I can do side by side comparisons, and everything I have tried the winner is clearly Apple. If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.

Weigel \"Donna Weigel\"", "ReviewID": "R3GNMV4OBSOTS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let\u2019s face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "I had a Kindle Fire before", "Author": "Katgirl2", "ReviewID": "R3KM077T57GA51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used my Kindle Fire for 2 years before getting my Kindle Fire HDX.

The new Fire is harder to read a book on because of the glare of the pages.  Much prefer the old one's easy on the eyes screen.  I don't like the dictionary at all.  You have to page through from a to z to find the word you want.  Waste of time.  I don't much care for the games that are available.  I like word games.  I play several every day such as crossword and Scrabble on my old Kindle.  The choice of games on Fire are mostly juvenile ones with sound effects which are irritating and most of them will only let you play a game or two without paying the company who created them more money.  On the old Kindle you pay for a game up front and play to your heart's content.  I also don't like how frequently it needs recharging - even when it's just sitting around doing nothing it needs a recharge in no time.  I do like that I can pick up my email without starting up the computer. I can check it while I'm sitting around watching TV, etc.  However, you can't trash the email on your computer from your Fire, so you end up trashing it from the Kindle, then when you get into your computer, the emails are still there and you have to go through the process again..  I also don't like the front only camera.  It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.  Perhaps going up to the next level would have been better, but that was a great deal more expensive.  I'd say this is an okay device if you like to play the games a lot, don't use the dictionary very much, either don't read a lot of books or have young eyes.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mayday", "Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.  I can see where the Mayday help feature could be absolutely invaluable to a beginning purchaser, though.

This is one of the highest quality tablets I have ever used.  I argue that this is just as nice as my mother's iPad.  The device is fast.  The OS has major improvements.  That was always my issue with past kindle fires.  The OS was slow and buggy and the browser was awful and you couldn't organize apps very well.This is all changed.  You can organize apps beautifully.  The amazon app store finally has enough apps where I am satisfied (even though it is still lower than google play and the apple app store, it has everything I need).  The silk browser is awesome on this device.  Even if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't switch to another browser.I have not used the mayday button because I am pretty tech savvy, but I am considering getting my grandfather one solely for this reason.If you have any doubts about purchasing this, do it.  Especially if you are a college student.  Textbooks are so cheap on the kindle store, you can highlight and make notes in them, and it syncs to all of your other kindle devices.This device is light. and when I say light, I argue that it weighs about the same as my smartphone.  I can hold it in one hand with ease all day.The battery is not as good as past kindle fires, but I can't complain because of the performance increase.  I can still get a full days use out of it as long as I am not constantly watching videos.  Also - being able to download prime videos to the device is awesome.Overall, I would highly recommend this device to anyone and everyone.  You won't be disappointed.

So it was purchased with the thought that I would use it (primarily to read library ebooks, check email and facebook, and play some games).After about 2 weeks of use I was contemplating returning it as we really weren't using it to warrant the purchase, and we discovered that we would soon have access to 2 more iPads (the Airs).Then I realized that FreeTime wasn't just a thing to restrict access, that for only $2.99 (Prime members) a month my daughter would have access to a lot of her favorite apps and tons and tons of great books and videos.  Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.  FreeTime completely eliminates that, which is amazing!!I still wish many things available for the iPad were available on the Kindle and I still use the iPad more when browsing the Internet or playing games on the Internet.

I've had the device for a couple of weeks now, and have used it primarily for streaming videos via Netflix, reading books, and browsing the web.  On the positive side, the HD screen is beautiful, and delivers excellent quality for videos or browsing.  Likewise, the fast processor helps ensure that media is delivered more or less flawlessly (subject to the connectivity issue discussed below).  This is consistent with the Kindle's other strength, which is facilitating the consumption of Amazon content.Those positive things said, there are several issues that I have experienced that should give prospective purchasers pause.  And if the point of the ratings system is to help users assess whether to purchase the product, I would suggest passing on the Kindle and sticking with another Android-based device.First, the network connectivity is horrendously unreliable.  When connected to a wi-fi router that provides fast, reliable service to a variety of other devices (tested with an iPhone, an iPad, a Droid Razr Maxx, and a Windows PC), the Kindle for some reason cannot load any webpages or other internet content, even though it indicates having a strong wi-fi connection.  Occasionlly, if I restart the Kindle, the problem will temporarily resolve itself; however, even that step should be unecessary.In addition, the battery life is mediocre, even when the screen brightness is dimmed and the wi-fi turned off.  This tends to diminish the Kindle's value as a media consumption device, because the battery drains, sometimes at the right of 1% per minute or two.Finally, the Amazon app store remains a laggard - far behind the Google- and Apple-based offerings.  (Yes, you can side-load Android apps; however, once again, that's not a hassle that users should need to tolerate.)If you don't need to stream movies via Amazon (for which you need an Amazon device), go with another Apple- or Android-based device and just install the Kindle app.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not impressed", "Author": "Jesica", "ReviewID": "R3MFXPSZBP4R14", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are just going to just use it as an E-reader then that's fine.

The processing speed and memory are among the best for 7\" tablets.  The screen is fantastic, and even the sound from the speakers is impressive.  Another great feature is the ability to view Prime Instant Video.  Access to free movies and TV shows (some of them are even downloadable for off-line viewing) is an added bonus of having an Amazon Prime subscription.The tablet is also great for kids, or individuals who aren't very tech savvy.  Its very intuitive to use, and the parental controls are fantastic--even allowing parents to set a designated period of time that their kids can play with the device.  If you are a parent, someone who is looking for an easy-to-use device, or someone that simply wants to watch videos, read books, and play simple games, then the HDX might be your tablet.However, I was looking for a more traditional Android experience and I just couldn't get past the Fire's heavily modified Android operating system.  First, the operating system offers very few customization options.  For example, you cannot change the background screen, have access to widgets, or customize/organize your home screen as you would for other Android devices.  I also use the Swiftkey Keyboard on my Android smartphone, which has helped productivity when sending text/email, however, the keyboard on the HDX cannot be changed and Swiftkey is not available for the HDX in the Amazon Appstore.The real nail in the coffin for me was the inability to access Google services.  This means you won't have access to the Google Play store, which has a vastly improved app selection over Amazon's Appstore.  You also cannot access Google Hangouts which I use frequently for text/chat messages as well as video calls and videoconferencing.  Further, I use Google's Chromecast to stream video to my television. The Chromecast app is unavailable on the HDX.The tradeoff of purchasing another Android device over the HDX is the inability to use the Prime Instant Video.  Amazon has provided an Prime Instant Video app for Apple devices, but has not (and I suspect will not) produce one for other Android devices.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over this because I didn't find the selection of free movies and TV to be all that impressive.  The selection of free movies that were downloadable to the device for off-line viewing was even less impressive.  Most of my video viewing on the tablet was through HBO Go, Hulu+, or Netflix.All in all, the HDX is a decent tablet with great hardware that unfortunately stumbles on its software.  If Amazon were to offer a Kindle device with the same hardware, but with a more traditional Android software experience with a slight Amazon spin (a la the Samsung Galaxy Tablets), I would certainly be willing to pay a higher price for the device.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's Only O.K.", "Author": "fearn0evil", "ReviewID": "R2CIX400A3M8VY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its alright.

The Send To Kindle app is such a neat thing, I've been able to send documents straight from my Mac to the Kindle over wifi, which is so simple and genius. The only thing I haven't figured out quite yet is if the battery always drains as fast, or if there are apps running the background and I'm just not sure how to turn them off completely. It's a simple thing to do on my iPad Mini. Between the Mini and the Kindle I prefer the interface of the Mini, but the size and screen of the Kindle. The Kindle is definitely my go-to for reading now, and the Mini will remain my game/entertainment machine, mostly because the app store is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else.

Speed. Crazy fast and really responsive. Really slick.4. WiFi. Two antennas and better range than anything else in my house.5. Layout. Love the screen and the carousel is ingenious.

This is not my first kindle (or second, or...). This tablet is definitely an improvement over the previous versions, it's more responsive, it handles video and web browsing so much better than the previous Fire generation, and I love the slimmed down version.The overall design is an improvement. The video quality is great, and music does play with a decent quality. Love the feature where it can display lyrics while playing song (if the mp3 has the information), thanks to the whole X-Ray/Lyrics feature. There's a lot of new touches here that are fun. I really appreciate the volume and the power buttons being on the opposite sides of the kindle now (don't know how many times I've hit the wrong one on my Fire >.<).Also, being able to have more than two browsers open on Silk now w/out it crashing all of the time is a great improvement.Some minor quirks - not sure if it's me or the tablet, but still trying to figure out how to get pictures already taken from my phone onto the tablet and directly into the photo folder.Have installed several apps without a problem, downloaded files and opened them, so far so good. The kindle goes everywhere with me (literally, it's the perfect size to fit in my purse). I wish there were more cover options for the 7\", but it seems to be increasing the longer the kindle is out, and I think a cover/case is a must for one of these. This is the kindle that I do take everywhere, and on a recent trip, I used this more than my Surface as it has my most frequently used personal emails installed on it (easy to set up), I can access my social accounts, my music, and of course my books.The battery is... eh, decent. I can keep it on and play music for a few hours, video less, and use it to read books for most of a day.

Grinstead", "ReviewID": "RP5JLI47IGQSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned an iPad previously. And, generally, the concept of a tablet is really convenient and fun. I loved my iPad.But iPads are expensive: The Apps are expensive; the cloud for storage is expensive; iBooks is expensive; updating to a new model is expensive.And the Kindle Fire HDX proves that the iPads aren't worth it. The Kindle Fire HDX does everything I wanted my iPad to do. Further, it's Amazon; so even though technically all of the apps purchased are Android apps, Amazon prices many of these Android apps more advantageously to me than my Google Play store and other Android shops do.The graphic layout of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", i.e. its icon placement, \"the carousel,\" its menu placement is very intuitive and pleasing to the eye. It's a very minor thing, but I actually really enjoy \"the carousel\": You purchase a new book or app and it shows up as this huge icon among other often-used icons. It's fun and makes you feel like you have purchased an actual book.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels amazing to hold, too. I am a bibliophile and, hence, own too many books. Nothing will ever compare to holding an actual book for me. However, Amazon has managed to design this particular Kindle at least feel as much like a book as possible.This is great news because another thing that Amazon generally does exceedingly better than its competition is sell eBooks. As a former owner of an iPad, I was able to and did download Kindle, NOOK, iBooks, Kobe, and other eBook-purchasing and reading apps. While owning those iPads still I always defaulted to the Kindle Reader. Amazon consistently and for a long time has simply offered better and more popular eBooks at better prices. Amazon's \"Daily Deals\" are something to watch for. I have owned my Kindle Fire for less than a month and have already been able to populate it inexpensively with bestsellers like the Divergent series, the Legend series, Burial Rites, the Goldfinch, Doctor Sleep, academic books on behavioral economics, etc. But, going back to the original point, the fact that the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feels so much like a book had made purchasing such a large quantity of eBooks as I currently have even more enticing at the time of purchase. As confusing as that sentence was.But, in deciding between purchasing this Kindle and one of its competitors (namely an iPad), here is likely the most important point: My five-star review is as much about Amazon itself as the Kindle.It is true that the Kindle Fire literally does everything that I have known my iPads to do. Like an Android phone, the big difference is in who supplies the apps. I, personally, love Android apps more so than iTunes apps. So considering nothing else, the Kindle Fire HDX was a worthwhile purchase if only because I was able to update my tablet without my credit card company deciding it needed to raise my interest rate because I had paid the equivalent of a new furniture set from Bombay for a tablet that had a logo whose bumper sticker would look great on my Subaru.So, whether or not you get full enjoyment from the Kindle Fire HDX depends on how much you use Amazon. Full Disclosure: I am an Amazon Prime member. I love it: Free 2-Day Shipping, streaming video, cloud storage, one free soon-to-be released book a month, etc. And, as a Prime member, my Kindle fully enhances that experience.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was a gift--Husband loves it", "Author": "Satisfied Buyer", "ReviewID": "R1DVJMRORZE7GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and operate.

The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" wooed me because I am a Prime member and most websites inclined that it's almost absurd to not look at the Kindle Fire HDX if you are one. I was offered a free trial and enjoyed the 32GB model thoroughly.  The apps I could get were fun and watching videos looked great.The features, look and feel were great.  I was saddened to be limited by the App store and lack of Google Play access.  I find it ironic that when you turn off the limitation on app installation the warning states that foreign apps might not be trustworthy when a recent free app offered triggered people's spyware app on their Kindle Fires.  This wasn't a huge drawback to my enjoyment, but another thing Amazon needs to work on.  There was another new issue that Amazon Techs apparently don't know about.It was during my free trial I saw an odd glitch in the system with certain apps.  Apps such as Simpsons Tapped Out, Angry Birds Star Wars 2 and UNO & Friends, I saw a strobe-like light flicker on the screen.  I ignored it with my free trial Fire, but when it occurred again on the 64GB I got for Christmas I was concerned.  Thankfully it doesn't occur during any video playback.When researching the issue, I found there wasn't much.  There was only one other post on an Amazon comment board from a gentleman who revived his Fire for Christmas this year.  He posted a YouTube Video, but it's rough to see the flickering.  I found one other article giving tips to troubleshoot it and I tried them all and retried them when I used the MayDay button.The Mayday tech sent me to a kindle specialist who had me reboot and try the apps again.  He had never heard of this issue which worried me a bit.  In the end, Amazon sent me a replacement tablet.  Once again playing Angry Birds and the background starts flickering.  Not sure if there might end up being an OS update to fix it, but it's something to be aware of.It's a great device and priced incredibly for what it delivers.  The App store or app accessibility needs to be massively increased and this new screen flicker issue will hopefully be addressed.Overall, I'm pleased with my Kindle Fire to stream all my Flixster movies and Amazon Prime Videos.  There are just a few issues Amazon needs to work to really make me forget Apple's iPad.Updated 2/16/14As a Christmas gift, I can't say that I was disappointed in my purchase but after owning this since December and already going through a replacement I expected much more.  The Tech reviews made it seem like this thing could go toe to toe with the iPad but I had used iPads my family owned in the past and I've seen nothing like the issues this device has.  From repeatedly errors in apps, apps that stop opening and have to be forced closed several times in a row to the screen flickering like a strobe light (Yes the auto brightness is off).  The flickering is what led to my replacement, but immediately upon rebooting my replacement did the flickering come right back.  I led it slide because it happened in games like Angry Birds, UNO and Simpsons Tapped Out because I thought maybe the software was having a difficult time with games that pull a lot of memory.  I really shouldn't have since this is supposed to be the faster Kindle Fire and have the ability to portray graphics with great detail.  Now, apps with simple text articles like IGN are now flicking.  I'm not sure if it's their Android software but I think by next Christmas I'll trade this in for a new iPad Mini.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This product is on fire", "Author": "Al T", "ReviewID": "RHN3DZXIMUN4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an ipad 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it and I love it.

I was not impressed by it due to the unusual GUI, lack of true Android, and slow performance. I've owned every generation of iPad and type this from my 32GB iPad Air. I also own a Nexus 7 (2012).  I initially considered the HDX because of the special offers, namely the extra special ones where products are sold dirt cheap ($19 Paperwhite? Heck yeah!). But after buying the 16GB HDX 7, I changed my opinion. I ran out of space on it and returned it to order a 64GB HDX (at a much more reasonable price difference than Apple could ever dream of). I'm not ditching my iPad's anytime soon (too heavily invested in that ecosystem) but I can't stop gushing over the HDX. It's fast  the screen is crystal clear (blue tint on edges doesn't bother me), super light, and inexpensive.  I will always take it when I take a tablet rather than the iPad (which beg to be stolen). The origami case is also pretty impressive. I like how it holds on by a magnet and can easily be removed. And the folded stand is FAR more stable than the expensive leather Apple Smartcase on my iPad Air. As for the Nexus 7? It now feels far too sluggish and I hate the 16:9 aspect as well as the black bar that never goes away.

I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

Although I heard goodreviews of the iPad the cost was prohibitive although the store was top notched.  Likewise, I heard good reviews about the Nexus but I was concerned with the store.  The Kindle HDX 7 delivers both as promised: inexpensive and also linked to the largest store in the world.I have had it for about a month now and it has been worth every cent I spent on it.  I love toggling it on and instantly watching movies from either NetFlix or from Amazon Prime.  Its fast and pretty.  I did once have a problem with Netflix -- it kept telling me I had no internet when obviously I did.  I reinstalled the app and never had a problem again.Reading books is great.  Clear and crips lettering and easy page turning.  Magazines I find with a mixed bag.  Essentially the composition of digital magazines has a lot to be desired about, but that has nothing to do with the Kindle.  I configured one email to its mail application and it works well, with no real complaints.  Typing on any soft key keyboard is a chore and I am thinking of getting a pen (although most I have seen are outrageously priced for a plastic stick).Not overly impressed with web surfing on this or any tablet.  I certainly dislike the mobile versions of Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter.  Some you can convert over to the normal desktop experience, others you can't (pointing at your Twitter!!).  I love to surf the web and just jump from one site to the next -- this is awkward and difficult with the Kindle.I have had no real trouble with the device and I have not tried their special help feature where I talk to someone.

Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an \"android\" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a \"fix\" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7\" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need.

This is the first solution that I feel confident about and comfortable handing the Kindle to a child without worrying. Also I like that I can limit the total screen time for my kids while requiring that they read for a set period of time before they can play games or watch videos.

I call Amazon and even though it was my fault they sent a new one out next day air for no extra charge and also included a prepaid return label.  I've dealt with a number of different companies customer service departments over the years but never have I experienced anything like Amazon.  They go above and beyond all customer expectations and will do just about anything to make sure the customer is happy.I've had my new Kindle HDX for a month now and I rarely use my laptop anymore.  I subscribed to the 3 magazines I use to get through snail-mail.  I transferred my Audible.com account to my Kindle, and I downloaded all my android games to it as well.  I just purchased my first Kindle book and that has been a positive experience as well.  I loved my Kindle so much that I purchased two more for my mom and dad.  They aren't all that technologically knowledgeable but it took them no time to learn and now they use their Kindles daily.The screen resolution is crystal clear and very vibrant. It's fast and the touch screen is very responsive. The menus are very easy to navigate. Awesome web browser.

I Skype a lot.The battery life is very good thus far. I can get about 12 hours of steady web use, 8 hours of constant streaming, and have left it idle for 3 days off charge and still had 99% battery life. I can take it to work for 14 hours with sporadic work related use and end the day with 30% battery life.The device functions smooth and quick. The processing speed is top notch.The display is so clear, HDX is great for viewing pleasure. No problems reading books in sunlight.The speakers are very clear and can get quite loud.Navigation is easy, not confusing at all.Amazon's free app of the day are usually high quality apps.Amazon also has these kindle customer only lightning deals that offer some serious value.Cons:The Device has, on 4 separate occasions, refused to respond from sleep mode. Just a black screen, like the device has been switched off, and it will not respond from pressing or holding the power button. All 4 times I got frustrated at the lack of response and walked away from it for a few hours. When I came back it worked just fine like there had never been a problem. Was not a charging issue, the battery had plenty of life left and I did not have it on charge while I let it be for a few hours.Amazon and the Google play store do not get along.  The kindle is designed to actively block any attempt to access the play store. It can be worked around of course, but it is annoying that I must do that. The Amazon app collection is not very large in comparison and leaves a lot to be desired to me.Overall it's great, I use it all the time.

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%. Meanwhile, my Nexus 7 was at 14%, plugged in at the same time and was at 100% the next morning. I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.

They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time.

I don't care for all the fancy technical stuff or connecting to TV at really, I'm happy as long as it does what I need it to do.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great device but lacking output/apps for external devices (TV, Receiver)", "Author": "someone", "ReviewID": "R359D4Z06Q4KMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are many reviews for this device, but not much information about how to output the device display content to external TV/monitor. So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lovely little tablet.

There is no way I could afford a new iPad and after using this, I don't think I would want one anyway. I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality. I would definitely recommend a kindle tablet to anyone who is looking for a tablet for entertainment purposes but is hesitant to shell out the cash for one of the more expensive brands.

As a 5th year student I really didn't want to (nor could I afford) a new laptop that will be replaced by a professional computer in a year or so. So, I thought on black Friday why not try for $180. I own the 2012 kindle fire and thought it was this seemed to be a good choice. I got a Bluetooth keyboard for this to make it a \"real laptop\", because I mainly write essays and it does well. I like this new kindle so far. I can type with a Bluetooth keyboard on word apps which helps a lot for the normal college student. I am not a tech geek or anything, just needed something to get me by for the last school year. I had a normal 15\" laptop then a netbook that both died out in college so I really didn't want another expensive computer and this is a good replacement. I don't plan on this being a forever replacement and I don't think other people should either. I use it to type and play games on it. The kindle is really thin which I love. At first I was hesitant because I was fine with the 2012 fire but I needed something better to write essays on. Now I think this is new one is fine. Overall, if your looking for a basic tablet that can do things like write in polaris app (or in king soft, whatever) and play app games this does very well. If your looking for a tablet that is more photo sharing, personal details, bigger screen, etc this may not be for you. I haven't had a problem with it and advise a person to get Prime with it, you can download movies and watch them without internet (great feature).Down sides:Yes it's a kindle, you can't have a screen photo and they're adds but for the normal person thats not much a bothersome.The power button and a volume button are on the back of it. I find it a hard transition coming from old fire to the new one. It beats me why they'd put them on the back. I find the power button on back a little bit of an annoyance but new fire users may not. This also makes it an issue because if you have an old kindle fire you'll need to buy a whole new case and NO OTHER KINDLE FIRE CASES WILL FIT IT! (You have to specifically buy an HDX one). I bought one thinking they would but nope. Normal CASES cover the power button on back; I still use the non-fitting case because I don't want to spend more money on a case.It is only 7\", no surprise there. But it is on the tiny side for tablets. I didn't mind in on the 2012 kindle fire and I don't now. If you have a giant cell phone it may seem odd because they're close in size but I don't have a high tech phone so this really doesn't bother me.This version does have a front facing camera, I don't know how many MP. I can't seem to find that info (but I haven't searched that hard).

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since! Good luck! There's a lot of good tablets out there to choose from.

Since they first became available, I had held off on purchasing a Kindle Fire. The new features on the HDX and the positive reviews finally moved me to make a purchase, and I must say I am very impressed! It was very easy and quick to set-up and your having exploring and having fun. I am considering enabling the parental controls to limit my time on it!I purchased the 7\" because in my mind, I could not justify the jump in cost to get the equivalent 32GB in the 8.9 HDX fire. I also wanted something that would fit in my purse vs. having to carry something else around. I was a bit concerned about the ability to read text on such a small screen, but it really isn't an issue because the screen gives a very crisp picture and there is a magnify feature. Don't get me wrong, if you need glasses to read, you will still need glasses to read ;) I am very happy with the speakers for music and movies, etc.. You get a healthy volume with a quality sound that others in a room can easily hear.There are some neat features that I don't believe are advertised. One, is on the keyboard. There is a microphone symbol that when it is selected, transcribes your spoken word into text. Also, I was confused about whether a anti-virus or malware app would be required. The community forum had a number of conflicting opinions on the subject, so I chatted with kindle support. The representative assured me that the Kindle is already designed with all the security algorithms necessary. She added that there are apps available for anti-virus and malware if anyone wanted them. In addition, she advised me that the browser has a option called Security in the options menu, which will provide you a warning if you are about to Enter a potentially harmful site.Bottom line.... I love my Kindle Fire and I am looking forward to exploring everything it had to offers!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Fire as of yet", "Author": "Reed", "ReviewID": "R1YPC8QTS442JN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great for reading, watching, listening to music and browsing. I have the old Kindle Fire and a Galaxy Tab 3, 10.1. Amazon did a great job with all the little extras they added to the HDX. If you have an old Fire a side by side comparison will have you loving the HDX. It is lighter,  faster, easier to maneuver around the system, the presentation/organization is cleaner, and the screen itself seems to keep off fingerprint smudges better. Another favorite is the ability to put books in collections. A set back on this ability is not being able to change the listing of the books within the collection's pop up window. The only available view is a grid view, and it's hard to see the books in this view.I would say that the volume output on the new Fire HDX is better than the Galaxy Tab 3. You can easily understand the conversation on videos and hear the musical notes on online radio as long as you don't become too picky about the notes. Picture quality is better than the Galaxy Tab 3 too. The colors are clearer, image is sharper, quite comparable to one of the better HD TV's on sale today. I was very surprised at discovering this. The TV we have takes quite a bit of power, now I just watch Netflix and Hulu on the HDX and get the same quality, less electric consumption, but not the big screen.Good battery life if all you're doing is reading or listening to music. Expect to plug it in more if you surf or watch videos. If you are planning to use it in sunlight, you'll need a lot of patience, but that is not the reason for buying the HDX. If most of your reading, watching and surfing activities are indoors, then you'll be fine.I bought a Fintie cover for it, the Fintie comes with 'buttons' that go over the HDX's existing buttons. These make pressing the power and volume buttons easier, and allows for better touch recognition too.Does it take the place of a laptop? Absolutely not. I do not believe any tablet will ever take the place of strong processors and lots of storage for people who 'work' on laptops.

I like the 64 GB and quad core processor.  The dual band wi-fi can use more power than my Internet can really deliver.  I will probably have to update my whole Internet package.  When I use the wi-fi to do downloads, everything on my wi-fi slows to a crawl and my Internet movies on Amazon and home computer freeze till it is done.  I think my phone company only offers 100 Mbps with my current package. This kindle is powerful and takes over my whole Wi-Fi service.The power adapter is a little different this year and goes in at an angle (thought it didn't fit).  The adapter comes with the Kindle.I will be keeping my old Kindle Fire HD, because I still enjoy it and some of the old apps I am not tired of yet (not compatible to HDX).  I will be able to upload more of my pdf's to this newer Kindle, because pdf's use a lot more space. Also I can download more TV shows and movies, since I live in the Amazon ecosystem.I like the clock on the screen is back. When I open the Kindle cover, the clock is in the corner with the date.  That was not on the HD, but was on the first Fire (it was bigger).I like the offers, because it is important to me what else is available.  The screen is beautiful as always. I did have to make some adjustments to brightness (using settings) and the books (using view) I am reading. Actually for us older folks, brighter is better.The sound is nice. I was watching PBS channel out in my yard and my neighbors could hear it. The PBS channel app  was not something I was aware of before, but loving it now (even with my Internet service).The HDX is smaller than the HD 7\", but the screen is still the same size.The camera on the 7\"HDX is better than the HD.

It sounds cool on their site to have it anyway...but....they're just advertisements on the lock screen that take up the whole page.  Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.

She was EXTREMELY helpful and kind and informed me it could take a couple hours to receive this promotional credit.Last but not least...the power cable.  It is at a FUNKY angle on the tablet in order to keep with the contoured angle of the tablet edge.  It angles upward while plugged in properly.

So ..it has a fast enough processor to game and complete tasks like surf or watch a movie. Oh yeah another big thing was....reading books...this thing makes it easy to read a book....Amazon Prime and this device just works and is a huge solution for many tasks just reach down and pick it up...only thing that I would like to see is Kindles offer more harddrive space....like a 1tb...yeah we are in a time of file servers aka cloud servers...but in times of no internet...a real harddrive is a must...face it 4G/3G is a hoax, its a joke when it comes to internet so don't fall for the 4G lie and highway robbery mobile internet companies charge for internet...Amazon seriously this product and your growing services is on the right track for the future.

I watched movies, streamed music, watched video, surfed, read articles and books, used the alarm and calender, used yahoo weather app, played games. The only thing i noticed as something it lacked was harddrive space when the Amazon prime video offered to download the movie better quality would require more harddrive space. But this is more of need when traveling through an area where there would be no internet or limited internet. And...

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

But before I get to what drags the score down for me, the good stuff about the Kindle Fire HDX:- Clearly more than a reader.  The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me. The good news is that many of these can be fixed; the question is whether they might actually be fixed. Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store. This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with. I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes!!!

Also have a full-size iPad which is a great size for watching movies in bed, but really too big/heavy to play games.  The original Kindle Fire has only 8 GB storage (partly taken up by software) so I wanted another smaller tablet.  It was between the new Kindle HDX or the new iPad mini.  One thing I didn't like about the iPad mini (besides the price tag) is that the bezzle on the long sides is so narrow, it is hard to hold the device without getting your thumb on the display (which screws up games).  When I saw the HDX on sale on Cyber Monday, I grabbed it.It's fast, thin, light and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I can't believe how light it is compared to my KFire! There are several design changes, such as the ability to show the percentage the battery is charged in the little icon in the top right corner. You have to swipe down from the top of the display to access settings and other utilities.  I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.  I did download a Prime Instant Video to watch off-line, but I don't like the small display for watching movies.About that display -- I compared the HDX to the original Fire, looking at the same page of a book that has alot of white space on it.  White is a color, and like all colors, it can be \"warm\" or \"cool.\"  A cool white is \"bluish\", and a warm white will be a little yellowish.  When I compared the 2 kindle displays for a book, I was shocked to see something I never noticed before.  On the original Fire, the white is \"cool/bluish\" and there is yellowish tint seeping in around the edges of the pages of the book I was comparing!  This never bothered  me; as I said, I never noticed it.  On the new HDX, the opposite is true --  the color white is warm (yellowish) with the blue/purple (that so many have commented about) seeping in around the edges of the book.  I doubt that this will bother me, and I feel that the people who complained about this and sent back this beautiful little device because of it, need to get a life!  BTW, the page on the HDX doesn't look yellowish to me at all; it is only when compared side-by-side to the original Fire that you can detect the different tints to the white color.I love playing games on the HDX, as even fast running games (such as my favorite Temple Run 2) work without stalling.  And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.  But charging is very fast using the included charger. My only real issue now is the battery life.  I am currently charging it up, and I am going to see if I can get anything close to 10 hours of \"mixed use\" on it.  (Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.  Search on the internet for other tips.)Edit about battery life:  I usually find that when products are advertised as \"up to X hours on a single battery charge (depending on settings, usage, blah blah blah)\"  I usually get half that. What concerned me about the HDX was that I had fallen asleep with the HDX unplugged, watching a PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED movie (a 2.5 hour movie downloaded in \"better\" quality; after it finished, the display went into sleep mode)-- the next morning, the battery was showing only 35% charged from fully charged the night before.  Since many people posting on the forums with battery problems were told to do a \"hard reboot\"  I tried that then fully charged the battery again (luckily, charging is pretty quick.)  Downloading music, and letting the display go to sleep mode, the HDX lost only about 10% per hour.  But as soon as I picked it up and played some games for a little while (like Temple Run 2) the battery much more rapidly depleted (this is with wifi turned on, as music was simultaneously downloading).  Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, \"airplane mode\" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%. So, finally, I downloaded a 2 hour SD quality movie to my HDX, and going from fully charged, with wifi off, and brightness lowered to about 50%, the battery went to 88%, losing only 12%.  Yes, a big improvement over my original KFire which lost double that, 25%, under the same conditions.When I got my HDX it was about 70% charged.  Looking in the settings, I saw that the software was up-to-date.  I was able to download content, read, and play games, without the HDX turning itself off and rebooting (as many have complained of).  The next morning, I saw a notification that there had been a software update -- one thing that was changed is that you can now put apps and books into \"collections.\"  Not only that, but apparently my HDX \"synced\" wirelessly with my iPad Kindle reading app, where I had already put some books into collections.  Those same books now appear in collections on my HDX without my doing anything. Thank you Amazon.I give this 5 stars, certainly in comparison to the original Kindle Fire.  In general, this HDX is spectacular and the price is great.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "bargain despite the blue", "Author": "Marcus L.

The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.  Brownie point #1SIZE: It is significantly lighter than my original fire,  and the tapered edges make it feel quite thin.  Not a fan of the tapered edges at this point,  seems slippery like I am going to drop it.  Might just be the way I hold it ..CHARGER:  I am not a fan of the charger port location;  due to the tapered edges ... the mini-USB plug goes in on a weird angle.  Can't just hold the thing flat and push it in ... I can see I will need to be very careful when plugging it in.SCREEN:  Turning on the HDX ... had a instant WOW factor.  The screen is so much better than my original fire it is almost ridiculous to compare the two.  Very crisp, clear picture and ...TOUCH RESPONSE:  I am sure it's due to the power behind it (CPU) that the responsiveness of the touch screen and smooth scrolling are also massive improvements over my original kindle.SETUP:  It took no time at all to setup;  it linked all my old books and apps automatically.  It was seemless .. my old kindle was still warm sitting beside me and I already had this one up and running with all my usual apps on it. Well done AmazonBROWSING SPEED:  One of the most improved aspects I notice is how fast the browsing of the web is.  This is something I used to not use on my original kindle ... If I had to goto a webpage I pulled out the laptop, not anymore .. the HDX is very responsive and fast,  I may argue it's faster than my viao with an i7 processor and 8Gb ram ... well at least when it comes to Browsing the web.FIRST NIGHT READING EXPERIENCE:  I found an auto brightness setting which is awesome;  lights go out, screen dims automatically.I'll update more after I get to play with it more.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire HDX", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R1XNJ427NC1JKM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three \"blue screens\" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.

I would download these anyway from another tablet, so why not AmazonThe biggest gripe of other reviewers seems to be Amazon's aggressive advertising and link to their ecosystem.  I have the special offers (cheaper) version, and don't really find the ads annoying (if I did $20 would fix that).  And I like the direct link to Amazon's content.  Nor does Amazon try to prevent you from sideloading APKs (they actually give you an installer on the device) nor from rooting (you can relatively easily install CyanogenMod I've heard).  In truth, I think rooting would be a big mistake, as you would lose out on Amazon's ecosystem without gaining anything.  The better route is to sideload the Nova Launcher (or there are several other launchers that do just as well) as they more or less remove any advertising, and give you a more conventional Android interface.  I make sure that I have links on the Nova Launcer dock to Amazon store and to Silk.  It's the best of both worlds.Update...I've had my HDX for two weeks now, and am pleased that Amazon has such a light hand in controlling their UI.  I've loaded the Nova Launcher on my HDX, with docked icons for Kindle Store, and Silk Browser.  The result is a better UI than IOS or Nexus 7.  Almost everything I want is sideloadable.  I tried sideloading GooglePlay (*HaHa*) but that didn't work for a fairly obvious reason -- Amazon did not want to be responsible for an App that collects payments outside their own ecosystem (it opens up a host of headaches for them).I purchased the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working.  For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations.  It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc.  The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.I even used the Mayday button once trying to set up the Netgear Push2TV ... it works as advertised and Amazon staff are great!In my opinion for a variety of reasons which I would classify under the general rubric of Amazon's \"ecosystem\" the HDX is better than Nexus 7 and iPad Mini-Retina (which is ridiculously overpriced), which makes it the best 7\" tablet available.Oh... and be sure to buy the Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Polyurethane Origami Case (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7\"), Mineral Black ... this is (if you  look at product reviews) an unloved and misunderstood accessory.  I was not impressed when I first got it, but now that I own it, I think it is the best case out there (though too expensive in my opinion).  The stand and magnetic cover work as advertised.

But the time came to declare allegiance.  Music and video purchases are less and less dependent on hard media like CDs and DVDs and are becoming more and more cloud based.  Which cloud\u2026that was the decision to make.So Amazon came out with fireTV\u2026and I took the plunge and decide to go with Amazon for my video purchases.  I have been a prime member since its inception\u2026and it is the first place I go to when I am looking to buy something.  I love Amazon\u2026probably in an unwholesome way.With that decision behind me I was now free to find a device to take entertainment with me when I travel for work.  Do you have any idea how long and painful it can be to copy DVDs into digital files to take along when traveling\u2026I simply did not have the patience to convert all 14 seasons Dallas!  I needed a device that would hold a number of videos to get me through at least 2 weeks overseas at a time.  Reliable streaming overseas is generally not an option for a variety of reasons.And so I bought a Kindle FireHDX (64MB, no ads) and have been absolutely delighted\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t be happier.  It is so FAST\u2026compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.  The video quality is beautiful.  The sound is great and it is extremely simple to download videos\u2026even Prime videos\u2026to take along on my travels.Of course, nothing is perfect.  There are some disappointments but they are relatively minor.1) Battery life is disappointing if wifi is not disabled.  That has been my experience.  I will lose 15 \u2013 20% overnight if I leave the wifi on.  With the wifi off\u2026battery life is very good.  If there is an option to turn off wifi after being asleep for a while\u2026I don\u2019t know about it yet.  Long term, hopefully something like this will be developed in a software update.2) Lack of a mini HDMI out.  I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.  When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.  It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.  I think the miracast is not quite ready for prime time yet.  It is not the end of the world if I can\u2019t hook up the hotel TV.  Watching directly from the Kindle works well.3) Apps\u2026need more.  I once had a Blackberry Playbook.  What awesome tablet that was\u2026really.  Fine quality device, perfect in every way\u2026except for the limited number of apps.  Amazon has to make this a priority.  And the apps need to work beautifully\u2026like they do on my iPhone (see, I said I had one foot in both camps!)4) Flicker.  I notice a disturbing flicker with one of my apps.  Haven\u2019t let determined if this is strictly a single app issue or if it will show up elsewhere.  I\u2019ll update later if it is more than just this one app.All in all I feel this was a most self-indulgent purchase\u2026it is such a sweet device and the perfect travel companion.

I bought a game on the amazon app store and it ended up blue screening the device which was surprising since i never had a tablet give me the blue screen of death before (but to be fair it hasn't had a problem since then )* battery life when watching videos is worse than my asus tablet* you don't see the date when you pull down the notification barLast thoughts*It is probably a good idea to add a password to the kindle because it is always signed into amazon.

I put on the screen protector, put it in it's case, set it up with my acct information. I was in awe of the look and feel of it. It is beautiful! The picture and sound are amazing too. If you love Amazon, this is probably exactly what you want!I went into the situation blind. I read a lot of kindle books so I thought the Fire would be great. I didn't understand that a tablet would block you from using specific programs they deem competition. I use Google Music, I pay for unlimited music each month. It never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to stream my music over my tablet! It doesn't make any sense to me! My HTC phone, which uses google, lets me download Amazon apps so why wouldn't Amazon let me use Google?!I went into chat with an Amazon rep to find out if there was anything I could do to get my music on it. They said no, they were sorry. They said I was free to buy music from them tho. Of course I am but I don't want to buy every stupid song that pops into my head. I'd go broke!And they don't offer anything like unlimited streaming that I could switch to.In looking through the kindle apps, I also learned that the Google apps that are offered (maps, gmail) had horrible ratings with comments that they don't work at all.I am a HUGE Amazon fan. And even through this, I am a loyal customer. But I am  so deeply disappointed. I am disappointed that they have chosen an isolationist approach to their product. Having my music available to me would not have taken any dollars away from them. I still would have bought my books and movies through them. Probably a lot more than I do now. I don't buy my music thru Amazon, I buy it thru iTunes. I always have and I always will. I keep my music on Google Music. I use the unlimited music to hear new songs so I know if I want to buy it or not. By not letting me stream music they've lost book and movie purchases. They never would have had much music business from me. Maybe some, bec I might be too lazy to use iTunes. The thing is, I have my way of doing things. I use many products. I don't want to feel contained or limited or be forced into changing for literally a BAD BUSINESS decision by Amazon.I wanted the kindle bec I thought it might be nice to use in the kitchen or around the house specifically for entertainment purposes. Reading, music, movies, tv shows. A sort of all purpose entertainment center. Like they advertise. What they don't say on their product page is that you won't be able to use Google services. It should be very specific for people like me who are new to the tablet world. I bought a case and protective covers and the warranty.  Amazon is charging me money for the returns and some of it can't be returned. I feel like they withheld important information and now I am paying the price for it.I did some research last night and decided to go with the second generation Nexus. It will stream music, allow Amazon apps and it has a cute keyboard.

That mean no Google Play, Google Maps, Google Navigation, Google Search, Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Translate... You get the picture.  Why would anyone want to limit themselves to the offerings at the amazon App Store with such a great little tablet?  Kindle Fire HDX is just a version of Android with an Amazon makeover.  Every aspect of this experience of using this device seems to be geared toward getting you to spend money at Amazon.  Right off the bat you are given a free month of Amazon Prime, the service that costs $79 per year.  They offer streaming videos, but, everything here is on Netflix.  Netflix has more.  Most TV series let you view the first episode for free, but all others cost money.Did I mention, the startup screen is a full-page add for some random irrelevant gadget on Amazon?  And, The top of the screen on the launcher page is, you guessed it, another link bar to Amazon Store Categories for you to accidently click when you want to slide down the top bar to check what messages have been displayed.Now, let's talk google.  Google invented the droid operating system and the google play store has everything under the sun for Android.  Apps like Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, Navigation, Google Drive.  These are not available on the Amazon store.  They really make up the backbone of productivity on the Android system.  Amazon seems to only want you to use this for entertainment, on a pay-as-you-go basis.I'll be looking for a way to load generic Android, or selling this on eBay.Amazon, if you read these, please come out with a more open update for this device's operating system.

Get it now.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for reading, not for collections", "Author": "Beate73", "ReviewID": "R22CPX7DUXUDT3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've now had the new Fire HDX for a couple days, and being a now long time iPad user, it's a good alternate to iPad. There aren't as many apps for the Fire as you have for iPad, but I'm guessing that's just a matter of time before they fix that.I mainly bought the Fire so that I could add my very extensive book collection to it. For reading I've been using the Kindle Touch 3GB, and I have more books than I have space. I found it tedious having to add and delete books all the time. I thought the Fire would be a good step up.If you have a couple hundred books, the Fire is perfect for your book collection. But if you're like me, and have been using Kindle for years and have a 6K+ collection, you might be disappointed.First, you have to click on every single book to import it onto the Fire. There is no batching. I really wish they could have had an \"add whole collection\" option. Importing is tedious at best.Second, you can't just import your old collections and believe that all books will automatically place themselves in the correct collection. First of all, I now have collections from my very first Kindle on the Fire. A Kindle that has been deregistered from my account for ever.The collections that did import correctly, are a mess. Books are missing, or the wrong books are in the wrong collection.Then there is the books that aren't in a collection. If you're viewing your books as collections, you can't find the books that aren't in a collection. It is simply impossible to figure out which book is in a collection and which book needs to go in a collection. I like to organize my books, and collections were the perfect way to do so. On the Touch, that is. On the Fire, it's all a big pile'o'crap, and I can't figure out what's up and what's down.So far, bookwise, Fire has been a huge letdown for me. I was really excited about getting the new HDX with the 64GB hard drive, thinking I'd finally be able to put by books in order. Not so much.As far as reading experience, the Fire is very good. The screen is clear, the text easy to read, and it doesn't hurt your eyes like the iPad does. Which is the only reason I give the Fire HDX 3/5 stars. I really hope Amazon updates the OS real soon where you have the option to import your whole collection with just a few clicks. And most of all I hope they fix the collections issues. Just thinking about what a mess my Kindle is makes me want to cry.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kindle Fire Is Growing Up!", "Author": "JPP Smorenburg", "ReviewID": "R5TINYTF5X0WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to share my feelings about my new HDX 7 which I received recently. I'll update the review as I get to know the HDX as time passes. I use the HDX daily for 2 hours on average reading and surfing. I use a PaperWhite 3G at work and at home and have used previous E-ink Kindle generations for daily reading in the past. Kindle Fire is growing up fast. The vastly upgraded device response and fluidity are already well commented on. The extra speed when surfing the web and navigating the HDX are again a big step up, good work. There is very little display reflection, improving reading once again this gen. Text is totally, faultlessly sharp.A very cool software feature in the Kindle app are the extra Wikipedia and Translation boxes that come together with the dictionary definition box, totally cool. Silk works better, taking many opened tabs in its stride and making the most of the display size with the cool article mode and nicely working full screen option that takes away the tabs and adress bar to move the page upward. I always found the iPad 4:3 display ratio appealing, but the Silk features mentioned above make the 16:9 ratio enjoyable for web surfing while keeping the device as small as possible.The form factor is again much improved with the HDX generation, no apologies necessary anymore. It's much more manageable than my previous generation HD 7; noticably less circumference and a third less weight. The physical buttons are very tactical, unlike those on the previous gen., and the sometimes mentioned \"angled\" USB port feels and looks solid, not at all awkward. The bezels are smaller and the plastic outer enveloping rim much more so giving a very tight, high quality appearance compared to the previous gen.In my opinion, Amazon have at this generation arrived at a wonderful compromise between \"boutique\" (like iPad) and \"utility\" (previous gen. HD) moving steadily toward the iPad. Also with the HDX, there is a better compromise between Amazon presence (say, like an Amazon website-type environment) and an open Android presence (like any generic android tablet) with the HDX showing beautiful, eerily sharp lockscreen wallpapers, app icons matrix and book covers, with removable recommendations which, removed, leave an \"Android or iPad like\" home screen save for the background, which is (in my opinion) nicely dark with classy icon shadowing.Battery life is at least as enduring as on my previous gen. HD. Sound is as good to my ears.UPDATE:I have some clouding, showing a brighter spot of about an inch in the centre of the display, which is visible on an even background like when reading. I can only get rid of it when switching to white text on black. The slight blue border bleeding is also present, but doesn't bother me at all.UPDATE 12/3/2013: I've requested and was right away permitted after a short live chat an exchange HDX to arrive in a couple of days, amazing stuff!UPDATE 12/5/2013: I received my replacement HDX today. What a miracle of logistics; from across the Atlantic traceable almost to the hour. Even my return HDX I can track. Boggles the mind. Well, I must say the clouding is less with the new one, but I can still see it. My daughter (painter artist) shakes her head and says: \"You exchanged it for that?\", when I show her the \"faulty\" one. Must be me then. I'll accept it as a HDX character trait.UPDATE 12/14/2013:The HDX performs excellently, the smaller size and mass, and the very sharp, defined characters are more appreciated as time in use passes. The new ability to sort cloud content in collections is much appreciated. Silk occasionally froze. Disabling page load acceleration solves that.This device is a big improvement over the previous HD; better ergonomics again, better display, less glass glare, much more zip, diminishing the E-reading gap with the glorious PaperWhite. My PW is certainly used less for reading since the HDX is here. As we live in the real world, I think the price:quality ratio is very important, and the HDX has made that ratio more favourable again for my ends, which are: reading E-books, internet news and watching news videos with the best possible display quality and low weight and size at a good price. Weighing the above factors, the HDX-Amazon combo is unbeatable. What I would call a Serious Tablet.Job very well done,Recommended!UPDATE 1/5/2014:For an Epub reader app, I can recommend Aldiko, downloaded through their website via a sent link for the free, non-ad reader. Really hassle-free, with only the basic options for good reading, not playing. The only caveat is crashing of the app with large .Pdf's. But it's not really needed for those; the embedded Kindle Reader app is superior for handling .Pdf. No need to waste space installing the Adobe Reader.For a good enough productivity app, I can recommend the King Soft Free version through the Amazon App Store. No ads, no hassle, easy connection to Google Drive.Good File Manager app: Free no-ad ES File Manager through the Amazon app store. (You can get easy access to your Cloud Account by adding in ES through documents/network/add (+ key at bottom, pick your account)Good Task Manager: Free no-ad ES Task Manager through the Amazon app store.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDX is even better!", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"Chuvasia\"", "ReviewID": "R1FRVSKFODHZFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to download Prime instant videos is sweet!

The two best features are the Mayday button and the song lyrics. No tablet that I'm aware of has any support even close to the Mayday button. You simply tap the onscreen button and, voila, a person comes on your screen and helps you. A real person you can see. The can't see you, but they can see your screen. I've used it a couple of times and never waited more than 10-15 seconds before they were right there speaking to me. AMAZING!Second, the new rolling lyrics with your music is awesome, however,  not many songs have the lyrics yet. I'm sure they're working on the data base, but the more current songs are available. On some albums some songs are done but not all. Great idea and hopefully Amazon is bringing lyrics in quickly.And let's not forget xray for movies. Tap the screen and you'll get a pop-up with movie info like the names of which actors are on the screen at any given moment. Awesome!Awesome machine... If it just had front AND rear facing cameras it would be perfect. It does have front facing, but not rear. Try it you'll love it!

I enjoy it more as I use it more.  I used MayDay on the first day.  It worked as advertised. I was questioning about an App that I had on the Kindle Fire HD that is not compatible to the HDX.  I was told that APPS will be worked to take advantage of the higher quality display.  That seemed to be a reasonable answer.Even though I had the Fire HD, I never used the Silk browser much at all.  I am now familiarizing myself with this browser and that is going well.  I do have a slight bluish haze on the page as I read, but I do not find it distracting.  I viewed part of an episode  of a TV  program I bought through Amazon and the picture and sound were excellent.The weight makes this tablet easy to hold.  Unless I am sitting at my desk and propping up the HDX, I will normally remove it from the Oragami case.  The case works well when I need it, though.I have the HDX chiefly because I like Immersion Reading.  It performs excellently at this task.
