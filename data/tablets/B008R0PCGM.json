It is nearly impossible for someone who isn't a tablet user to figure out how to download apps. The touch configuration is completely off. Just a horrible Christmas gift for my son who only asked for this. It is on it's way back (thank you Amazon for being so easy to resolve issues) and the Kindle HD has already been ordered.
