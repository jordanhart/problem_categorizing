NOW, GOOGLE anything doesn't work! Actually NOTHING internet supported works! I contacted Google because google play stopped working. The specialist told me this company DOES NOT HAVE A LICENSE and/or did NOT pass compatibility test required by Google. Basically he said that once the Google server realizes its not AUTHORIZED it shuts down connectivity. This will be going back tomorrow. BUYER BEWARE, DO NOT BE STUBBORN OR NAIVE LIKE I WAS, SAVE YOUR MONEY!Here is the email from GoogleGoogle Play Support Team googleplay-support@google.com10:38 PM (27 minutes ago)to meHi K*******,Thanks for calling Google today to ask about your issue with accessing Google Play. I'm always happy when I get to hear directly from our customers. If for any reason you need to contact us again, please feel free to reply directly to this email or visit our help center at:support.google.com/googleplayI reviewed your account and unfortunately right now, the Flytouch Tablet isn't supported for use with the Google Play Store app or with play.google.com, which is why you're getting an error on the Google Play website.I know this might be confusing, but not all devices running Android are licensed to use Google Play. This happens because manufacturers use the free Android software on their devices, but sometimes these devices don't pass Google's compatibility requirements to have the Google Play Store app installed. To help with this confusion, we've published a complete list of supported devices here:[...]To see if your device can become a supported device, to find out what your other options are for getting apps on your device, or if you have any questions or doubts, I recommend contacting the manufacturer of your device directly.Thanks in advance for your understanding; it's very frustrating for us when our users have problems with unsupported devices since we can't help any further. If you have any follow-up questions about supported devices, please let me know. Have an excellent day.Regards,M***The Google Play Support Team", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, not Great", "Author": "Kaleb Antonson \"God Is In His Heaven, All Is ...", "ReviewID": "R1WAGGN99AXNMA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for a few reasons, A) Iv been wanting a tablet for awhile and B) because my kindle keyboard recently broke. Iv never heard of the Brand FlyTouch, its apparently some Chinese knock off company, thats not to say the tablet is bad, its OK, it does feel plastic and cheap, but I only spent 120 dollars on it. people are saying that you have to push hard to make the keys work are mistaken, its not the keys that are hard to push, its the processor that takes along time to complete the action, it is a slow tablet, but at the end of the day I like it. It has alot of ports that other tablets just dont have and i like the fact that you can customize it. if you are looking for a cheap tablet, buy this.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "What I expected and wanted from this tablet.", "Author": "Abram Vargas", "ReviewID": "R3ASY4DPNUOTII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok so let me start off by saying that if you want something that compares to and I-pad or Asus prime or any Top of the line tablet this is NOT the tablet for you. I mean come on people the price says it all.  You want a top of the line tablet pay the price of a top of the line tablet which for now is over 350 dollars depending on the tablet.  That said, It is everything it says it is.  It did come with a 4.0 android operating system and it does have the USB ports and WiFI.  It arrived on time.  I bought this tablet for my 13 year old Godson.  All he is going to do with this is to use Facebook, write Email, and play Plants vs Zombis and Angry birds and read books.  I tested this tablet for those purposes and it worked fine.  Now it that is all you want to do this tablet will work fine for you as well.  It is a bit slow but not so slow that you can say why did I buy this for.  I rated it a 5 star because it was exactly what it said it was.

Let me give you honest feedback that you can count on. I actually give this product 3 1/2 stars but that wasn't an options.Pros:Tons of appsNice speedFair Download time2 USB ports (to connect keyboard and other items)A modem jack (to plug in your phone line if you don't have wifi)HDMI port (to connect to your tv so you can watch videos or netflix movies)Comes with a stylus (which improves the touchscreen quality)LOUD soundCons:The device is made of fragile material (get a case)Touch sensitivity is mild (use the stylus which comes WITH the device)Privacy screen (the screen appears blurred to someone who is standing a an angle trying to look over and see)Now WI-FI is great but sometimes you have to reconnect it, it takes like 1 minute or less to do. TIP: Go to the google play store (the app) and reinstall youtube. This is because the youtube installed on the device is outdated. Just telling you to save time.All in all, the good far outweighs the bad. This device is great, works well with tango, skype, etc. Most people are trying to compare this to an Ipad, you cannot compare apples and oranges. Plus, Ipads have huge drawbacks as well.

If someone at these companies would take the time to make a thorough, easy to understand instruction book, the ratings and sales would be much higher, and the consumer would appreciate the product.  How about a tablet for \"Dummies\" book.  The only real issue with these products seems to be the powering on and off, which can be erratic at times.  The product quality and technology is decent, but I don't think the foreign countries that produce them can translate the instructions properly for the US market. They really have some great features, but the lack of instruction causes a lot of fustration. I have revised my review and have only given a one star reveiw because the Flytouch website does not respond to my emails. I sent two, and the first was sent over a week ago.

Many of the reviews were not very positive, but the few that were positive are what helped me decide to purchase this tablet. I was going to purchase a Kindle Fire or a Google Nexus, but really wanted something less expensive. The product arrived days earlier than the estimated arrival which was a pleasant surprise. It came fully charged, which was also a nice surprise! The instruction booklet that comes with the tablet is really not helpful - whoever translated it to English did not know English very well. However, I was still able to understand it enough to figure things out.  I had no problems connecting to WI-FI and so far, the connection has never dropped.  I was concerned about the Facebook app not working properly after all of the negative feedback, but even after updating it to the latest version I am pleased to say it is working wonderfully!  All the other apps have updated to the current versions and are also working just fine.  I have added several apps such as Scramble with Friends Free, Kindle, Netflix, and more and they have all worked as they should.  I also purchased a memory card and it is working great, too. I purchased this tablet with the intention of using it for email, games, searching the web, watching movies via Netflix, using Facebook and reading books with the Kindle app and it is perfect! Someday I will buy one of the name brands, but for now this is just what I wanted. :)UPDATE 9/17/2012: After having a week of no problems, I went to use this tablet this morning and it was dead. I used it the night before with no problems, I plugged it in to charge overnight and it was fine. Next morning it would not turn on and the light that shows it is charging won't even light up.  I have sent a request to the seller for a return. I will update once I hear back from the seller.

But just so we're clear it's not an Ipad, meaning you can use flash memory, two usb ports, very easy syncing, works as a easy and great video player for 1080p movies with nearly no setup time, and for the price I haven't seen an equivalent. I absolutely agree there are faster, more modern tablets on the market, however as the old saying goes \"You get what you pay for.\".

I would have given it about 3 stars originally but here's why i gave 1 star, and suggest to buy something else.Angry birds and a few other apps were preinstalled, which is nice. The item is refurbished and not new. Although the system was programmed in english, someone was previously using chinese web browser on there, so when opened, it would always be in Mandarin.  A lot of the apps were out dated and had to be re-downloaded, but we had problems with compatibility.  The touch screen, even after synced, was not very good and would often open things other than what you would press.  And finally, the reason for giving it the worst rating is that after 1.5 weeks of using, it inexplicably died!!  It will not restart or anything.  Currently trying to return this product.
