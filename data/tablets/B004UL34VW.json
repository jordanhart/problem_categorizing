However, when I decided to move from a paper day planner that I was alway misplacing to a tablet, I was not sure of which tablet to get.  Like everyone, I see the Apple IPAD everywhere and have many friend who are devoted users.  However, I was not convinced that the IPAD was the right table for me.  I like the smaller size of the Playbook compared to the IPAD.  I have found the calendar, the email application, the contact compiler, and the web browser to be very simple to use.  I have also taken photos with it.  Those are the applications I am after in a tablet in my professional life as a Catholic priest.  There is a learning curve for me as I get comfortable with the Playbook, but so far I am very happy that it is meeting my needs.  I am very happy with my choice of the Playbook. I am not sure what the future of the Playbook and Blackberry will be with all of the competition with IPAD, the Android platform devices, and the new offerings from Google and other companies.

This is coming from a person who currently owns a Windows Phone 7, an Android Phone, and an iPad 2.  I bought the Playbook with much hesitation and little expectation.  The $299 price convinced me to get it.  Now, I'm happy I got it.  I love the 7-inch screen size.  It's so much more comfortable to hold and thus, more portable than the iPad 2.  The Playbook doesn't have mobile broadband, only WiFi; so I have to use my cell phone's WiFi Hotspot to connect it to the Internet.  Not a big deal.  The biggest drawback is Blackberry's AppWorld, which does not offer a few apps I would like to have such as Words With Friends and Google Voice.  I think RIM has an awesome mobile OS, better than iOS and Android.  They just need to attract more 3rd party support.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Tablet!

They all have a review on their sites. All the complaints about not having enough apps in the App world, not having native apps such as BBM, email, etc, and the screen size being too small is unneeded. I saw one review in which the reviewer didn't like this because of the screen size, then stated that he/she is gonna get the Samsung 7 inch tab. WTF? Do you not realize that they're both 7 INCHES???

There are so many reviews on here for the Playbook (all the bad reviews seem to complain about one thing, the amount of APPS, just craziness!), there is not much to be said that has not been said already, so I'll keep this simple, basically give the reasoning behind my decission to go with the Playbook over other Tablets/laptops...  About 4 months back my \"Acer ONE\" laptop crapped out on me, and I've been saving for a new laptop ever since. It's been a hard 4 months, as I have been stuck using my Ipod Touch 1st generation to surf the net while at home, which BTW has NO Youtube or Flash on it (it had Youtube but no longer works on it anymore!)!  Well, about 3 weeks back I finally saved enough and began surfing the net for the best laptop/netbooks on the market.  When I started my search for a new laptop, the only thing I was looking for was a laptop, thats all I had on my mind.  The main things I was looking for was a fast browser, the laptop/netbook must be small (9 to 10-inch screen or so) for potability, a decent amount of memory, a nice camera, and must be powerful enough to play movies and stream content without glitching up on me.  While researching a couple weeks back, I decided to take a look at Tablets, thinking to myself that something like my Ipod but with a bigger screen would be absolutly perfect for what I was looking for!  I must have looked at every Tablet on the market before deciding on the Playbook (The Acer Iconia, Moto Xoom, Ipad 2, etc), I even went to Best Buy just to test them all out, and in the end it was a no-brainer, the Blackberry was the Tablet for me.  While there are some good Tablets at a cheaper price then the Blackberry, the main advantage the Blackberry has over them is Power, the camera/video (1080p video recording), the OS interface, browser speed, the size (portability), and more Power!  I was amazed at the OS on this tablet, it is AMAZING!!!  My favorit feature of this is to wake up the Blackberry, you simply swipe from the top edge down, and it turns on the Playbook! While there is a button to press inorder to turn off/on, you do NOT need it, a simple swipe of the screen does everything now (watch some of the Blackberry Interface video's on Youtube, you will see the beauty of the OS in it's full glory!)!  I can now record video's in full 1080p and watch them on my TV with micro HDMI connection (only $5 bucks for a micro HDMI cord here on Amazon), when I am at home I surf the web on my 46-inch Samsung HD LCD Screen through my Blackberry Playbook, I watch movies, etc, all on my TV! :) I can now take wonderful Pics where ever I am without my Samsung Camera on me, the Playbook does it all!  This Tablet is tiny, but the screen is sooo perfect in size, it is bigger then I expected!  I was thinking that the screen was gonna be just a tad bigger then my Ipod Touch screen, NO SO!  It looks more like 4 Ipod Touch screens put together, just the perfect size to read and watch movie's without having to squint. I am not a big app freak (never been), so the apps that this Playbook does have suit me just fine (Although RIM has stated they are adding apps daily, this is there first Tablet, so I do give RIM the benifit here).  My goal now is to get me a Blackberry phone with a Internet plan, this way I will be able to \"Bridge\" the phone to the Playbook \"at NO cost\" and go on the internet on my Playbook anywhere there is a Cell Phone signal, so my fiance can be driving down the highway and I can be surfing the web sitting right next to her! :  The awesome thing about this is you do not have to pay for a seperate plan for the Playbook, you simply buy the plan for your phone and Bridge the connection to your Playbook, and BINGO, internet everywhere! :D  I also bought a \"Defender Case\" for my Blackberry Playbook, this case protects like you would not believe! If you decide to get this awesome Playbook, the Defender case is the only way to go!  This case is sooo tuff, You can run over the Playbook with a car and there won't be a sctratch on it!  Look up \"Defender case for Blackberry Playbook\" here on Amazon, and check the reviews. There are also video's on Youtube which shows the strenght of this case. There is nothing better then this case to protect your investment.  With all this said, I am beyond happy with my Playbook, I could not be happier!  If you are looking for what I was, just get this baby, you can thank me later. :):)", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrific product", "Author": "Paul Kropp", "ReviewID": "R19UD49Q09C9ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical at first.

I was waiting for a better selection of Android 3.0 devices to come to market before purchasing a tablet, but when I read the reviews on the Playbook I felt it would work better for me as a Blackberry Enterprise smartphone user than an Android tablet.  I was able to find one for less than $325 on Amazon and got a $100 rebate from RIM, so my net cost was $225.  A great deal for a tablet that let's you use your phone's data plan to access the internet (as long as you're not an AT&T; user).  If you have a Blackberry Playbook and are on the AT&T; network, please switch to another provider and let AT&T; know that the tricks they're playing with Bridge Browser is simply wrong.  Any company that values their customers as little as AT&T; doesn't deserve to have any; but I digress.I've used the iPad extensively and feel like the Playbook is every bit as good, only in a much more convenient size.

Was worried at first I might get a refurbished unit but no, it was New and flawless as stated ;)You can expect to have a low battery level, so once you start it and go through all the setup it will tell you if you want to upgrade to the latest OS version, which I did, and thus have to wait for battery levvel reach over 20% for it to start the download and install, it was looooong but I didnt mind.In regard to the start from zero (from off state) it takes 2 minutes to fully load (some have stated as long as 5 minutes!). The screen is fantastic, speakers are incredible.Key points to my purchase of this tablet where: 64GB!!! (have tons of music & video loaded and still have around 30GB, this tablet will come with a little less of 5Gb from factory), wanted to try out the Blackberry Bridge feature, its really good, all emails, SMS, BBM are handled with the Playbook without having to take my 9380 out of its holster. Dual HD Cams is a nice feature :)Regarding apps, well there will be no support of BB10 (latest software release is OS 2.1 from february 2013, hope we keep seeing more updates, but for now Im OK with it), you get a limited choice of Apps no doubt, and most \"likeable\" apps are paid... too bad, not much of choice for games (free ones, you do have many paid games out there which are very nice).For the amount of money this costs, I think it is a very good deal! It will make a nice travel companion :)UPDATE: after a week of use Im pretty happy with it! All connections (wifi, Bluetooth, Bridge) work flawlessly and Ive managed to download quiet a few applications and games! you can find a lot of sites with games/apps available for the Playbook! (do not rely just on the App World). There is a program called DDPB which will let you \"sideload\" Android apps to the Playbook!

Do a search on the internet on how people use their Ipads. I am sure this is true for other devices.What I like about the Playbook over the Ipad,1. Multi Tasking2. Gestures (no constant pressing a button to change apps)3. Blackberry Bridge (with my bold connected it is superb)4. HDMI output - this works great with any TV, it uses the full screen (not like IPad) no extra accessories (only cable, not like the Ipad) it can also use the Bold's touch screen and keypad for input.5. The size - Ipad have just woke up to this with the Ipad Mini.6. The build - as good as the Ipad if not better.7. The price - recent discounting gives you 4 64gb Plybooks for 1 64gb Ipad.8. The mini usb port far more friendly that the Ipad (Apple cannot even stick to one format).I think the Ipad is great but has it limitation, the Playbook is great and combined with a BlackBerry Bold it is a great business tool.On balance I think the Playbook wins out just on the points above but I am always open to persuasion.I hope this helps anyone wanting to choose.I have not mentioned the Nexus 7 but it is good and a treat for those that like to change things all the time, with the correct firmware it is the fastest tablet, but not for the faint hearted.Also if you want to see what the playbook can achieve go here and have a look at the video not an Ipad in site in the Porsche  [...]", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Recommended", "Author": "Zagain", "ReviewID": "R3CMMSDGC8NY1O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I recently purchased it because, at the price, it seems like a great deal.  You get 64GB of storage (a similarly priced Android tablet would have 8 or 16GB), and the hardware platform is similar to other 7\" Android tablets.  I was aware that the app store would have far fewer options available than what one would find in Google Play or Apple's store, but to be fair, there were quite a few options for games and other tools.  The unfortunate thing is that the unit arrived partially charged and would not allow me to recharge the battery with either the provided power adapter or the USB cable.  After doing some quick searching on Google, I found that a number of people experienced this problem -- either after first opening the product or after using it for a year.  Another negative is that the tablet has a very long boot up process.  I actually thought on initial boot that it was simply stuck on the initial BlackBerry screen given how long it took, but it eventually started.  I then assumed that this was probably just a delay due to it being the very first startup, but on a restart I found that it was the same thing.So, overall, I would urge caution in purchasing the tablet.On the positive side, it's got good hardware, great storage capacity, and some obvious software advantages for BlackBerry users.  Additionally, while it may not have the selection of apps and games that you may find for iOS or Android, it's not as if the store was completely empty with choices either.On the negative side, however, I find it hard to \"trust\" the device as it seems the ability to recharge is a common problem.  Additionally (and others have mentioned), BlackBerry is obviously abandoning their tablet line, so the long-term prospects for the device aren't great -- but if you can get one that works (and recharges), I'm sure it's fine for many uses.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a GREAT tablet for your Dolla'...!!!", "Author": "Vincent Aumann", "ReviewID": "R2QIRN2XVX537E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A GREAT Tablet for your Dolla'...! I have been playing around with this thing for the past week or two, and this tablet is nice! It is a solid built tablet, with a nice \"rubberized/coated\" backing to keep it from slipping out of your hand. The weight is there, knowing you have something in your hand which I like, due in part by it being a LCD tablet, and not a LED tablet like iPADs and such.Like the iPADs out there, it does not have the MicroSD/SD slot for expanding memory and such. However, getting 64GB of memory compared to an iPAD Mini w/ 16GB of memory, for HALF the price! For me.... that's a \"no brainer\".Also, it comes w/ at least 1GB of RAM & a 1.2GHz processor, and I believe.... iPAD Mini is 512MB of RAM? REALLY... I hate to say this, but it's time for the \"Fruity Named\" I.T. company to upgrade their hardware. They are way behind in that area, yet... charge the most money for their products.Anyway, the O/S is very smooth & simple to figure out. Took me 10 minutes to get the jist of how it works, and have now gotten quite competent rolling through it for all the uses I need for it. I have let this thing stay on, with the WiFi on until it drains to zero, with periodic use - this BB Playbook EASILY lasted 24 hrs before I went and charged it back up. (NOTE - if you use the cellular on it, music, video, it will be less) I play a LOT of music thru the WiFi, and it lasted a good 8 to 10 hrs.Other little nuances to note:1)the fact you can \"Pause\" applications in the background OR have ALL of them active. I pause them, so this is probably why the battery will last longer than maybe for other people.2) there's desktop software to download (free), so you can transfer files between computer & Playbook, and this is very handy!3) Having HDMI is nice when wanting to surf/watch a vid on my big screen TV instead.4) Touch KYBD on the Playbook is nice to type on for a 7 incher. Adjusting the sensitivity of the touch screen KYBD is simple.5) Quite impressive sound quality on the dual speakers AND when listen thru the headphones AND listening it thru my AUX jack in my car stereo.6) The BB Playbook takes surprisingly decent pictures & video. (5MP rear / 3MP front)So if you're looking for an easy, simple, more money for your buck tablet - Get the BB Playbook. I use it for music, writing lyrics, reading documents, and general surfing of the web for the most part. I don't need a full blown laptop for on the go, nor paying the high price of other tablets out there.

It takes about 2 hours to charge it to get it to 20%. Some people have also said thatthe battery dies when you drain it completely... that's because lithium ion batteries aren't like alkalinebatteries and it's not good to completely discharge them.PROSThis is using original operating system version 1.0.7 Bundle 2942 that came with it, not eventhe latest 2.0.1 Bundle 358 update.-Comes with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint preinstalled. I'm not sure how useful this would be for professionalssince the tablet doesn't have 3G, but if you have a Blackberry phone and use the bridge, it seems like it could be very useful.-Browser has only crashed twice using it for about 3 hours a day for 10 days. Not bad at all. Once it crashesyou can turn it back on immediately.-I easily had 5 tabs open in the browser, 2 of them videos but didn't try more. The 1Gb of ram helps a lot with multitasking.-Amazing Wifi: Browser confirmed download speed of 100 KBPS compared to 80KBPS on both desktops and a laptop whichI thought was pretty strange. The browser must have have a built in download accelerator or somethingbut I'm pretty sure my internet shouldn't go faster than 80kbps.

When I set it to 100% it literally hurts my eyes it's so bright.-OS 2.0 apparently lets you download a lot of android apps.-Amazing screen, some things look like they're 3-d. More than sufficient brightness, super black blacks,no dead pixels,very even brightness. The resolution is also very good, both text and video are super crisp.-Great touchscreen responsiveness, pinch to zoom features, and hold a link to right click.-Very stiff case, it's very hard to twist-Thin and light, doesn't get hot, not more than 90 to 100 Fahrenheit-The keyboard is amazing, and the size of the tablets lets me type with both fingers even in landscape mode,although that wouldn't be comfortable for a long period of time-True multitasking with the UNIX based Blackberry OS, unlike IOS and other operating systems.You can leave the camera on, a game on in the background, music on, all while browsing the internet.-Good weight, feels solid but not too heavy at all-Can bridge with Blackberry smart phones (I haven't used this feature).-Pretty decent speakers, can get pretty loud.CONS-Biggest con for me is that the Blackberry desktop software just doesn't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling at least 5 times,but it never downloads over 60%. If you try to upload on the tablet directly it also cuts off, saying the internet connectionmight have been interrupted but it hadn't been. Most download managers would automatically pause if the wifi got disconnected,not start completely over again. Very annoying.-Takes 3-5 seconds to switch from portrait to landscape mode once you rotate it, not a big deal for me though-Takes 60 to 80 seconds (average 65) to turn on if off for more than 30 minutes. The good thingis it's functional immediately after it turns on.-15 increments of volume adjustment, but I always felt like it was too quiet or too loud (with headphones on) I have very sensitive ears though.-Most camera pics look grainy, white light pics look much less grainy though. When you upload the pics to your computerthere'll be a lot of pixels, but a lot of them are just noise.-When the battery is charged to 90 to 95% capacity it takes a very long time to charge to 100- about 1 hour from 90 to 100Once above 20% it takes 3 to 4 hours to fully charge. 2 hours from 0-20%-Only 13.4 GBs of usable space, but my whole music collection is about 5 GBs and I don't plan on putting a lot of movies on the tablet.-Can't expand memory because of no SD card slot.Overall, for me, the pros dramatically outweigh the cons.This is the review that convinced me to buy this: check out the review on notebookcheck dot netI pretty much agree with everything stated here.One tip I have is to charge the battery to around 95% and only let it drain to 70%. This maximizes the life of the battery. For me, this gave about2 to 3 hours of time between charges. This is because of the nature of the lithium ion battery in the tablet.Search lithium ion batteries at batteryuniversity dot com", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Highly Underestimated Tablet", "Author": "Elle", "ReviewID": "R101Q9BHGSZVJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great tablet. Let me break it down and explainPROsSIZE: The 7\" form factor is great, it is highly portable. I havent left it at home really since i got it. i'm not one to walk with a big bag, so this is great to drop into your purse or jacket/pants pockets (if you're a guy) It is very solid. So it's great for reading books as well.GESTURES: the playbook uses gestures to turn it on, change applications, and so on.. as there are no buttons on it except for the power and volume buttons. This has to be my FAVOURITE feature.. so ingenious! I own an ipod touch, now i find myself swiping on that screen. lolTRUE MULTITASKER: beauty about this tablet, you can run one application and simply swipe across to get to the other without stopping the first one.. pretty cool. I havent seen any lag on it, i have gotten up to 9 applications going at the same time and it still didnt slow down.BRIDGE: If you own a Blackberry smartphone, it will skyrocket the PB into more awesomeness. With the Bridge function, you can connect your phone with the playbook and use the phone's data plan to surf the internet on the playbook. Big help if there's no wifi around. You can also see a lot of information that's on the phone on the playbook. you can use BB messenger, memopad, calendar, messages (emails) on the playbook.FULL BROWSER WITH FLASH SUPPORT: when browsing, all flash material comes through just like you would on a computer. My mother is able to even check her farmville on it when she's in bed. Though it is laggy, but it will do the job.MEDIA- CAMERA: 3 MP forward facing, 5 MP rear; both capture Full HD 1080p video. you can get some beautiful photos and video. the mics are crisp and clear and loud.- SPEAKERS: 2 speakers on top of either ends of the tablet. They are nice and loud.- DISPLAY: 1024 x 600-pixel resolution. for the size of the tablet, videos looks great. very sharp and crispFUTURE OS: I'm pretty sure BB10 operating system will come to the playbook which will just make the playbook a whole new device again... as i witnessed with Playbook OS 2.0CONS:APPS: In truth, the Blackberry Appworld doesnt have a big apps market like the others have. But many times, the browser does well to access the website. (other tablets create apps because they dont have the flash support and isnt able to use the full website on it)There is no Netflix nor Skype app available, though there are apps that try to get around that. As far as i know, Netflix will not get to the Playbook neither. These dont affect me much because i dont have a netflix subscription and i dont use Skype.Some apps on the PB also tend to be a bit more pricey in comparison. The appstore is growing though so this con may do a turnaround at some point.WEIGHT: For it's size, it's kinda heavy and you can feel it in your hands after a bit. (especially when reading)Overall, I love the PB, i find more uses for it everyday. I find most people who complain about and sully the good name of the playbook didnt do their research... Take heed of what you're buying..  because if you want netflix and skype and a bunch of apps...dont get it and begin to complain that it doesnt have it.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "At $199, the playbook is definitely worth it!", "Author": "Ver de Guzman \"Ver\"", "ReviewID": "R1XRETVZLCVJS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At $499, the BB playbook is a total rip off! But at $199, you should definitely buy it. Why?PROS:1) The screen is superb. Good resolution with nice bright colors2) The camera is good as well, both front and back3) It is gesture-based and quite cool for me who is used to android and ios only4) It looks great, how it minimizes its apps. Makes it easy to transition between apps.5) The body has a nice solid-feel. The matte texture feel of the  back is nice too6) Has decent preinstalled apps/gamesCONS:1) Limited apps/games. Most apps are paid, very few ones are free2) Camera has no flash (but not a big deal for me)3) No native twitter app. Browser only4) The bezel is just too thick for my taste but I can get over it5) Hangs once in a while and had to reboot to get it working6) Reboot time is quite long, a lot longer than android/iosIn conclusion, despite having equal number of pros and cons, this is still a great buy and I still recommend it for those who wants to use they tabs for social media, videos and emails.

A major software upgrade is coming in February and I am already excited by a peek preview of what is to come. There are more than sufficient APPS available from the App Store to satisfy my demands. The Wi-Fi system works great picking up signals wherever you go. The best part about the PlayBook is its size. It fits into a jacket pocket as wel as the pockets of cargo pants.

Gibson", "ReviewID": "R3702WLQJ2R53W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided on this tablet as a last minute Christmas gift during the fire sale that was offered by a name brand electronics store toward the end of December.  Yes I read the reviews about how the tablet was good but wasn't \"ready for prime time\" blah blah but with competing models running more than twice the cost I figured, why not?  You can also read a myriad of critcisim on it suggesting how it can't be any good because of its app shortcomings and you'll need to wait until OS 2.0 for it to be anywhere near competative.  Anyone remember waiting for iOS 1.1.5 or even 2.0 on your IPhone to address bugs, push e-mail, etc?  Guess that's ok though... sheesh.I've had it now for about a week and have gotten very used to the form and feel of it as a whole.  It's solidly built and feels good in your hands.  Overall, I'd say RIM has the makings of a huge winner and here's why:Performance - Simply unbelievable.  Multi-tasking is flawless.  Play an HD video, surf the web, open a few documents, the thing won't skip a beat.  The interface is a pleasure to use with bezel gesturing for simple commands.  Want to minimize your app?  Swipe from the bottom bezel upward through the screen.  Want to bring down the options bar?  Swipe from the top bezel down.  Similar functions for scrolling and moving through apps in multi-tasking mode can be done from the left and right as well.  There's also diagonal bezel swiping to bring up things like the keypad, status bar etc.  Oh, and these functions are also mirrored whether you hold the tablet in portrait or landscape.  Really cool.Graphic diplay - Beautiful.  Rich full colors with nice high definition.  Love it.Customization - Good but needs a little work.  I'm hoping that OS 2.0 will address this.  Right now, you can move icons into different pre set categories for 'Games' 'Media' 'Blackberry Bridge' etc. but currently there's no way to setup your own.  Really a minor gripe but there it is.  There's also no sound customization beeps and boops but I'm not sure that's even a necessity. After all, it doesn't have a ringer does it? Of course, you can change wallpaper and all of the typical stuff that goes with that.Apps - One of the biggest complaints with this has been the lack of apps.  They add more by the day on Blackberry App World and with guaranteed Android support in OS 2.0 I have no doubt I'll be downloading a plethora of fart apps in another month or two.  Can't wait (sarcasm intended).Compatability - Android coming in OS 2.0, currently supports flash, HTML5, Plays MP3s, WMA, and I'm sure others.  Can't comment on video format or other audio format yet as I haven't tried those but I can't imagine that others that might not be supported yet won't be soon.Video - Records in 1080p and outputs the same by micro HDMI to your HDMI TV.  Simply awesome.  The thing can also mirror its display on your television for a much richer viewing experience.Camera - Dual cameras fore and aft.  5mp rear and 3mp (I think) front.  Has a video chat function which I haven't tried yet since currently, it only works with other Playbook users.  I understand that there might be third party apps that can be used so that may not be an issue.  Pic quality is about what you'd expect.  Not that it's bad, it's not, it just isn't that good in low light conditions.  I know, what do you expect, right?  With a well lit subject, it's fantastic but just a slight low light condition and it gets grainy.  The Playbook does not have a camera flash which is a particular gripe of mine.  However, since this isn't a primary camera for me or my family, maybe it's not such a concern after all.  Still deciding on that one.  Camera settings are a little lame too.  Auto, Whiteboard, and Sports.  There's also a stabilization button but not much else.Form factor - Love, repeat, love the 7\" screen.  You can put the tablet in your pocket, carry it around with you easily and read text very very well.Bridging - Another criticism of the tablet is that it accuses RIM of only catering to current Blackberry phone owners by not providing native communications software for e-mailing, texting, calendar, etc.  I would have to agree with this one and consider this to be  RIMs biggest mistake which likely helped lead to poor market sales.  I do use a Blackberry so this doesn't affect me but OS 2.0 is supposed to incorporate all of the native ware that everyone is he*l bent on.  Speaking on behalf of bridge users everywhere though, I can attest to its genius in that it's seamless and simple to use. Although the software is basically stripped down versions of the apps used on the Blackberry, the fact that you can leave your phone in the kitchen while you hold your office on your lap is a treat.  You can also use it to bridge to your Blackberry web browser (more on this in a bit).  I do have some gripes about some of the functionality of the bridging apps which are missing key features like spell check or some expected intuitiveness.  Overall though, they work very well for what they do.Communication - Another critical issue with reviewers has been that this tablet is only WiFi.  Again, since I have a Blackberry, I can tether to the internet through the phone so I have complete internet access when I'm out of Wifi range.  No biggie for me.  Plus I don't need an extra data plan to use it.  Bluetooth A2DP coming in OS 2.0.  WiFi good and strong without any dropouts.Battery Life - Don't really know.  I'd say with heavy use, maybe 5 hours.  Light use more like 10?  Either way, seems on par with everything else that's out there.Typing - Good.  Responsive and easy to do, just need that spell checky/auto correct thingy and we'll be good to go. OS 2.0Internet experience - Without a doubt, the best.  The experience is the same as if you were sitting at your PC.  Flash is flashy, HTML5 is HTML5'y. In short it's what mobile (not really mobile anymore) surfing should be like.  In fact, it's so good that many apps for missing loaders that people are complaining about become unnecessary since they can just be accessed through direct web experience.  Not true of all, but many.Things I'd like to see and, my understanding is most will be addressed in OS 2.0 (due out in February last I heard):- Software improvements to some of the bridge apps to make them a little more intuitive.- A2DP Bluetooth- Android compatibility should open the door up for most apps- Many companies are still loathe to develop apps for the Playbook.  Netflix, Pandora, and Goole Maps come to mind.  However, they can all be made to work by direct net access or, in the case of Netflix, by streaming to a PC and then your Playbook but the Android issue should address this.- A little more customization of categories, naming icons, avatars, etc.  I understand that you'll be able to add quick links to contacts and such in OS 2.0 for instance.In conclusion, I really think RIM has a winner.  It's too bad that the tablet has been panned so badly by critics which is partly due to RIMs poor marketing strategy, no native e-mail, early release of a product that likely wasn't quite ready yet and some good ol' fashioned RIM bashing, but I pay less attention to them and rely more on user input instead.  Most of the user reviews you read are very positive about this system and for good reason which is what attracted me to it.  I can't compare it to other tablets such as the Galaxy or the IPad since I haven't owned either.  I've dabbled on the IPad a bit and it seems every bit as rock solid and well thought out. Given the two however the price point speaks loudly.  $600 vs. $250?  Mmmm, I'm pretty happy with my choice.I ranked this tablet as a 4 star.  I have no doubt that when OS 2.0 comes out in February that most of my wants list will be addressed.

Wanted a tablet/ipad for awhile but didn't want to shell out too much money.  Also wanted to make sure it worked for me and what I wanted it to do.  I like and respect the ipad but strongly dislike the lack of compatibility (hdmi, usb) and multitasking (open new tabs easily, have multiple programs running).  Apple makes great products, but as an \"intermediate tech guy\" i want more!!!  So looked elsewhere....asus, acer, blackberry because of compatibility.Pros:Size - personally i love the 7\", smart phone too small, 10\" a lil much.  Can put in my jeans back pocket, not a perfect fit, but keyword is fit.Multitasking - awesome. (you can read that as \"awesome period\"). Really is great.  All windows/applications run in the background (option to turn off if desired i.e. window/app will still be up but not running).  Swipe and go to the next.Compatibility - acts essentially as an external hard drive.  Micro-usb to usb in computer (cord included), click and drag files. Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint on playbook preinstalled!!  Adobe for pdfs!!  I put all my old notes from college on it to try, perfect, you can open all those file types and edit them (and can have each open in their own windows too!!).  Note: playbook doesn't have preinstalled files/folders navigation for some reason, but can get free or $1-2 app's to do this, then just like a comp, open/navigate files/folders.HDMI - honestly haven't tried yet but i'm sure that's fine....should prob check though.Blackberry Bridge - don't have a blackberry phone but if you do, this feature seems cool.Cons:Power button - Small.....but responsive and not that bad.  very manageable.Apps - not as expansive as ipad/android but adequate.  Note:  in feb 2011 android app compatibility is coming to the public (available now if you know what you're doing - demo/test 2.0 version out.....googled it)Apple, Android, and RIM (research in motion, blackberry) are the real tablet choices.

I went as far as clicking on the Cancel Order button, but decided not to follow thru, because of the warning about the order already being processed.  Glad I didn't.I have/had many devices (iPhone, iPad, Samsung Infuse), but the the PlayBook was the most impressive out of the box - namely, because of the fluid navigation and speed of the browser.  I'm sure part of my surprise was due to lowered expectations from reading negative reviews, but the PlayBook is a top notch device (or has potential to be).I mention \"potential,\" because the hardware and interface design is outstanding, but, as many have complained, a lack of native email support and limited applications makes this incomplete.  Hopefully, the OS v2 will release as planned and the promised features will be there.  If it does, I think the PlayBook will be hard to beat.The most impressive feature is the the menu/navigation system.  It is unique and very practical.  To elaborate, the design allows you to view/utilize 100% of the screen until you invoke more options by swiping from below or above the screen.Negatives (all app related): no Netflix player; no LogMeIn, no native email and no Droid Market (until next OS release in Feb)Positives:  hardware; menu/navigation, sound, HD, no iTune-like bloat-ware to manage media (e.g. music, video, pictures)Now that I've experienced the goods, I wish I had paid $50 more for the 32GB version.To be fair, my positive impression is significantly weighed by the promises of the release of OS 2.UPDATE 2012.1.2:PlayBook passes droptest...

Give it a chance!!", "Author": "Kyi", "ReviewID": "RF863KBVO7JR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So about a year ago, I bought myself a netbook. I already own a desktop PC, and Android phone, but I wanted the netbook so I could browse the web on the go and didn't like doing it on my phone because the screen was too small. I've been eyeing the iPads for a while as well, but the price point was just a bit too high for me, seeing as you can buy a decent netbook for cheaper. I was attracted to the touch screen and all the cool little apps you can download, but when it really comes down to it, I just wanted a good portable browser that I could use comfortably for an extended period of time, which I could not do on my phone.Well, after a while of lugging the netbook around, I decided it wasn't so portable after all and more of a pain than I thought it would be to carry it around. Still, I didn't really 'need' a tablet and still didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new device, so I just stuck with it. Then a few months ago, I found out about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet, and realized they were both affordable enough to consider buying one. I also realized I didn't like the 10 inch tablets because they seemed too large and don't have that feeling of portability that I wanted, especially since I already have a 12 inch netbook that already feels cumbersome. I was still unsure though... I didn't know anything about the tablet market and wasn't even sure what else I'd use it for other than browsing the web and random stuff I could do on my phone. I still had my desktop PC after all.I waited a while for the reviews for both the Fire and Nook to come out, read a bunch of them, including comparisons and etc, and decided I would wait a little longer to get one since I wasn't in urgent need of one. A few weeks later, I had some extra cash lying around and decided I was going to bite the bullet and finally order a tablet. I read some more reviews, and based off of those, I realized the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet were just too locked down for me and just seemed like a hub for spending more money on their stores. Some of the negative reviews said the browsers were sluggish or kind of jumpy sometime, and that made me more uncertain. I decided to look into the other 7 inch tablets and see what the difference was between all of them, and see why those tablets cost more. Just for research's sake.Thats when I came across the Blackberry Playbook. I saw that the price had recently been dropped, and even though I missed the fire sale, the $300 price point is still doable (I actually have the 64GB version). Especially for the impressive hardware it comes with. I also considered the Samsung Galaxy 7 tab as well as the Acer Iconia, but both of those are more expensive and doesn't really come with anything that would justify spending that much more on a tablet. And of course, I went into my review reading frenzy, and despite the few negative things that people dislike about the Playbook, it didn't really bother me  much and I decided to give this product a chance and boy am I glad I did!Here's what made this purchase worth it for me and why I am very satisfied with it.-Fast full flash browser. A slow, jerky browser would certainly get on my nerves, everytime I use it. This is important. A lot of other tablets have sub-par browsers and the Playbook browser is surprisingly fast.-Smooth seamless UI. The QNX OS. Like another review stated, I do not want to feel like I am using a large version of my phone, nor do I need another 'compact netbook' device. I want a product that feels unique and different. This is a versatile and powerful electronic toy in a sense. It does everything that I want, and does it well. I don't really care that it isn't Android, especially since it seems to work just as well, if not better.-Beautiful screen. Everyone can agree on that.-Very high quality speakers and placed in a practical location on the device (on the front sides). I really dislike when the speakers are on the back or can easily be muffled, or if they sound cheap and crackly. The volume level is impressive too.-5MP rear and 3MP front facing camera. Most of the other tablets in this price range do not include a camera. I don't think I'll use it that much, but this was definitely a perk as I still want to have it just in case I do decide to start using it. And who doesn't like taking self photos??-You can tether your phone and get GPS as well.And for those who are worried about the lack of apps in the store... I will admit, the store does not have hundred thousands of apps like the other stores, but I do not really feel that limited. There are still plenty of apps, and a lot of free ones as well. And for those who don't know, a new OS release is coming out soon for the Playbook that should fix all those problems that the haters have been complaining about. And honestly anyone who complains about the tiny power button... it's tiny for a reason. It's hard to hit for a reason. Do you want to accidently turn your tablet off in the middle of using it? After you turn it on, you don't even need to turn it off really! You put it in standby mode and all it takes to turn it back on is a simple swipe from top to bottom of the screen. The standby mode does not drain much battery at all. Seriously... sometimes I feel like people just have to find something to complain about because they are fanboys to the other two A words.TLDR: If you want an impressive piece of hardware at a great price and a fast and unique OS, get the Playbook. And if you're concerned about the apps, wait for the new OS release. And if that's still not good enough for you, go buy yourself a dang Apple or Android tablet and stop hating. Trust me, just because they do a lot more marketing and are more popular, does not make them flawless. If you're a TRUE hipster, you'll get off that bandwagon and give this one a chance.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "My iPad is gathering dust", "Author": "Benjamin Franklin", "ReviewID": "R1U2OLKU8PZ5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had an iPad for a couple of years so I held off getting Blackberry Playbook as I couldn't see the point in having two tablets. When the price of the Playbook dropped just before Christmas I decided to treat myself and boy, am I glad I did.I loved it so much I decided the 16GB version just wasn't big enough for me and so I went back out the other weekend and treat myself to the 64gb model, so now I have two Playbooks.So, what is so good about the Playbook and why do I prefer it to the iPad.1. It is just so much nicer to use. By comparison the iPad is clunky and bland. Once you get used to the various screen swipes (there are quite a few) you can just breeze from open application to open application, bring up the keyboard, close an app, open an another app. It is all so amazingly easy and so much more enjoyable than than constantly having to press the button at the bottom of the iPad screen numerous times just to do the most basic thing such as swapping from one app to another. On the Playbook what takes several button presses to do on the iPad takes ONE swipe. Brilliant!2. I far prefer the size of the Playbook. The iPad was too big and bulky for me to lug around. I can just pop the playbook in my pocket and hit the coffee shop. It is like like reading a paperback rather than a heavy hardback book.3. he installed apps are pretty much everything I need and more. Unlike the iPad the Playbook comes with a superb word processor, spreadsheet, etc. Yes, there aren't a million apps to download, but do you know what. I've not touched my iPad in weeks and I've not missed one single app on it - not one!4. It is so much easier to add content onto the Playbook. Just plug it in with a USB cable and copy the files from your computer straight onto the device. No need to mess around with iTunes. Just drag the files over, put them wherever you like and the Playbook will do the rest. I add about one hundred albums and dozens of movies and it took me minutes. The same thing with iTunes would have involved selecting all sorts of things, syncing, resyncing, installing the latest update, and blah blah. None of that with the Playbook, which means I'm free of the nasty iTunes.5. You can connect the Playbook to your TV with an HDMI cable that costs a few bucks. Unlike the iPad which requires a special $40 lead that works some of the time, but not all of the time (check out the reviews of it on Amazon and you will see what I mean).6. The screen display is amazing. Just put it next to an iPad 2 and you can see instantly how much better it is. The colors are vibrant, the text is crystal clear, and it is just so darned fast and smooth. Check out the sample HD video that comes with it.That is just six reasons. There are many more.I honestly can't see me ever wanting to go back to the iPad, but I can see me putting the iPad on eBay in the not too distant future.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best tablet I have ever used...Period.", "Author": "G. Dowling", "ReviewID": "RXKQ6N2Q73NSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing much research and having tried all the premiere tablets on the market, I landed on RIM's BlackBerry Playbook. I tried out the iPad 3 and I was not terribly impressed.  It felt very fragile in my hands, like it could break if I squeezed it too hard, the speakers truly suck as they sound tinny, and these are problems are significant given the money Apple charges.  I have a BB smartphone and I have always been impressed at how well-made their products are.  This made the playbook a no-brainer for me...I had no idea just how superior it is...the QNX processor is lightning fast and can easily manage several open windows.  You can edit word documents, spreadsheets, and it has flash player which iPad does NOT.  The screen and video camera is HD.  I opted for the 64gb model, as the price difference between the three sizes is negligible so it's worth it to upgrade to 64gb.  Though, with cloud storage, for most people, 16gb is probably plenty.  The touch keyboard is exceedingly comfortable and the most intuitive I have ever used...it really does learn how you write and anticipates your word choices.  It has a port for a micro hdmi cable so you can enjoy your downloaded content on your hdtv.  I bought this cable (sold separately)for only 4 bucks on amazon.  The PB is comfortable to hold as the build quality is immediately apparent.  It does not feel like it's going to fall apart if you drop it.  The processor is faster than any laptop I have ever used. The web browser is like flipping pages in a book.  If you have BB phone...it open up a flurry of additional features called BlackBerry Bridge.  The bluetooth connection syncs the two devices so you can manage appts, contacts, view, receive and reply to your text messages using your BB smartphone as a transmitter.  Your phone can be used as a remote control when watching a video or listening to music and you can browse the website for your phone's keyboard...it is a really amazing set of features...and best of all you can use your BB phone's data package to use 3/4g connectivity if you do not have access to to wife/hotspot so you do NOT need to sign up for a data service.If it seems I am gushing over this product, it's because it's that good.  So those of you who may think BB products are out, this will remind you as to why BB has such loyal fans.  And finally, it is simply priced...nowhere else will you find a tablet of such superior quality, enormous storage, awesome features, great versatility (ideal for home and work) and just plain fun for the jaw-dropping low price as I purchased it for slightly over 200 bucks (reg 700). Do not waste your money on the iPad...RIM has outdone themselves with this tablet. Outstanding product.Note: just to recommend some accessories to maximize your enjoyment...make certain to get a case of some description...there are many which come with a bluetooth keyboard built in...I opted for the Otterbox Defender as I have 2 year old twins and this case can take a beating and perfectly preserve your tablet. It has a built-in screen protector and a tough outer protective layer.  Its an amazing case which provides a complete solution.  I also recommend a micro hdmi to reg. Hdmi cable and extra charger.

After trying all contenders, the Blackberry Playbook 32G won by a nose and this is why.The case is sturdy metal, feels substantial, and does not flex. The screen is gorgeous, brightness and contrast make text crisp and color images pop.Finger response is first rate right out of the box, not overly sensitive, and can be tweaked. I like the intuitive fingerswipe sideways to close an app, as well as open program page pulldown from screen top.The system upgraded at first start, took only a few minutes, and now more apps than I will ever need are available. FB, the browser itself, and my email client (gmail) work perfectly, and tethers with bluetooth to most cellphones, mine is an older samsung 3G.Wi-fi is strong, connecting, and maintaining a connection at home or on the go without a hitch. The sound is very loud and clear, with nice response- great for gaming, music, movies, whatever, frankly puts apple and nexus 7 to shame, and there are 2 speakers, not 1 BTW.I have the rapid charging stand which is twice as fast(a charge lasts 10+hours btw, days on standby), and provides a nice pedestal to perch while not in use. I did not have any issues as some mentioned with the standard plug in charger, it was tight and secure, but I could see where the connector could break if bent or forced at the insertion point. I purchased the playbook because of past experience with the brand, the perceived quality, nice price, software updates, processor speed, and just a general balance of design and function. Many will underestimate blackberry, and I think apple already has. Schools and businesses are snapping up the playbook for a reason, these are sturdy and secure. I realize the market has many choices, the hd nook, the kindle fire, and the nexus 7 I feel were close in usability, and may suit those who will spend more time in the B&N;, Amazon (with ads), and Google worlds. The nook hd felt sleek and light but flimsy, the nexus has only one weak sounding speaker, and the kindle hd was slow and heavy. At present PB has no netflix, skype or kindle apps, but it will video chat with other playbooks, and has a kobo app. There is no app for gps function that really functions, and no sim card slot to allow direct access to a data plan. BB will soon offer new models that will. What the playbook does, it does well in my view. With the next software update, it will be even better.

I visited the Blackberry site. I found an instruction manual online and I read it. I made  judgments on which reviews are constructive, and which are just plainly absurd. I settled on the Playbook. So, I wasn't disappointed when I got my Playbook in June this year.I took it on my trip in July to the Canadian Rockies. I was pleased that I could check both my personal e-mail on Yahoo and my work e-mail on Outlook. I took pictures using the Playbook (I had the camera on and put in in the pocket of the car door) when I couldn't fire up my Sony Hx9v fast enough to snap pictures of mountain goats, sheep and elks. (Almost took a picture of a black bear crossing the road. Kathy: Look, a bear. Bear: Oh #$%^, humans).I have since been able to side-load some android apps, which now has become a bonus.

That makes my Mondays are more prepared and pleasant.My Sony Hx9v is my dedicated camera, but I also take \"duplicate\" pics and videos on my playbook for sharing them with my co-workers. It's more handy and discrete than putting them on my work computer, and the Sony scree is too small anyways.I also take the PB to off site meetings (we have WiFi at all our sites). I bring the PB instead of lugging my labtop to allow access to work e-mail and essential documents in the PB, if case I need to refer to them.August 26 update:I wasn't sure what apps are in the App Store, so I just enter an alphabet in the search box.

I disagree.  It's actually well placed and sized to avoid accidental on/off.I purchased the 16GB, as I figured I wouldn't use it that often.  It is now my go-to computer and I have found myself loading more and more items I need on the machine.  I wish I had purchased the large drive. However, given the FTP program and the ability to access files on other computers, this probably won't be an issue.Cons:-No Skype (there is an available program, but not seamless)-APP marketplace still slow going - APPS are a bit pricey.I am incredibly impressed with this machine.

VanGilder", "ReviewID": "R1HN7XTL0PRI0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Blackberry Playbook over Black Friday (2011) weekend after recently returning Amazon's Kindle Fire.  I wanted a device more portable then my iPad that would provide both entertainment and functionality.  After watching/reading several reviews on the Blackberry Playbook, I was super stoked to receive mine!Unfortunately, that enthusiasm didn't last very long.  I quickly discovered how, um, blah the device was.  RIM did an amazing job with the QNX operating system; it's super faster, beautiful, and an absolute pleasure to use.  With that being said, the lack of app. support in the Blackberry community has left this device struggling to find its place among smart phones and the iPad.Without apps., you basically have a device with a camera that can play movies.  Sure, there's the internet and such.  But it's a WiFi only device (unless you have a Blackberry smartphone to bridge).  If you find yourself out of range of a hotspot, there's nothing left to do except watch movies/listen to music.I suppose you could read a book.  But wait!  There's no Kindle app.  Instead, you have a Kodo application in which you're expected to repurchase your library.Sigh.  I'm really disappointed with this device.  It has such great potential if the community would get behind it and support it.  To be honest, I don't see that happening.  With Apple's IOS dominating the majority of the tablet world and Google's Android sucking up what's left over, I don't see much room for a new \"competitor\".So to break it down, here's my Pros & Cons list.Pros:-Beautiful Design-Portable-Great camera (can record in 1080HD)-Beautiful and fast operating systemCons:-Lack of app. selection-No Netflix app. and the Playbook's browser isn't supported by their online streaming service-No Skype-No Zinio-No \"good\" eBook reader-No native email or calendar app. on the device (they include web shortcuts to Gmail, Hotmail, etc.)As you can see, the majority of the cons are due to a lack of app. support from developers.  Until there's more support for this device, you're stuck with a 7\" internet browsing/movie watching device.  And if that's what you want, just get an iPad; bigger screen, more enjoyable experience.  And as I said earlier, if you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot, you're pretty much SOL.Overall, I rate the device's design, operating system, and smoothness a 5/5.  But with its lack of apps., the functionality and capability of this device is a 2/5.  :(", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent tablet !!!", "Author": "Nguyen Ho", "ReviewID": "R3HRD0FO2PP3V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an iPad 2 and just bought a Playbook when the price dropped.

I can't wait until Feb 2012 when RIMM releases OS 2.0 which supports native email client and Android apps.  The Playbook will be a perfect device with better software updates over time.

Moving on to software, the Playbook comes with version 2 of RIM's QNX software, which we found to be a rather pleasant experience. The navigation of the OS is based around its multitasking features, which keeps all open apps in its own little box on the home screen, which are all constantly running. For that matter, the Playbook really shines at multitasking compared to other mobile OSs, however thats really where its pluses end.

Simply because it doesn't read flash, it's too big, and I think the price is a little ridiculous to pay for something that's a larger scale of what I already have and doesn't do everything I want it to do. However, I still wanted something aesthetically appealing, sleek, sturdy, and about $200. I looked at the kindle fire but it lacks a camera and I looked at the nexus 7 but at $200 you get 8g instead of 16g. I had seen the PB at Best Buy and a few minutes playing with it I wanted it .. After further research and reading the reviews (good/bad) I bought it for these reasons: The screen quality is awesome and makes the screen look bigger than 7inches, the fluidity of the platform is so sleek, and I really like the swipe up/swipe down feature (instead of the home button on an iPad). It has a rubberized back for a no slip grip and is light. Sound is great n doesn't sound cheap. I read the battery life was long and it definitely is!  After the first charge I didn't have to recharge for 3 days .. I suppose if you use it all day long it'll last about 9hrs.Apps:If you're an app maniac don't buy it! The PB does not play Netflix which is a bummer but I honestly watch Netflix only on a TV, it doesn't have instagram but I'm not trying to whip out a tablet to take a picture, that's what my iPhone is for, and as far as games go, everytime I've DL one on my iPhone it becomes a waste of space and I usually delete them after a few days . As a college student, Docs to go and adobe reader (comes standard) is great,  it will definitely come in handy for lecture when I have to write or retrieve PDF and word documents. It also comes with the essential FB, twitter, and YouTube apps. From what I have been reading on the net there are ways to sideload android apps,haven't tried .. Not sure if I will.Internet and wifi:The wifi connection is strong and picks up signals my laptop can't..Im sure the Bluetooth connection is just as strong just haven't tried it. The Internet browsing is crisp, clear, and fast! I REALLY needed a tablet that read flash I shop a lot online and a lot of sites use it and my online class requires it for viewing homework and since the PB reads flash it's perfect and runs smoothly with no freezing. Other reviewers say its like browsing on a desktop and they're right!Accessories:Not very many and kinda hard to find.

RIM's tablet packs the power of a mini-laptop in a pocket-sized form.Pros:- It has crystal-clear display- Very resistant and stoutly built- Fast, with more than enough power to run heavy applications and games.- Feature-rich with HD rear facing camera, a chatting front-faced camera, GPS, Wi-fi, HDMI and Bluetooth.- GPS apps don't work while connected only to BlackBerry Bridge but they work while tethered to a BlackBerry phone or connected to a wi-fi mobile AP on Android (see below) The included app Bing Maps does a good job similar to google maps, and can even give me driving directions (in my country, Google Maps doesn't do that)When partnered with a BlackBerry phone (I have one) the result is more than the sum of its parts. The tablet can function as a big screen for the phone, and the phone works as a wireless modem for the tablet (over Bluetooth)If you have an android phone v2.2 or above (I have one too) the phone can share its  internet connection with the Playbook via Mobile Wi-fi AP. Also, I can transfer files between the phone and the tablet with an android free application installed on the phone called AirDroid.Cons:- A little bit on the heavy side, but still lighter than any 10 inch tablet.- Battery life isn't spectacular, when I used it through the day, I must charge it overnight, every night.- A certain lack of applications, but this is an item that gets more value as more people buy it.

The most problematic issue I have came across was when I would open an android app through the app player which would make the entire OS run less efficient. I hardly use the anrdoid app player, so I'm not too annoyed. The main selling point for me was the small form factor and the drastic price drop which made this tab irresistible.

You can shut down or hibernate the playbook via a control on the screen and awaken it from hibernation with a swipe gesture from the bezel onto the screen. The gesture controls in general are quite intuitive to learn and really make navigation efficient and easy.The Cons:I am not overly impressed with the battery life, compared to my Ipad it's actually quite poor.No native e-mail and calendar support is absurd, this will hopefully be a non-issue once OS 2.0 is released later this month.App store really is lacking in quality apps, I am hoping that RIMS push to have android developers port their apps to the PB plays off.A lot is riding on the release of OS 2.0 this month, I think if RIM executes it properly the Playbook will see some life, it really is a great device.

Between my Style and my PlayBook, I have about 150 apps for social media, productivity, reading (blogs, news and books) and games.I am a consultant and have used my PlayBook for presentations (so slick!), to update my company's blog and website, for shopping (like, well, here), for preparing class notes, and for blowing up those pesky Humans in My Yard (it's a PlayBook thing). I have gone weeks at a time without my laptop, just dropping my PlayBook into my purse along with a Moleskine notebook and my favorite pen (a Caran D'ache Ecridor Chevron Silver Plated Ballpoint Pen--sigh)I have used an iPad, which was on loan, and couldn't quite see what the breathless, adoring hoopla was about: It was large, did not have as many features and its app store included apps for things that ran, natively, on the Playbook (full internet from jumpstreet). But, then again, the PlayBook and the iPad are not designed for exactly the same target markets. To my mind, the PlayBook is work-skewed while the iPad is play-skewed (I hope that makes sense).Ignore the Playbook haters and get your hands on one, if you can (demo unit at Best Buy sold it for me).

You actually get the PC version of the website and not the \"mobile\" version of it.Play movies with it.  Love the speakers.Watch amazon prime.  It does that straight from the website because it supports flash.Answer emails and prepare work related stuff.Plug in the mini HDMI and watch the movie on my TV.I do not care about many apps but the apps I do wish they had was Netflix and Skype but it is not a deal breaker for me because I can use them on my phone, other tablets, PC, etc.  Also I know that you can port android apps and I have already done it for a few of them but I think it is just one step and if you are not technically savvy it can put people off.Bottom line, I think it is a good tablet, I am hoping that it will only get better with the release of the new OS but it is good already, but if you do the cost analysis of acquiring one vs. any other electronic out there I think the playbook will come up on top just for the price point of it alone.  The only time the Playbook will lose it would be when it comes to apps.I hope that Blackberry (RIM) works and encourages developers to port the apps directly to the blackberry app center.

It makes deleting apps and updating apps so much easier.  The Ice Cream Sandwich on the android tablets is ok, not sure what the big deal is about, it's still a bit cumbersome to get around.  The BBPB is much smoother and nimble, especially when it comes to web browsing.  I tried 3 different browsers on the android tablets and they crash quite often whereas the BBPB gives me much more confidence in its stability.  I thought after the past few years with the smart phones and tablets that Android tablets would be stable, but with so many different hardware variations, it's still a bit of a Wild Wild West - It's akin to Windows XP versus Windows 7 on a PC.  The only drawback to the BBPB is the apps that are available.  It's still a bit thin and I do not think BB will introduce a Android run-time environment so that you can run android apps on your Playbook (even though they said they would oh so long ago).  On a positive note, you can side-load 1/3 of the android apps on your BBPB.  You can look that up.  Finally, the BBPB just feels like a serious piece of hardware.

At Panera the other day I was frustrated with the speed of the wifi so I jumped on my phone's Internet access through Verizon via BlackBerry bridge.  It works great. The size is way better than ipad.  I think it's a matter of public uninformed opinion and poor marketing from BlackBerry.  They brought the tablet to market too soon with no native email client. All the reviews make such a big negative deal about the bridge to the phone. And then everyone wrote it off. The folks at staples and office Depot are clueless and of no help.

Also the Ipad is relatively large and heavy compared to a 7\" tablet and finally the Ipad couldn't configure my Microsoft exchange based email account.I have a blackberry phone and heard about the playbook's feature that enables users to use the phone's internet accesss on the playbook.  The other deciding factors was the very reasonable price (a small fraction of the cost of the Ipad) and the lighter/smaller size of the playbook vs the Ipad.  I also had confidence in the playbook's email capabilities premised upon the blackberry telephone's ability to immediately and flawlessly configure and intergrate my email accounts including the Microsoft Exchange based account.I purchased the 16GB version of the Playbook.  Upon powering up (and connecting to WIFI), the playbook immediately updated the OS to the latest version (took about 20 minutes for download and installation) automatically. The screen is very bright and sharp comparable (but not quite there) to the Ipad.  The touch screen is also excellent and (almost) as good as the Ipad.  There is no button to return the home screen (rendering the Ipad more convenient in this context).The apps available for the Playbook pale in comparison to the Ipad.  However two particular apps; docs to go (included in the OS) and Blackberry Bridge (free download) make the Playbook more appealing to me than the Ipad.  Blackberry Bridge seamlessly lets your blackberry telephone provide internet access to the Playbook (after an easy bluetooth connection is established).  It's really amazing.  There is no longer any \"tethering\" app needed (which apparently was necessary in the old OS). The internet for some unexplained reason is much faster on the playbook than on the phone (perhaps because of processing power involved in screen redraws but I am not really sure why). Docs to go is a Microsoft Office type program similar (to the extent a 7\" tablet can be) and compatible with Microsoft Word.  The Ipad does not have any such program built in and available apps (for purchase; ie pages) are not as good.Battry life is great, a whole day even with wifi on.  As expected, all my email accounts are intergrated and accessible on the playbook (although the phone's setup seemed a little easier) including the Microsoft Exchange based account that the Ipad could not configure to work. Email contacts, calenders, BBM contacts etc are all easily imported from the phone.There is one big drawback (for me anyway) and the reason I only gave 4 stars in this review; the icompatibility of Skype.  There is an excellent webcam on the playbook but for some reason there is no Skype app.  The only way to access the video communciation capabilities is by communicating with another playbook.  The Ipad (in contrast) works really, really well with skype.  Someone would make a lot of money if they developed a reasonably priced app that enabled skype to work on the playbook based upon the clamor on the internet for such an app.  If Skype becomes compatible with the Playbook, the Blackberry Playbook would be a really great tablet at this price point.There is no (Micro)SD slot to expand the internal memory.  The cynic in me believes that is because RIM would like to sell the 32GB version for more money than the 16GB version (there would not be much demand for the 32GB version if there was expandable storage capabilities).  Of course the Ipad does not have any such capabilities either (presumambly for the same reason).MP3 playback works great on the playbook.  It is much easier to copy MP3s onto the playbook than the ipad (no itunes necessary).  A free app makes creating playlists as simple as creating folders on the Playbook (much better than the Ipad or even the ipod).  Videos are also much easier to copy onto the playbook (again no itunes necessary).  However, the file formats seem to be more limited on the playbook; I have been unable to find an app to play .avi files so far.Before purchasing the Blackberry Tablet, I tried (and immediately returned) one of the generic $100 android 7\" tablets.  There is really no comparison between the playbook and the cheap android tablets.  The touch screen on these 7\" android tablets is terrible, WIFI routinely cuts off, the screen is not very bright and the battery only lasts a few hours.  The only \"advantages\" of the cheap 7\" tablets is compatibility with skype (which works horribly) and many more apps which is not really and avantage since the tablet itself is not usable.In summary, this is an excellent tablet considering the price.  It becomes almost essential if you also have a blackberry telephone.  The lack of Skype compatibility may be a deal breaker for some though.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING DEVICE!!!", "Author": "BIGxALx420", "ReviewID": "R1CVX21AKW1MXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refurb from BestBuy for $150 and I could not be happier.I have downloaded several torrent files and loaded them as a bar file to my playbook.I watch MLB.TV using the simple browser set to desktop IE mode...I am SOOO happy i bought this and didnt waste my money on a sub par device.I love watching movies on my tv via the hdmi port.Who needs apps when you can do everything without them?

The bummer is the tiny power button, no HDMI built in, however it does accept most mini connectors to your HDMI TV, AND ! when connected to your HDTV performs well.  The APPS available through Blackberry are good, but you have to search through each category and try them out. The overall experience as well as the many free app's, utilities, TV programs (English and French) are good. Sound is far more superb than most tablets, image quality far superior. The power button is small and hard to access, there is the s-l-o-w-e-s-t start up ever for a tablet, and takes what seems to be a seriously delayed start up.  Some nice things are that when online, making purchases, you can instantly take a picture of anything you are experiencing simply by pressing the top arrow keys together at the same time located next to the power button.. this sends any image then to your pictures.The other odd thing is that you cannot upgrade the tablet with a micro SD card, but 16MB of built in flash is good.

We just got it for Christmas and have only had it for 2 days.  I was looking at the fire, and happened to come across this by accident.  At $189.00, we had to try it.  My husband has a work Blackberry with a full data plan, so we were excited to get the added ability to bridge at no extra cost.  The bridge was easy to use and install.  The other thing I wanted was to be able to use Amazon Prime to stream free videos for the kids.  Most reviews were mixed on this, but we had no problem!  There are not many apps, but we purchased this as a family gift, and there are plenty of free and cheap apps to keep the family happy (ages, 7, 4, 3).  We have an ipad, so I was a little worried that it wouldn't compare, but it is fantastic.  I love the smaller size of the Playbook and even though it is very different to maneuver, all three kids were able to figure it out. This was a great choice and a cheap alternative to the ipad.  I can't wait to try all of the functions and to see what the Blackberry is able to do.  I also heard that in a few months Blackberry is going to offer Android apps.  I'm not holding my breath, because I heard that the release date has been pushed back a few times, but this would be an added bonus!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for Blackberry smartphone owners", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R2FK9OKMUV3S8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this product so much, I decided to write my first ever product review.  I bought my Playbook on sale for $199 and have had it for about a week.  So far, it has done everything I want a tablet to do (once I figure out how to do each task). I want my tablet to be an extention of my smartphone and to take the place of my laptop in a pinch.  I travel a lot and I drag my laptop along so I can check news, email, etc, on something larger than my Blackberry phone screen. I do have to review/edit MS Office files on occaision, but it's usually minor work. I looked hard at the IPad II and the Asus Transformer and was headed down the road to buy the Asus after reading reviews of both.  But, when Radio Shack put the Playbook on sale for $199, I had to take a closer look at it and ended up buying it. So far, this is just what I was looking for.  Here's my take:Pros:-Connectivity to my Blackberry smartphone. No 3G version needed.  The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to my phone and my computer.  I can check/send email, move files, listen to music, etc, between all three devices.  I can also connect to it through its IP address on the internet and move info.  So whether I'm in the house connected via Wi-Fi or away from the house connected via Bluetooth (to my phone), I'm always connnected.  The devices find the best way to connect and make it happen automatically. Of course, you can always connect via a USB cable.-Price: Though it lists for about $500 along with most other 16 GB tablets, Radio Shack still has it on sale for $199.  For that price, you are in the same range as the various e-readers such as the Kindle Fire (did I mention it has e-reader apps available?).  Side to side, there is no comparison in overall capability/flexibility.  I spent $150 to buy my daughter a Kindle Touch and I'm now considering spending the extra $50 to get so much more in the Playbook.-Performance/usability: This is equally as fast as the IPad and the Asus I tried out and the picture is just as vibrant.  It doesnt' have all of the propriatary software issues that Apple products have when working between Apple and PC based platforms.  It is a 7\" versus a 10\" pad.  I thought I wanted a larger pad, but after using the smaller one, I think I like it better.  I'm mostly surfing the web and doing email and I'm not likely to watch movies on it, so smaller works better because it's just the right size to hold and \"thumb type\" like you would your smartphone.  The larger pads are too big to thumb type and too small to type regularly (thus the Transformer's add on keyboard). I'm not going to type an essay on the thing anyway--just short replies and web addresses.Cons:-Instructions: It doesn't come with any other than how to hook up to Wi-Fi.  You have to get on the web and search for directions.  The setup screens are about as weak as they get.  So, I spent a number of hours off and on over my Christmas vacation sorting out how to make it do all the things mentioned above.-File management: There is no file manager on the tablet.  To manage files (or even see what you have) you have to hook up to your computer and work from there or search for it via the applicable software.  So, if you have a Powerpoint file on your playbook, the only way to find it is by opening the Powerpoint viewer and searching for it. No big deal if you have your computer nearby to open the desktop manager and search, but if you are on the road, you are out of luck--unless you carry your laptop with you on the road which defeats the whole purpose.  Maybe there is a better way, but I haven't found it yet and as mentioned above, it's short on instructions.But, in the end, I like it a lot. I'm about to hit the road again, so we'll see how it holds up.  I hope this was useful to those out there contemplating a tablet purchase.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Uncompromised performance in an ultra portable design", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3DWHU7W1P1H0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Playbook has a 7\" screen, large enough to see clearly, but small enough so that it stores away easily, compared to the bulky 10\" tablets. You can hardly tell the difference between a desktop browsing experience and the Playbook. All the streaming videos, games and social networking that I've come to see in a desktop is packed in this ultra portable tablet. Support for Adobe Flash 10.2 and HTML5 means you get all what the internet has to offer. I haven't seen this actually in any other tablet yet. Tablets will either have HTML5 or the Adobe Flash Player; not both. The flash performance is probably the best I've seen on a tablet. It can run a solid handful of apps simultaneously without freezing, slowing performance or going \"catatonic\". In other words, you get true multitasking and incredible reliability you can count on. The build quality seems to be very high, and the video hardware is great, as evidenced by the resolution of the sample video clip that is provided in it. It has a stunning multimedia with rich stereo sound and a crystal clear, high resolution display optimized for HD content. I enjoy movies, music, home videos and even the web in high definition on my HDTV with a standard HDMI connection. The camera doesn't have flash, but it takes phenomenal pictures and videos in 1080p. It also has Face-to-face video chat. With the built-in video chat, you can call another BlackBerry PlayBook with a simple tap; view your caller on the high resolution 7\" display, or output to an HDTV with HDMI to share the conversation with a group. You can even use other apps while you're on a call. Even though the Playbook has a limited BlackBerry App World, this is only temporary. Soon many of our favorite apps for BlackBerry smartphones and Android will soon be available for the Playbook. Even though they say the contrary, the Playbook has tons of capability once you unlock its full potential. The BlackBerry PlayBook offers uncompromised performance in an ultra portable design. I personally am very happy to have it and I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good ultra portable and reliable tablet.

Here's why I returned the A100 for the BP. . .Okay, so I am not a serious tech person and not in the habit of writing reviews. This is my first tablet.After doing my due diligence, I decided on purchasing the Acer Iconia A100, which I was very excited to obtain, based on the many positive reviews here and elsewhere. It seemed to me the A100 was a much better bang for one's buck than the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire. I purchased my A100 on Dec 16th for around $260 at Best Buy.My A100 performed well at first. I was not pleased though with the touch screen and found it terribly inconvenient to type on, often needing to retype letters and phrases numerous times.After two days of use, mainly web browsing, watching videos, and the Kindle Reader app, the A100 became less responsive and developed a considerable lag, until finally it started freezing/locking up and requiring me to do a hard reset, which I had to do at least 6 times in the couple of days I had it.So, I decided to return and found that the Blackberry Playbook (BP) was on sale at Best Buy for $199, some $60 cheaper than what I paid for the A100. Not to mention, the BP is 16G while the A100 is only 8G.Hands down the BP outperforms the A100 in every way. It is LIGHTNING FAST, with multiple applications running all at once, incredibly smoothly. The screen on the BP is 1080p versus the Acer's 720p. I can not get over the stunning crisp bright HD images on the BP screen. Also, the screen on the BP can be viewed askance and at an angle, whereas the A100 can not.The touchscreen keyboard is a PLEASURE to use. It is well sized and perfectly responsive. No retyping, ever.The current reader on the BP is the Kobo Reading App, which does the job for me, but admittedly is not nearly as good as the Kindle App on the A100. Also, I should mention there is no Netflix App for the BP, yet.Oh, and the BP battery lasts a MUCH longer time than the A100. The BP battery can also be recharged via a USB to your computer.For $60 less than the A100, the Blackberry Playbook OUTPERFORMS the A100 in EVERY WAY. The current price of $199 at Best Buy is a STEAL. This is a tablet that draws serious comparison (watch the video reviews online) to the IPAD2. All for $199!For someone who was in the market for his first tablet, to use mainly for web browsing, some work with documents/email, an Ereader (a Kindle App should be coming soon), and for video and music (Rhapsody!) I could not be more pleased with the BP.

It has a good weight to it, and feels like it could withstand a little unwelcome abuse. There are many deals out there right now for this tool. I paid $550 for another device for a gift, and I paid much less for the playbook.

I doubt 16GB of storage is enough to get many programs. However, I can operate many programs at the same time, WITHOUT any lag time on my Playbook. Kudos QNX! Once QNX hits the BB smartphones, those units will take off. It rivals, and in my mind, will exceed Android processing. With a 1GB dual processor with 1GB of memory, and in my case 32GB of storage, this thing rocks big time. Don't hesitate to look at one at the store.

I have been thinking about a tablet for some time for when I take a short trip and I don't want to carry a laptop. The Samsung smart phone is nice but a pain to type on. Plus I wanted something that I could do some work on while traveling but not break the bank. The computer geek I was sitting on the plane with pulled out a Nexus tablet and I asked him how he liked it. He said he wished he had waited a little because he would have bought the playbook which is now selling for under $200. It had better memory, screen, and sound. So I took his advice and bought the playbook. The setting up of my email, contacts and calendar from outlook was easy. I love the documents to go function. Now I can load on some excel spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations and some word documents that I need while traveling. This really made it very usable for more than just a movie viewer. The only disappointments that I have is that gotoassist does not have an app that will work on this so I can connect co-workers computers to solve problems and that there is not an SD card slot. But for under $200 bucks with 64 gig you cant really go wrong.

I own a Nexus 7, a Kindle Fire HD, an iPad Mini, and I just bought a Blackberry Playbook. The Playbook is truly excellent as a device. It is solid, sturdy, the screen is beautiful, the touch is responsive. I like the way the bezel is touch sensitive, and certain functions and menus are invoked by swiping the bezel. I also like the UI, the way the app drawer appears below the main screen and the way the apps open in the middle of the screen and then expand to fill the screen. In short, the Playbook has almost become my favorite EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!!!!! That one thing is the disappointing sparcity of useful applications; there just are not many. I'm not comparing the raw number against iOS or Android. A few really good apps are all that are. necessary, and those are sorely lacking. I have not found a good search engine, browser or office suite. I have heard that RIM will begin making Android apps available for the Playbook \"SOON\". RIM seems to have \"SOON\" as its company motto! Everything is GOING to happen SOON; RIM just does not deliver on its promises of \"SOON\".I think it's a lamentable shame. The Playbook is such a well-built device, but RIM does not seem to support it well.. If it had the necessary support from RIM, the Playbook would definitely merit five stars.

I use the Playbook to watch videos downloaded and streamed too. The videos look better on the playbook than they do on any of my computers or TV's. I also love that it has Micro USB and Micro-HDMI so it easily connects the playbook to TV's computers etc.. I also think that it reacts well when I touch it and doesn't seem too slow or tentative. The browser is also pretty good. It comes with a bookmark page similar to speeddail, so searching through your favorites is very convenient.Cons: Others have stated how the apps are limited in number available to the public. That's a huge understatement. There isn't a real Twitter, Reddit, or even TMZ app. I know you may now all be thinking that's a weird combination of apps that I've brought up and my reply to that is \"Well I like to be in the LOOP.\" Now to bringing me back to a pro, the Bookmark page holds enough dials that it is easy to sort through all your favorite websites. Also browsing those websites that don't have an app for the Playbook are not an inconvenience on most sites..Conclusion: If you are wanting to play with apps or use popular apps or wanna do anything at all other than play the Free Need for Speed game that is a really fun game, you had better not get this tablet. Other than the no apps issue this tablet is a pretty awesome piece of technology..", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Christmas", "Author": "robemjr", "ReviewID": "R3V0Z7LV6A8XI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great product.

My wife bought me a 32GB for my birth day and I decided to get 4 more.  One for another personal use so that I and my wife can connect.  The rest are for company use.  Depending on your need, you may find PB has no real use if you are into apps to run through your day.  However, only a handful of currently available paid and free apps, I find it very helpful for my daily need both personal and at work.Here is my short review.Pros:Size, I find it to be just a sweet spot to lug it around.  For any short business trip, I have been successfully leaving my laptop behind.Specs, for its current discounted prices, you can't find anything close to it.  It has 2 HD cameras front and back.  Of course, 5MP front and 8MP back would be nice, but it is good enough.  It has flash and support html5.  Being Amazon prime member, I am really happy being able to stream movie directly with my PB.  The list goes on, but last but not least, its multi-tasking is above average.  Higher memory to 2GB would be super nice, but it has yet frozen or crashed on me.BB Bridge, some may find this less appealing, but I love it and look forward to the OS2 release.  Check the 2012 CES report and you will understand what I am referring to.Cons:Apps, again it is a toss up depending on what you are looking for.  So you know what you are going into.  This is not iPad or Android apps market.  Study and see if it fits ya.SW, it needs an update really bad.  Currently, it lacks native file browser, languages support (South East Asia, for example), spelling checking, etc.  But the new OS should address most of these.I should also note that I do not like the charing setup via micro usb.  I have seen a few displays at a few shops in town with broken micro usb and the thing stuck to the device!  I am sure it was due to the abuse from potential client, but thought that I mention it.  Last but not least, the power button seems to have issue and its depends. Some unit will have a really flush power button making it hard to use.If you are a doubter and know that you do not need hundreds apps to get your job done, give it a whirl.

I don't love it (which would have been a 5 star). In short - the hardware is nice, feels good, seems of high quality. The software is limited and lacks some of the features that I would like to see. I am not an expert user and also non-ideological when it comes to brands (Apple vs. Android vs. RIM). I am a long time user of Blackberry smartphones and really like them. I was thinking about a tablet for a long time and jumped on the Playbook mostly due to the good price and the size.I find the name of the tablet fitting - Playbook. This is exactly what this device is good for. It's a nice extension to my laptop and my smartphone that I will continue to take on my travels. That's why I prefer the smaller size of the Playbook over the bigger iPad. I am sure the iPad is a great device and from all I hear and have experienced myself, it has superior touch and feel and certainly more applications than the Playbook. That's probably my biggest critizism of the Playbook. Apps are limited and I am mostly missing Google Maps and Skype functionality. I like the Blackberry Bridge functionality that allows for accessing emails on the tablet, but I cannot e.g. download attachments. This seems to be a bug connected to the Blackberry Enterprise server software, something I unfortunately have no influence on. So I am really waiting for that Operating System upgrade that RIM is promising and that is announced for Feb 2012.In summary, what I like:+ Size+ Price+ High quality touch and feel+ Speed (e.g. browser speed is great!)+ video/photo qualityWhat I don't like:- Limited apps (no google maps, no skype,...)- waiting for OS upgradeI would recommed the Playbook if you are looking for a handy extra device for mostly... play.

I'm not an Apple fanboy as I happily use both Macs and PCs, and feel like there's a place for both.  I have an iPad 2, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of Apple products and tablets in general.  What I wanted to try in the Playbook was a smaller form factor and apps that helped improve productivity.  Here are my impressions:Pros:- build quality is phenomenal.  RIM must be applauded for the device, which has tight build tolerance, high-quality materials, and a nice feel.- The display is likewise terrific.  Bright, clear, high contrast.- Initial setup was painless, and I was up and running in 10 minutes.- Price!  Compared to the Toshiba Thrive or Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus, it's hundreds of dollars cheaper.- The web browser is a full-fledged browser.  Unlike the iPad, I can browse the full Wall Street Journal website.  Big thumbs up for this.- GPS worked well.- Audio volume and quality is superior to the iPad.Cons:- Lack of apps!  This is the main reason that I returned it.  No Kindle app?  No easy way to read my own eBooks?  Yes, one can use the Kindle reader through Amazon's website, but that's not doable if you're not in a wifi area.  What if you're on an airplane?  No mail app either?  No calendar app? Similarly, no Pandora app.  Yes, you can use the browser...however...- The web browser kept crashing on me.  Over and over and over.  I restarted the tablet, reset the tablet.  Didn't help.  I found it maddening.  Other apps crashed fairly regularly too (like Spotify), but not as much as the browser.- I'm not sure a 7 inch tablet is a good form factor for web surfing.  It's way easier on a 10 inch tablet.  Duh.  But I found it pretty hard to read the screen - got a headache after a few minutes.  This is probably the downside of having the same website views as on a full-sized computer.- Steve Jobs comment about needing sandpaper to narrow your fingers so they tap the screen effectively seems pretty accurate.- I would have really liked an SD card slot (or even micro-SD).All in all, I'm not sure if the Playbook is better or worse than the Kindle Fire (it's not quite fair to compare it to the iPad, which retails for hundreds of dollars more).  The hardware is superior on the Playbook.  But the lack of usable apps hobbles it.  Maybe the supposed February software update will render it great.  But the update isn't set in stone, and RIM has already pushed it back from summer 2011.  So it's a gamble.  The question is, does the tablet work for me in its current state?  For me, no.Last note - I don't have a Blackberry smartphone.  If I did, and was able to use Blackberry bridge to tether my Playbook and get access to my mail and calendar, many of the weaknesses would be rendered moot.

I was able to get this for $249.00.First the pro-Playbook stuff:I was looking for something portable to replace or augment my laptop in a way that would allow me to be more productive, and I liked the idea that the Blackberry Playbook could bridge to my Blackberry smartphone.  This is HUGE.  When I am riding the subway, this allows me to update my calendar, task list and other stuff on the Playbook and automatically have it show up on my smartphone.  At 32 GB, I haven't even begun to hit the limit, and I have several movies, a ton of books, and lots of pictures, plus a moderate amount of music on it (I set my Playbook to sync with my Top 25 most Played list of my IPod, and then added a few other specific artists).  The size is great.  It is a little big to fit in the pocket of a suit coat, but the size is perfect for the inside pocket of an overcoat, or a large external pocket of a coat.  This puts it at about the right size for a small to medium woman's purse, I think.  Basically it is the same size as the Kindle Fire.  The screen is very responsive, the high def video is AMAZING, and the learning curve for tactile navigation is very short.  It picks up Wi-Fi very quickly and easily, and it does the same with bluetooth, plus it remembers the key passes for bluetooth or network devices once you enter them, so there is not a lot to remember when you want to sign onto a familiar protected network.Cons:  It is a little heavier than I anticipated.  It is LIGHTER than an I-Pad for sure, but you should expect this item to weigh about as much as a small jar of pickles.  This might be an issue for some people, but hasn't been for me.  Occasionally the icons you tap, or buttons you tap take a moment or so to respond.  Sometimes the interface with AppWorld is touch-and-go on downloads.  They HAVE NOT YET RELEASED the Kindle Reader for the Playbook (this is as much RIM as it is Amazon), so I am still waiting for the release of the new Pro-Android App OS under OS2, which is supposed to roll out on February 17th, according to RIM's website and latest industry news.  I will believe it when I see it.APPS:  For now, here is a brief list of APPS I have added and recommend:AIR Browser is a Free App that allows you to explore the file structure on the device like Windows Explorer or the Apple equivalent.  I find this useful to find media that I cannot find, or that the program does not detect (like some AZW files I transferred).EPub Book Reader is another Free App that allows you to do your e-reading, including AZW files.  A NOTE OF CAUTION:  DRM-Protected AZW files will be unreadable as of today's date.  Thus you cannot use this to read Kindle purchased books for the time being.FourPlay - Recommended to me as a FourSquare user, this was described on CIO.com as a useful Free App.LaterDude - just allows you to put a sticky note on your screen and fill it with whatever Post-it type notes you might have for yourself.  Free AppGuitar Playbook - holds various guitar tunings and chords for the whole scale - a neat little app for the guitar players  (you can also use this to tune).Investment Week - Free app - pretty self explanatory, and highly rated.Poynt  - Free app to find stuff nearby like movies, people, businesses, restaurants, gas, events and offersScratch Pad - a Free app that lets you write in free-hand.Doodle Blast - a free intro version of a paid game - fun for a day.ScoreMobile - Free Sports scores appQFolio - a Free Nasdaq stock appThe Big Package - a central app for free that allows you to track packages from different delivery companies in one site.Navita Translator and Fancy Tran - two free translation apps that are actually pretty goodGames:  Hangman, Free  solitaire, Playbook Chess, Gravity Burst Lite, Fruits and Ninjas, NYT Crosswords (all free apps)Currency - free currency converter.Netflix Queue Manager - meant to handle Netflix download queue.So far I am pretty happy.Just hoping the Android app interface rolls soon.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "BlackBerry Playbook 16 gb", "Author": "Christopher R. Cole", "ReviewID": "R3HBBVLG9FOI2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Playbook as a Christmas present from my parents, sister, and wife. I am completely new to the world of tablet computers, but have been a BlackBerry user for the past two and a half years. So when I saw that my family gave me a Playbook, I was very excited. I must say as I have spent the better part of the day playing with this fantastic device. My family really did their research on this. Being a BlackBerry user, the Playbook pairs via Bluetooth with my phone to access some of its features that, curiously, does not come pre-installed such as the calendar and the email app. Regardless of that though, mobile web has never looked so good. Where I believe the Playbook really shines is in its browser. You don't get a mobile view of a website, you get the full site. And unlike an iPad, the browser on the Playbook supports Flash, which the majority of the internet is. What's the point of having the \"best\" supposedly if it's handicapped by a deliberate lack of something essential? But the more I handle this, the more I am realizing that it does everything a tablet computer should do, and does it well. To say that I am impressed is an understatement. Even for someone who has had limited exposure to a touchscreen keyboard, I am finding the learning curve to be very friendly. The swipe feature, like the dots (which other BlackBerry users will be used to) allows you to do just about everything you will need to do. And as the final testament to what I have done with this so far, I typed this review on my Playbook.Edit: It's only been a couple of days but I need to update this review. I live in an area where the least expensive wi-fi option is $50 and comes with a 5gb cap. So, having my phone's unlimited data plan has been great at keeping me connected to the internet and the outside world. Where the Playbook comes into this is I can connect it to my phone (Curve 9330) via Bluetooth and use my existing data plan to surf the full web without having to add tethering to my plan.

Like the Film Board of Canada video app, Kobe bookstore or the ING.ca banking app in App World. Eh?Research in Motion is pedaling hard right now. We all know that.  Android and iOS rule the roost with Microsoft threatening to move Windows into position that might someday translate into a reasonable tablet. In the meanwhile, RIM's foot is stuck on the railroad tracks hoping some RCMP Mounties in the form of a Pandora or Skype can rescue it before the train arrives.And while the Mounties may, indeed show up, I'm betting they'll be in the form of independent players, Pandora SDK in hand, hunkered down in a cabin on the shore of Chaleur Bay in a flannel shirt hoping to get an app into the market that can stop the train. In the meanwhile, based on the recent RIM leadership shakeup and much needed Playbook upgrade to QNX 2.0, I think that the train is still very far away.I now have two of these $199 Canadian slabs sitting before me. One for me, one for my wife.  So for less than the price of one 10\" 8GB iPad, I have two 7\" 16GB Playbooks complete with USB, Bluetooth and HDMI support - connectivity features that, while unimportant to Apple in the era of `The Cloud', are important to me and lots of others.From a hardware standpoint, the Playbook is a lot of kit. When compared to a similarly priced Amazon Kindle Fire or the new 8GB B&N; Nook Tablet, just the connectivity features alone clearly give value-added benefits to the Playbook. Being a lazy writer, I'll spare you the rundown of the specs but I'll just say that this thing is solid. Really solid. Battleship solid. A bit heavy for small hands solid. And, with its metal chassis, a little cold too. If you like to cuddle up in the bedroom with your tablet perched on your mid-section, a B&N; Color Nook tab might be more comfortable. However, if you appreciate survivability, this thing is tough. But lacking Gorilla Glass, not that tough.A while ago I had the agony of owning an awful HTC Droid Eris running Android 2.1. While I'm not comparing apples to oranges or phones to tablets, I am calling out Google for the lack of stewardship of its Android OS by letting the phone manufacturers and carriers have their way with it and generally turn it into a fragmented, insecure cheeseball of an OS. It's so out of control with fragmentation and OEM customization that it reminds me of current day Las Vegas after the Mob lost control of the casinos. It's an overblown OS while Apple's iOS looks like it was designed by a New-Age artist at a Yanni concert.  I have a Windows Phone 7 which I think is the most usable mobile OS available. Looking closely at QNX, I saw that it was designed in the same spirit of OS usability, purity and security as old WebOS or Windows Phone 7.So let's talk about that operating system, QNX. A while back when HP was dumping their tablets for $99 bucks, having WebOS rather than Android or iOS was seen as a compromise to be made for the pleasure of scoring a nice albeit cheap tablet. What is sad is that WebOS is a very good OS. It's the same for Playbook's QNX. A very nice, secure and fast tablet environment bereft of malware and Android security fears. Using it gives you the impression that you are dealing with an extension of the quality build of the device's hardware. With the upgrade to 2.0, all of the previous dumb RIM management decisions melt away and you're gifted with a highly-functional tablet experience that doesn't need a Blackberry phone to provide integrated email and PIM features. In fact, QNX 2.0 gives the Playbook the smooth, effortless and snappy feel that is lacking in the Amazon Kindle Fire for the same money.Reading to this point, you'd think I'm really sold on our new Blackberry Playbooks. Well I'm certainly not going to put them in the box and send them back, but I have one serious concern that would have prevented me from buying the pair had they not been such a deal at $199 each.  Lack of apps.Now I refer you to back to my second paragraph. The section where I expect a Canadian Mountie in the form of a big player like Pandora or Skype to pull stuck RIM off the tracks before the train comes. Having business tools like Documents To Go is great, but it's not enough. Pandora says no. Skype is waiting to see if it's worth their while. But some like Zinio who see the promise of small but growing market are jumping in.Lacks of app was an issue with Windows Phone 7, and the outcry for Pandora was met by Indy developers creating SDK-based apps like MetroRadio to fill the hole. I think this is where Blackberry needs to be very proactive in supporting and fostering independent developer interest in Playbook and QNX. Just the ability to use some Android apps doesn't cut it. I've loaded a few. Feh. Playbook-native, quality apps built by RIM-supported developers are the only way to go to make RIM a true contender for your tablet-dollars.I'm keeping my Playbook. My wife hasn't put hers down since she got it, so I think she is too. But proactively I've put both Google and Bing on news alerts looking for Blackberry Playbook announcements. I'm reading Crackberry.com every day. So for now, the apps I have along with the great WebKit browser are satisfactory. But without a rapidly growing App World inventory, the future will be dim indeed.I have faith that the freight train heading for RIM will either derail or turn back before insuring a tragic and unnecessary ending to a great Canadian company.

Robinson", "ReviewID": "R2ML6RZQTEBV4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "***UPDATE***I could not in good conscience leave my review as it was.  It was bad enough that to acquire and use the most basic and universally popular apps, I had to spend hours standing on my head, tweaking my PC, and researching Java info (I am NOT a techie) to put it all together; it was worse when the only market for buying and viewing movies and shows was the ridiculous Roxio market and its antiquated, user-hostile site.But when, less than 5 months after purchase, my Playbook went the way of countless others, refusing to take a charge and eventually dying for the last time, I had it.  I can't even it sell for someone else to use for spare parts, etc., since I can't power it on to remove all my personal info.I tried so hard to support Blackberry, defending them to every mocking clerk at Best Buy or Radio Shack who saw my Torch 9810, jumping through the above referenced hoops to make it remotely useful to me, and my patience is rewarded with a $180 paperweight.  It is inexcusable that with so many users having this issue RIM did not support the problem in a proactive way.My 7\" Samsung Galaxy 2.0 and I are just fine together, thank you.P.S. Shortly after its first anniversary, my Torch began to have issues with locking up constantly, requiring battery removal to resolve.

I hope the new platform and devices work out better for Blackberry, but for now, I am done.---------------------------------... because 4 stars is a mite generous, but 3 too harsh in my opinion.Have had this for five days now and used it extensively.  Blackberry did a lot of things right with this, as compared to other 7\" tablets out there.  I should explain that I bought the Playbook as a replacement for my Kindle Fire for several reasons.  (And yes, I do recognize that Amazon never officially marketed the Fire as a \"tablet\".)1) I LOVE my Blackberry phone and based on its quality and intuitiveness, had some faith ahead of time in the Playbook's craftsmanship and usefulness.2) The Kindle Fire's limited device memory makes me crazy, and don't tell me about Cloud storage.  That is of greatly diminished value without 3G service.  No, Amazon could not have afforded to offer this for free with the Fire, but they could have made it an option which I would gladly have paid for, much as I do on my iPad.  In any event, the Playbook I selected (32GB) offers quadruple the device memory as the Kindle for only 25% more money.3)  No camera on the Fire; front and rear-facing on the Playbook.  You DO need good lighting for a decent shot, however.  My phone takes a much better picture and compensates with a flash for darker scenes.4)  The Blackberry Bridge option which synced in a wink all the data on my Torch 9810, and the option to tether the tablet to my phone for 3G service (yes, at an additional charge.)So far I have decided the Fire is going up on eBay, but the jury is still out on whether or not I'll return the Playbook.PROS-Much larger memory than the Fire-Terrific graphics-Icons laid out on desktop in the usual manner.  Sorry, I find the Fire's carousel approach silly and unwieldy, and have the impression it was used for the sole purpose of doing something different (whether it was a better idea or not.)-Menus and page minimization super easy to manipulate.-File manager from which I can access .pdfs, pictures, music, etc.  Nice to have it centralized and files of all types neatly listed.-True stereo output, with speakers on BOTH sides (unlike the Fire).  Sound quality is impressive.-Option for use with a separate keyboard, though RIM severely underproduced the most reliable keyboard out there.  Cheaper versions seem to have mixed reviews.  Regardless, a reliable external keyboard could effectively turn the Playbook into a respectable netbook IMO.-Reasonably priced-USB cable makes loading music, documents, etc. from both my office PC and home iMac a breeze.CONS (and why it might go back)-NO KINDLE APP!!  Seriously??  For the first time, Amazon has managed to majorly disappoint me.  The company shot off its mouth over a year ago that one would be available for the Playbook, but no.

How could I resist? Well, I went ahead and bought it and I do like and dislike a few things about it.I really love the hardware quality of this tablet. It feels so whole and sturdy. This is the first BlackBerry device I've ever used, and I can see why they have such a loyal fanbase even in this day and age when Google, Apple, and Microsoft are eating away at their market share. I especially love the play/pause button on top of the tablet. That's quite useful. The matte finish on the back of the unit really gets me, because I love matte finishes on high quality devices. It certainly does not feel cheap, either. This is a well-put together tablet, and BlackBerry is even nice enough to include a neoprene sleeve with your PlayBook to give it basic protection.I was a little surprised at the lack of buttons for functions like forward or home, but I got used to the gestures rather quickly. They make a lot of sense, or at least for the most part (swiping from the bottom upward to close the app drawer is the only gesture that makes no sense to me, because swiping from the top down when the app drawer is open only opens the (very useful) settings drawer).The built-in apps are polished and well-made. Browser is very reliable, as well as the onboard camera, file manager, picture browser, video player, and more. It also does a wonderful job with my calendar sync and it syncs my contacts and emails quite well. Standby battery life is also very excellent. I had it sitting in my messenger bag for the past 8 hours and it still has 92% battery left from light use. The built-in keyboard is quite nice and makes a very nice, loud, satisfying tap sound when you press a key. When you type in certain apps or in the browser, the keyboard opens up this prediction system that reminds me of SwiftKey on Android, which is also rather nice.The built-in storage amount is by far the best feature of this tablet to me. So much space for so many videos, songs, and pictures. It's wonderful. You can go crazy with 64GB of storage. I have several videos in the .wmv format inside of it right now, but there's definitely more space available, and other supported formats. You could also use that space for games, which BlackBerry World seems to have no shortage of, as far as I can tell.Now, there are a few things I dislike about the item, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like the item as a whole.First of all, the app selection is awful and even non-existent to some degree. A lot of big names are completely absent on this platform for some reason. No official Dropbox, Netflix, Springpad, Kindle, nook, Pandora, Feedly, and a whole lot of other apps are missing. On a platform like Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8, whenever there's no official app, there's at least a very good third party app that is good enough or even better. That is not the case on the BlackBerry Playbook. If there's no app, chances are you have a questionable third-party app that actually costs money and has bad reviews, or nothing at all. You can sideload .bar files, but judging by the ported apps I've tried, they barely work or are poorly optimized for the PlayBook. It makes me wish people other than just game developers had given the PlayBook more of a chance. The hardware is definitely nice, but the software support from third parties was definitely not there.I also own a Nexus 7, and the app selection on the PlayBook (unfortunately) pales in comparison. I think that's a shame as well, because I like the look and feel of the PlayBook's hardware more. I don't play a lot of games, either, but it seems like the apps that are most plentiful on the PlayBook (or just about any tablet) are the games. There's even a few preinstalled on the PlayBook, like Tetris or Need For Speed, in case you want to get used to the UI on it.I'm not a fan of the security on the tablet, either. I'm not talking about stuff like viruses or any of that. No, BlackBerry's very much on the ball when it comes to that kind of security. The security I'm talking about is locking the tablet. If you have a Nexus 7, iPad, or just about any other device, you can set up a convenient and rather easy way to unlock the device so that only the owner or those who know the password/pin/pattern can get access. Well, if you only like password lock screens, then you will have no problem at all with the PlayBook. This is the only way to lock the device, to my knowledge. I looked around in the settings and can't find anything else. Instead of being able to quickly press a few numbers, or draw out a pattern, I have to use the entire keyboard and type something out, and after that, reach for the \"OK\" or \"Enter\" key. You can just use a pin for the password, but it's still more effort than it needs to be. I wish this required a bit less effort, although it's not a deal killer for me. It's partly a problem because this is a tablet instead of a smartphone, so the screen is bigger and takes more effort to type a simple password on.Lastly, some of the UI is a bit counter-intuitive to me, or at least at first. This is my first BlackBerry device, and I am willing to admit if I just found it counter-intuitive because I'm unfamiliar with BlackBerry's UI standards. It took me a while to figure out how to set a wallpaper for the tablet. I kept searching the settings thinking it had to be close, until a Google search showed me I had to go to the pictures app and do it from there. Also, it seems like to get settings on any app, you need to swipe from the top down, which isn't too obvious unless you've used the tablet for a long time or just already know what to expect.Although this tablet has shortcomings and is aging a bit, it is still an unbeatable value for its storage and out-of-box media capabilities. Good luck finding a new 64GB tablet at that price. I store tons of video on mine and use it primarily as a dedicated media tablet. For media playback and capabilities, this tablet is more than adequate for the job. Just don't count on using too many apps. If you want to watch videos, play music, or look at pictures on the go, and you want a lot of storage to do so, go for the PlayBook. You won't be disappointed you did.EDIT: I've been using it a bit more lately with sideloaded apps I've put into the tablet myself. Some of these are a bit wonky to get working (older versions, free apps only, etc.), but some of them do work great or good enough. RetroArch works perfectly on the PlayBook (to my knowledge, I haven't actually opened up a ROM in it), and the Dropbox app I sideloaded as a .bar file works fine, too. But the strangest thing is that you probably need to sideload apps to get quality compared to the ported apps on BlackBerry World. For example, I use Electro Droid on my Android devices, and there's an app called Electro Tools in BlackBerry World that looks like a ported app. The ported app in BBW is terrible and barely works at all, but if you sideload Electro Droid as a .bar file, it works perfectly.Sadly, you can't sideload everything on this tablet. I've tried sideloading SpringPad twice already, but it doesn't even show up on my apps list. Still, your results may vary on this, but it's quite capable on running sideload apps. I partly wish that sideloading didn't require setting a password on this tablet (a password is required for using the tablet in development mode, which you need to sideload anything).", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got one that was supposed to be new but was not", "Author": "Mary Garvey", "ReviewID": "R2QCHOXX20QOX3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to return it..I got it from Time to Save..perhaps there is a glitch but I could not set it up or register it and called Blackberry Support..they said serial number had a valid registration and this was not a new item..it looked new..no scratches etc....I went back to web site to see if it said refurbished anywhere and did not see it.I am sending back and hopefully will not have further trouble with another one.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's the best I come across", "Author": "Avelon Manswell", "ReviewID": "R23UAM4YUJCE1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't get enough of itCan't put it down go out and get one.

The small form factor makes it easy for even a six year old to run around and capture action shots like a pro (it's survived being dropped a few times).  On vacations it fits in the same camera bag along with my 35mm SLR so it's very easy to bring along. Of course the good games like Angry Birds and Need for Speed come in handy too.-sent from my playbookPS - I'm a Ph.D. Computer Science not an MD", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally UNDERrated", "Author": "F.

However, at these price points, I don't think there is a better tablet for the money than the Playbook.  Yes, the Playbook isn't as fun and sexy to most like an iPad, but it can do so many things very well.  The web browsing is fantastic.  The music and video options are great.  In fact, I just sync it with my iTunes.  The camera is super and the video chat is great.  The video chat is limited between Playbook users, but man is it sweet!  Too bad it isn't expanded.Bottom line if you are shopping for a tablet, give the Playbook a good, hard, look.

Problem with YouTube and other apps.I have used the iPad 2, iPad 3, HP TouchPad and now this Playbook.  In terms of build quality, it is solid.  you have this metal shelf feeling once you hold on to it.However, it seems the apps is worse than HP TouchPad.  I use it mainly to read email, browse the web, track stocks and watch youtube.Let's start with my worst experience, the YouTube.  The layout seems ok, until you start do a search on video.  It cannot find video that exist when using web browser.  I am talking about the browser on BB.  That's pointless, right?  it is not just one instance.  It happens a lot.  So, I end up using the browser to go to YouTube .  Secondly, the \"related\" video and the authors link feature doesn't work!!  So, after you watch one video, and wants to find the related video or author button.  It just won't allow you to do it.  Even WebOS is better, what is this?Second main comment is the lack of good stocks, options tracking software.  It isn't hard to program.  Since RIMM is targeting business users, they should include more finance related good apps.Third, the screen and video quality is not as good as HP TouchPad.  the pixel density seems less.  Comparinng with the TouchPad.  It seems the pixels are larger.  however, the sharpest seems a little better than the TouchPad.I think the screen is on bar with iPad2.  iPad 3 screen may be a little over rated...", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most under-rated technology product", "Author": "Mitchell O.

The power button is easily pressed without any head scratching, frustration or need for a sharp object.  As for apps, there are far more than I expected.  Many hundreds, mostly either free or ranging up to $1.99.  There are a few that are more expensive, including Angry Birds at $4.99.  One small complaint that I hadn't seen documented is the longish boot time.  It takes my playbook about a minute and a half from button press to ready to use.

My expectation is that any important OS updates RIM provides for the 32 and 64 gig models will also apply to the 16 gig models.Background:  My use of the Playbook is primarily for business, so that perspective largely impacts my review.Value: Excellent value for the hardware and software that comes with the Playbook.  That's why I don't mind tossing a few bucks for some apps, altho I'd prefer to pay more up front and not have to search for some essential apps, some of which have shortcomings.OS and Blackberry Support of the OS:  Software/Installation Process Should Be BetterThe RIM websites devoted to the Playbook have some useful instructional videos, but these websites are also disorganized and unnecessarily confusing in areas.I'd prefer to have the option of updating the OS using the USB cable and the Blackberry software I can access from the RIM site(s).The on-board standard file manager that comes with the Playbook is very limited and doesn't show many files and folders on the Playbook.  (I've been trying out some file manager apps from the Blackberry Appworld.)  For limited file management, one can also change the Playbook's \"Storage and Sharing\" settings or use the the Blackberry Desktop software installed on a laptop/desktop in conjunction with a USB cable connected to Playbook.The Playbook has a .pdf reader installed, as well as Docs to Go, which includes mobile versions of MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.  Trying to open versions of a document that I had created in the MS Word format as well as the .pdf format, the .pdf reader provided better readability, showing page numbers and a signature, whereas Docs to Go did not.  Opening a PowerPoint file that contained audio, Docs to Go showed the slides but did not recreate the audio.  Perhaps there are apps or other software I could procure to address this shortcomingThe Playbook allows me to tether via Bluetooth to a Nokia smartphone that connects to a Tmobile data service.  This arrangement works very well, the connection remaining unbroken for 2-4 hours on occasion.  However, certain apps, such as the Playbooks App World app won't work with this type of connection, but will work with a WiFi connection.Using the default video recording settings created files of about 4 gigs in size during an hour and a half of recording.  Because I don't do much digital video recording, I can't validly compare the Playbook's capabilities in this area with similarly priced instruments.Recently, I bought the OEM Blackberry charging stand, which has been reviewed on the Amazon website.  I will probably buy the OEM Blackberry bluetooth keyboard, which altho pricier than most of the alternatives, probably works considerably better with the Playbook, based on many reviews I have read.AFAIK, the Playbook doesn't come with a password manager.  I paid 1.99 or 2.99 for the Vault, from Xlabz.  This works fairly well.  However, this software provides for offsite backing up, using DropBox.  This is a step I don't want to take, because of my security concerns re: Dropbox.  I'm hoping that a more comprehensive file manager will allow me to find one or more password manager files on the Playbook that I can use for onsite backing up of the password manager.As others have mentioned, the music player combined with the Playbook's speakers work well in light of the device's speaker size limitations.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Fano", "ReviewID": "R1HSC6ZE3RY8FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the better tablet in the market.

What most people won't like about this tablet is the amount of free apps, that it doesn't have. Can't get Angry Birds free, being its operating system is not an Android operating system. What else does this tablet have to make it worth buying? The camera and battery life. Every scenic picture taken with the camera makes it look interesting. Makes the scenic pictures that would have been a boring looking picture, into something that you wonder \"where is that\". Makes the photo look like a whole different world. The battery, not sure if you can get a tablet with a better battery life, at this point. Does last a long time. Another thing people may not like is the boot up time. Sometime you just want to be able to turn it in really quick and play your favorite game. I think that slow boot up somehow helps out alot with the battery life though. Since. Not a problem for me.

Yes you can get a bridge between your phone and the playbook but all you need is a Blackberry ID, which is mainly necessary for the App world.

I got it so I could play casual games & watch videos while traveling.Native browser: The bad thing is that it crashes frequently, doesn;t play too nicely with yahoo mail, is very slow, & does not support AbBlocker. It's the ads that cause the bulk of crashing & the slowness. The good thing is that when it crashes, reopening it will put you on the last thing you were looking at. There are several other 3ed party browsers you can install.Proxybrowser: The only browser AdBlocker works on, because it comes with it. The downside is that won't play videos. Still, the lack of ads improve browsing speed & stability greatly.Facebook: Don't even try to play Facebook games on this thing; it will crash every time. It can't handle the workload.Youtube/Blip: Half of the time, when an ad plays in the middle of the video, it will play the ads over & over, then reset the video to the beginning or end it.Battery life: 4 hours tops, unless you turn off WiFi when you're not using it.Free games: You'll have to spend a few books to find anything good. Most of the free games are duplicates, aimed at detracting drooling 2 year olds, or the most mediocre games in their native Chinese, Spanish, & Russian languages.Camera: Fill a fish bowl full of cocoa; that's what your pictures will look like. Not unlike that weird orangeness old cellphone cameras have.Java support: None; there goes your plans to sideload Minecraft.Software updates: Haven't been any since I bought it, so Flash is several versions behind.Blackberry Desktop Software: I've never gotten this thing to successfully connect to my desktop. Even their tech support gave up trying to help me.Primary uses: It still does the little things I wanted it for; Play solitaire in bed as a pre-sleep ritual, access Yelp/email/Google Maps on vacation, has a screen 3x the size of an iPad, & isn't an Apple or Microsoft product.

It had an overall cheap feel to it and the operating system was terrible.  There were almost no apps for it and your home screen was limited to a bookshelf.  I guess that it was a good ebook reader and that is about it.  I wanted a real tablet so I ordered the Playbook.  The first thing that I noticed about the Playbook was the quality.  The screen is as nice as they come and the whole device is made from the best materials.  You cannot even compare the quality of this to the Nook.  The operating system is great on this as well.  There are not as many apps as Android but you will find what you are looking for.  It is really good for running multiple apps at once and it is really fast; apps load and open quickly.  It is also nice that it has dual cameras and a gps, something that the Nook didn't have.  Another nice feature is the HDMI port which allows you to easily connect the Playbook to a HDTV, definitely a useful feature.

If you have a Blackberry phone, it can now function as a mouse and keypad giving you more precise control than any other tablet. I bought this thing because I have a Blackberry phone and it was only $199.99.  The 7\" size is superb saving weight and space--holding this lightweight device is easy even for extended periods. I cannot imagine why anyone would want a larger screen--this one is incredibly readable. I've been using the device for at least a month and rather than reaching for my laptop, I use the Playbook instead.  I'd tried all the other tablets (including iPad) over the past few months and was uninspired by all.  Obviously when the Playbook is selling at a $200 price point it's being sold for far less than manufacturing cost--Blackberry is trying to clear the warehouse of reportedly millions of unsold devices--better buy yours before they're gone or the price increases.

Shame on you.", "Author": "Navid", "ReviewID": "R1L6FXYXL4HM68", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered two 64gb Playbooks through RIM's site (free shipping, no tax, figured the mfg stands behind its products if any issues arise).  My mistake.  Should have ordered via Amazon.com since they set the standard on customer care.  It would have cost a bit more, but I wouldn't have to waste my time writing this review.Again, I bought two Playbook's, both 64gb. One for me, the other for my wife since we're both BB 9900 and 9810 users and loyalists.  One Playbook was defective right out of the box.  It had a dead pixel, which by the way they said they couldn't do anything about because \"it's within our acceptable range\" for dead pixels.  I couldn't believe my ears.  It's like buying a new car with a crack on the windshield, and the dealership says \"that's ok, because we set our standards so low, that this is actually a good thing\".It didn't end there.  The device would also freeze up and not allow me to turn it off.  Then they refused to allow me to return both devices, even though the second device was still in the box, unopened.  They said they need to attempt to repair it, and they couldn't repair the dead pixel.  I have to live with that problem they said.  That process would have taken at least 3 weeks.  They also had the nerve to tell me to keep the unopened box device and use that one, and then they would take back the device with the problem.  I was thinking, \"seriously?\", do they think I'm that desperate or stupid?I guarantee you, Apple or any Android device maker wouldn't conduct their QC or customer service that way.Finally, I pretty much had to keep calling until they sent me a new device.  That device didn't come in the same packaging.  So now, I have a supposed \"new\" 64gb Playbook, with the box of the old one, which obviously doesn't have the same SN.  They called that the \"advanced exchange\".  To their defense, they did overnight that with a prepaid FedEx label for the device I returned.  But that's after putting a $699 retail price hold on my credit card.  I paid $299 for my device, but they put a hold of $699 on my credit card.  Figure that one out.  Nice, right?I've been a BB user for almost 10 years now.  I can't believe how quickly this company has gone from being the innovator in the space to the catastrophe of the space.If you're having trouble getting to customer support, try this number (877) 255.2377.  You'll need a case number and from that point, they're pretty good about denying responsibility for their subpar products.  It's a customer support nightmare.I'm now stuck with the two devices which I'm debating keeping.  I really did like the bridge feature and being able to access the internet while mobile, without having to pay for a 3G or 4G service.  But the lack of apps and so many other missing features, which the press has written about extensively makes it an unattractive device compared to what's available out there.  Not to mention all the technical issues the device has.RIM's third party fulfillment company GlobalWare Solutions said they've escalated my request to return the devices to their committee and they will decide if they'll send me an RMA with a prepaid shipping label.  Nice, huh?  No one has called me yet.  I'm in a big \"BLACK\"-BERRY hole.  Their number is (866) 957-0761, and they referred me to their BB technical support at (877) 644-8410, which then referred me to the BB website.  It's one clown short of a three-ring circus.Now you know why their stock price is where it is, and why customers are taking losses and getting rid of their devices, and to leave the mess this company has created for itself, and it's loyalists.Ridiculous if you ask me.  Not to mention, very embarrassing.You're bound to see more and more negative comments about customer experiences with the Playbook that will crush any attempts RIM will make to keep itself above water.  This thing is starting to unravel faster than they can do damage control.This product was not ready for launch, and they clearly rushed it due to pressure.  Now, instead of standing behind its products and reputation, and making things right for unhappy customers, it's deflecting accountability and responsibility and leaving the customer high and dry.Nice going RIM.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Playbook User for 4 Days", "Author": "Todd Snelgrove \"Global Manager; Value\"", "ReviewID": "RGRNV1YCRQ325", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

Everything is hard.Seeing as the entire point of a tablet is simplicity, I found this aspect really odd.An example: You can download your photos quite easily from another computer, which is nice to cart around old pics you like to have around. But while with an ipad or galaxy, then viewing them, and moving between them, is ease itself, with the playbook, it's a struggle. There might be an app that makes this work, but I've been through four and nothing is satisfactory. I never for a minute considered that this might be a problem. It isn't with anything else I own. after all.And there are the truly bizarre, no Skype, no Netflix, both you'd think would be included in any product today.The technical support is poor. And on...When it does what I expected it to do, it does it well. But right now, it's a reader and email machine with a USB stick functionality.

I am just happy as can be with the Playbook. Granted, it's not perfect and the apps are few right now. Quite baren almost...but it's got some help on the way as RIM is giving these out to Android developers willing to port their apps over to the Playbook.The Playbook has fast hardware, ample storage, and a great UI. The apps available on the Playbook are basic but elegant. I almost felt like I was using something with an Apple logo on it, everything is sharp and fast. The mutlitasking nature of the tabbed UI is just so inuitive it's literally a fine example of the work these guys do.I researched tablets for quite a while, thinking over such options as the Kindle Fire, Nook Color, Galaxy Tab, and Toshiba Thrive. After hashing over what was more preferable - screen size, hardware, and build quality - I narrowed it down to just the smaller units. Personally, anything over 7 inches doesn't feel like a real tablet.  I liked the Nook and Kindle for that reason. Ultimately, I chose this because of the price. It's an incredible deal for what you're getting. No GPS though, which kinda foiled my plan of using it as a big GPS nav. But I do just about love it for everything else it offers.This is only the 2nd day owning this tablet but I'm very happy with the device and the experience is awesome. I'm coming from 2+ years of Android experience, 2 years Windows Mobile before that, and frankly speaking it's all more or less moving in the same direction.

I don't know if what I did made the difference, but .... with wifi on and connected I enabled pop-ups.  Then I used the cloud reader link on the \"app/link\" page I'd created earlier, went to downloaded books (I'd \"downloaded\" four)and opened one and read some.  Pages don't turn well but it's doable if not fun.  Then I turned off the wireless but did NOT close the browser and was able to go back to it and continue reading.  However, I found that if you close the browser app you're done for; poof, it's all gone when you reopen it and you have to enable/connect the wifi and start all over again to get back to your book.  Oh, and Bing maps has finally more or less located me - twice and briefly - a few blocks from my actual location.Update:  Upon further reflection I'm going to upgrade the rating to .... 3 stars, I think.  It does a nice job with photos and videos (and music) and I don't expect something of this size to be much of a \"work machine\", just more of a fun \"take along\" as RugRat says, something in size between my iPhone (too small for much photo/video stuff) and my iPad (too big for a purse)and with somehow a sleeker feel and a little more easy versatility than my Kindle Fire.  Yahoo (sbcglobal) and gmail access work, web browsing is fine.  BUT - the location service still doesn't work, Blackberry tech support gets NEGATIVE stars, and the biggest problem - a deal-breaker really - is that I can't read my Kindle books without internet access.  I'm not going to carry around TWO 7\" tablets, and in the war of Books vs Videos Books win hands down.Original Review:  I've had this for two days and so far I like the look and feel but not much else.  I've done two hard resets and made three calls to tech support who were if possible worse than useless.  On the first call I got a live person, I asked a question, was put on hold and disconnected after 6 minutes.  The second call disconnected AT the transfer, and on the third call I got a human again who mostly said things like \"yeah, maybe\" and \"I don't know\" and couldn't even explain or walk me through some of the basic steps I'd already done.  So far Bing Maps cannot \"locate\" me - at all - even though the other GPS-less but wifi devices next to it can.  Granted they are sometimes a few blocks off, but the Playbook just says \"unable to locate - please try later\" (I think trying repeatedly over two days is enough). And, try as I might, I've been unable to read - or even find - my supposedly \"downloaded to the device\" Kindle books while offline despite hours of searching and trying possible online \"solutions \" or work-arounds. They may have worked for some, but not on the unit I have.  When I asked the Blackberry rep for help with this issue he clearly didn't have any idea and first had me go through a bunch of things I'd already done that didn't work.  When I really pressed him on the subject - because if I can't figure out a way to do this I'm most likely returning it - he put me on hold for a few minutes and came back to say there was \"no way I could read the Kindle books on the playbook.\"", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be aware of extra charge to tether to your phone", "Author": "ColoMom", "ReviewID": "RZVAFGQYQ78PP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently bought this from the manufacturer on sale.  I have been looking at various notebooks for a while but no way would I pay $600 (I got the 32 GB) for any of them.  I really wanted it for travel so I would not need to take my laptop with me and didn't necessarily need to find a wi-fi hotspot on the road.  I chose the playbook for a couple of reasons--1)  I really like the size of it (about as big as a half-sheet of paper)very easily fits in my purse 2) I liked the idea that you could tether it to your Blackberry phone for data (the idea, of course, being that I didn't have to buy a separate data plan.)  That second reason for buying it is why I am only giving it 3 stars--what they don't tell you (or, at least I never saw anywhere, is that you have to PAY EXTRA to tether it to your phone for data (or at least with ATT you do)--so much for not having to buy another plan!!  I don't know yet how much as I haven't had to travel since getting it and have just been using it with wi-fi, I just thought I'd try it and that is how I discovered the need for an extended plan.  This is fairly annoying to me!!  Otherwise, I do like it, it does easily sync information (like notepad, etc) with the phone and if you're on a wi-fi network, connects and browses well on the internet.  As other reviewers noted, it is a little short on apps but there are still quite a few--enough anyway to make me happy enough and my kids have had great fun playing on it.  So anyway, even if I end up not paying extra to tether to my phone to it, I guess it can provide entertainment when we're traveling!  Just thought a little heads up on the data plan would be nice.**update**  haven't tried this yet but another reviewer recommended looking at crackberry.com/playbook-bridge to get around the tethering issue.  I looked at it and think that will probably work for me.  If it does I will likely be back to raise my rating to 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  This really is a neat little item!**more update**well, I've tried several workarounds to this issue none of which worked for me.  Probably who I should ding is ATT not the playbook but anyway this isn't going to work for right now the way I wanted it to so I'm not really happy either way.

The primary reason for buying it was the promise of android apps. I thought that the OS looks good, and with a choice of apps, it is a steal, considering the hardware. How very wrong i was!The hardware is indeed great for the price. You get 2 cameras, a stunning display, a 1ghz dual core processor and 1 gig of RAM. The OS, for the most part, does a great job of using this hardware potential. So what's the problem?Apps, as you might have guessed. What use are 2 cameras when you don't even get skype, or any other video chat app, coming to think of it. Yeah, there is the official video chat, but it is works only with playbooks playbook,rendering it more or less useless.Appworld is a joke, seriously! I did see a lot of new apps after the release of OS 2.0, but most of them are completely useless. Most look as if devs made them only to get a free playbook.No kindle, no netflix, hulu, no decent note taking app except evernote, not even google maps. What they have, like angry birds, are overpriced. $4.99 for angry birds,really?? It appears that devs are not too interested in making any apps for the playbook.So comparing to iOS or android, the apps selection is ludicrous.Problem is, no improvement is in sight.The android apps were only the ones devs submitted, which does not seem to be a large number.There are some games, but the collection is very limited.The android app player can get temperamental at times.On the plus side, the OS is actually snappy. Closing an app is as easy as it gets. The video and sound quality is pretty good, so is office app.If all you need is a device that you could put in your pocket and use for email, reading and editing word and excel docs and surf the net?( with wifi), this is the device for you. If you want something which can be versatile in use, with a big app selection, look elsewhere.

I have had my 32GB wifi model for about a week.  (I bought it from Staples.)  The physical tablet is four and half stars.  It is a perfect size, the screen is beautiful and the weight is ideal.  It is roughly the same size as a 3d generation Kindle.  Half a star deduction for the top buttons which do not feel like they are very high quality.Included in the box are some brief instructions, a folding blade charger, a micro-usb cable, a nice foam pouch case, and a screen wipe.There are a few negatives: (1) a lot of websites think the browser is for a blackberry phone and auto-direct you to the mobile version of their website; (2) the browser does not allow you to rename bookmarks, reorder bookmarks, or put bookmarks into folders; (3) the GPS is not yet functional - it's in there, but has not been enabled by the firmware - this feature is \"coming soon\"; (4) there are two very high quality cameras, but no videochat software; (5) there is no Kindle App.When linked to your blackberry smartphone via bluetooth you get a mirror of the email, contacts, calendar, to do, and memo pad found on your phone.  You also get access to files on your blackberry (even the microSD), but cannot open video or audio files - just documents.  There is something called the \"bridge browser\" which allows you to surf the internet through your phone's web browser and 3G connection.  This is different from tethering because the carriers don't charge for it.  The PlayBook also allows tethering which gives you full data access (although not to app world for some reason).  Some carriers charge for tethering, some don't.  Apparently AT&T; doesn't even allow their customers to use the Bridge - which is a HUGE drawback if you happen to have AT&T.;The lack of apps is the largest drawback.  As of this writing, there is no Kindle app (a huge drawback), no Skype app, no Netflix app, and no MLB app.  You cannot watch Netflix videos on the browser or your MLB.tv subscription.  You CAN watch amazon instant videos.  They look beautiful.There is a huge amount of potential, but unfortunately a lot of that is \"coming soon\" - and isn't there right now.  When is \"soon\"?  Nobody knows.  One good thing is that firmware updates come out every few days and each adds functions.  Since there are no carriers involved in rolling out firmware, RIM has full control and can do it quickly.Some have mentioned problems with battery charging - I haven't had that.  My battery charges pretty quickly and goes to 100%.  I can use it for nearly 15 hours before I get a low battery warning with about 10% left.  Some have complained about the power button being hard to push.  Mine is small and recessed, but I can easily push it.The screen is absolutely beautiful.You can use your existing blackberry charger, but it will take much longer to charge.  The included charger can charge your existing blackberry (micro USB) without harm.  There is also an available quick-charging stand.The BlackBerry PlayBook could be an amazing tablet - five stars.  However, it is now a bit of a work in progress at this point and I can only give it three stars as it currently stands - It is only OK.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "High hopes dashed to bits", "Author": "BB Fan", "ReviewID": "R2U07EKOXYRBP6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I waited almost a year before getting the 64GB Blackberry Playbook.

Since I am a Blackberry diehard who has had one since the monochrome sidewheel days and my whole family is on Blackberry devices I figured that it would fit nicely in my ecosystem.Before purchasing it, even at 57% off the regular price I laid out some reasons for buying it:1) Play audio2) Play video3) Browse web4) Use Blackberry Bridge to do emails to stop hurting my Blackberry thumb!I received it on Friday and here's how it went:1) Audio: It won't play about 5% of my MP3s.  The screen shows that it is progressing through the song yet there is no audio.2) Video: It won't play about 30% of my videos.  None of the .MKV videos work and some of the .AVIs won't work at all while others show a silent movie that I attribute back to whatever it is that won't play audio files.3) The fastest loading page on the web is arguably the Google home page at [...]  On the Playbook this page takes 3-4 minutes to load with the Playbook within arm's length of the wireless router. The Playbook is touted for having Flash support but only after I turned Flash off and JavaScript off would Google load in a few seconds.4) Blackberry Bridge: Doesn't work for me. Although this not working may be attributable to my using a Blackberry that's a few years old and doesn't have as much memory as the latest, the bottom line is that it still didn't work because my Blackberry phone did not have enough memory to run the required software and I'm not about to go out and buy a new Blackberry phone just to make the Playbook work.and more5) Screen sensitivity: Almost half the time the screen would not respond to my finger swipes and pokes.  Very frustrating.  This reminds me of when I first excitedly tried the Blackberry Storm and the onscreen phone dialpad would not recognize pokes at the \"3\" digit...for 20 minutes straight.

IMO it is not worth the price if one cannot do what you need ....email= no problem using yahoo & gmail.boarding passes = sometimes it works sometimes not. many times i cannot get the curser into box or the small windows to choose dates that pop up freeze or i can't make a choice = i end up using 3g on cell.hotel/plane reservation= same problem as boarding pass = end up using 3g on cell.maps = fair to so-so  .. if you are looking at a resturant and they provide a map ( google or bing) and i click on map it pops up a new browser page and it freezes and i have to cloes it. = end up using google maps on cell ... anyway i get to google maps it doesn't work = freezes ... going to BING and clicking on maps = freezes.the playbook does have a bing map app. that works so-so to ok . problem there is say i'm looking at santa monica and i click on resturants. it shows 7 ( 1-7) resturants on map. i can click next page and now it shows 8-14 on map ..finally by page 6 i see my resturant say #44 .. i then zoom into map and by the time i can see the street name the resturants have reset to 1-7 .. i then jump to page 6 and now the map is zoomed out and my resturant isn't there because now it might be #30 or #40 or #9 .. seems to change every time and again once i zoom into map it always goes back to page 1 on listings ..surfing the net = so-so ..many times the pop ups do not work, hard to get curser into boxes, pages do not load or do not work ( freezes )the playbook is set up to work with a blackberry phone. i do have a wifi hotspot on my cell. no problem with playbook connecting to it but in the end it's not good enough here ... i've been on 3 trips since i've had the playbook and every trip i've ended up using my cell to finish up what the playbook couldn't.i've been told that OS V2 mid feb 2012 will fix it.oh lets not forget about the on/off button. it's a pain .. i can press on it for 5, 10 , 20 seconds and nothing. not sure what pressure turns it on?  you can turn it off without using the button BUT the only way to turn it on is using it. right after i bought it i went to 2 stores that carried playbook to see if mine had a problem. both stores had playbooks on display and none worked. last week i went by 3 stores and again NONE worked. these are not display models they are suppose to be working playbooks. i did find one at a best buy begin of Jan and the ON button was worse then mine. so i just don't turn it off. i find that after approx 3 days of not using it - it is very difficult to wake up.other then the ON button the hardware seems to be very good to excellent. HDMI easily connects to TV, projector.IMO it's the software that needs work. hoping V2 makes it usable ..not a happy playbook owner ( yet)update 4/9/2012upgraded to 2.0 ..no problem making plane/hotel /boarding pass, reservations ..bing maps works much better ... google maps still does not work ...takes over 3min to boot up ... seems to me, clicking on links is worse ( nothing happens)in OS 2 ..also i use to leave it in standby ( because it is difficult to turn ON) but since OS 2i find that after 24hrs in stand-by it is very difficult to get it out of stand-by and when i do, about 40% of the time it is frozen = have to restart ...still think the ON=OFF button is the WORST ..i'm not finding the \" it works with android apps\" working that well ...i do like the 7\" size ..IMO OS 2 is a slight improvement  ..today i take a 4.3\" android phone on trips (no cell service on it, only use WiFi ) instead of the playbook because it works much better ... take a 3.2\" android for cell phone use ...not a happy playbook owner ... use it less and less ...it's OK but OK is not good enoughupdated 9/23/12there was a small update in software since last april ..no longer have any problems getting it out of stand-by after 24hrs or even 4-5 days of stand-by... but now making reservations is difficult because 75% of the time i can't click on the icons to finish teh reservation or should i say i don't know if i clicked on the icon ? they don't highlight, i click on em and nothing happens but then i'll check my email 5 min later and see that i just made 3 reservations at the hotel or i bought 2 train tickets ? it never went to a confirm page when i was trying to make reservation ...BING maps is difficult to use with the new software update ( again can't click on the icons ) ... i now consider this thing USELESS ... if one can't click on icons then it sits there ...60% i can't go BACK to previous web page ... i pretty much stopped using it last april (2012) .. was thinking of taking it to europe next week but after trying it out last week it just can't complete reservations and it's a pain to surf the web  , will replace this with a android tablet when i return ... changed rating to 1 star ( from 2)  ..will never again buy a RIM product/service ..", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "detail", "ReviewID": "R25N7OH6XJ4PXU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "good seller,fast shipping. not one regret even as i had doubts before i purchased the item. i love the product", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I satisfy", "Author": "Patricia Merritt", "ReviewID": "R3MOGUEQBZ10AS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I received them they wAsnt working I was n't satisfy with  both tablet .

Totally unfair after collecting US$300 for a device now worth half that amount.RIM was a great fore runner in the smart phone market but the truth is the companies restrictiveness and inability to move with the time and give customers what they want has made them nothing better than a relic.

I've always liked Blackberry and am somewhat saddened by their fall from grace. I bought the device just to see what it was like after several dramatic price cuts. It's good, but it is not special. I also have an iPad that I disliked at first, but after buying the Playbook I find the iPad experience to be better. I've also played with Samsung's tablets and like them better than the iPad. The screen size is too small, which I knew going into the purchase. I feel that any device with 7-inch screen is not worth it. Playbook is pretty heavy and I don't like that either, but some people might find the weight difference marginal. The Blackberry App World is small and there isn't a single one that I have bought. The device now serves as an expensive web-browser for me, something I already get from my Kindle Fire and iPad. A final thought, the navigation around the menus and especially certain apps is not quite intuitive. I have found myself very confused and frustrated trying to exit a screen that doesn't have an exit button for me (the device itself doesn't have a home button either, something common with other tablets)...the exit is all in the swipe...somewhere...if you just know where the swipe spot is... Bottomline, I would recommend holding off until the device is much cheaper or just pay-up and get a competing device.

Sometimes my life seems to depend on it, so, I was really waiting for a product like this Playbook to be out in the market. I went to the closest Staples and got me one (16Gb for $499.00 + tax)...they had plenty of them anyway. The disappointment that fallowed is such a shame given the Tremendous Amount of Technology Packed in this Cool Gadget.Graphics: As said before...breathtaking, out of this world.Multitasking: Flawless...impressive.Speed: Darn fast!Set up: Ridiculously Easy.Network and Connectivity: Here is where the two stars come to play. Through the Wi-Fi connection it worked above my expectation. When paired through my BB Smartphone 8530 with software version 5.0 it was a mess. The internet connection was very slow and dropped every two minutes and also every time I tried to transfer a file through BB Bridge.  In addition, I manage my life through a personal Synology home server which normally I access smoothly anywhere in the world from my laptop. The BB Browser does not support the Synology application, therefore I could not access it.Business Apps: Very good if the paired connection to my smart phone didn't drop so many times.Size: Perfect.Everything on this tablet is perfect except the very two things I wanted it for Mobility and Remote Data aAccessibility.  Also, there is no way to pair the BB phone via a physical cord.So my bottom line is...if you are going to use this tablet for business...wait until they fix the glitches and lower the price. If you want this tablet to sit at your local coffee shop with a Wi-Fi connection and surf the net,then make a trip whenever you have the time and buy one, I guarantee, you will have an awesome experience and I guarantee there will be plenty waiting for you at the store.

Slider keyboard sucked.I wanted to support Web OS, but sadly I had to return it.Now I have the long nameHP Palm Pre Plus 2phone, but its in the box. Unused.Similarly with theRIM Blackberry Playbook Tablet.Can there be a longer name?Playbook has a great interface, QNX is nice (Been a fan of RTOS for over 20 years), flash is nice. First tablet I found that can watch various streaming web sites like dramafever and dramacrazy.Oddly I could not pay any youtube videos out of the box after enabling wi-fi.then either the firmware update or something, and now it seems to do youtube ok.Battery life is bad. If I haven't used it in a day or two and try to use it, its already dead from being in standby. Its plugged into the wall as I type, waiting for it to charge before cleaning it out and boxing it back to the store.My nook color can be in standby, with the same size screen, and a week later, its still got more than 1/2 batt full and ready to go when I need it.And we all know the legendary battery life of the iPad and A4 processor. The benchmark has been set.The playbook tiny round red and silver power button on the top is also annoying. Too small for my big fingernails. Need to carry around a pen tip.How to fix it?$299 with this current battery, and it may still not succeed, but I would probably keep it. Much better battery life is sorely needed along with a competitive price, especially since they are the underdog, and late to the game behind iOS, and Android.It's going back to the store this week, sad to say. Going the try the Acer 10\" $449 that just came out. See if batt life is better and if flash works on that.I worry that QNX will suffer the same fate as BeOS, Palm, and other great platforms that were acquired.RIM is lost and confused.

However, I have played with it considerably in the form of its software emulator.  I can speak of the hardware itself, since it was emulated by my desktop PC, and I can't speak of the apps themselves, since there were none; but what I was able to see was the web browser and user interface.  In that regards, the Playbook seems well laid out and organized, and it seems easy to use.  Compared to the iPad (which I've used only in the Apple store), there are neat gestures that increases the efficiency of the interface.  It took a while to realize that some actions are activated by gestures, but once you get the hang of it, the tablet becomes very fluid.  It would be nice to have a keyboard that can be reconfigured in terms of size.  It does take up a considerable portion of the screen, but given the intrinsic touchscreen interface and gestures, the keyboard is not going to be of primary concern.  Before I got involved in the developer's program, the Playbook didn't really interest me, but once I got a chance to use the software emulator, I have to admit that I'm looking forward to getting mine in the mail.  Hopefully I will be able to update this review soon, once I get it.UPDATE:  I got my free Playbook.  It is as fluid as I had expect, but having it my hand gives me a better feel on how it handles.  RIM went the 7\" format which both pros and con.  Obviously it make the UI smaller, but that is not necessarily the end all or be all of the design.  The smaller size makes this a very mobile, hand portable platform.  Moreover, the smaller screen size make everything much more smooth and crisp.  Given the landscape layout, rather than thinking of the devise has having a small screen, I think it's more appropriate to think if it as just the upper half of the iPad in portrait mode.The hardware is fast and smooth.  There is no lag, even with multiple apps open at the same time.  And the gestures make moving from app to app smooth and efforts.  The playbook still need some way to scroll, as with a trackpad, but otherwise this is a easy to use device.  My only wish is for a built-in GPS to make this a perfect travel companion.The software does need some tweaking, but this is not fundamental limitations.  Of course, the lack of an native email viewer is noticeable, but this is not a permanent situation and is a very fixable problem.  And, as so many have pointed out, there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, but the number of apps is a false issue.  The real question is on RIMs strategy to attract developers and how does their hardware make app useful.  On the first, as a app developer myself,  my one concern is that RIM has a very awkward process to upload and maintain have apps.  It's no worse than Apple's, but Apple is in a position to maintain their arrogance.  Hopefuly RIM will cleanup their process as they go from \"catch up\" mode to \"polishing\" mode.  However, on the latter question on the hardware, I can say the the hardware and UI is very powerful, much better than that in iOS, and it should enable very, very nice apps.  And given RIM's enterprise level infrastructure, particularly with security, I think this could be a truly powerful business platform.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "The product is not user friendly.", "Author": "Wendy H Wang", "ReviewID": "R1CE3IONMAHB0U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the size.

Not only is blackberry app world lacking in polished applications, but most of what is offered costs 99 cents and up. No skype or any of the popular FREE apps available for android or Apple and NO NETFLIX!!!!!! You can't even watch in the browser because there is no silverlight support. Don't be fooled by the reviews that say \"it now has android support\". This means nothing because you are limited by blackberry's weak application offerings....there is no android market here.I spent $199 for this and it doesn't get much use (my ipad gets used often). Battery life sucks with the playbook (3 hours max) and my tablet arrived with one green stuck pixel which looks lovely on a black background.The browser does play flash well however flash enabled sites often become tiresome to navigate because of the limited screen space and tiny controls. An example of this would be zillow.com. Try pinch, zoom, and scroll without opening advertisements or other content. Unless you have dainty hands it's impossible. Another reason applications are important, so the user can easily control what they are trying to accomplish.This review comes post install of the 2.0 update which has been waited for with bated breath by many and was suppose to \"change everything\" in terms of this tablet's usability (or lack thereof). With the 2.0 update you get a native mail app and buggy \"android support\". Pretty insulting for my $200 dollar investment.The volume (sound volume) rocker on top of the device lags horribly. Push the up or down buttons to change the loudness, and the effect happens 5-6 seconds later, along with a volume slider bar that appears on screen. You either end up turning the volume way too high or way too soft because of this.The OS software on the playbook takes about 3 or 4 minutes to boot up. Quite possibly the longest boot times in mainstream computing history. Reminds me of the old days with windoze 98 on an i386.These are my observations about the device based on my usage, and in comparison to the iPad/iOS and Android powered tablets (of which I also own). Some people seem giddy with excitement about the playbook while others are in my camp of disappointment  (based on review readings here and elsewhere) so your mileage may very based on your level of standards, and whether or not you are a RIM fanboy or employee (the not-so-good reviews for this device are trolled by such people if you look closely)I have no allegiance to any device or company but this thing was clearly rushed to market. Lovely colors, smooth swiping, and 1080p mean nothing if utility is lacking. Software wise it's a joke, an expensive joke on ME. You can decide if the bargain basement price is enough to make the same mistake.If blackberry can fix the battery life and volume control with another update and give me Skype and Netflix for F R E E (don't nickel and dime me with your app world!!!!) then I'll change my review to 4 stars. The hardware has promise, The software as of today (even after the long awaited v2.0) does not.HINT: F R E E GPS software, to take advantage of the unutilized GPS capabilities of the playbook would get 5 stars.
