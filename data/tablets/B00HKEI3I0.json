{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent form factor, and good improvement from previous model", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2RU5FFXA9GYLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my review of non Red version, but it is the same. Red version is even better for those who like the color!There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7\". It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8\". In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I gave 7\" a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10\" also a 4 star because of some strange spec `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\" lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10\" Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 2 model.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 oz. (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.9 oz. (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz. (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 7\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs only 300 gm. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Galaxy Tab 2 is 345 grams, so Tab 3 is lighter by 45 grams.  Processors are similar 1.2 GHz dual core in Tab 3 Vs 1 GHz dual core in Tab 2. Resolutions are same with Tab 2 1024 x 600 pixels (~170 ppi pixel density). Tab 3 supports up to 64 GB whereas Tab2 is 32 GB. Not a big deal unless you have tons of video/photo/ebooks/music you want to carry with you all the time. I use a mixture of on device storage + Google Music + box for my data needs.  Battery is also same between Tab 2 and Tab 3 7\" versions - Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery.Both have Bluetooth 3.0.  I cannot confirm still if Tab 3 7\" supports OTG.  I know for sure Tab 3 8\" supports as I tested it.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. 7\" is equally capable as a 8in for `most' day to day apps. If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos 7\" is more than enough. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I am getting the Pulse device as soon as it hit stores.

There are a number of nags though that make this an unlikeable tablet for me.1. The latest supported android firmware is 4.1.2. At this point, pretty far behind 4.4. Missing two major releases from Google. KitKat still not out (though samsung says it's close).2. No official cyanogenmod port, so you're basically stuck with 3-year old Android software with no 3rd party roms3. In-built SD card is useless because 4.1.2 doesn't let you move apps from internal storage to SD card. So if you're planning on loading it up with lots of large games for the kids, you're limited to 8GB.4, Permanant soft buttons and home button have no lighting whatsoever. Really sucks when you're using the tablet at night.5. USB charging is crippled by default if you connect to an actual computer. You can overcome this by doing the insert-slowly-halfway trick with the usb cable, but seriously, not being able to charge a tablet from a PC? That's BS.6. Lots of crapware preloaded. Some people may like this, but I personally like my tablets clean so I can install what I want, not what Samsung wants.7. I have to agree to a bunch of samsung licensing and EULAs to use the tablet-- kind of BS considering Android is open source software.I bought this tablet because the bezel is small and the form factor is nice, plus it came with the nice little case. But this is crippled compared to my phone because of the limitations, and I regret not having done some more research before I bought it. Should have stuck with the nexus tabs-- they're uglier, but at least they're functional and supported by the dev community...Overall I think I'm going to sell this guy on ebay and buy something else. I'm not hopeful that kitkat will solve many of the issues and it may be years before we get a CM build.

The tech told me that the ability to transfer purchased apps to the memory card is disabled on the version this tab ships with ?????????If I had known this I might have bought something else.Im not really happy with this tab for this fact. I have a sweet (empty) 64gig micro chip and a Tab that has no more memory.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "slow", "Author": "colett", "ReviewID": "R2R57S66WFKVGP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It very slow for me and can get  my bible app on it or my daily words so I am very disappointed for that", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not so nice", "Author": "Jay Williams", "ReviewID": "R3HINSNWIBZZC5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Shipped pretty quick,but device isnt so nice; see my full Review on YouTube Jay-Willy Tech.Feels like a regular tablet.
