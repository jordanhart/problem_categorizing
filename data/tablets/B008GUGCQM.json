{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great alternative to the iPad", "Author": "Ashley F \"Ms. Finny\"", "ReviewID": "R23YVP299CVQLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung tablets are a great, less expensive, alternative to the iPad. We have had this tablet for about a year and use it almost every day. It is so easy to navigate even my children can use it. When it was purchased, my oldest was 5 years old and he needed no instruction before he figured out how to open and use apps. We have a screen set up with the apps he and his younger sister are allowed to use and it works perfectly for us. A good plus is that the Google app store is much larger (and often less expensive) than the iTunes store.The screen size on this is perfect. It makes the keyboard relatively easy to use with both hands, more like a real keyboard rather than typing with one finger at a time like you would on something like your phone. It also makes it easy to see what you're doing with games, websites, pictures, etc., while not being so big that it loses it's portable status.Something to note for those that may not have used a tablet in the past. These are NOT a good replacement for a desktop or a laptop. Many websites don't work quite right on these mobile devices. The pages are going to load more like they do on your phone rather than on a computer. The keyboard also isn't as easy and fast to use as a physical keyboard on a computer. The tablet is made for quick, portable use, and it is perfect for that.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent tablet", "Author": "Rod", "ReviewID": "R29IK0VX7DYDR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The value is totally worth the cost.
