I was actually surprised by it's size as I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it is. The graphics are awesome, video playback is incredible, the sound is good enough, and battery life is impressive. I have installed several apps from the play store and as of yet have no experienced any lag on the device.

The more I read of the specs and reviews, I came to realize this version of the A1000 is behind the curve. I wound up returning it even at AMAZON's lowest pre-Christmas price.First, the AMAZON writeup states no less than 3 times this tablet has a 1.2GHz dual core chip. Other reviews and the box itself state that a slower 1GHz chip is used. Benchmark tests indicate it clocks in at an even slower 800mHz. By comparison, that's about what older Android phones can do.Next, .5GB of RAM is 2012 technology and its not even the faster DDR3 standard. Many under-$100 tablets have 1GB RAM.I've seen the A1000L and these specs contribute to some of the slower response and video issues it has.Also, this A1000L version lacks:-Bluetooth- useable camera- GPS- Dolby speakers like the A1000 (only thru headphones)- HDMIAre there nice features for the price? Yes, namely- Lenovo name, support, forums- long battery life and reliable charging- good sound- little bloatware loaded with Jelly Bean- expansion card slotFor kids and older children, those newer to Android tablets, a solid choice that should be current enough for a year or two. The redesigned A1000 with 1 GB RAM, 1.2GHz chip and 16GB (not offered here) would be better for business and heavier duty personal use, but still falls short of tech specs for Samsung, Hisense, ASUS, Acer, Nexus coming in at $130-170.

I purchased this tablet for work purposes. It is a simple tablet, nothing fancy, but it works great. I use this tablet at work for schematics and operations manuals on the go. I am an industrial electronics technician and I carry this everywhere I go. I pull up all my PDF files in seconds with the office pro app. It has an excellent battery life and a excellent screen that can be viewed nicely in any angle without the image fading. I don't really use it at home but I did test its video capabilities and it does an excellent job. I did have a Lil choppiness when viewing HD movies on it. I would recommend the Lenovo A1000 instead if someone plans on using it for streaming since it has 1 gig of ram for 20 bucks more. I would highly recommend this tablet, It gives you what you pay for and more. Keep in mind that this does not have a rear camera, the front camera is terrible, and it does not have Bluetooth. I have seen some bad reviews because of these 3 flaws I noted, but come on it's a 100 dollar tablet. From a reliable company.
