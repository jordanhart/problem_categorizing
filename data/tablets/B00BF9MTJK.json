{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good for the money Honestly", "Author": "TyeDye", "ReviewID": "R17UD5WCK132EG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I purchased two from Amazon and mine stopped picking up wifi connections two or three weeks after using. It was not my router because my other devices were picking up my signal and others nearby. I attempted to return to D2 Pad Company but they have a procedure where you call in to limited tech support. Which leaves you creating a ticket online to pay to ship the faulty device to them VS AMAZONS free pick up via fed ex and replacement. I went with Amazons wonderful solution to my problem. The Day after I called fed ex came for the device. About five days later I had my replacement via USPS. I wanted the replacement and not my $100 and change back because the device is fine flaws and all. Its 9 inch screen is just right for me. The App MeeGenius and its pre loaded  childrens books which was the selling point for me is awesome.  I like the App Soundhound that allows you to find the title or artist to songs by singing it yourself or playing it pre installed. I like that when online I can go to top upright menu/settings to change Browser mode to Desktop instead of the Android mode it is on as default. These are pros to me. I read it didnt come with Google Play and so I use the One Mobile Market not a big deal or difference at all to me. I read it didnt have even a 1.0 mp camera. Well, with lighting on in the background the camera is does the job whenever I use it. I havent re tried Netflix since using desktop mode. But prior to it wouldnt play. It does play youtube videos with no poblem. And if it doesnt it must have something to do with your router or the device  . My relative whom has the one from the beginning has not encountered any problems what so ever. Ive played with the settings to make it my own. Brightness and ponter speed adjustments. Only issue is the lag you get when typing or touching to navigate way too often. But I look at the pros which is that it does the job never the less. Very clear resolution, lightweight, rubber back, streams videos and loads multiple pages. Thanks to the 4.1 os this cheapie is a keeper. Im satisfied and hope this review helped some. Im not into brands just good deals that benefit me. This was one. I suggest anyone who buys explore the settings of the device before assuming the worst.

I ordered it the same day I saw it advertised. I wished I had gone online and read the reviews first. I was very disappointed with the camera which is one thing that is important to me on any tablet. The pictures are horrible so I dont use the camera. Everything else works fine.  I havent had any problems so far and I have had it for about 5 months and I use it everyday.  My grandkids love it for the games. I have downloaded alot of stuff from playstore no problem. I bought a memory card. It doesnt take long to use up the battery but thats ok I got the charger. I wont be purchasing another one of these for myself but I would get it for the little ones. I'm looking at the galaxy now. I wouldnt recommend the D2 if you gonna use it for more than just email and games. I need a tablet to be my everything.  But the D2 tablet still is not bad for the price I paid. The only reason I didnt give it a 4 was because of the camera. I would recommend it for someone that doesnt do a lot with a tablet.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for the on the go type person who need a pc but not a laptop.", "Author": "Esther B.

I found it in D2 9\" quad core tablet that I purchased from ShopHQ for $120. Yes, I have 6 months to pay it. I must say, that it's fast and I'm loving it. My purchase came with a free 4400mAh battery and also a keyboard/case/stand combination. I looked up an old version of D2 single core that is sold at Walmart for $99. I figured that the bundle I received was an excellent value.I'm a very responsible adult; so I won't be dropping the tablet at anytime in the future. This is worth the price for letting me watch and learn from Khan Academy. Even if that's all it would do, it would be worth $120 to me; but it does so many things! The voice search is icing on cake...and $20/month for 6 months? That's like giving up 2 movie tickets a month.Update: (sorry, this is late): I loved the D2 tablet but it froze just 2 days before the 30-day return policy ended. There was an update I needed to do, which I didn't care and didn't have time for. Someone told me to take my ipad to any Apple store to have it fixed.

The touch screen is not responsive.  To swipe down for example, takes at least two tries.  Keyboard entry is enough to cause a aneurysm.

The camera leaves a lot to be desired because it is controlled from the front and the lens is in the front.

So far I have found every app I have looked for and when downloaded they work fine, except...... And there is always an exception!!! I downloaded the SWYPE keyboard and when I went to open it a very useful warning popped up. It told me that if I were to use that app it would access ALL info on my tablet INCLUDING any credit card info I had previously used.
