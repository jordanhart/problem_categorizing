{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Tablet for Children", "Author": "NSB", "ReviewID": "R2J6OMRETQRH25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok. We bought this tablet for our daughter for Christmas. She always plays with my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket so this will be a nice device for her so I can have my phone back. LOLHere is our review of the Ematic Funtab (Purple/Pink):1) This is NOT an iPad or high priced tablet. This tablet is perfect for the age demographic (youth).2) You MUST set-up the wifi before you can do anything. If you already operate an Android you should have no problem setting up the wifi.3) The screen isn't as sensitive to touch and often times when typing the letters/numbers I touched it didn't exactly respond to the selection I was touching and I had to touch it again.4) The wifi connection did drop once but has since not happened again.5) The Zoodles app works perfectly along with all the other pre-installed apps.Lastly, Google Play Store is NOT pre-installed on the tablet. Which is a fail, however, there is a workaround. You will have to download the app via connection to your laptop/desktop.Amazon Appstore, however, can be downloaded directly to the tablet and has the same apps as Google Play Store with a plus of the \"Free App\" of the day feature.Overall, my husband and I so far love this tablet (especially compared to the Nook Color we also got her but returned once we go the Ematic Funtab) for her. It's perfect for her age, 6.5 yrs, but still has the functionality, feel and operating system of the expensive tablets.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap tablet ~ dishonest customer service - REFURBS sold as new", "Author": "Linda Knapik \"internet shopaholic\"", "ReviewID": "RJUVY2EY036TV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my grandson.  3 weeks later it stops charging.  I contacted Amazon and was told it was a \"3rd party\" sale.  Ok, so I contacted the seller and after spending $14 in shipping to return the defective tablet, received a replacement 2 weeks later.  This replacement tablet would not charge at all.  It would only turn on if it was plugged in at the same time you turned it on.  It is at this point I realize there are pictures of other people on the tablet and it has another child's name on the screen that it had been setup for.  I assume this \"refurb\" was just a defective model that \"Jake's\" parents had already sent back and was reshipped to me as my replacement.  I again contact customer service at ACTION GEAR and he tells me that he will personally check the next one that goes out after I return the 2nd defective model.  Again I spend another $14 to ship this item to ACTION GEAR and wait 2 weeks to get a replacement - I eagerly open the box to charge it up and a piece of plastic falls to the floor when I take it out of the box.  Yup, it's the on/off button.  I give up, I'm not spending another $14 to ship this crap back to the same crook that sends out this garbage in the first place.I paid $99 for a product described as new and every one of these tablets came with some other families pictures on it.

Vrs Nabi 2 Vrs Coby Kyros", "Author": "Attezor", "ReviewID": "R2NTZNMWGC7Z86", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "EMATIC FUNTABI bought this tablet for my 2 year old daughter. I set it up prior to giving it to her. It was fairly simple. Switching screens from kid mode to mommy mode is a little confusing at first. I found myself \" lost \" a few times. The preloaded apps are nice, and it was fairly simple to put everything else I wanted on it. Which wasn't much, considering the age of my daughter.  The tablet is fast, but dropped wifi a few times. Over all I didn't have any problems with it.It doesn't come with a case, but it has grips on either side that are a nice addition.Kid safe? Nope. Screen broke in a couple of weeks. The glass and the LCD both shattered. The glass and the LCD broke from a 1 1/2 foot drop onto plush carpet. The point of impact was the upper right hand corner, it shattered clear across the screen.I didn't buy this tablet from amazon, and the place I bought it from didn't fulfill the warranty. This isn't the tablets fault obviously, but beware of that if you buy it some place else.  I emailed ematic (3 times) to see if they could fix it for a charge, or if it was covered by some sort of manufactures warranty. It's been a few months and I'm still waiting for a response. Talking to a local shop that repairs screens, they quoted 95$. I paid $50.00 for this tablet the day after thanksgiving.The price of this tablet is great. I'm not sure why the blue is so much more than the pink though.Other than the broken screen, which happens, this is a nice tablet for a child.*******************************************************Nabi 2I bought this tablet (nabi 2) for my 3 year old son. I set it up prior to giving it to him. Set up was easy, \" mommy mode \" is brilliant. The tablet is fast and reliable. I had zero problems with movies and apps. I was able to upload every app I wanted too and make it \" perfect \" in a few hours.One thing I didn't like was that some apps can't be removed from the child screen, and they need to be purchased to play past the trial. The child can't accidental buy anything, but it caused a couple of head aches.The case is thick and easy to grip. We received the alphabet pack as a free gift when we ordered it. Those are also great, my son really enjoyed them.***Kid safe? Not a chance. The screen was broke with in a week. The glass and the LCD broke when my son was playing with the preloaded drum set app. He was hitting the screen with his fingers, having a crazy amount of fun... until it broke. He wasn't hitting it very hard, but apparently hard enough. Nabi will replace the screen for around $80.00, if you don't have a warranty to cover the cost.I read rave reviews for this tablet before I purchased it, perhaps ours was just unlucky.***********************************************************My children are obviously young, they are just starting out with electronics. They were supervised while playing with both the Nabi and funtab. There was no abuse, or rough play with them. They didn't have them long enough for rough play. They broke from pure accidents. An older child might not have the same issues we had with the screens at all.I waited for my son to get a little older and gave him my old Coby Kyros 9.7 inch to play with. It's been six months and the screen is still intact. It was fairly easy to child proof. We don't have a problem with him clicking adds, going to any website let alone an inappropriate one, or buying anything. I simply blocked the Wifi and browsers. He hasn't found his way into the settings or anything like that. (yet) Its far to slow for me, but to use it for the things my son likes to do ( movies, learning apps, low graphic games) it's pretty great.Over all, no tablet is kid safe. No magic screen that won't break. Both kid tablets had in app purchases I couldn't hide. Even if the screens didn't break on the first two tablets, I didn't find anything so special about \"mommy mode\" to pay the extra money for it.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Sanchia", "ReviewID": "R33KSIQ4B1HBGX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When my daughter first got she loved it.

It worked for a week.  After a week, the charger would no longer plug in, it was just loose in the hole.  So, I went on their website to contact their customer service.  I couldn't find a phone number, so I clicked on the \"Contact Support\" tab.  I filled out the form, and submitted my info.  After submission, it said I would be contacted in 1 business day.  Nothing.  After a week, I contacted them again.  Nothing.  So, yesterday, I went back to the website, found another support tab and emailed again about my 2 previous attempts at contact and asked for at least some kind of answer as to why I hadn't heard anything.  I get an email this morning with the most nasty tone I've ever read.  I was told that I should pay more attention to what I click on and read and fill out because my requests were just ignored because I was filling out the \"business\" forms.  Nowhere on the forms did it say \"business\" or \"commercial\".  Needless to say, this company will never get my business again, and my child will get another tablet.

Why? It's very frustrating to use, contains very poorly designed applications that are buggy, and mediocre touch screen/response.APPSThe ones included are extremely buggy. They either:- freeze up- don't respond to touch at all 90% of the time- require several touches to respond- touch response lag is very unacceptable. Some apps are sensitive to touch while others may require your child to hold down a bit and then let go. This is confusing as you move from app to app.- have bad, poorly designed interfaces. The navigation menu and buttons are either very tiny or very cramped together. So, my child or myself, always end up accidentally touching buttons that we didn't intend to press.- are hard to see. Many of the games are not crisp or clear.The ones that are not included, well, you have to dish out MORE money. $59.95 a year.- I wouldn't know because I refuse to pay Zoodles $59.95/year.- the apps that are included don't work correctly, at all, so why would I foolishly dish out more money. I would hate to find out that my son would continue to have a frustrating experience for apps that don't work.TABLET- The tablet itself appears to be durable but the screen blacked out on us once. We put the tablet aside for a while and my son decided to try it again.- Startup is extremely slow. Sometimes you think it froze but it's actually still loading.- Sometimes, the tablet does freeze up at the Android Ice Cream Sandwich screen.- The plug for the DC power doesn't seem very durable. It doesn't insert all the way into the table.CUSTOMER SERVICEHard to find and then turned out to be non-existent.This tablet had the concept I was looking for but failed miserably in graphical user interface design.

Supposed to be durable enough for children but im still looking for a case i've got a 6 and 7 yr old they are pretty good at handling my galaxy tablets but why chance it !after more use i will post a more detailed review but so far so good ! screen response i give a 6 on 1-10 but the children wont mind at all . apps i give an 8 . looks i give a 10.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Easy to Use!", "Author": "Chuck Erickson", "ReviewID": "R26AUCKZO1HMWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son was trying to play games on my tablet, but the process was hard for him to understand, the Ice Cream Sandwich processer makes it so simple for kids to learn and play...awesome product...and it's durable!", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!!", "Author": "Cheyenne", "ReviewID": "REML7S5L3E5VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the perfect tablet for children.

My son has dropped it once (right off the bat... go figure) and it sustained no damage. Of course, I warned him not to drop it again... I think we just got really lucky the first time.

Can't install Google play or Amazon app-store and actually get them to work properly. Bought a $79 zeepad for my younger child and it worked better then this tablet for my older child. I see Asus has a memo 7\" pad for 50 bucks more and I am sure it works better then this junk. For $100 I would have expected better performance. Anyone who settles on this tablet for their child is either cheap or has no clue about decent touch response and functionality. I'm pretty tech savvy and this tablet is not worth $50 bucks imo.

The first I ordered from a different sales outlet(Rakuten), but it was sent by the same vendor.(Altatec) The problem I have is that both of these items were sold as brand new, but in both instances the item came in an unsealed package, and the first one had someone's name written on the box and it was obvious that the ear buds had been used, but at least there was some documentation included in the box.  The second one that I ordered from amazon was also in an unsealed box, no writing on this one but there wasn't a single piece of paper in the box, no quick start guide....nothing.  I must say I was refunded my original purchase price on the first one with no hassle and probably would be able to do the same with the second one but I bought it for a birthday present for my grandson and due to the slow shipping I was already giving it to him late.  I ordered the second one from amazon thinking I would get faster shipping and since it was $15.00  more than the first one I expected it to be brand new with all contents included in a sealed package.  Little did I know that it was coming from the same vendor and I could have ordered it directly from them on their ebay store for a much cheaper price.  The product itself seems to be ok, my grandson is enjoying it so far, it would be better if it would allow you to use the google app store.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product for kids", "Author": "Stacy Gause", "ReviewID": "R1A1XYZUUBI5XH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Ematic Funtab through a large chain retailer at a much cheaper price than on amazon, even though it was not on sell.

Comes with LOTS of games and books. My children love the video mail feature. My 8 year old son did drop his and broke the screen. And it was no longer usable, so that is one down fall. Ematic will replace the screen but after all is said and done it is cheaper to purchase a new one.
