{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad device for the money", "Author": "Neal Kite", "ReviewID": "R31XXRY49674Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Its a $60 Android tablet\" so my expectations were low to start.Its mission to give to my 2 year old to play movies and some kids games. This tablet feels like an oversize Android phone. Its very light and the plastic seems very cheap. It comes out of the box with just a basic load of Android 4.1.1 no bloatware (which is good) but I needed to load Google Services in order to set up my Google account. The tablet does have full access to the Google Play store and I have not found any app that isn't compatible yet. The charger is not a USB charger so it requires a different charging plug. However it only uses 5 volts and that is what the USBs put out, so if someone is handy they could make a cable adapter to use a USB charger. Overall I have been pretty surprised on how well this thing works. The speed of the tablet is faster than my Acer A100. The true test will see how long it lasts with the 2 year old; but for $60 its cheaper than a DVD player with more capabilities.Pro:1. Screen resolution seems pretty decent, and it is very responsive.2. No noticeable lag moving between screens.3. Minimal load of Android means more free space for apps. I have about 6 gig free space.4. HDMI output and cables are included5. SD card supported6. Cheaper than a kids tabletCons: 1. No Blue Tooth (knew this when I purchased)2. No GPS (knew this when I purchased)3. No rugged case made for it. (will have get something close and modify as needed)4. Battery life about 4 - 5 hours. \"", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Love It!", "Author": "Catherine H.

There are 3different accessory cords for the outlets, including TV, PC and for charging. It also has an easy to understand instruction book. The things I like the most about it are1. It is easy to navigate.2. It has Wi-Fi to surf the internet.3. It has a Webcam to Skype with my friends.4. There are many apps to download to play games or read books.5. It has a camera and plays videos.6. There is a port for a mini SD card to add more storage.7. The color is super.8. It is small enough to fit in your purse or coat jacket as well as being easy for children to hold.Just remember this is not an iPad.

My galaxy tab didnt even come with an HDMI cord. So if you want to watch netflix on the big screen your all set.The camera quality is low, which sucks but since I take photos with my phone or digital camera i dont really mind.(it does have front and rear camera),doesnt have bluetooth. Also, the resolution quality isnt HD quality but you can see videos and pictures really good. if your looking for a super high tech tablet like an ipad it may not be for you.however if you need something on the go like for school or keep your kids occupied for an affordable price this is great. and its an android JellyBean!Big tip: download Go Launcher EX and Go Keyboard app(for any android device) to personalize the theme of your android.get rid of those plain default looks of icons,font styles and backgrounds.this app will TOTAL change the way your Noria tablet looks!free apps too!", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost as expected", "Author": "J. Davis \"jzjdavis\"", "ReviewID": "R174YWUN8ZGGJN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just bought 3 of these for kids' Christmas presents.  I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive the screen was, especially for this price ($70).  The processing speed is also surprisingly good.  The screen is not viewable from any angle, but again, they were purchased for individual use for kids, so no complaints that way.  Two things I noted that were important to me as a user.  First, there is no access to the normal Amazon app via the Google Play store on this device.  This is the case on all 3 of the devices I ordered.  And, amazon.com is incompatible with this device, as it reads.  That was disappointing as an Amazon Prime member.  Second, I use the Xfinity Go app for my kids to watch TV/Movies as it's free for subscribers.  This app works in almost every way, but there is no sound whatsoever with any part of that app.  Again, this is the same on all 3 devices, so it's clearly an operating system issue.  Pandora works, Hulu works, the stock video app on the device works, most of the kid's games and apps seem to work.  So, again, overall for the price and what it was intended to do, it's worth what we paid.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Nice Tablet", "Author": "sehelfer", "ReviewID": "R3J5OXN7U47SKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a first tablet for a teenager.

It is easy to use with a large clear display which makes reading and writing much more comfortable than using your phone for the same projects. It is also great for Skype calls and watching Netflix or other movies or TV programs. The video quality is good and the audio quality good enough and fine when you attach head phones or speakers.The drawbacks are these: The processor is abysmally slow. Touch the Google or Kindle apps for example and then you can go a brew a pot of tea before either is loaded and ready for use. I find it very frustrating to touch a field and NOT get an I bar OR conversely you get an I bar which does not respond to the keyboard for several minutes. Also the battery has a very short life. I use this primarily for reading and after an hour or so it tells me to attach the power cordIf I had it to do again I would probably buy an iPad Mini or a Kindle Fire in the first place. Certainly if you plan to use your tablet for work get a fast one and avoid embarrassment before an impatient employer. You will not save any money buying one of these cheap tablets. You will simply use it find it useful but frustrating and buy the more expensive one after a month or so.

It says there is only a 30 day return policy which of course it's now been 90 days. I would expect at least a year when cared for. The glass is extremely fragile even with a cover. A very short drop of 20 inches onto carpet,  plus a rubber mat over the carpet shattered the screen. That makes little sense. We have all dropped our smart phone at least once and that issue doesn't seems to create a serious problem. This tablet simply fell off the lap onto car floor and it seems it couldn't be possible it broke like this. Either I received an inferior product or this brand isn't like I thought it should be for $77.  It was a Christmas gift and I'm very disappointed. When I inquire information I'm told no deal.
