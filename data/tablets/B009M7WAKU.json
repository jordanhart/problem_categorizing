The tablet comes pre-loaded with some apps, yes, but they are all \"lite\" versions and many just didn't work at all. The camera didn't work at all, and I only got error messages when I tried to access the lullabies and other games. So you have to purchase additional curriculum packs, which are expensive, and in my case Vinci doesn't ship the plug-in cards to LOS ANGELES, CA (What???) so I would have had to purchase online and download the curriculum packs to the tablet, without knowing whether my child would appreciate them, and no way to return them if she didn't. This was a complete and total nightmare all around, and the capper was that it cost me nearly $30 to ship the thing back to the seller. Never again with Vinci.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vinci Learning Tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R119Y7E7QF5JPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My granddaughter loves this learning tablet.
