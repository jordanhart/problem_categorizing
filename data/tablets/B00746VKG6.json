{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Predictably Remarkable. The best tablet in its 10\" class.", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R3IQD3SQXBM5AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to secure the new iPad at our local Apple store, but I also got to spend some time with a review model beforehand. In any case, I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share my experience from my past two years of iPad ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet had an iPad to call their own. I'll also reveal a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps and games for free, in hopes of making this the most helpful iPad review on Amazon!For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets: http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8My review tends to run long, so I've organized information by section, with headings, to make it more helpful for those just looking for specific info. For example, see the heading \"Downloading Apps and Games\" for the info on obtaining free apps and games!First, let's quickly cover what's new, and what each means for you:+ Retina Display - twice the resolution of the iPad 2, at 2048 x 1536 pixels (264px/in)+ 5 megapixel rear-facing camera - take photos with over 8x higher resolution and quality than the iPad 2 (but still no flash)+ Dual-core 1GHz A5X processor with quad-core graphics - better multitasking and flawless high-res graphics performance+ 4G LTE capable - faster mobile connections on AT&T; and Verizon when in 4G-LTE-covered network areaIf you're considering the now-cheaper iPad 2, here's a quick recap of what was new last year:+ Dual-core 1GHz A5 Processor - better multitasking, 9-times faster graphics+ 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures+ Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through with Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately)+ Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos+ Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)+ Verizon 3G model now available - no longer limited to just AT&T; for the WiFi+3G model+ Thinner, lighter and smoother with contoured back - feels more comfortable in your handsThe iPad 2 brought a lot more new features to the iPad lineup, but the 3rd generation iPad still brings us some welcome new features. First, it sports the new A5X processor. Don't be confused though, it's not really that much better than the iPad 2's, and it's not technically a quad-core processor. The CPU itself remains dual-core, but the graphics processor built-into the CPU chip can compute 4 streams of graphics information, thus making the graphics aspect of the A5X processor quad-core. It's confusing, I know. To be honest, there was no noticeable improvement in performance over the iPad 2, except maybe behind the scenes where it handles 4x more pixels. In general, everything on the new iPad runs just as smooth as it always has, which is as to be expected from Apple! But I imagine the new processor has particularly been used to speed up image processing for the new 5 megapixel camera, making photography just about as snappy as it is on the iPhone 4S, which I own as well. 4G support was also a nice surprise that had been rumored.On the other hand, other rumors didn't exactly pan-out, including an SD card slot for photos and file storage, nor the possibility of a smaller, more manageable 7\" iPad model, but I'm still holding out hope for one in the future (UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, and you can now read my review of it too: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8). Thankfully, the price stays the same for these new models, but that is as to be expected. As a boon for those who don't really plan to use the new high-res camera nor need the Retina display or 4G speed, the iPad 2 is going to stick around for a while longer, with a new lower price for those in the market!===== My Background =====I'm a website and mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for iOS devices, including the iPad. I also develop websites, so I like to ensure that those sites look and perform well on the device too, since it's continually growing in popularity for surfing the Web with over the past two years. I've spent lots of time with both the iPad and various Android-based tablets, and I have to be honest... apps are what make the iPad (and other iDevices) so great. Android tablets have the benefit of price and size, but Android apps available for tablets are terribly mediocre! They're also not as responsive as the iPad, at least not after you load them up with apps, games and other junk.I'm no Apple fanboy, but I can recognize quality hardware and software when I see it, and as far as 10\" tablets are concerned, the new iPad simply can't be beat, but that's mostly due to Apple's knack for high-end hardware, plus the ridiculously huge following of quality app developers that Apple can boast about. With over 200,000 apps just for the iPad alone, there's more than enough to keep you busy!===== First Impression =====Unboxing any new device certainly has its appeal, but the iPad has an allure all its own, and the new model is just as touch-worthy as its older siblings, especially when it's fresh out of the box and accompanied by that scent synonymous with new electronics. But when you turn it on for the first time it becomes clear: there's something different about this new model, especially if you've been using the iPad 2 for a while. There's a rich, vibrant crispness to the image that wasn't there before. It's almost like the screen isn't there at all, as if the silky-smooth graphics are just floating there.===== Interaction Experience =====Thanks to the powerful processor, animations and transitions remain smooth on the new iPad, even on a Retina screen with 4-times more pixels! Plus, text on the new model is crisper than ever, even in apps that haven't been retweeked for the new Retina display. Meanwhile, where the iPad really shines is with its continuation of a phenomenal multi-touch interface that is second to none, seriously. Android tablets and other devices may tout \"multi-touch\" support, but usually this just means they support 2-finger gestures like pinch-style zooming. The iPad touch-screen, on the other hand, supports up to ten simultaneous touches. Nothing new here, but still worth mentioning, especially for tablet newcomers. So if an iPad app ever needs to support that many touches, the iPad is ready. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.===== So What Can the iPad Actually Do? =====Naturally, there are things you can do with the iPad right out of the box. You can browse the Web with Safari, set up your email, download your photos and videos to your iPad via iTunes, as well as shoot new photos and videos using either of the two built in cameras. You can also surf YouTube and watch your favorite videos via Apple's built-in YouTube app. There's also an iPod built in, so you can listen to your favorite tunes via the Music app, or download new music via the iTunes app. Another popular iPad app is iBooks, which lets you download and read e-books on your iPad. You can also jot notes, manage your calendar and contacts. You can even chat with other Apple-device users via FaceTime (over WiFi only). Of course, the fun and usefulness of the iPad doesn't stop there. The App Store app is your portal to unending games and utilities. One thing Apple has been really good at is showing off just what you can do with the iPad. App developers have undoubtedly been busy creating unique experiences through their iPad apps, most of which have yet to be rivaled by (or ported to) Android and other tablets.You can also download two additional Apple-made apps: iBooks, which lets you download and read ebooks easily on your device, and iWork, Apple's office-document editing suite, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages (for editing word processing documents), Numbers (for editing spreadsheets) and Keynote (for editing PowerPoint-like slideshows); Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well, but I'll explain a few typing techniques below. Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Downloading Apps and Games =====Downloading apps on your iPad couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a password and credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want from the App Store, tap the button at the top with the app's price, then tap again to confirm. Enter your password (once per session), and voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple charges your card for the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new app. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!Now for the juicy money-saving secrets of the App Store! With the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. You see, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during these often extremely-limited-time promotions.There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPad itself. I prefer to use an app called \"AppShopper\" that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. You can filter just iPad apps, or show iPhone apps as well, and you can also filter just the free products or just the sale apps. But so many apps go on sale, making it hard to cut through the clutter, which is where AppShopper truly shines: the \"popular\" tab shows only the most popularly downloaded sale apps. If several other people aren't downloading an app, you won't see it listed there! AppShopper is a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me tons of apps FREE! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps. You can even create an account and track the apps you own, so you don't end up trying to redownload them if they go on sale again! It also supports watch lists (via your account) with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a real thing of beauty! There are other apps such as AppZappPush, AppSniper, AppAdvice, Apps Gone Free, and more, but none of them leverage the power of the masses to help you filter out the unwanted apps. Feel free to check them out if you like, though!===== Typing on the iPad =====Typing on the iPad can be annoying at times, but I mostly chalk that up to it being 10-inches. Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, with the added potential that you'll be using it to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First, realize that the iPad's no laptop--you won't be speed-typing, so it may not be conducive for heavy usage like typing lengthy emails or blogging, let alone writing this review. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1: ThumbsThe most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. In portrait mode: grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Using your thumbs, hunt & peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content. Alternately, thanks to iOS 5, thumb-typing in landscape mode has now become painless. Normally, the keyboard is still docked to the bottom of the screen, and can be hard to reach the center of the keyboard with thumbs. However, if you press and hold the show/hide button on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. You can then choose to split the keyboard, with makes it easier for your thumbs to reach all keys, when the iPad is in landscape mode. You can also choose to undock the keyboard, which centers it vertically on the screen, instead of at the bottom.Typing Method #2: Full FingersI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. I find it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method. Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Typing Method #3: Speech to TextNow, Apple has brought us an even more convenient way to type, thanks to Siri! Just hit the microphone icon on the lower-left side of the keyboard, and start speaking. In most cases, your words will be transcribed into the currently active text field, with potentially mis-interpreted words underlined in blue. Just select any such word, and a list of possible alternates will pop up for your choosing. You can also speak most punctuation, such as 'period', 'open-paren', 'close-paren', 'hyphen' and more. At times though, network congestion does hinder the ability for this feature to work properly, so hopefully that will improve over time.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the external keyboard, as well as third party speech-to-text transcription apps, but with Siri's voice transcription feature built in, the latter is no longer necessary.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, but content on the Web is often best viewed vertically, and the new Retina display's 2048x1536 resolution renders that content more crisply than ever, especially in portrait orientation (vertical). Working within the Safari Web-browsing app, the interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple closed-mindedly refuses to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). However, regardless of whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons, but they don't seem to care anyway. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others though. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in some cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities. Alternately, you can jailbreak your iPad (when a jailbreak is released for the new model), which would allow you to circumvent the Flash limitation.Granted, I don't often actually find myself surfing the web with the iPad for a few reasons. First of all, I prefer the display to be parallel with my face, but for the iPad that means craning my neck downwards and after a while that gets tiring. I also tend to do a lot of typing on the sites I use, and typing a lot on the iPad isn't really an enjoyable experience. There are however some keyboard alternatives if you decide that on-screen typing isn't for you. I just find it easier to work from a laptop when I'm on the go, and the 11\" MacBook Air fits that bill simply enough for me. Finally, when I browse the Web (on my computer), I typically have more than 9 tabs open at any given time. I say that because the iPad's browser limits you to 9 tabs. If you rarely use more than 9 tabs when browsing the Web though, the iPad may be right for you.===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine, albeit with black bars. Some may not like that though, but I don't see a wide-screen iPad coming to market for a while.The Netflix and Hulu+ apps are great for members of those online video streaming services. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video. For those who want to watch live TV, I also recommend getting yourself a Slingbox and snagging the SlingPlayer app to stream live TV to your iPad. I do that, and it works quite well!===== Photography and Video =====The new iPad brings a phenomenal new high-quality 5MP camera to market that picks up where the iPad 2's half-megapixel camera left off. 5 lenses inside the aperture, and the more powerful processor, combine to create the sharpest iPad image yet. Even low-light pictures are better than ever, though there's still room for improvement there. There's also a new iPhoto app from Apple (for five bucks) that lets you organize, edit and share your photos right on the iPad!As if that's not enough, there's built-in Picture Frame mode that lets you use the iPad's gorgeous Retina display to showcase your favorite photos, using clever transition effects like \"Dissolve\" with \"Zoom in on Faces\", or the nifty multi-photo \"Origami\" effect. In this review's comments, I'll include a helpful link to an article that shows you how to set up and use this mode.Plus, you can now record full-HD (1080p) videos, instead of just the previous 720p videos. Though I must warn you, in you plan to shoot a lot of video with the iPad (or even the iPhone 4S), you'll want to go with a 32GB or 64GB model! These incredibly high-quality videos take up an incredibly large amount of storage space!===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths because of its one-app-seen-at-a-time multitasking approach.In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and they're naturally located under the category titled \"productivity\" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still see the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, the iPhone and iPad changed the game on that. Millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games. Most Android games look terrible on tablet-sized screens, but iPad game developers have taken care of us with good quality iPad versions of most iPhone games. Board games and lap-friendly games are also perfect for the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on device-rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Printing =====Printing with the iPad is really hit-or-miss. The ability to print documents right from your iPad came along last year, with the iOS 4 update, but there are some caveats. Your printer must support \"AirPrint\" or, if yours doesn't, you might have some success working with some software called Printopia (if you have a Mac with a shared printer). Google AirPrint or Printopia for more info and device compatibility. From there, printing is easy. The iPad will walk you through the process of locating the printer and setting up the printing options the first time around. For more information about printing with your iPad, I'll linked to some informative off-site pages in the first comment for this review.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Praise =====+ Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around. Android doesn't even come close+ The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPad as well as the iPhone and iPod touch+ High performance 1GHz A5X processor - provides performance power for cutting-edge gaming and multitasking+ Multitasks like a dream with iOS 5 and the powerful dual-core central processor+ Rear camera - 5 megapixel photography goodness, plus it can do 1080p HD video (up from 720p)+ 4G LTE option - It's clearly the next big thing for improving connection speed when away from WiFi===== Dissappointments =====+ The 10\" model is not very portable, it's often just too bulky and heavy to tote around or hold up for long durations\u00bb UPDATE: a 7.9\" iPad Mini has now been released, see my in-depth review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8+ No true GPS - IP-based location just doesn't cut it, and GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use like assisted (cellular) GPS does+ No 128GB model - would have been useful for high-res videos that look great on the Retina display, or hold more of those huge 1080p videos+ No USB or SD card slot - for storage expansion, or more importantly, importing pics from your external camera to the new iPhoto app+ Front facing camera - great for FaceTime communication, but it only works over WiFi, Apple isn't even letting it work over 4G!===== The Bottom Line =====If you already have an iPad 2, perhaps there isn't enough new to warrant purchasing the new model, unless you really want the Retina display. If you have the original iPad, it's probably worth getting though, seeing all the new additions that have carried over from the iPad 2.Overall, the iPad still sets the pace for most other tablets in its 10\" class, but I personally find all 10\" tablets to be a bit bulky and somewhat unwieldy. Particularly, I find it awkward to use the iPad where I want to use it most: lying in bed, or sitting on the couch with it in my lap. On the couch, where a laptop is comfortable resting on your lap, with the screen parallel to your face, whereas the iPad needs to be angled up, and your head angled downward. This can be tiring after a while. In bed, it's just too heavy and bulky, and I've dropped the thing square on my face several times.The solution? I started bugging Apple for a 7\" model since the iPad was first released in 2010. Jobs said no, but, with all due respect, he's no longer calling the shots. UPDATE: Thankfully, Tim Cook saw the light and cooked up the iPad mini! The iPad mini is on par with other 7\" tablets in size, but uses screen real estate more efficiently and thus sports a screen that's closer to 8\" than 7\". If 10\" is comfortable for you, then the 3rd-gen iPad is definitely worth 5 stars. Personally though, I've found the iPad mini more to my liking. I've posted a more in-depth review of the iPad mini: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KRNCDSS963I?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8 so feel free to browse on over to it and have a read. Some content from this review applies to the other, and vice versa, but there are plenty of differences.In all honesty, the iPad really is the best 10\" tablet around, and I would give no other tablet more than 3 stars. I'll continue to keep mine around simply because it does have it's uses, especially for Web and app development, and when not in use, it still makes a great digital picture frame with the aforementioned Picture Frame mode! (See the Photography and Video section)However, for reading, surfing and all other entertainment and gaming uses, I've now transitioned over to using the iPad mini most of the time.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. Feel free to keep the discussion going via the comments! :)", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but ...", "Author": "Bookenz", "ReviewID": "R2Z4YKL3AP05RB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a big iPad fan and was waiting anxiously for the third generation to come out.  I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded.  I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2.  So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one.  Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was.  I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot.  I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side  by side.  I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard.  I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue.  Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm.  Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it.  This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book.  My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot.  I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2.  They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem.  He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me.  But I'm certainly no expert.  I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again.  For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad.  These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both.  Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.Update January 7, 2014 - since writing this review for the iPad 3, which I ended up returning, I've moved on to the iPad Air, which is noticeably lighter and faster than the iPad 2.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead?", "Author": "Ron Cronovich \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R1CZFLUXXQIC7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10\" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are \"post-paid\" and \"pre-paid.\"  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can \"suspend\" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perspective from an Android and Windows User", "Author": "J. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RUYOPTD4UA08T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I realize I must have been living under a rock for the past few years since I've never owned an Apple product.  I've been using PCs since I was a kid in the early 90s and Android on my smartphone for three years (Blackberry before that).  So it was not an easy decision for me to take the plunge on the New iPad.  Below are my findings thus far, some of which I knew before buying and some that I've learned since.  I won't spend time reviewing technical details or comparisons to the iPad 2.  There are dozens of professional reviews out there that have done as much.  Instead, this is my perspective in using the iPad after so many years with non iOS products.Positives:+ Beautiful design, form, fit, etc.  Always seems to be the case for Apple products (sometimes to the point of diminished functionality as noted below)+ Best screen.  I've always worked with large, high resolution monitors (current is 1440 27\").  This screen is gorgeous as everyone has called out.+ Best battery life at 10 or so hours; I've only had it 6 days but nothing leads me to believe 10 hours is overstated+ Best selection of tablet-specific apps.  There's really no comparison here and it will likely take years for Android and eventually Win 8 to catch up+ Tons of 3rd party products such as cases in every possible style+ Easy to use content via iTunes+ Compared to laptop, instant on and long battery life are ideal for videos and entertainment on the go, quick surfing, etc.  Touch of course is very intuitive (love to watch my five year old use it on her own)Negatives:- Big Brother In Charge:  Locked factory home screen, really?  I guess I've been spoiled with all the freedoms that Android includes (no iron curtain there).  But if I want to get rid of an Apple factory icon, I can't.  Instead, only secondary screens are up to me.  In general, there is very limited ability to tweak settings.  Way too controlling for a $700 device in my opinion.- No guided turn by turn navigation and GPS struggles to get location where my Android phone picks it up instantly;  standard on even $50 Android phones- Having used the Android Market (now Play) for years, I am accustomed to trying out ad-supported apps for free, and then buying ad-free versions of the ones I find the most useful.  Now I'm still early into iOS, but I am finding a lot more paid only apps and far fewer ad-supported free apps.  I'll keep looking but this is my initial impression.- No SD and overpriced memory upgrade only available at time of purchase- No USB to connect camera and other accessories to, and Apple OEM only camera kit for a high price for what it is.- Occasional stutter or delayed response.  Generally very smooth as reviewers have said, but both my wife and I have seen this happen once or twice an hour.I'll do a follow-up in a couple weeks when I've had more time with it.  I still wouldn't consider an iPhone over Android.  But for tablets, Apple is the game in town right now both for hardware and ecosystem.  If Android/Win 8 tablets approached the hardware quality of the new iPad (screen, battery life, etc), and their respective app stores built up a good base of available apps, I probably would choose one of them over iOS due to above negatives.  I realize some of the reasons Apple has been so successful is that they lock their products down fairly tight.  But they also clearly are gaming the customer to drive additional purchases, expensive upgrades or future product replacements, etc.In summary, I think the new iPad is an amazing product that I wouldn't have imagined only a few years ago.  For that, I'm willing to part with my hard earned dollars and enjoy it.  But I'd also gladly swap it for an Android/Win 8 tablet in a couple years when those markets mature.Update 1 Month In:+ Battery life continues to be amazing+ Form/weight/screen all a delight+ Compared to using laptop, find that we use more including short-bursts; instant on is great+ Awesome as a digital photo frame for sharing photos- 10 Watt power supply is somewhat ridiculous considering iPad contains laptop size battery; charges take about 6-8 hours, depending on how far one lets it run down;  for comparison, typical laptop comes with 40-60 watt power supply and charge in 1.5-2.5 hours- Lack of Flash is bigger drawback than I anticipated; Kids sites/games especially depend on Flash- Wi-Fi is considerably slower than on laptop and even Android phones;  SpeedTest confirms speeds 50-60% slower", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The New ipad, to be or not to be?", "Author": "LionKing \"bas\"", "ReviewID": "R2YMNHE7JHO3UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Retina Display", "Author": "Simon", "ReviewID": "R3P5S7NHNE0Z0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40\" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins.

Some quick pros and cons:PROS vs Android/Asus:*Retina Display: The screen is very good, but coming from the Asus, which has a higher resolution than the iPad 2, I was not blown away by it. It feels like a larger version of the Retina display on the iPod Touch, a device which I also use frequently. Coming from these two quality screens, the new iPad display was not a massive step up in quality, but I suspect many people who have been using different devices will be pleasantly surprised. Where this display shines is in color saturation and text quality. Images pop off of the screen and reading is the best I have seen on any handheld device.*App Selection: Many have made this point, but it is worth mentioning again. The App selection on iPad blows Android out of the water. There really is no comparison here. Even the free apps seem to be of higher quality than on Android.* UI: The smoothness of the UI on the iPad is second to none. The screen registers every swipe and gesture, and pages flip seamlessly and with high quality animation. The ASUS Transformer features the much discussed 2 second \"Android lag,\" which is not a deal breaker, but feels less sophisticated compared to the iPad (although this seems less of an issue in ICS).s* Build Quality: The solidity of the iPad is a major plus compared to the Transformer. The iPad is heavy, solid, and the tactile transition from glass to brushed metal is appealing and borderline luxurious. The Asus simply feels like a sheet of plastic (which it is). The Asus also suffers from noticeable light bleeding, the charger also died within a year and the keyboard dock had to be RMA'd and repaired. I don't think these things will be an issue with the iPad.CONS vs Android/Asus:* OS: I may be in the minority here, but I find Android to be a more feature rich and deep OS. I like having some degree of control over my devices, and I appreciate the fact that Android lets me get \"under the hood\" a bit more than iOS. It doesn't trap me within a proprietary \"ecosystem\" of content, it allows me to use the device as an external hard drive to transfer media, and I can expand the storage via MicroUSB as I see fit (This has been beaten to death, but Apple really needs to allow users to expand storage-even on a proprietary basis). And there are also little touches that I think are well done, such as Android's ability to run many programs at once and allow the user to flip through them- a feature that I miss in iOS.  Its Gmail widget is an invaluable and quick way to check email, and its placement of the back button is far superior to iOS. This last point may seem minor, but the Android back button at the bottom of the screen is more convenient as you do not have to remove your hands from the device to go back to a previous screen.*Weight: I prefer a heavier device but I know this is an issue for some people. The iPad is noticeably heavier than the Transformer (but lighter than other Android tablets, such as the Acer Iconia).*Keyboard Dock: This is a wonderful, albeit expensive, add-on for the Asus Transformer. The keyboard dock/charger is incredibly useful as it extends battery life, expands storage, and enhances usability. I know that you can use Apple's bluetooth mouse and keyboard with the iPad, but the all-in-one solution from Asus is more appealing as it basically affords you the convenience of a netbook and a tablet. I suspect this will be the future of mobile computing. As I noted above, however, my keyboard was defective out of the box and reviews suggest that the build quality of these units is quite poor.OVERALL: If you are new to tablets and want the best UI and great ease of use, go for the iPad. If you are technically inclined and want more control over your device, go with a high-end Android tablet. The iPad has the best tablet hardware on the market, but Android as an OS is closing the gap.  That having been said, Apple's iPad, while not revolutionizing the act of computing, is instead changing how we consume the internet, and the newest iteration of the iPad is the most convincing example of this vision.**UPDATE**I just wanted to confirm that I too have experienced the extremely long recharge times reported various internet outlets (about 5 and a half hours in my case). It by no means detracts from my enjoyment of the product, but planning recharges and making sure to top off the charge at appropriate times does reduce the device's mobility.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Desktop Replacement?  Almost there!", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "RQOIJ6LERWJ60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the pleasure of trying out most of the new Apple products for the last few years.  If you have any questions or requests for clarifications you can leave a comment, and I'll be emailed, or you can email me directly by clicking on my name and looking for the link.I mostly use an iPad 1, but I have the opportunity to use an iPad 2 often.A lot has changed since the iPad came out, and I wrote my original review (located here:Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi) titled with a quote from Woz, saying \"Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing\" and its still very true.  Tablets aren't like PCs, you don't need to maintain them or worry about software requirements at all.  Its wonderful for people who hate that.  My friend can tell you exactly what processor his last laptop had, but what processor does his iPad have?  He'll say \"Don't know, don't care\".  If you are wondering why to get a tablet at all, I would recommend that you read that review. Its the second review on that page.So I bought the new iPad, the 2.5, or whatever you want to call it.  I'm not going to go into the tech specs, because, they are posted everywhere and unless you are a geek you will also fall into the \"don't know/don't care\" category.  I'm going to try to focus on just telling you what I would want to know before I bought it.  This review will be about real use.I chose a 32GB version.  Why?1) The new apps that will support the retina display are supposed to take more memory, so you should expect that whatever you had on your older iPad will take more space on this new one.2) I feel that the days of 16GB being enough may soon be passing.  With my 16GB iPad I was actually having to start managing my memory.  I had to start leaving things off it.3) The more powerful the iPad becomes, the more I expect to use it.  And this means, more memory will be needed.  The iPad has never been my primary \"computer\", but with this iteration it might be there:  I can plug an HD screen into it via HDMI now, and use a nice bluetooth keyboard.  However, you have to use the iPad itself as a gigantic touchpad, as you can't use a pointing device.  It mirrors whats on the screen, so, its clumsy-but-possible.  Still, we are getting so close to throwing the ipad down on the desk at work and just... working.So for the first time I plunked down my hard earned money for the 32GB version.  I think the 16GB version will be like having a 4GB iPhone 2G.I'd also like to point out that despite the improvements and upgrades, Apple is maintaining the same starting price that it did for the iPad 1 and the iPad 2.  This is very nice.The main new things -for me- in order of importance are:1)  The 4G LTE network (I have the AT&T; version).  We'll skip the cell phone enthusiast argument over whether this is really a 4G device, because 4G was actually supposed to be (clears throat) even better.  Because in spite of that, the 4G LTE may be the primary reason I plunked down my change and bought it.  I want to be able to do my work remotely without problems.I ran some tests on the new iPad.--In my office, which has a 6mbps DSL and wifi, I saw a 3.6Mbps upload and a  512k upload.  You might say \"who cares?\"  Ah but wait.--I signed up for the 3GB Data Plan at $30/mo, and when using the 4g LTE network, I saw a 17Mbps connection.--And at home, where we have the fiber optic connection, I only saw an 11Mbps connection.--And finally, my iPhone 4s got a lousy 2.5Mbps on the AT&T; 4G non-LTE network.So there you have the relative speeds.  All calculated using the Speed Test app.So here's the point... the new 4G service is a major upgrade.  On the LTE network it is very fast - however, I did experience some latency when just checking emails traveling in a car driving 70 mph.  This is typical for this technology, it seems to have problem switching from tower to tower.  But if you are sitting at a park downtown then I don't think you'll see those problems.  What does this mean?  You should see a movie download in 1/2 to 1/4 of the time. And the iPad will be able to act as a wifi hub for all your devices.  In other words, I will be able to use the iPad for internet for my laptop too.  Now, at the time of this writing, it should be noted that you cannot use your iPad as a wifi hotspot with AT&T.;  At this time only Verizon supports that feature.  (Maybe you want to pick the Verizon version if this is important to you).Now, I live in a metro area in one of the biggest cities in the USA, so, your 4g service may vary.  And they are charging a super premium price:  $10 per GB.  A full length movie on iTunes is 2GB or 3GB, so it can't replace my home connection, but its great for work and casual use.Back to the countdown:2) The \"resolutionary\" screen.  It is true that this screen is amazing and a pleasure to look at.  You can't see the pixels, and I love that.  I love that on my iPhone 4 too.  It will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent, so I don't think you need to got all excited and upgrade tomorrow.3) The faster processor.  I actually did not have a problem with my old iPad processor, but soon my old iPad will be like using a 2G iPhone.  But it will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent.  Once again, I don't think you need to upgrade tomorrow, but, a few months after release it should be a lock (I happen to know that many iPad developers wait until they can actually get their hands on a retail unit before upgrading their existing apps, although once they get the retail unit its like a race to finish).4) Dictation.  I have used this with success.  However, like most voice recognition software its usefulness is reduced by the fact that I'm seldom in a quiet place. Still, I like it.  I think its a valuable addition, and I typically use it when I only would have to type a few words.  I don't use it to type long letters, as its not completely accurate and I think editing out all the mistakes would take longer than typing it out.  (I do use an Apple brand bluetooth keyboard for serious typing: Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION] I have also tried a chicklet style one but it didn't work well for me: Kensington iPad 2 Case with Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad 2 3G Tablet, WIFI Model K39521US.5) The camera.  I don't think I'll use this much.  Mostly when taking pictures of things that I'm writing about, which isn't that often.  Maybe for some FaceTime.  But I don't think this makes it worth it to upgrade from the Original Ipad.  (the iPad 2 had a camera, so you can ignore this if you have an iPad 2)Other usage changes since iPad 1:1) I bought an HP envy (HP Envy 110 e-All-in-One Printer for the wireless printing from iPad and iPhone.  This has worked out VERY well.  I think the AirPrint implementation has worked nicely.2) One thing I was disappointed with the original iPad for was the inability to see what was on the iPad screen on a TV.  Since then I have purchased an Apple TV Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010) [OLD VERSION] which is now the old version.  And Apple has made it possible to see whatever is on the screen of the iPad on a bigger screen, and you can buy HDMI adapters now: Apple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A)3) On my first review I talked about the ability to put your iPhone sim card into your iPad and share your existing data service.  I tried this out, putting my iPhone microsim in the new iPad and I was invited to purchase a new data plan.  So apparently that little moneysaver has been eliminated.Other things that stay the same:You still won't be able to use Flash, a website programming language that allows websites to act more like computer programs.  I've read that the reason that Apple won't allow this is that Flash is often the gateway to getting viruses and other nasties.  As a result, there is no need to have antivirus software on your iPad, its very very safe.  The iPad is rock solid reliable.  In fact, the only virus I've heard of for the iPad is where someone had to send you a Pdf via email and get you to open it.  And of course, thats threat was removed before I even heard about it.On my last review, I talked about usage.  Apps I use a lot now:1) Logmein: to do anything on my computer that I can't do on an iPad.  This would include Flash based software.  I connect to a computer THROUGH my iPad, and control the computer to go to flash sites.  Ordinarily I would say this is not worth it, but the computer also runs engineering programs and other programs that don't really exist for the iPad.2) Gopayment to accept credit cards, although Quickbooks Online usage is hampered by the fact that Quickbooks makes you use a stripped down version through the safari web browser.  Once again, use LogMein Ignition.3) I find the spreadsheet program (numbers) to be highly annoying.  However, there was recently an announcement that MS Office programs Excel Word and Powerpoint will soon be available for the iPad with an interface similar to MS OneNote.  I'll be buying a copy of Excel and hoping that it doesn't suck.4) Find my Friends: I see where people are without having to call them and say \"where are you?\" which is nice.  Because I can see where my wife is without calling her, I get less honeydos.  Wipe that smirk off your face >:(  But also if you know they are driving you don't have to worry about distracted driving causing an accident.5) I don't end up playing many games on the iPad.  I play a lot of games on the iPhone.  But thats just my usage experience.  Maybe that will change with the new screen.You can read my original iPad review (linked above) for more usage ideas, if you are new to tablets.A bit more about usage, someone pointed out in a comment that you don't need the HDMI adapter if you intend to use AirPlay.  Airplay includes the ability to wirelessly stream audio and video from your iPad to a TV.  Typically this is only from apps that share music and movies, which is the functionality of Airplay (You PLAY things over the air).  There are Airplay adapters, including the AppleTV.  However, the HDMI connector does more than the Airplay allows: You can share the actual screen of your iPad, no matter what it shows, to a TV as a mirror image.  If you were to want to use the iPad as your primary \"computer\", you would probably want an HDMI adapter for big screen use.  I meet more people each month who do use a Tablet as their primary computer, so I felt this was an important point to clarify.  I own the AppleTV and the HDMI adapter, and use them in different ways at different times.Will this Ipad 2.5 make my original iPad as useless as a 4GB iPhone 2G?  For the first 6 months, no.  But after that, its likely.  Overall I am happy I bought it, mostly for the native 4G LTE internet.  Followed by the beautiful screen.  The faster processor is the 3rd reason, and as soon as the app developers start utilizing it to greater advantage, it will likely become the #1 reason.  And I think I'll feel that that has happened in about 6 months.After MS Excel comes out I may make an attempt to make the iPad my primary computing device, using the HDMI out and a bluetooth keyboard.  Wish me luck.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Verizon (and AT&T;)  iPad Buyer Beware", "Author": "RSaunders", "ReviewID": "R31QU3JV3F46BU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review by stating that the iPad is a remarkable product that is worthy of a five star rating. My one star valuation is specific to the new Verizon iPad which in my opinion contains a major flaw detrimental to all consumers unwary of Verizon's tactics.The Verizon iPad is equipped with a sim card that permits cell data usage by subscription. With my AT&T; iPad 2 I am able to subscribe and unsubscribe at-will one month at a time. This is the way a cell data subscription should work. The Verizon iPad does not permit this type of usage. If you cancel a monthly subscription for cell data with Verizon that cancellation permanently inactivates the Verizon sim card. The only remedy is to go to the Verizon store to obtain a new card. I have had to do that twice since I purchased the Verizon iPad and each time it is a major time consuming inconvenience and problem.My first stop at the Verizon store took an hour while the customer service representative insisted that I could not replace the sim card without signing up then and there for a monthly plan. After some argument and consultation with others he recanted but insisted that he could not install the sim card without obtaining from me full personal identifying information (telephone number, e-mail address, home address).The next time I needed a sim card the Verizon store representative insisted she had to charge $10 for the card. She didn't require any personal information and she didn't make any effort to link the sim card with my iPad. She simply insisted on $10 for the sim card and handed it to me.It seems as if Verizon is using the expense and inconvenience of forced sim card inactivation in order to discourage a la carte usage of cell data and to encourage people to pay $20 or $30 dollars a month whether or not they need data service.Had I know about this policy I would never have purchased the Verizon iPad.  The Apple Store saleswoman who sold me the iPad was not aware of this flaw and did not advise me that it was an issue. Surprisingly, none of the Apple Store sales persons I have spoken to since then were aware of this issue.Unless you enjoy spending time at the Verizon Store or unless you intend to use a cellular data plan without interruption, you should stay away from the Verizon iPad.Update on February 4, 2013: I just left my local AT&T; store after speaking with the AT&T; store manager about this issue. He confirmed that AT&T; has adopted the Verizon policy and their new iPads also discourage a la carte usage by requiring the customer to purchase a new sim card if the customer cancels a la carte cell data service. It is clear that both major companies want to discourage at-will cell data usage and promote the more lucrative monthly subscription. What a shame and what a rip-off.  They will probably continue to do this until the customers rebel and refuse to purchase the higher priced iPad and/or the monthly cell data service plan.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "All that sizzle and no steak", "Author": "YS Sheu \"ss\"", "ReviewID": "R1LAYFDEKV7AE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I own an Apple Mac Air, iPod touch, and work on a Mac Pro at school, and I have to say, the iPad is my least like Apple product.  iPad is essentially a bigger and more expensive version of iPod touch plus the optional cellular function, which you have to pay at least $20 each month for the service, so that you can use the navigation function (cheaper just to get a GPS with antiglare screen).  First, my biggest complaint is the lack of flash function.  It is true that I know about that limit before my purchase, but it is only when I started to use iPad, I realized how many things it couldn't do without flash, such as watching Amazon online stream movies.  It is really stupid that an iPad, which is targeted as a tablet, could not do flash.  Second, I thought it could at least play DVD if I have the right USB adapter, since I have an external DVD drive, but after searching online, I realized it could not do that either, because some format issues.  It really drives me nuts, because what is good about retina display if you can't watch movies, and I am not about to pay extra money for movies on iTune.  Then, it is the multi-tasking function, I really thought that was a joke. Originally, I thought multitasking means that you can open two apps and have them side-by-side on the screen, and I was dead wrong.  First, there is no side-by-side, and second, once you switch to another app, the previous app (such as safari) stops.  For example, if I am watching a dateline story streaming on CBS, I cannot have it play in the background and use other apps.  There are also small things like I can't use the Apple magic track pad with iPad (wireless keyboard works fine).  Overall, the new iPad sucks compares to other Apple device.  I feel for the price I paid, I am getting a mediocre device with multiple restrictions (mostly for business reasons such as no flash so that you have to stick with iTuen for movies) and no special talent other than the retina display.  Anyhow, I hope my love for iPad could increase a bit after Siri being available on new iPad in OS6.*UPDATE*:  another disappointment about new iPad - it takes ages to recharge.  I use the 10W USB power adapter and I closed the smart cover (sleep mode) when I was charging the new iPad.  I tested the battery at 3 different times, and it is roughly 10% increase per 35 minutes, which means it will take roughly 5 hours and 50 minutes to charge from 0% to 100% full, which is very close to PC world's report.  On another note, the techs at Apple store told me that apps and bluetooth draw a lot of power, so that I should close them if I want to save battery.*UPDATE 2*: on the postive side - I downloaded the GPS drive app and it actually works without data plan.  The catch is that you have to get the direction while you have internet access, and then it will take you to your destination without continuous 3G/4G or wireless connections.  However, you won't be able to get another direction to a new place unless you have internet, nor can you find the nearby restaurants, gas station, etc without internet connection.*UPDATE 3\"(8/2/12): Amazon Prime videos are now available on iPad!!  The video quality is pretty good, but I don't think it is HD quality.*UPDATE 4*(9/27/2012): I updated my iOS to version 6, and I like it so far!  Siri is now incorporated to my iPad 3, and I've been talking to her ever since.  Youtube app is gone from my iPad, Apple says their contract with YouTube is expired.  So for now, I have to use Safari to watch youtube.  Google maps is gone and replaced with Apple's new map system.  It does voice turn-by-turn direction, but I haven't really tested it out yet.  As for other newly released apps, for some strange reason, iPad 3 owners did not get to have passbook app.  I guess Apple figures that I won't be carrying my iPad around to the airports, concerts, or watching a movie, or going to a ballgame, which I do....*UPDATE 5*(10/28/2012): Apple just announced few days ago that they have a new iPad (for convenience, let's call it iPad 4) - by looking into the technical specs, I think the only two changes are: the chip (upgraded to A6 from A5), and the power adapter (from the 30-pin to lightening connector).  In the future, someone has to comment on whether the lightening power adapter is able to charge the iPad faster than the 30-pin adapter. Otherwise, I don't see any benefit of changing power adapter, as the the lightening charger won't work with previous versions of power docks.  People who are interested in buying the mini iPad should also know that the mini iPad does not have retina display (it is 163 ppi), and thus no HD.  On a separate note, I've been testing the Apple's new map system recently, and the results are so far so good! I think in some ways it is better than Motion X HD (a paid third party GPS app).  To summarize: First, the color system in Apple's map only has four to five colors, but that is not a issue to me, as it looks plain but clear.  Second, you can only get one voice: the voice of Siri, but it sounds great, so no complain.  Third, Apple's map gives much earlier warning compares to Motion X in terms of the next direction.  I had many experience that Motion X was late on telling me to take an exist or make a turn.  So kudos to Apple's map.  Overall, I don't know why there are so much criticism against Apple's map (most complaint is that the map system is not as mature as Google's).  I mean, it is possible that Apple's map won't work for you if you are going to somewhere remote, but you can always double check on Google's map using Safari.  I think if you mainly use Apple's map in places other than country side, then you should be fine!  After all, you don't need to pay extra (Motion X is $10/year) for voice navigation.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Retina display makes it", "Author": "donutbrew", "ReviewID": "R3J03O3R3RP74G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm glad I waited for the retina display in the new iPad rather than buying earlier or opting for the less expensive iPad 2.

There probably isn't much to be said that hasn't already been covered by more experienced users, so I'll be brief. I bought this with the idea to use it for a few months and then give it to my wife who's been asking for one for awhile. I was planning to get an Asus Transformer for myself. Having used this for a month so far, I now find myself on the fence...while I love the customizable features of android (usually root my devices and load custom ROMS), the ease of use and final polish of this pad is phenomenal. I like the screen, the size and I think I might actually prefer the 4:3 screen ratio to the widescreen of the asus, as it means less scrolling when browsing the web in landscape mode.Ultimately, the new iPad is undeniably a 5 star device regardless what we of the Android community spew against it. So if you like iOS, or want THE tablet all other tablets are judged by, you should probably buy this one. As for me, I'll continue hemming and hawing, for the next couple months while I use this iPad (much to my wife's distress) while I continue trying to decide if I really want to abandon my beloved android.***Update***So my wife and I have been using it consistently for about 2 months now, and my main aggravation with the iPad is simply that there is no native file management system in place. Example: I want to create a text file with my passwords on it. However, I don't want any person that comes along to open the notes app, see my file and be able to open it. I prefer to be able to \"bury\" it in a hidden folder somewhere within the operating system. I would also like the option to easily rename files, and organize my Pictures, Music and personal documents in my own folders, i.e. a \"My Documents\" folder. I debated dropping a star on the iPad for this inflexibility in the iOS, but I knew about this \"shortcoming\" (as least in my eyes) before buying it. I just didn't realize how heavily it would impact my day-to-day use. In the end, I will be buying myself an Android tablet while the wife will use the iPad.***Final Update***So I finally ended up purchasing an Asus TF300 for myself and have been using it for about a month. My reasons were mainly because I wanted the flexibility of a file management system and the ability to more thoroughly customize my home screens (i.e. widgets and such). While I'm happier with my Android tablet, I still think the iPad a 5 star device, while I'll probably give the Asus 4 1/2 stars. The build quality just can't compare, the retina screen on the iPad is beautiful, and the stability of the OS is rock solid. Of course, the price of the iPad is more steep, and it came with 1/2 the memory, but 16GB should be plenty for most users and anyone who isn't SURE they want the Android, would probably ultimately be happier with the iPad.

So over the course of years I always dismissed iPad because of it's price. I bought MANY Android Tablets and taking them back because I was disappointed with Issues. Here is a list:- Elocity A7 tablet- Samsung Galaxy Tab- Dell Streak 7- Archos (few of those)- HTC Flyer- Eee Pad Transformer- Xoom- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+Now all of them wasn't bad tablets, they just wasn't working properly after a while. So after all that I gave up on tablets period. I decided that since I have a now Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) It was time to just save and bite the bullet on a iPad....Now I question myself...Why did I wait so long to buy one?!?!This tablet is amazing, It truly a remarkable device. I can see why Apple get's praised for making a device this good and this fluent. While I understand both iOS and Android is different and each it's own (There are some things Android and iOS do better then one another.) but \"The New iPad\" is leaps and bounds over most tablets that I've tried here is why:Screen:Bright and Vibrant HD Visuals. It's crisp and sharp and reading on this thing is Phenomenal. This is eye candy (or iCandy) pure eye candy to anyone who is a fan of a HD display. Unlike the iPad 2 which I tried at the demo at store there is no way I can go back to a lower resolution tablet due to the fact I am spoiled by this screen. The games look amazing as well. Honestly its like the screen isn't there.Speed:Quick...So quick in everything it does. Web browsing is super fast, Opening apps is super fast, Doing anything is fast. I never owned a iPad 2 so I can't compare the two but I am very happy with it.Apps:Good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store and running perfectly if they are iPad ready. You won't be disappointed. Its one of the best ecosystems on a tablet device. This was my main reason for getting the iPad and I'm sure a lot of other people too. There wasn't a hassle like \"side loading\" like it was on my first tablet \"Elocity A7 tablet\" which lead to a terrible user experience for a first timer. The iPad simply just works and I can believe if this your first time having a tablet. You will be happy.iOS 5.1.1 / Camera:It improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. unlike it was before on the first iPad. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. Recording Video is nice! What bad about it is that it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE. I don't see myself using the camera at all to take pictures it's nice that it's there though. Let's face it, I don't think many people would want to use their tablet to take Pictures / Videos. I will just use the front facing cam for face time.Build Quality:Solid and it just feels right in the hand. Just don't drop this tablet at all. it seem like it would break pretty easily. I would get a screen protector like I did and a case to cover the iPad. I notice its a little heavier then the iPad 2 which might be a problem to some people.The bad:Well, The iPad can get warm at times on the back. It's also somewhat restrictive and limited. I would like to have an SD slot to add more storage / lack of customization that iOS such as widgets / and a little bit more open in the market. I can live without these but it would be nice for Apple to open up a little more. The price is expensive but worth it (especially for that screen alone) just little too much just for 16GB of space.Overall:I just want to point out that this Tablet is not for Android junkies, its just not. If your coming from an Android and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys wait for the Nexus Tablet from Google which I will be getting as well.But for people that just want a great user experience with a tablet without any hassle. Even if your a New comer to tablets, I suggest you get the New iPad. Its a little hard to say if you have an iPad 2 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want that drop dead gorgeous screen. But trust me it improves on what the iPad 2 before it had which was a good tablet from the start.It have the best ecosystem, it still has the \"just work\" aspect and it still one of the best tablets out there. Buy it, enjoy, and have fun!Edit:I took back the 16 GB and got myself a 32GB iPad and I love it to death! Personally I highly suggest getting the 32GB/64GB iPad. its just not enough storage with some Apps ranging to 1 GB+. Thanks to some research I also found out how to do home sharing on iTunes to save space.

I finally took the leap.Admittedly, when I first got it, it felt like a luxurious toy -- and perhaps it is. I kept saying to myself, \"my Macbook can do this\" or, \"Do I really need this app?\"But finally, what it boiled down to was that I was having so much fun with my new iPad. It was a mixture of both practical, functional apps and wonderfully fun apps. I concentrated on free apps and already have so many good ones downloaded. I have books and magazines to read, including audiobooks which can be read to me before I fall asleep, and apps to help me with things like finding yard sales in my neighborhood or Manga Storm, which is marvelous for reading manga on the iPad. There's Glympse, which lets everyone know where you are at any given moment.This may be the Wi-Fi version, but in my city it has its advantages. My ISP is providing free Wi-Fi hotspots for its customers around the city, and is adding more all the time. I imagine other ISPs will follow suit. Wi-Fi may soon be in competition with 3G and 4G. It sounds far-fetched, but at least in my city, it isn't, although a few years ago it would have been. So I can get connected in a lot more places for free, which is nice.I'm very impressed with everything about the iPad, from the display to the controls to the sound. I don't have an iPad 2 or an original iPad to compare it to, as this is my first one. All I can say is that I am very happy with mine.I got a beautiful case for it that I just love: the Osaki iCoat Slim Y+ Hard Case and Cover for The New iPad and the iPad 2. It fits both the new iPad and the iPad 2. What I love is that the front of the case is like a Smart Cover, except that it does both portrait and landscape modes. The front cover attaches not to your iPad, however: instead, it attaches to the back case. I also got a nifty little stand, the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book. It works great in both portrait and landscape mode and is great for charging.I also want to say a word about screen brightness, since some people have mentioned about the iPad overheating. I was worried about this prior to getting mine. Yes, if you have a bare iPad and you run a game or a very graphic intensive app, the iPad may get a little warm. However I have found that most of the time, the brightness level that the iPad is set on, which is around 50%, is fine for me. There have been a few times when I have raised it to 75%, and there have also been a few times when I have lowered it to 25%. But mostly I keep it at 50%. I keep my Macbook's screen at 100% brightness. So I like a bright screen. But the 50% brightness on the iPad is really bright to me. The only exception is if there is a game and it has a really dark scene. Then maybe I want to turn up the brightness a bit, or maybe I want to dim the lights in the room. It depends on the game.However, most of the time, people are not going to have a bare iPad if they are thinking about protecting it against dropping it. Usually they will have AppleCare+ or some type of protection plan. Mine went right into my case as soon as I got the case. So with the case on it, I really do not feel any heat. The heat I was mentioning was when I was playing games on it when it was bare, before I got a case for it.Also, if you've never had an iPad, I learned from Apple tech support you can only have 11 pages of apps on the iPad (you can have unlimited apps stored on iTunes or in iCloud). But you can put apps in folders. So at least there is that option!All I can say is, if you've never had an iPad and you're on the fence, this is a beautiful device. I'm extremely happy with mine. The only thing I would wish for is more storage. I got the 64GB but it still feels like for things like photos, videos and movies that I would like more storage.The iPad third generation is amazing: you won't regret your purchase.

The iPad 1 is pretty much now obsolete because it is incredibly slow and crashes a lot with the newer apps. There is also no camera on the iPad 1. Therefore, if you are going to upgrade, you might as well upgrade to the iPad 3. Everything is better on the iPad 3 compared to the iPad 1 in terms of screen and speed.However if you currently own an iPad 2, I actually do not think upgrading to the iPad 3 is worth it. For one the iPad 2 and the New iPad look virtually identical. I even brought them both into an Apple Store and the guy that was helping could not tell the difference. You might think you can easily tell the difference with the retina display but you have to look very carefully to be able to tell. Don't get me wrong the retina display is beautiful but you have to look carefully to tell the difference. In terms of speed, I cannot tell the difference between the iPad 2 and iPad 3. The big difference I can tell is the camera in that the New iPad has a 5 megapixel camera.I am giving the New iPad a 4 star rating because it is a great device but in my opinion it is not worth upgrading if you already own an iPad 2.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best tablet still, but not better enough than the iPad 2", "Author": "William B. Partridge", "ReviewID": "RUAHDQH0PLB6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, the best tablet on the market. It's what's all other tablets aspire to be, hands down. The problem is that while it's better than the iPad 2, the difference might not be enough.So what's different?  The screen is now 4 times the resolution.  It's the best screen on a tablet, by miles. If you were to display a picture of icecream on the screen you'd be tempted to even lick it. RAM is also now doubled which leads, most notably so far, to less reloading of pages when you use multiple tabs in browsing.  The graphics processor is also better, while the main processor it self remains at the same speeds.  The differences in this, so far, aren't perceivable.  The back camera is also improved but I'm not really sure who's taking pictures with their iPad.  If you go with the LTE option, well that's going to clean the floor with the 3G versions, but that's up to you. On the downside the tablet is now also a little heavier (it is noticeable, but you'll forget about it) and runs warmer with long use (this is also noticeable and you won't be able to ignore it unless you're using a case).  Also Apple changed the polarity of the sleep/wake magnets so now nearly all 3rd party cases that you have from the iPad 2 won't work that way.What's not different? iOS. All the pros and cons are still there. The front camera is also still VGA. While the graphics processor got a nice bump the CPU itself is still the same dual-core.I'm really disappointed Apple didn't improve the front camera.  A VGA camera on a screen this good is just a joke.  The rear camera, a camera I used maybe a dozen times in my ownership of my iPad 2 gets a massive upgrade but the camera I've used for hours of video chat is left where it was (even a year ago the VGA camera was terrible).  I can only assume it was left off to provide some feature for the next iPad.  What this product ultimately highlights now are the shortcomings with iOS. Aside from putting a better front camera in the device and addressing some of the backwards steps with the iPad 3 (temp, weight) there's really nothing else Apple can do with this device.  The main hold over from the iPad 2 was the screen and that's been solved now.  Apple needs to, and appears to be doing (but slowly), work on the OS itself.  It's somewhat troubling that by and large iOS 5.1 looks and operates the same as iOS3 and 4.  The most notable of improvements has been the addition of the multitouch gestures and the addition of the notification system.  All nice additions but they don't really represent 2 years worth of changes.In comparison to the iPad 2 this is a nice upgrade, but ultimately it's not enough.  I'm not sure anything could have been enough to be honest though, but the fact that it runs hotter and is heavier don't help it in comparison.  While the screen is appreciable, the screen on the iPad 2 is still amazing in it's own right. If anything it's not a comment on poor quality of the new iPad but rather just that the iPad 2 was already so good.  The new iPad is a worthwhile upgrade from the original iPad or great for a first time buyer.Pros:++Screen++Extra RAM+iPhone and iPod touch based games now use their retina display apps for upscaling on the iPad (this is a REALLY nice improvement when you do use it).Cons:--Front facing camera is still the same-no new OS version = same old same old (e.g. no Siri)In addition, I'd like to compare this to Android tablets in general as I own both.  Android itself represents a better operating system.  Notifications are better, multitasking is better, and just the general usability of the device is better - especially with regard to the home screen.  What Android tablets fail to deliver, however, is the smoothness and richness that iOS offers.  Scrolling on a webpage in iOS versus in Android is just effortless.  It really shows off the imperfections of Android in general, much like how Android shows off the short comings of iOS.  The other issue is app selection.  Android doesn't have the heavy media hitters.  No Hulu Plus, no Xfinity, no HBO Go, no EA games, and just a general lack of quality applications (Android 2.2/2.3 based tablets and the Kindle Fire are exceptions but I'm focused on iOS 5 versus Honeycomb or ICS).  While the Google apps are hands down better on the Android side, they don't make up for the lack of entertainment on the iPad.  Also to note, a lot of the Android apps really don't feel like they take any advantage of the screen size difference, many of the apps feel just like scaled up phone applications where as iPad apps seem to have more thought put in to them for the extra size.While Android often times offers better and more features in it's core implementation, none of that matters when there's so little in comparison to do.  And nearly none of the things they both do are done as well on Android or as smoothly.  Yes, I miss widgets, GTalk integration, and a variety of other things when I use my iPad, but I ultimately use it a lot more because there's more to do.  If you own an Android phone (I do) there's not much really the tablet can do that my phone can't do already, so ultimately it just feels pointless.And I think that's a good point to consider.  Unless you hate Apple/iTunes, if you own an Android phone you'd probably be better off with an iPad to complement the phone.  Likewise might hold true for people who own an iPhone, an Android tablet might be better than the iPad.In the end, if you're looking for a tablet, get the new iPad.  Android may do more things on the front, but there's just less to do on it in most cases.  If you already own an original iPad or an Android tablet - this is worth the upgrade.  However, if you own an iPad 2, unless you really need LTE (and you won't tether your phone) this is a pass.  I made the change to get more storage space primarily (32GB wasn't cutting it anymore) but if not for that I'd have kept the iPad 2 instead.

The description on the label was \"FC705LL/A RFB IPAD WI-FI 16GB BLACK-USA\".  Note the \"RFB\" in the description and the model number starts with F.  The serial number started with DK.  Three signs of it being a refurbished unit.Outside the cellophane on the top of the box was a sticker that had all the information to label it as new, including the word \"New\" in bold type...I contacted Amazon for a refund.  That went smoothly.  The seller's attitude was that it should have been a new iPad. He said he never sees the boxes of items fulfilled by Amazon; something like his products go straight through Amazon warehouses.  He did point out that refurbished iPads have different boxes with \"Certified Refurbished\"  printed on the front.  My box was not one of those.After I researched Apple Certified Refurbished, I concluded that a certified refurbished iPad is ok, but I PAID for a new one.  I ended up buying an Apple Certified Rerurbished iPad 3rd Gen at a price point that was in line with it being a refurbished unit.I don't know if this problem was the seller's fault or the fault of the \"system.\"  3rd Generation iPads are no longer in production.  The only models being produced as NEW are: iPad With Retina Display (4th Gen); iPad Mini; and 2nd Generation iPads.

This review is not so much about the technical abilities of the iPad (which are well covered elsewhere), but more about the difficult-to-define allure of the product.People I know who also own an iPad, or who are considering buying one, often seem to spend some time coming up with justifications for the purchase: it'll help with their work, it will be great to watch movies on the train, it will keep the kids amused. After all, no-one *needs* an iPad; we can all get along quite adequately without one and at the back of our minds we are well aware of this. The iPad is expensive and for most of us it's a lot of money to fork out on what is essentially a luxury item. Deciding what you want to get out of the iPad, and whether there's a cheaper alternative available might be questions worth considering before committing.Having thought through the sensible stuff though, I, like many others was seduced, and parted quite happily with \u00a3500 odd in the expectation of...what exactly? You often see the words \"Apple\" and \"magic\" in the same sentence, and this ability to produce products which go beyond one's expectations are at the core of the company's success. Having bought an iMac a year or so ago, I was confident that I would again have my investment in an Apple product repaid several times over in the sheer enjoyment which goes with an amazement at the uncanny perfection of the product's capabilities.So, there I was in the Apple store, seated at a table, an attendant at the quasi-mystical ceremony at which my own iPad was removed from its packaging and prepared for set up. As this was the first day on sale, various people gathered to watch in awe. I was required to do the unboxing and unveiling, instructed in every move by the assistant. After removing the protective sleeve it was time to flick the button and bring life to the screen. A hush descended. As smooth as silk, the interface appeared in all its cool beauty. This truly was a work of art.Six months on and it's almost always in constant use, whether by me or another member of the family. Interestingly, different aspects seem to appeal to different people.For me it's the mail which is probably the singularly most useful feature. I have my work email as well as private email accounts all in the mail application. The messages are clearly laid out, and writing and responding I find is easy enough on the keyboard, though I know a lot of people don't find it so; it takes a while to adapt your hand shape to the keyboard, but the predictive text ensures that even if you hit the wrong key the word will probably still appear as you intended. Somehow Apple have made even such a mundane program as mail glamorous, and Excel, Word and pdf documents look spectacularly clear and professional on the retina display.Kids love the apps, particularly the gaming ones of course, and there's always a new one coming along in this seemingly inexhaustible supply of the new and extraordinary.Photos look a million dollars on the new screen and iPhoto ensures that albums can be easily organised. The iPad cleverly syncs with your PC so not just photos, but music moves seamlessly between the two.iTunes, YouTube and the BBC app mean you could be entertained for hours, if you should so choose. Whatever you watch you'll be treated to pin-sharp definition. The sound is fine on the basic headphones.All these things, in my opinion, make this a luxury worth having. However, the iPad is somehow more than the sum of its parts, and the robustness of its manufacture (I can attest to this as it's been dropped from a height on more than one occasion) together with the absolute lack of any indication whatsoever that there are actually processors whirring and chips buzzing below that crystalline surface, instil a confidence that this is somehow more than just a mass-market device.

Living in Austin, TX, all we hear about is Apple products because of their offices here.My family purchased us an Asus Tablet that works with the Andorid platform, so we were happy with the apps and overall use.  I used it mostly for reading Kindle books, and he used it for reading the news.  My company bought all of its employees iPads this past fall, and we simply fell in love with it...to the point we were having problems sharing it.  The browsing speed is so much faster, and we can stream videos for hours without the battery losing even 50% of its capacity.  It is also nice to sync it with our email accounts and iTunes, and it was easier to respond to emails using the iPad versus the Asus.  We also enjoyed taking pictures with it.  iPhones take better quality pictures, but the iPad works fine for still images and decent lighting.  Taking video is also easy, and we can text message pics and links between out iPad and other cell phones.About 6 weeks later, I bought this iPad (which was a great deal compared to buying it in the store).  While I use my iPad for email, Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and watching shows on Hulu and Netflix, my husband uses his all the time for browsing the news and streaming videos.  The apps are limitless, and the computing speed is so fast.This is great for anyone with existing Apple products or the person who has nothing Apple related.

I thought it was a tad over-priced for what  you got, it was technically unproven and it was unknown as to how it would be embraced by the public as well as app developers.  Safe to say, those concerns have been resolved.  So, I recently purchased a version 3 and saved about ninety bucks off of the original retail price.And the verdict is. . . what a great device!  The quality of the fit and finish of the iPad is above reproach.  The retina display is stunning (try streaming HD through HBO or Showtime) and it is as smooth as silk from a functionality standpoint.  Responsive, intuitive (Siri) and pleasing to look at.  Which may lead some to ask, why only 4 stars?  First, only one speaker. Second, no way to expand memory.  Third, very few options in hooking to other devices. No HDMI, USB, etc. Finally, the corporate decision to not provide for Flash capability.  It may sound like there are more cons than pros, but once you get this bad boy in your grubby little paws. . . you're really going to like it.  A wealth of apps exist for the iPad with more coming nearly every day.  Productivity apps, games, social networking, streaming, photography, etc.  A seemingly endless set of choices.

If you spend to long reading on the iPad your eyes start to bother you. My recommendation is to take breaks often if you plan to read long books on your iPad. The portability of the iPad was another factor, it so light that it doesn't weigh done your backpack. The only thing that I do not enjoy about the iPad is the typing experience.

You see there is a method to Apples madness. If you notice even Amazon is now restricting stuff on the kindle like number of songs, etc. but they don't have the background of Apps like Apple. Having an Iphone and other Apple products helps, man oh man the Itunes and cloud works awsome, but that is a bonus, because as a Tablet alone I can't see getting anything else but an Ipad. Maybe they won't have a particular app you like, but the Apps they have are usually done much better than the Android stuff. For  those of you Apple haters out there. If you have never owned one, then I suggest you keep quiet because reading about it does not make you an expert. Apple makes great products whether you like it or not.  I think I am qualified to say  this because I am a Windows PC tech...:-) But please, if you are thinking about the Ipad, try and get to an Apple store and test drive one. If you have never had a tablet you should still be impressed and if you have had a tablet you should be impressed, if not so be it, but don't knock it before you try it.One thing to remember about any electronic device especially Cell phones and Tablets..You got to be smarter than it.

If not buy an inexpensive lap cooler or small portable fan if you are so worried about the heat. SO far though I have not had a heat issue.Update: Please be aware if you get the WI-FI only model the dependence on WI-FI may affect the performance in public places like Hotels, Coffee shops, etc.  At a full hotel with free Wi-Fi, you may find things a bit slower than what you are used to. If connection is a major issue for you then maybe a 3g model.  It is my own personal preference that I refuse to pay anything to Verizon or AT&T; as to why I don't have the 3g.Update:  I think I mentioned this before..If you don't own an Apple product or never have, then I HIGHLY suggest you get to an Apple store or even a Best Buy if you can to test drive this. You are indeed going to find it different than any other tablet you may have owned.I have other Apple products so it is not difficult using it.  Also, not to be obnoxious about it but if the price of any of these is scaring you off then maybe you should be paying your bills anyway. I didn't get the 3g model simply because I can't stand Verizon or AT&T; and I wouldn't pay them to shine my shoes. To me, to pay $100.00 less for an Ipad 2 is just lame.  No Heat issues as of yet.Buying via Amazon by  the way was a breeze, got the device in 2 days. Adobe Flash is of course an issue, hence YOUTUBE will be a problem for you if you use it any.

Still a Great Product!", "Author": "Irineo Placido-Lopez", "ReviewID": "RIAXYJW0WQHAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This  is a review of the Apple iPad 3 or the \"New\" iPad as Apple likes to call it. The main question is, should I buy this? The answer will vary from person to person, but I can help you decide to see if it's worth it. First of all, let's take a look at what is new in this version of the iPad. Please note this review will be long so only read the parts that interest you. If you are truely curious, feel free to read the entire thing.Top Things in the NEW iPad: The A5X chip with quad-core graphics drives four times the pixels of iPad 2. The A5X chip is the main thing in the New iPad. It is what delivers the New Stunning Retina Display! With a 2048-by-1536 resolution you can't argue that the New iPad obviously has a way better screen than any other iDevice. With an amazing 10 hours of battery, the new display is really going to get noticed. Due to the fact it now has the A5X chip, the iPad is a lot faster and has really amazing graphics! The new 5MP Eye Sight camera is also something that is really enjoyed on the new iPad. Even though most people aren't really used to taking pictures with a 9.7 inch display tablet this update might encourage people to do so.Now, Let's get into detail. I will break up the review in segments in order to make it more convinient for you all.==== The A5X Chip ====You might be asking, \" Is the new chip really such a difference?\" The answer to this question is, yes. The new A5X chip, although not seen, is what makes the new iPad so great. It is the source behind the improved graphics, faster responces, and even the really improved Retina Display! Trust me, the new iPad is something truely amazing!==== 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight Camera ====The new rear camera on the iPad is now a 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight camera! What is Eye sight ? Let me put it this way. It is similar to professional DSLR Cameras with Autofocus. That's right, the new iPad has similar features to professional DSLR's. With really good Macro Focus and all-around high quaity pictures. Although 5 Mega Pixels is not that high, the pictures still look really nice on the iPad's Retina Display. MegaPixels matter, but there are other things like Aperature and shutter speed that have a dramatic effect on pictures. This is what is new on the iPad's camera. There is stilll room for improvement in the cameara. They could add a Flash which would make the camera truely spectacular. For now though, the camera is definitely a great improvement from the iPad 2.==== The Battery Life ====Now the battery life on the new iPad can vary from user to user. If you are those types of people that enjoy having the Best Display at all times the battery life is going to be reduced drastically. You can get more life by changing the screen brightness. The iPad has a nice feature to it called Auto-Brightness. This enables the iPad to automatically turn the brightness of the screen higher when you are outdoors and when you are indoors it automatially lowers the brightness to the point where it is just right. On auto-brightness the battery can still last a good 10 continuous hours. This means using it 10 hours non stop. Of course most people don't do this. They leave it on standby. If you only use it a couple of times per day the life can range to maybe 2 full days. Since the battery is larger and it lasts longer it takes more time to charge than an iPod or an iPhone.==== The Display ====As I mentioned before, the display is amazing on the new iPad; however, it is something so great that I can't cover in a review. The best way to decide is seeing it for yourself. I would recommend seeing one in person for you can truely observe the new display with your own eyes.With all of this said, What can an iPad Really do? I will answer this in the sections below...An iPad is basically a computer in some words. It can really be a computer with the right accessories. Some required things to take full advantage of an iPad are:* A wireless printer that supports Apple's Air Print.* An Apple TV to stream with Air Play.* A Bluetooth wireless keyboard that is supported with the iPad* A good case to protect your iPad.Let's take a look at what an iPad can truely do...==== Air Play ====If you have an Apple TV you can stream wirelessly to your HDTV. For Example, If you want to share some pictures with your family, now you can with Air Play. You can wirelessly send infromation to Your HDTV in which you will be able to see pretty much everything you see on your iPad. From Youtube videos to Photos to even Netflix.==== Air Print ====If you have a wireless printer that supports Air Print you can now print straight from your iDevice. For example, you have a PDF file that you just edited or a really great Picture that you just took. With Air Print you can print this from basically anywhere in the world. Even if you are in another county you can send an e-mail to your printer and your printer will wirelessly & Automatically start printing out whatever you sent it! This is someething truely amazing!==== Games & Apps ====With an iPad you have a wide variety of applications and games that you can install on it. With Apple's App sotre there are literally hundreds of apps to choose from with most ranging from FREE to around $5. There are two types of applications on iPads. There are normal apps that were meant for use with an iPod Touch or an iPhone and then there are HD Apps. The High Definition apps were meant for iPad only and they look a lot better than iPhone Apps; however, both are fully functional. The Games will look a lot better on the new iPad as it now has the A5X chip.==== Dictation ====Dictation is a new feature on the iPad. It allows you to speak text. An example would be writing a note in the notes section of the iPad. Instead of typing it out slowly, you can now just say it and the iPad will turn it into text! Save time by literally talking to your iPad. This is also very helpful when sending e-mails.==== Siri ? ====Apple has released to us that in its new update that is coming soon it will allow the new iPad to be used with Siri! The main feature that made the iPhone 4S such a big hit is now going to be integrated into the iPad. Just another great reason to buy an iPad 3.==== iOS ====iOS is the magic behind the  iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. Apple likes to boast about it being the worlds most advanced mobile oberating system. With every update making it even better, this is a true reason to buy an Apple Device.==== iCloud ====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPad to update its self with the \"cloud\" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPad because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPad and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPad.Overall:This is a truely outstanding product that is just amazing. The only reason why this is not a 5 Star product is because it tends to be hot! Literally it gets really hot if you use it for around 2 hours. This and the fact that it can still be improved in some areas. Overall though it is a great product that I would not hesitate to buy. I recommend this product for everyone who is looking for a Tablet. I hope that this review helped you guys out. If it did please feel free to say that it helped you out in the buttons below.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R1SRUTWOQOHYBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "The screen is so much more noticeable /clearer compared to the iPad 2. Apps are now made specifically for this iPad 3 HD.", "Author": "M. J. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1JK70QRWY58PM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The two most important features as compared to the iPad 2 and the new iPad are the amazing resolution and this speech to text dictation.I am now using the dictation to write this review and it seems so much better than Nuance Dragon Natural Speaking. Combined with the new resolution, which is much noticeably better than the iPad 2, it seems worth the upgrade. If you sell your iPad 2 you are only lose about $150; Apple products hold their value. Apple has created a system for apps, which makes which makes the new iPad available to download your current apps in four times the resolution; Web browsing and Kindle texts looks so much clearer on the new iPad. If you are a blogger or WordPress, Joomla or just an every day emailer there is no point in having a external keyboard for the new iPad. The voice to text dictation is a huge bonus.Cons:Although the front facing camera is adequate for Skype and FaceTime the resolution is not as good as other cameras for taking clear pictures. Another con compared to the iPad 2 is that the battery takes very long to charge. Although the backward facing 1080P camera may seem good on paper it is not as good as one would think. Like me, not many people use their iPad for recording videos anyway.Also, like the iPad 2 the Wi-Fi antenna is not nearly as good as a laptop or desktop computer.16 GB is really all you need, most people don't even use half of the space. Streaming music or videos does not require any extra GBs, however if you use it as your main camcorder, download video/music directly to your iPad consider getting more space or more than 16GB. If you are a big traveler and have the money go with the LTE version, otherwise the Wi-Fi version is all you need.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kind of a dissapointment", "Author": "Serpentiz", "ReviewID": "R1WTV6KJW1IU0E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the new iPad because of the retina display, it is my first Apple device. The retina display is beautiful, but I found more cons about the device then I found pros. They say once you go mac, you never go back, but I have to admit, I miss my Android tablet. First, let me say that this tablet seems to be built nicely, I have no qualms about the build quality of the device, other than the WiFi seems to be a bit slow. My complaints are about functionality and overall cosmetics. I was surprised to find out that I am unable to add widgets to my home screens without jail-breaking the device, really? This is something that Android users can do, and have been able to do since the dawn of time. Okay, fine, I can get past that. Next, my main email address is a Gmail address. I use my Gmail account to backup all my contacts, as well as send/receive emails. There is a setting on iOS 6 (which I updated to immediately upon turning the device on) that allows you to add a Gmail account. Taking into consideration that the two companies always seem to be at each others' throats, I was happy to see this was possible, however, then I found out that, while I can add my Gmail address and receive emails from my account to the iPad, I can't sync my contacts. May I ask why? In order to sync my Gmail contacts, I had to set up my Gmail account as a Microsoft Exchange account, this is stupid, why can't I just set it up as a Gmail account and automatically sync my contacts without the extra hassle? Now, I haven't really looked, but I assume Apple offers the same kind of service, where you can receive emails, and backup contacts, etc. that I can just switch to, but why should I have to? This device is supposed to be the best tablet available, why can't it do something as simple as syncing my contacts without having to use a work-around? Next, I have an Amazon account, and tons of books I've downloaded through Kindle. I found the Kindle app on the app store, and it works great for reading, then I found out you can't buy books through the app. Really? I have to go to the amazon website through Safari. Well, Apple has iBooks ... okay so to be able to do something as simple as purchasing and downloading e-books through the app itself, I have to re-purchase my entire library? This is ridiculous, in the Android Kindle app, you can do this, so it has to be Apple that for some reason decided they wouldn't allow this functionality with the app available to iOS devices. So, okay, I can get past all that as long as it reliably works right? Wrong. One of the biggest aspects this tablet is built for is gaming. There are great games on the app store, and the iPad is supposed to play them without a problem. So I go to try a game and start playing, after about 15 minutes, the device over-heated and the game crashed. There are other aspects about the iPad that I don't like, there's no HDMI out without having to buy a separate adapter, there's no SD card input (should be available on every tablet ever), I would've like to see an I/R blaster, but it seems only Samsung and Sony think that's a good idea, but these are my main complaints about the device. So, here I am, I like the iPad, but I find myself more often wishing I'd gone with a new Android tablet, and that's why I can't give the iPad 5 stars. And if you're an Android user looking to give the iPad a shot, like I was, all I can say is buyer beware.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Janie Dills", "ReviewID": "R28QD8JHKVIAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second purchase of this particular product from this Amazon Marketplace seller.

Which wouldn't be so bad, if all the web was ipad-compatible.For popular and cutting-edge websites, the iPad works like a dream. But any site that doesn't have a team of programmers, (or better yet, an app) can be rather touch and go. I just wasn't able to log onto my university email, for instance. I spent time finding elaborate solutions to problems that just don't exist for a laptop.At the end of the day, I must say that the iPad is a great product for light work, like networking, googling, or just killing time.

But the ios is actually easier then windows once you know what your doing. And there is the rub. This comes with no instructions. But you do get 90 days help and can call in as many times as you want in that time frame. The service is great, real people that seem to be in California, no accents. As a befuddled \"oldster\" (but I did know windows very well) they gave me plenty of time and effort. Some things are so simple if you only knew, and reading on the \"book\" manual in the iPad's ibooks (free) can only get you so far. The touch is so responsive it took time to \"power down\" my finger compared to \"other\" touch products (my other brand smart/dumb phone, kindle fire, other people's tablets, etc.)Things to know, = makes very sure you get that 90 days service, once the box has been opened the clock starts. If you buy someone else's or a \"open box\" from some store, make sure you know how much time is left. If you are like me and didn't even know there was that service, or that I needed it, I would have been lost. Another thing is that dang password. I spent a lots of time on the phone with Apple help on this, and they kept passing me up to higher supervisors. I don't know why it was so hard, but I know I wouldn't have got \"in\" without that help. God help me if I ever forgot it.You hear fanboys and geeks talking about Apple products.

Awesome, Awesome piece of technology and tool.Now for the long version.  I had an iPhone for two years before purchasing the iPad.  I had played around with my friends when the first one came out and thought it was a fun (expensive) toy great for surfing, playing music and games.When I got the chance to get one for myself finally, I honestly wasn't sure that I would use it.  I had been given the first gen Kindle Fire and thought the UI was s#@t!  Not to mention that the Android store was neutered and I wasn't able to download any app that I wanted because of the Amazon operating system that was on it.  So even after rooting the Kindle and installing the Android operating system I was even less thrilled about the tablet idea.  The touch technology between my iPhone and Kindle were significantly different.  That difference equated to annoyance when I couldn't get the Kindle to recognize the correct link I was trying to get without having to zoom in all the time.  The iPhone would figure out what letter I was picking on a page and get it right 98% of the time... unzoomed.  What I did like was the idea of being able to not have to have my laptop around all the time (which is 17inches of screen) and that I could use it as a reader.However, I didn't want to squander my work bonus on something that would sit on the kitchen counter next to the Kindle Fire because I had no use for it.  After researching what apps were available like iWorks, Flipbook,  Note Taker HD that would serve a utilitarian purpose for my job.  I went ahead and got the iPad.  I honestly can't remember being more stoked about Apple since my first experience on the Apple IIe as a kid learning basic and playing games.  This muthafkr goes EVERYWHERE with me now along with my iPhone in my back pocket LOL!!!The clarity, visual smoothness, quality of the metal... Steve and his team really out did themselves.  As a reader, there can occasionally be some glare as I've come across when reading outside.  For a true person wanting an eReader, I think one of the other Kindles would work (Kindle Fire had glare too).

While I still love some Android tablets, thanks to now owning an iPad 3 after owning the Ipad 2 for a few months before that I can say that Android developers have to catch up BIG-TIME!  The design aesthetic and ease of use of the iOS system and the design philosophy that gets passed onto the developers who make the apps is beyond average.  I will give my impressions on a few different aspects that come to mind as far as superiority.Hardware----The aluminum unibody frame and simple design of the front just gives off a great feel of quality and even though its Chinese made it gives you an idea of what is possible for Chinese companies.  If Chinese workers can put together these high quality products, its only a matter of time before before they improve their design abilities and crack out well designed and quality over engineered products that will leave Western companies in the dust (Please remember my kind comments future Chinese overlords!)  Even the glowing green light for the FaceTime camera is a demonstration of superiority keeping in mind the amount of thought, time, and expense put into figuring out how to make it semi-transparent.  Google the article about the special machinery Apple custom designed and built just to accomplish that one simple task to make the light glow green through the material!  Its weight is very light considering the size of the battery and the retina screen.  The thinness is still pretty damned good considering all of the above features that are included.  Thanks to the uniformity of the device that they purposely kept, there are stupid amounts of available accessories that will hold, protect, or customize your hardware.  Genius!Software-----Web Browsing:Safari is one of the best mobile browsing experiences out there.  Thanks to HTML 5 I do not miss flash all that much since a lot of the video sites I thought I would be missing out on actually work pretty good.  I am able to use the browser to accomplish most tasks that there isnt an app for, or if the apps is crappy I can always pull up Safari and just act as if im on my MacBook Air.  Copy and post is really simple in the app also so that comes in handy a lot.Taking Notes:Thanks to tons of apps including Notability (which I highly recommend for all college students) that made me lugging around my backpack ALMOST irrelevant.  At the very least I could leave my laptop at home if I chose to and annotate slides from classes.Face Time:This program works great on the tablet.  I am able to have a conversation as close as possible to having the person in the room with me.  I've tried Tango, Skype, and Google Video Chat.  I just wish more people I knew had Face Time devices because I swear I would just stop making phone calls and just video conference with everyone.  Welcome overshare and having conversations in my boxers!Watching Videos:This is so convenient using ___ that I rarely use my laptop which has a bigger screen to watch videos that I have downloaded from the web including MKV files, AVI files, and mp4 files.  It has turned into my home entertainment center, car infotainment system, and my constant companion when I'm dying to watch my show and have to head to work.Calendar:Calendar works great with my Google Calendars and I can move events around and put in all kinds of related information.  Just works great, despite the fact that it relies on a Google calendar system in my case.Mail:Works great also.  Emails look good and I can easily copy and paste different parts of emails and pictures.Bottom Line:I started to write the bottom line simply because of the fact that I realized how easily I could go on and on about the different aspects of the device and speak glowingly about this tablet.  The point that should be taken from this, if you are reading this review and \"considering\" getting the new iPad just STOP and buy it.  I can guarantee that 99% of the population can come to love this device just as I have being a former Windows and Android fiend.  If I made the switch and feel this strongly about it, damn near anyone can be convinced that Apple does, not good but EXCELLENT products and software.

My first Apple product.  So far, I like it a lot.  Glorious colors, very fast downloads, enormous app store, I felt like a kid let loose in a candy shop.  I haven't had any problems with \"warm spots\" or \"hot spots\" either.  But it's not an unmixed blessing.For one thing, it's pretty heavy to carry around.  Walking 20 blocks toting an iPad in my tote bag is not the best experience I've ever had.  A smaller tablet comes in handy at times like that.For another, some apps and websites don't work as well on Apple as they do on Android.  Notable among these is Nook.  (I know nothing about Kindle because I've never used it.)  I have Nook for Android on my HTC phone and every feature works great.  There is no Nook store on Nook for iPad; to download books from Nook you have to go to the Barnes&Noble; website, navigate to NookBooks, and order from there.  Another minor cavil is that Nook for iPad doesn't have animated page-turning whereas Nook for Android does.  However, I didn't have any problem downloading my Nook library to my iPad; in fact, as soon as the app was installed, all my books downloaded immediately.  (Reading books, of course, is a lot easier on an iPad than on a cell phone because the screen is so much bigger.)The iPad bookstore is adequate; that's the most I can say for it.  It's nowhere near as comprehensive as NookBooks.  So far I've got 3 books on my iPad bookshelf and over 30 on my Nook bookshelf.I clicked on the Huffington Post website on my iPad.  Lousy scrolling and none of the comments loaded.  iPad has an app called HuffPo for iPad so I downloaded that and found out the videos don't load properly.  C'mon, Apple, you can do much better than that.  I haven't had any problem with any of the other websites I've navigated to so far.I was able to transfer all my photos and videos from my cell phone to my iPad with no problem at all.Actually, my biggest beef with the iPad is that the screen is a fingerprint magnet.  No, this screen is NOT fingerprint-resistant, I don't care what anyone tells you.  Five minutes in and the screen is absolutely covered with fingerprints.  The screen  protector for the iPad 3 is okay and solves about 95% of the fingerprint problem.  The smart cover is great for saving energy and keeping the screen free of dust and scratches.  Naturally the screen protector costs extra, but they did apply it for me at the AT@T store.  Good thing, too, or I would have gone bananas trying to get out the air bubbles.  Actually they did a commendable job.I bought the iPad with 4G from AT&T; because I don't have wi-fi at home and don't want to be limited to a wi-fi hotspot if I want to surf the internet.  The day AT&T; set my account up, the iPad worked perfectly until around midnight and all of a sudden it wouldn't connect to the server.  Next morning, it was working fine and continued to work all day with no problems until late that night when it wouldn't connect again.  I took it back to the AT@T store the following day and they told me AT&T; was having some server problems which should be fixed by that evening.  They were.  No connection problems since then.Overall, the iPad is a lot of fun.  I'm still exploring all the various apps it comes with (I absolutely love the Photo Booth) and getting used to how it works.  It's not perfect, but what is?Judy Lind", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "From  very disappointed to thoroughly impressed", "Author": "MikeT", "ReviewID": "R3MGCWXEA314YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my New IPAD 32G WIFI only right on time on March 16 and promptly unboxed it and restored my latest IPAD 2 backup.  My anticipation was excited by the many articles I've read claiming that the new display is everything from your first experience seeing HDTV to a blind man getting sight.Since I had shelled out the cash for the new one and promised a family pass down for the old I was out of pocket about $1200.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I turned it on and saw nothing dramatically different from the IPAD 2.  OK let's get them both out and compare side by side.  More disappointment as there seems to be almost no difference in the visuals.  My first taught was they shipped me an IPAD 2 by mistake.  Weight, thickness, larger camera and a serial number check proved it was definitely a 3rd generation tablet.I have now had it for more than 24 hrs and can positively report I have gone from totally disappointed to thoroughly impressed.Why:Visuals from a distance of about 3 ft. when I made my comparison looked about the same but when you put It on your lap to view it at a more normal distance the display starts to pop and everything from text to pictures to movies look phenomenal.The camera is finally capable of taking excellent photographs and the HD video is with anti shake is very high quality.  Bringing photos up in IPhoto makes them look more like a printed glossy and very 3D like.Internet sites load very quickly and seem more crisp especially when you blow the size up or view a video full screen.  Download speeds tested out about 50% higher than the 2 and so did the links.My favorite racing game \"Real Racing HD\" issued an update to run on the new iPad screen and so I tried it out.  WOW first off the cars in the garage now have a life like appearance.  The game itself played very smooth at very fast speeds and the visuals were outstanding.  Even games that have not been updated yet played and looked much better.I read a lot and it was important to me that the books and online articles would provide a better experience and less eye stain than the iPad 2.  Too early to tell about the eye strain but the text on iBooks was noticeably better and pages turned smoothly.  The kindle app text was also better but pages were jerky and did not turn properly. Checked out flip boards new updated app and again the articles were all eye catching and pictures were outstanding to look at.So now I've gone from very disappointed to thoroughly impressed and glad to hand over my iPad 2.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "More expensive than Apple Hmmm", "Author": "M.

I own an iPad 2 and I am sure that the iPad3 is a good piece of hardware.  However, in the listing specs Amazon lists this device as \"Series  New iPad\".  THIS IS NOT A NEW IPAD AS THE IPAD 4 IS AVAILABLE.  Do not be mislead and have to go through the hassle of returning the item when you find out that it is the old model and not the new one.  The iPad 3 has Suri which is a cool advantage over the iPad 2 that I own.  However the iPad 4 has Suri, a much faster processor, and a better camera for the same price listed for this model.  That is why I was fooled by this item listing.I should have read the comments (many of which were made in March 2012 coinciding with the iPad 3 launch).  That would have been the first hint of trouble.  I ordered this item earlier today and by the time I looked harder at the order this evening it was already shipped.

Delivery was quick and unit was delivered new.  So far she enjoys it a lot. She enjoys her streaming videos everywhere around the house.  Picture quality is great.

I will be calling Apple to see if there is some defect with this unit.  My old I-Pod was listed as 8GB and showed 8GB of total storage. The price for these units jumps a lot for every few GB's so feel a bit cheated with the loss of 3GBs.Second reason for only three stars is that these units don't charge with the USB connection to our normal desktop computers.  You have to use the AC adapter to charge it.  This might be due to the current required to charge these larger batteries so make sure you have an extra AC Adapter if you travel.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Needs an SD Slot Desperately", "Author": "N.Yorker", "ReviewID": "R2VF5HKIPONCH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The iPad 3 is pretty much the iPad 2 with a better screen and nothing more. That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "R2ZHC4O6M76E31", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my new ipad through apple.com.

Great looks but no personality. The IP3 is only a great conduit as a marketing tool to sell other Apple products and other online products. Secondly, It serves well as a limited entertainment device.For the price i paid for these devices, I won't list the things it cannot do because I will spare myself and others the agony of rehashing what they are.

The iPad is not one of these things, but it is still a very nice piece of hardware / software.  The problem with the iPad is the same thing that makes it incredibly useful:  It can connect to and integrate so many disparate services into a single interface, and controls me.  My work email, contacts, and calendar with my Gmail one, as well as any other account I configure.  That's pretty slick, and I can't say I've ever seen anything be able to do that before, on Windows or Linux.  The dark side of all this is that \"It KNOWS!\" ..... as it has now become a sentient being.  But, this isn't that dissimilar from Google, or any other service you use that tries to integrate all the aspects of your life and/or workflow.  Do I wish that all this data could be stored in such a way where the only person that has access to it is me?  Absolutely.  Do I understand the reality that I'm not going to get this kind of integration unless I give up my privacy and/or anonymity?  Yep.  Would I also be for any other alternative that comes up that can protect my privacy and rights more than it can when using iPad, Google, etc.?  Certainly.The reason I got an iPad is essentially because I knew it would \"just work\".  While I can't say that this has been completely true, it has been mostly true.  As a knowledgeable tech guy, I've been wowed again and again by what this device can do, with relatively little effort on my part.Gripes:- There is no Adobe Flash.  I don't give two flying fish about your business politics;  I want Flash, because so much of the web depends on it.  You can take your stinky business model and send it down a dark alley.- No streaming Amazon video. (EDIT:  Amazon released their iPad app on 2012-08-02, so this is no longer a gripe)I'm able to find apps (and am willing to pay some amount for good ones) that do what I want them to, and do it well.  SSH, RDP, VNC, SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and other acronyms.  That makes the iPad very useful to me, and I can subdue the rage that brews inside about these other things.  I think that it's possible that the iPad could be just as useful to me (if not more) and *not* do (at least some of the evil things) that it does.Steve Jobs was a visionary, and so was Bill Gates.  They both ripped off their ideas from other companies, and proceeded to market them better.  That's kind of the idea behind open source...  except with open source you give credit where credit is due.  So, I'd like to thank Xerox and IBM for the iPad that I've purchased.  It's really slick, but please back off on the evil.  Thanks!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's just a shame! Connection and Photo Syncing Annoyances", "Author": "Amazonian \"MM\"", "ReviewID": "R13I40ZE31Q9LP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I actually bought the Ipad 3, 64GB wi-fi version from Apple maybe a month or so ago.  Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in \"Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem\" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good media device for entertainment", "Author": "prash_142", "ReviewID": "R34K858YVJVGXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I generally dont buy Apple products becuase they are expensive.

I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded. I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2. So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one. Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was. I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot. I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side by side. I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard. I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue. Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm. Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it. This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book. My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot. I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2. They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem. He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me. But I'm certainly no expert. I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again. For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad. These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both. Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "New Ipad", "Author": "Judy Raley", "ReviewID": "R37S24STD9ATHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the generation 1 Ipad and just wanted to upgrade....It is great, the camera will be a plus also.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "mymindseye", "ReviewID": "R1EE8ZJ36RWETF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's an iPad with retina display.

His goal was to have me use it for college. It has definitely come in handy already and I am only a freshman. I bring it to class instead of my heavy computer, which, trust me, makes a huge difference when you are also carrying a lot of books. There are many uses of the Ipad 3 in a schooling aspect, and also some restrictions. I'll go into both in this review.I will start with the positives of the Ipad 3. First off, it is super lightweight. So if you are interested in carrying it a lot of places, it is a good option. It is small so it can fit in most bags or purses. I wouldn't write an essay on it, but when I need to look something up really quick in class or on campus, I have the option to. It is also good for taking quick notes on, or having something saved so you can show your professor.Something else that is really good about the Ipad 3 (which also goes for all apple products) is the choices of apps. I am taking a French class, which has an online textbook. However it uses Java, which most Ipad internet apps do not support. Through lots of questions and research, our teacher found out that there is an app that supports java. So now I can also access my french book from my iPad using \"Puffin\" internet browser. Other than that, safari and other internet apps are very useful, fast, and easy to use.The iPad 3 has a \"mail\" app that is used for your email. It will load the email straight to your iPad, so you can use the app instead of having to log in online. The best thing about this app is that you can load multiple emails to the app, so you can see all of your emails in one place. This might sound overwhelming, but you can sort them in a specific way. Say you have three emails linked to it, and you only want to see the new emails for two of them, you can select and unselect what email shows the unread messages. Something else that is good for school is \"math reference\" app.I am so glad I have the Ipad 3 because when I was in math class, and lost in the lecture, I could just open up math reference with my Ipad and get a quick answer. There are many helpful apps on the Ipad 3 that you can use for school, and a lot of them you can get for free, or for really cheap. One comes already on the Ipad 3, which is called \"iTunes U\". This is an app where you can download and save specifically education material. Such as books, courses, and educational videos. More and more now textbooks for certain courses are coming out with the \"kindle edition\" of their books. Which means if you have the Ipad, you can buy your textbook as a Kindle book and read it in the kindle app. This would make the books astronomically cheaper and of course, be much more convenient because they would all be in one place in a nice, lightweight iPad 3.The iPad 3 makes it very easy to change settings if necessary. All of the apps are easy to move around into the organization that you desire. They are easy to download, or delete. You can easily manipulate almost every aspect to your Ipad from the \"settings\" app. It is very clear, concise, and easy to use. Even for the technologically challenge. And even if you don't know how to fix something, you can just look it up online. There are tons of forums and Q&A; websites for apple products. There are also a lot of great shortcuts on the iPad 3 to get around easy. For example, the very left page is a search page. If you double click the home button a bar at the bottom shows up with your most previously visited pages. If the iPad is on lock, if you double click the home button, some options will appear for listening to music (if you already have music playing). If you click and hold the home button, you will have access to \"Siri\". If you click the home button and lock button at the same time, it will take a screenshot.Now for the negatives of the iPad 3. I have very little things to complain about with this product, but of course there are always a few inconveniences. One would be that sometimes the internet stops working. Most of the time it is just my campus internet failing, but sometimes its my iPad. Most of the time, just turning it off and back on will fix it right up. Very, very rarely my iPad will be slow or have apps quit unexpectedly on me. But again, this is very rare.Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I use it everyday. I am still looking for my class books to be kindle editions so I can just download them to my iPad. I am sure more will start having kindle editions soon. It is such a great thing to have for my schooling, it is incredible how many things you can do on it to help your education.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really love my iPad", "Author": "Uriel Galimidi", "ReviewID": "R3P51MYSFQ7LOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my iPhone for news video clip, reading books and documents, and surfing the web.

I always wondered why there was so much hype surrounding Apple products. It's a beautiful tablet, both the body and the screen. I just thought Apple would've shaken things up a bit instead of using the same mundane icon layout etc. The good thing is that it gets the work done that I need, the extras that I want are just not there. For example, no auto-fill when typing URL's, lack of Flash player, no built in HDMI port, no notepad for me to write on unlike the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the so-so sound quality. I've gotta tell ya, the Kindle HD sounds way better. There are some other features I wish the iPad had, but I won't get into that.What I'll say is that I like the sturdiness. It feels like they used good quality material to construct this. Battery life is simply amazing, I rarely need to charge it. It connects quickly to the internet. I like the sharp retina display, the ease of transitioning from one app or website to another. It's very smooth, the best I've seen in any tablet and I've purchased and returned a few in my quest to find a really good one (Kindle Fire HD, Blackberry Playbook, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & the Asus Transformer TF700T). I think Apple got me by the sheer volume of apps they have and so many of them are free! It's amazing to have such a vast array of apps that are dedicated to this one product.I like it enough to keep it plus I'm tired of returning tablets. I'll just have to learn how to manipulate it.

The backspace \"key\" is the only way to move the cursor and it erases characters. The touch screen allows you to place the cursor where you want it, but it isn't always responsive to my attempts to place the cursor where I want it; so this too can be awkward for making corrections etc. I ordered a stylus.

The device itself is wonderful, my only complaint being that it doesn't allow the use of Adobe Flash Player. Sarasota is in the AT&T; 4G LTE reception zone, so while riding in my car, or in a location where wireless wasn't available, their service was excellent and always dependable. While I realized that the 4G LTE service wasn't available everywhere, I assumed that their regular service would be adequate. Boy, was I wrong. My wife and I moved back to Upstate NY in June. During our drive north, there were so many locations where the AT&T; service was poor, that I had no use of the iPad for a good portion of the trip. Now that we're settled up north, I've discovered that there's no 4G LTE in my location, and the so called AT&T; regular 4G service is very spotty at best. I believe that the 4G service is actually 3G, but AT&T; makes it sound better by calling it 4G. Anyway, 2 weeks ago, we took the train down to FL to visit my wife's mother. I was amazed at how poor the reception was. Yes, there were areas, such as NYC and Washington, DC where the reception was great, but there were far too many areas where there was no reception at all. AT&T; is in the process of building up their 4G LTE network, but in the meantime, it's extremely frustrating putting up with the service they offer now. If you live in a large city, from NYC south, you'll be all set. If you don't, I would highly recommend purchasing the Verizon version. Please keep in mind that once you choose either version, you're stuck with your decision, as they're not interchangeable. So, the bottom line is that the iPad itself is a fantastic device (even without the Flash Player), but I have to remove 1 star because of the spotty AT&T; service.", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating doesn't work", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "RPUM2M6O6BOFY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Of course the NEW IPAD is everything the IPAD 2 is and better but I'm very dissapointed with the Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating Apple claims it has, the finger smudges are as visible and annoying as they were in the IPAD 2.Also Apple failed to inform that they had changed the polarity in the IPAD so not all covers in the market ( from third parties) activate the cover lock/unlock option in the settings menu.I bought a non -apple cover with my new IPAD and found it didn't work the lock/unlock option, when I tried the apple cover it did work.

With this issue however, there are apps you can get which will allow for texting to other devices. They aren't quite as simple to use(just a few more steps) but I'm sure that is by design.

I will sum all of the good into a nutshell and say that the iPad is everything Apple advertised it to be, and then some. The Retina is awesome, the camera is great, 4G LTE is quick, and gaming is brilliant. With the addition of Siri in iOS 6, this device is a good internal leap from the iPad 2.But here are my couple of flaws. The first is that the battery takes about 6 or 7 hours to charge. Basically you have to just charge it at night, then get 10 hours of use for the day, charge it at night..... Not too bad. My next critique is that the back heats up a bit. Its not painful or anything, but it can be a bit irritating. I would reccomend a case to solve this. Another issue us that the microphone is apparently in the dock connector. So if you want to make a facetime call while charging, or your hand is over the port while filming, the sound is muffled. My final problem is that the facetime camera is pretty awful. I guess it's usable, but even in great light it looks pretty grainy.As a whole I would reccomend the new iPad to everyone and anyone. While to the novice, it may appear the same as the iPad 2, it is surely a good, well rounded, fundamental update.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "ipad 3 16G with At&t; 4G - very good, not perfect", "Author": "Randomly", "ReviewID": "R2AMQ4QUUZYD82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new ipad is very good for one job, browsing the web: reading online news, books, searching various information. Typing is pretty good, but I did not try to do work on it. The spell auto-correct function is sometimes annoying. Some programs simply don't work on it. It is much faster than the Kindle fire. I find the camera 1) not so useful 2) possibly less good than in the iphone 4. It connects to a wi-fi network flawlessly.This being said, the casing is slippery and one has to buy a protective case. Once this is done, which is inevitable if you really want to make sure an accidental slip would not wreck your ipad, the options are restricted to hefty cases (I have the Otterbox Defender). At this point your device morphed into a heavy, bulky  not so elegant netbook without a lid. Add a screen protector (included) and the once superb display is just grainy but yes, extremely responsive. It is of course an extremely fast, responsive tablet, about the right size and worth 4 stars. However, not five, as it costs way too much compared to a laptop.A word of caution about 4G: I decided to pay more to have this feature, motivated in part by the new sharing plans from At&t; (which I did not sign up for yet) and the unreliability of cable internet providers in my area. 4G (LTE) does not really work everywhere on the At&t; coverage map. My iphone works perfectly on 3G but 4G is dead in my house. It is not clear to me if I can force the ipad to use the 3G network, but my first impression, from admittedly superficial research, is that a locked device would not accept it.The ipad is good, but not a necessity. Purists may disagree with a comparison to the iphone 4 (in my case). But the iphone does everything the ipad does; its form factor makes it amazing, versatile and indispensable.

Brunner", "ReviewID": "RIX6U3CS4S65U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 Stars For The New IPad! 1 Star For Best Buy's Lousy Customer Service!I  have both the IPad 2 and the IPad 3. There are differences between the devices, but the two devices share many similar qualities as well. If you have not bought an IPad, I highly recommend it. I have the wifi plus Internet on both of my two devices. I also have a steel case made by Logitech that is a Bluetooth keyboard. With this keyboard the IPad 2 completely took over for both my MacBook Pro (2011 model) and my dell.So, there are many things that are the same about the IPad 2 and the IPad 3. They look identical next to each other. They are the same size. They both fit my Logitech keyboard which is also a snug case. When turned off, the two devices are indistinguishable. Also, the apps seem to work on both although some of my apps seem to be a little off. For example, on WeRule the buildings have earnings that you need to click on to collect. On the new IPad, you have to click to the side of the buildings, and the picture seems to have trouble loading. Hopefully, the apps will update soon fixing these issues. The features on the two IPads really seem the same.There are a few differences that I can see on the two devices as soon as you power them up. First of all, the picture on the new IPad is very crisp. There are more details. It is hard to explain the difference. I only really see it when I put the two screens next to each other. When you put them side by side, the difference is striking. The movies and graphics look much clearer and impressive. Another difference is in the speed of the devices. I can see that the new IPad is faster. It runs certain apps faster like Plants vs Zombies. It loads apps faster than the IPad 2. Again, this is a very small difference only seen with the two together. The camera does take a better picture on the new IPad 3 than the IPad 2, but it is nowhere near what I would be happy with. I do not use either one for this except to FaceTime, and I do not see me changing that with the new IPad 3. My IPhone 4s has a camera that far exceeds the IPad 2 or IPad 3. If you do not have an IPhone, I am sure that you could find a much better camera for less than a hundred dollars. I plan to test it out more, but my first look did not impress me at all. The pictures were fuzzy. The new Internet does seem faster on the new IPad 3 as well. I have 3G on the IPad 2 and 4G on the IPad 3. In my area, the only Internet is 3G, but I swear the new IPad is faster. The Internet just seems faster.Honestly, I bought a new IPad 3 only because we wanted another one for my husband. I'm not sure if there are enough differences to say that I would get rid of my IPad 2. I was very pleased with the IPad 2 that I bought at Best Buy with their protection plan. I also bought my IPad 3 at Best Buy with the protection plan. It was $135, and it covers accidents as well. It covers if you crack the screen which I like alot. The people at Best Buy activated my 4G for me, and they were extremely helpful.Edited 3-20-12- a couple additional thoughts- the voice dictation is a feature that I'm not very impressed with. It is a good idea, but I would rather just type with my keyboard rather than have to go back and correct mistakes. The battery does not last as long as my IPad 2. I am using the new one exactly the way I have used the old one for the last year. The difference is about an hour less battery with the IPad 3 because of the improved display I guess. Another thing that I recently noticed is that the new IPad 3 weighs a little more. I only notice this after reading for a few hours on it. I started getting tired of holding it which I never did on my IPad 2. Also, I noticed that I have to slow down my typing on the touch screen on the IPad 3. I got pretty used to a fast pace typing on my IPad 2. The same pace on the IPad 3 leaves out letters. I only mention this because it happens quite a bit. I slowed down my speed, and the problem went away. Sometimes the autocorrect catches it, but other times it doesn't.Edited again 3-27-12 I just found out that Best Buy totally screwed me over when I bought my New IPad from them. The day that I bought my IPad; I was told by three Best Buy sales employees that I had to activate my New IPad in the store through them. In fact, I was taken out of my line to pay, which would have taken 5 minutes and put in a line that made me wait for an additional 30 minutes. I asked the employees if I had to activate it there since that was not the case with my IPad 2. I was told that I could not activate it on the IPad itself. Come to find out that this is a big lie/ scam cooked up by Verzon and Best Buy. If you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, you are set up with a post paid plan. There are people saying that Best Buy gets a kickback from Verizon to screw you over in this way. It is similar to a cell phone plan except that you do not have a contract. Well, why am I griping??With a pre paid plan that you set up directly on your New IPad, you can:1. You pre pay. So if I only want one month then I can pay for that one month and that's it. If I want another month, it is fine. If I do not, it is fine. On a post paid account, you do not have a choice. You are billed for each month and if you go over your data you get charged overage fees and if you leave and come back you get activation fees.2. On a pre pay plan set up directly on your IPad, you do not have any activation fees. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you have a 35.00 dollar activation fee. You also have this fee if you do not wish to have Internet for a month or two. You come back, and Verizon charges you another activation fee.3. On a pre pay plan you can access your account directly from the IPad. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you can only access your account through the Verizon website ( which is a total nightmare) or by calling their customer service ( which is another nightmare) trust me on this. I have been dealing with them all night.4. On a pre pay plan you have the choice of 1g of data for 20.00 dollars a month. If Best Buy activates your New IPad, you only have 2g for 30.00 or 5g for 50.00. This is what I was told by 2 Verizon customer service agents tonight.One good thing that I found out about my New IPad was the personal hotspot. I don't know why I never saw this before today. Oh, it is because if you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, the personal hotspot is not in your general settings menu until you turn it on. I think you go to general then network then turn on personal hotspot. This is really cool. You can then use your iPad's Internet as WiFi for other devices. We tried it with our IPad 2(worked beautifully) iPhone( worked beautifully). Because of this feature, I changed my opinion. I would upgrade from an IPad 2 to the New IPad. Just please do not let the people at Best Buy activate it. I am a Best Buy silver reward zone member, so please do not think that I am a Best Buy hater.

Buy something else!", "Author": "BozemanPhil", "ReviewID": "R19TG14JNDYMTO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my iPad about three months ago on the recommendation of someone working at a store that wasn't associated with Amazon.com, but I feel I must warn the rest of the world to keep away from this arrogant piece of <word I shouldn't use in an Amazon review>.Unless you get up and start your day by kneeling at your personal shrine to the Holy Trinity of Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, and Steve Jobs, then spend twenty minutes beseeching the Holy Spirit of Saint Steven's Ego, don't come near this thing.Lots of people will tell you what it does, let me take a few minutes to tell you what it WON'T.Multitask.  Playing a video or audio file in one window or tab?  Don't look at anything else!  As soon as you do, 99% of the time your playback or whatever stops.  And, if you switch back, the very idea that it might hold onto that data seems to be a foreign concept.  Download a 200 meg PDF file, read thirty or forty pages, then check your email.  Coming back to that tab leads to your iPad basically saying, \"Oh, you weren't done with that?  Well, we'll just have to re-download the whole thing from scratch!  And, even though it would be incredibly simple for me to do it, I didn't bother to remember where you were at.\"Flash, Java, and JavaScript. \"Why would you want to play anything like that?  Stephen Christ did not approve of such heresy!!  Therefore, you do not, either.  Therefore, you have no need to see them, use them, or have me acknowledge their existence on websites.  I shall block them out and make popup windows of large, empty frames to protect you from their sinful natures.  Praise Steve!!\"And before anybody replies and says that you can eat apps that will run flash movies, yes, those do exist.  However, either you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for them or you have to become the software equivalent of an AMWAY distributor to keep using them.Wi-Fi vs cell connection.  I purposely bought the model of iPad that had a cell connection, and, unlike a number of other reviewers, I haven't yet had any trouble with that cell connection and I do like the navigation software, but, given that Wi-Fi is generally free and cellular data generally costs money, wouldn't it be somewhat reasonable to default to using the Wi-Fi if there's a connection available?  Or have a place where I can set a preferred order to access these things in?  Oh, not in Blessed Saint Steve's world!  I have to turn my cell connection completely off anytime I'm using wi-fi, or it'll just keep pulling data over the cell.This damn touch keyboard.  Enough has been said about that in other places, but let me assure you, it's true.Keeping the screen clean.  If you're using programs that require you to input a lot of stuff or you're typing a lot, be prepared to clean your screen off every twenty to thirty minutes.  I just use a paper towel that I always have sitting by my iPad, so that's not too bad.  It's still an annoyance, though.Finally, how reflective this screen is.  Working against a white background isn't bad, but if the background is darker?  Well, looking straight into the iPad screen is like standing eighteen inches away from a mirror and trying to watch a t.v. program being shown on the glass.  Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of symbol that Blessed Saint Steve, Hope For All Mankind. Is watching over us, I don't know.  What I do know is it's annoying as hell.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.I'm just hoping that, when my financial situation improves to be able to replace this embarrassment to progress, I'll be able to borrow a hunting rifle from a friend of mine, and, with five or six rounds, put this iPad out of my misery.Who knows?  Maybe I'll film it and put it online.(In QuickTime, of course, so all of Saint Steve's worshippers are allowed to see it.)", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "sent back", "Author": "Barbara", "ReviewID": "R3QJZC83KIAVHE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There was something wrong with the Ipad and had to send it back for refund.

I got the wifi model and I realize now that this thing is pretty useless without it. We don't have public wifi at work. Also, I thought I would feel more comfortable using it in public. I actually feel like a big dork that should be socializing instead of staring at a big square without internet. It's also a bit of a pain to lug around since I don't have a need for a suitcase. I'm not about to start carrying a bag just for my iPad either. I do however think that if I ever can afford to go on vacation again after purchasing this , that it would be great to share photos on.  You know, show off my vacation and my iPad all in one day.The screen on this is simply amazing. I would also add that this is my 1st iPad, so even I can really appreciate and be awed by its shear awesomeness. I take pictures and this just makes them come to life. Until you zoom in on a high res photo that you took yourself, you cannot fully appreciate just how insanely crisp the screen is.On a side note, I was tempted to take it back because I hated the color of the bezel. It is the white model and really distracted me at 1st. After having it a week, I can happily admit that I am over it and kind of enjoy the white. The only thing that bothers is that it does my match my MacBook or iPhone. Boohoo.P.S.
