When working, it is a great deal for the price. However, Axess customer service is horrible, and I had issues with both tablets I used.The first tablet I ordered never synced the clock or any of my app data when coming out of sleep mode.  Dealing with Axess was problematic, as their solution was to send me a link for a convoluted process to update the firmware using a laptop and some of their software.Couldn't get that to work, so Amazon worked an expedited return and reorder. The second tablet did not have the same defect as the first, but hung when I was trying to use an app downloaded from Google Play. The tablet restarted and could not advance past the splash screen. Axess did not have a way to externally reset the tablet, even to factory defaults, and their only solution again was to upgrade the firmware. When that didn't work, they recommended another return.More trouble than it's worth, so I will not be trying a third time.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "NJDEL35", "ReviewID": "RMJOV0K3RBNJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet met all my expectations.
