{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why I changed by iPad for a Xoom", "Author": "Luis Delgado", "ReviewID": "R1OI95WNZGHYBP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before starting with the review, please let me tell you that you should be very skeptical about many reviews out there that speak bad about this product. Many of these reviews seem to be written by people that have read the specs of the product but have never actually used it. These reviews made me very skeptical about buying the Xoom, to the point that I bought it only because I could return it. After 6 days with it I'm not giving my Xoom back, and here's why:Construction and appearanceThe Xoom is solid and well built. Some reviewers point out that the back panel is made of cheap plastic and that it easily gets very dirty. This is not true. Grab a Xoom and you'll feel and solid and well built product in your hands. The Xoom also weights pretty much the same as the iPad 1.ScreenOne of the things I love about this tablet is the screen. The screen's resolution is higher than the iPad's and it has a slightly higher pixel density, so text and pictures look sharper and clearer. Some reviews out there say that the screen lacks contrast, brightness and color saturation. This is false too. I see no difference in terms of color quality and contrast with respect to the iPad.PerformanceAll graphical components and animations are fluid. Switching between apps is a darling. Even loading up apps and immediately switching through them at an insanely fast pace (which you would not do during normal use of the product) is smooth and instant. Multi-tasking is a charm. You can switch from apps at the touch of a button, and all apps remain in the same state as when you left them. This is real multitasking.Web browsing experienceThis is perhaps the point where the Xoom really outperforms the iPad, and by far. Websites load up fast and are beautiful to watch on the screen. What you get with the Xoom is a REAL browsing experience. Websites work and render as they were designed to. Things that I can do with the Xoom that are not possible with the iPad include: 1) Accessing Flash content, 2) uploading files to websites. For example, I can login to Facebook and upload a file or a video. This is not possible with the ipad, since it has to accessible file system. 3) Access advanced features such as Facebook chat console. 4) Multi-tab browsing. 5) Browsing websites with panels (like Gmail, where you have a left panel with your emails and a right panel with content. 6) Word-wrapping text. Zoom in in to see text as big as you want and the Xoom can rearrange the text so you won't have to scroll sideways to read it all.Integration with cloud servicesNaturally, the Xoom integrates effortlessly with Google services. When I had my iPad, I paid for mobileme services, but to my surprise, the integration between the ipad and mobileme was not satisfying. Perhaps this comes as consequence of Apple being mostly a hardware company and Google being, well, you know how good Google is at offering services. Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, Google Talk and Voice, Buzz, Latitude and searching features are all outstanding.Google MapsGoogle maps is definitively way better on Android than on the ipad. Those familiar with Android know that I'm talking about. On the Xoom you'll get an oversized version of Android Google maps, where you can select different layers to see (Map, satellite, terrain, traffic, latitude integration), look up businesses and get all their contact information and other data, pinch, zoom, tilt, pan as fast as you want and the Xoom will keep up rendering and displaying the map with no graphical delays.File SystemDownload an app like Astro and you will get full access to the file system. This is a great feature that is missing in apple products. For example, I can take HD pictures or video with my cellphone, transfer them to the Xoom via bluetooth or wifi, browse the file system to look for them, where I can choose to open them up on the photo gallery app, any other app that processes images, or select the files as attachments to send with Gmail or any other file-sharing app you may have installed. You really have access to a small 32gb hard drive and you can do inside it whatever you want.Internet tetheringThis is another point where many reviews are mistaken. I have an unlimited data plan with my cellphone provider and I used my phone to tether my ipad and connect it to the Internet. I bought a wifi-only Xoom, and for me it was critical to preserve this function. I use an HTC Desire HD phone that sets up an adhoc wifi network. The Xoom connects to it flawlessly.User Interface and ease of useThe ipad is simpler than Android. This is a matter of fact. Using the ipad is very easy and it is a charm for people with no technical skills. Android, on the other hand, offers much more functionality and customization capabilities. This means that menus and the interface in general have more options, more features, that is, more items that can confuse you. I have no trouble using Android 3.0 and I love all the power it gives me. However, people with very limited skills using electronic devices will prefer the ipad because of its simplicity.Battery lifeBattery life in the ipad is better than on the Xoom. This should not be a surprise, since the battery on the Xoom has to power real multi-tasking and Flash websites which suck the battery up. Whereas I got 2-3 days of battery with the ipad, I get 1.5 with the Xoom. If you can charge your Xoom every night, this should not be a problem.AppsApp store has much more apps than Android market. However, so far I have been able to find an app for Android that does what I did with the ipad. I am missing nothing, even though some apps for the ipad are not available for android so you will have to look for an app from a different programmer. I do not use the Xoom for gaming, I use it for work. Thus, I had no games on my ipad, and have no games on my Xoom. If you are a heavy gamer, the lack of apps might be a disadvantage for you.NotificationsThis is another point where the Xoom clearly beats the ipad. Instead of the lousy pop-ups of the ipad, the Xoom offers you a notification center on the bottom right corner of the screen, which is accessible at any time, and displays alerts and notifications from email, calendar, facebook, skype, google talk and others.Why I didn't give the Xoom 5 starsI rated this product with 4 stars. Here's why:- There is still no support for the SD card. One of the disadvantages of the ipad is that you can't increase its storage. The Motorola Xoom does have a port for inserting an SD card, but this feature is still not operational (apparently, Android does not support it yet).- Apps that crash are more frequent than on the ipad. Even apps that natively come installed with the Xoom have crashed. Now, don't get too alarmed with this, it does not haven very often, and recovering from it is something that takes about 2 seconds. However, it is clear that 1) Android 3.0 still needs to get some bugs out and is a less mature product that iOS (which has been around for some years now), and Google needs to work better on the quality and stability of the apps people publish in the Android market. Although Apple exerts a tight control on the apps and content you can get (one of the reasons why I decided to ditch Apple), they do make sure the apps on the app store are reliable and stable.- You need a special cable to charge the Xoom. Though it was a microUSB port, you cannot charge the Xoom with it. Although this is not a disadvantage compared to the ipad (you need that big white connector all the time), it would be great if you could charge the Xoom via USB and have to carry one cable only.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "All Things Considered, Simply THE BEST 10\" Tablet", "Author": "joel k", "ReviewID": "R16X75Y4IHZY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Please note that I'm including links to products mentioned in this review so that you can easily read more about them if you wish.)Some people criticize the Motorola XOOM (Motorola XOOM) for not being as thin & lightweight as several other 10\" tablets.  If you want the thinnest & lightest-weight 10\" tablet, you may wish to consider an Apple iPad 2 (Apple iPad 2), Samsung Galaxy Tab (Samsung Galaxy Tab), or ASUS Transformer (ASUS Transformer).  However, in my opinion, if you want THE BEST 10\" tablet, get the slightly thicker & heavier XOOM ... all are fine choices, but I believe the XOOM is the best of them, and costs significantly less than all but the ASUS, which - although not quite as good as the other three - is worthy of consideration.As a point of reference, I have two fast & powerful notebook PCs, an upgraded & very potent MacBook, and two high-performance Android phones (yes, I know it all may sound like a bit much, but it comes with the territory for the type of work I do), yet - as a very busy computer consultant who's constantly on the go, working one-on-one with hundreds of clients - it's the XOOM I use the most ... all day, every day ... for email, scheduling & calendaring, accessing websites, editing photos, note-taking, scanning, faxing, uploading & downloading files, running countless apps, and so much more ... its design, build quality, performance, and reliability are outstanding.I use a 32 GB internal memory XOOM with a 32 GB Transcend microSD memory card (Transcend 32 GB Class 4 microSDHC Flash Memory Card), which is my recommended configuration for a 'premium' tablet ... however, any high-quality tablet should serve you well, regardless of its memory configuration ... if your tablet accommodates a memory card, it's a good idea to store everything you can onto the card, thereby freeing up as much internal memory as possible, which helps maximize the tablet's performance (the same applies to mobile phones).As you may know, many people claim the Apple iOS app market has more apps from which to choose than does the Android app market ... the problem with this rationale is that quality is more important than quantity ... and the Android app market is superior in quality for one simple reason: Google owns Android (not surprisingly, Google also owns the mobile component of Motorola, arguably the premier manufacturer of mobile devices ... the ramifications of this are more appropriate for another forum) ... suffice it to say that the universe of computers and all things computer-related is a 'Google universe' ('Googleverse') ... as such, all of Google's apps are available for Android, and other app developers are, of course, joining the Google bandwagon.So if you're unsure whether to go with the stylish-but-sinking Apple (which means choosing an iPad) or the rising Android (which means choosing the XOOM, the Galaxy Tab, the Transformer, or any of the many other good Android tablets, including the very nice & terrifically-priced 7\" Amazon Kindle Fire (Amazon Kindle Fire) and the excellent & affordable 10\" Toshiba Thrive (10\" Toshiba Thrive) or 7\" Toshiba Thrive (7\" Toshiba Thrive), the choice is simple: choose your favorite Android tablet.  (That said, and in the interest of fairness, the iPad is a wonderful device with bazillions of terrific apps, and if you don't mind overpaying to go the Apple route, I think you'll be pleased with it.)A word of caution regarding the XOOM: If you're inserting a microSD card into the XOOM's memory card slot, be very careful to position the card properly before pushing it in ... the opening is large enough so that you can inadvertently push the card into the XOOM without getting it into the actual card slot ... thankfully, this should not adversely affect your XOOM in any way, and it leaves the memory card slot available and fully functional ... you can retrieve the mis-inserted card by opening the XOOM's case using a Torx T5 screwdriver, locating the card (which is about 7/16\" wide), and VERY GENTLY removing it.Another bit of advice regarding all tablets (and smartphones): Don't assume your device needs a screen protector ... most people who use them believe screen protectors provide a good defense against scratching the glass screen ... however, consider that protectors are made of plastic, which scratches easily, while the glass screen is highly-resistant to scratches (just don't try testing its scratch-resistance with diamonds or other known glass-scratchers, and your screen should be fine!) ... screen protectors also attract more dirt, dust, and fingerprints than non-protected screens, and they're far more difficult to clean than the standard glass screen ... and protectors can dim the display (even if just a relatively small amount) ... so why use them at all? ... well, if they provide you with additional peace of mind, go ahead ... they're harmless.  Given all this, if you prefer using a screen protector, I recommend GreatShield Ultra Smooth Clear Screen Protector Film (GreatShield Ultra Smooth Clear Screen Protector Film) ... it's made of sturdy, high-quality materials, it's custom-fit for your specific device, it's washable & reusable, removing it leaves no residue on the screen, it doesn't smudge easily, and it's barely noticeable if applied properly.  As with most screen protectors, it can be difficult to remove all the air bubbles when applying it ... but if you're a screen-protector fan, & you can get the air bubbles out, I think you may like this product.I'm exceptionally picky and demanding regarding the products I choose to purchase & use for myself, and recommend to my clients.  I thoroughly compare specifications, reviews, performance, advantages & disadvantages, price, design, build quality, battery charge, ease of use, and much more ... all factors tangible and otherwise ... it's well worth the effort, particularly because I rely upon these items as a demanding computer professional, and - just as importantly - because I insist upon providing my clients with the very best information and recommendations, so that they can make the most educated and informed decisions for their needs, preferences, and budgets.  All things considered, the Motorola XOOM is - in my opinion - simply the best 10\" tablet available ... and it's certainly thin & lightweight enough for most people to carry around and use very comfortably & easily.(If you're wondering about my second choice, it's basically a toss-up between the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the Toshiba Thrive ... both are available in 10\" and 7\" sizes, and they're close runners-up to the XOOM ... the Galaxy Tab is consistently - and deservedly - among the highest-rated Android tablets, while the Thrive's 10\" version has a number of very cool features, including being one of the few good tablets - if not the only - designed with a user-replaceable battery ... technically, you can replace the battery in any tablet by using the proper tools and a bit of care & effort, but you may risk voiding the product's warranty ... kudos to Toshiba for removing this unnecessary restriction.  The Thrive tends to receive mixed reviews, but I respectfully maintain that it's a wonderful tablet, and it's nicely priced.  Should you choose either of these (or any of the other tablets mentioned in this review, for that matter), I think you'll be thrilled with your choice.And I'd be remiss if I didn't emphasize that if you're looking for the combination of best tablet/lowest price, I recommend that you look no further than the Kindle Fire ... while somewhat proprietary, and not as potent & feature-packed as more-expensive tablets, its combination of quality, features, performance, ease-of-use, and price make it a flat-out bargain!)Should you have any questions regarding the purchase and use of a tablet, or any other computer-related issues (including Macs, PCs, smartphones, apps, and more), please feel welcome to contact me at your convenience (i'm easy to find on the internet ... personal computer lessons in berkeley, ca ... joel).", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola Xoom not perfect, but perfect for me...", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R9ZPKLQ1X6EA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying I bought my Xoom at Target for $399.99, which included a free case.  I did not like the case, so Target refunded $35 and I effectively bought the Xoom for $365.  At that price point, the Xoom is very, very hard to beat.  This is a 32 GB machine, with a slot for harddrive expandability and 3G/4G capability and mini USB and HDMI output ports that do not require a propietary cable.  All the other hardware specs are as good as competing (and more expensive) models.  At the initial offering price of $800 it's easily beatable, and at the current $500 there are other formidable options.  However in $400-$500 price range, all other offerings are 16 GB not 32 GB.I won't go into the iPad vs. Android tablet comparisons.  Apple makes a great product, but their closed business model has too many drawbacks for my needs and wants.  I absolutely abhore having to go through iTunes for everything, and with the lack of expandability the iPad was off my tablet list.  16 GB of storage is not enough and I am not going to pay $650 for a 32 GB model.The Android app space does have it's issues with fragmentation and not knowing which apps are best suited for tablets, phones, etc.  However, I am willing to suffer through some of the growing pains in order to have a more open and useable hardware platform.  The Android Market place has it's issues, but there are TONs of great free apps and it's improving everyday.With that said, I love the Motorola Xoom.  I agree with many of the reviewers that the display is not on par with iPad and Samsung tablets.  It's no slouch either.  On axis it's just as good in my opinion, but off axis viewing suffers.  It took me a return to get a Xoom with a display that I liked.  I am wondering if Motorola has second sourced displays and if some Xoom's have better displays than others?  I was not happy with my first one, and took it back.  I am more than happy with my current Xoom.  I will say that the Xoom display does not have the 178 degree off axis viewing angle of the IPS screens on the Galaxy and Asus Transformer.  However, for the large majority of viewing angles the Xoom display is very, very good.  The Xoom does have Gorilla Glass, so that is a huge plus for me.I tried the Asus Transformer, based on the positive reviews online, however I took it back after seeing backlight bleedthrough and having sensitivity issues with the touchscreen.  Both of those issues seemed to be common complaints of the Transformer.  I have not had any quality control issues with the Xoom.  Overall, the Transformer seemed like a nice machine, but the touchscreen sensitivity issues (having to press multiple times to register an action) scared me away.  Reading that this was not an uncommon thing kept me from considering it, despite the positive reviews.The speakers on the Xoom are top notch, compared to other tablets.  They are rear facing, but that hasn't been an issue for me.  The build quality on the Xoom is also top notch.  It is heavier than other tablets, but I do not mind that at all, and it is not an issue.  Thinness, thickness is not a big concern of mine.  The Xoom is plenty thin and comfortable to hold.The one drawback is the power cable.  It is proprietary and looks to be undersized for mechanical purposes.  I talked to the guys at Best Buy and they said they have not had alot of issues with the port pins breaking, etc.  Online, a few people have had some broken charging ports, but most of those have been due to accidents.  There does not seem to be a widespread mechanical problem with the charging port.  The advantage is that charging times with this port (it charges at 12VDC) are very fast.  The Xoom does not charge via the mini USB port, for better or worse.  Many models do not charge via mini USB either.I opted against the Samsung Galaxy because the 10.1 inch models do not have SD slots and have 16 GB harddrives at the $450-$500 price range.I have been very happy with my Xoom, and at $400 I don't think there is a better tablet out there.  I did sacrifice off axis viewing, but on axis the display is splendid.  If Motorola had used IPS display technology this tablet would've been homerun at any pricepoint, at $365 it's a steal.  Very solid machine.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Hardware, and Android is slowly growing up.  Really 4 1/2 stars", "Author": "Nanohead \"nanohead\"", "ReviewID": "R1HYZOTN80QXAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm always baffled by the minutiae that people complain about.  As computer tablets become more popular, the height of nitpicking seems to have moved into the stratosphere.Like many others here, I churned through several Android tablets (Asus, Toshiba, then Xoom) to find one that I really liked. I tried to keep my expectations aligned with the reality of yet another new gadget coming onto the market.  I don't have negative feelings toward Apple, although I refuse to pay the 50-100% premium that many of their products command.  I was going to buy an iPad, and spent quite a bit of time testing and playing with both friend's iPads, as well as at the Apple store.  It is truly sexy hardware, but the software has a toylike quality to it that doesn't suit my more geeky brain.I have an android phone, and am definitely enjoying it, even though it has its quirks.  I'm not religious about technology, nor am I brand loyal to any company. I'll try just about anything. So on to my opinions about the Xoom.Hardware:  Just beautiful, and wreaks of quality.  The fit and finish is truly premium.  It feels good in your hands.  There are some quirks, like the cheesy charging port, that is destined to break.  Also, the MicroSD card slot is about as idiotic design as I've ever seen (its like brain surgery to remove the \"dummy\" card and insert the real one).  I like the on off switch location, it feels good in the hand when you pick it up.Screen: Also beautiful.  I am always baffled at how people complain about fingerprints...  Its a FINGER tablet for goodness sake.  You use your FINGERS to operate it.  OMG.  Yep, its a little shiny, so there can be a tad of glare when around certain kinds of lighting.  But its really no big deal, you can just move it a millimeter one way or another and its fine.Responsiveness:  Very fast, especially now with the 3.2 update.  I just like how things work.Software:  I actually think the tablet build of Android feels smoother and more natural than the phone build does.  Its nicely suited to the enhanced real estate of the tablet, whereas it now feels cramped on the phone.  I like Motorola's corporate sync feature, which works well with my Exchange server. The Google browser is decent, syncs with Chrome bookmarks, although it takes forever.  Android market is getting better every week, and I really like Amazon's Android appstoreFunctionality:  It does everything nearly all computers do.  The touchscreen experience is wayyyy different than the keyboard experience.  I never reach for it if I'm going to type something, but use it for email reading, web browsing, and miscellaneous stuff.  Games are decent, but not all are set up for tablet form factors yet.Overall:  The Xoom is great.  Other than a couple of hardware quirks, its a stellar device.  Android for tablets is more technical than Apple's tablet software, which is one reason I'm drawn to it.  I find it extremely flexible, as well as very suitable for business use.  Its like anything else, you need to get used to any new complicated software based product, before you really know whether you and it will get along.  Android does have a way to go before its brainless like Apples operating environment, but all in all its really nice, especially if you like tinkering.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a crap shoot....", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R3O7B08JUZ71V8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a XOOM and loved what I saw.

This is my first tablet, and my first Android device. Having had an iPhone for 9 months now I grew accustomed to how OS4 & OS5 both worked. But the Xoom with Android 3.2 straight out of the box was very easy to navigate.  I am already an Amazon Prime member so I purchased Mediabridge - High Speed Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 Feet) and was able to Stream an Amazon HD movie right away onto my LCD 1080p HDTV. The Xoom has 720p definition and looks great on TV or on the Xoom screen. It is comparible to the Ipad2 screen but not as sharp as the IPhone screen.Motorola has already confirmed it will be upgrading the Xooms to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4) a few months after it's official launch so this tablet has a long life ahead of it. I am extremely pleased with the Android platform. Unlike the Ilocked products, it is easy to customize to your liking. New Apps are coming out everyday also.I have not had a chance to check out the blue-tooth capabilities yet but its good to know I can add a blue tooth keyboard and USB mouse if I ever want to. I presume blue tooth printing is another feature I have yet to check into yet but any peripherals I decide to purchase I know won't be as expensive as Apple products.Some websites still get confused with the various Android OS builds and default to a mobile themed platform but with the xoom you can customize it to always display one way or the other, turn flash on or off,etc. Android is how I wish my PC OS would work.

Wischkaemper", "ReviewID": "R3Q6Y5R34X67BQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my Xoom one week ago, and have been rather impressed. I was previously the owner of a Viewsonic G Tablet, which is a similarly spec-ed Tegra 2 device, though without Honeycomb and possessing a significantly inferior screen.Overall, I'm extremely impressed with the device. The screen is excellent, especially compared to the Viewsonic. Viewing angles are quite good, and the 1200x800 resolution is fantastic. Honeycomb is great to use, and really does seem to be a good attempt at using the increased screen real-estate more effectively than a smartphone. There are a few nitpicks I have with it here and there, but overall the software experience is quite good. Most programs run fine, though there are a few out there that either crash immediately, or are poorly programmed on the developer's end, resulting in a sub-optimal tablet experience.My favorite addition to the Honeycomb interface are the new widgets - particularly the email and calendar widgets. It seems like a rather minor thing, but if you're using your tablet for actual work instead of entertainment, having quick access to your inbox and messages can make a large difference. The two-pane Gmail application is likewise a big step up from Froyo/Gingerbread. The new notification system is also very appreciated for those using the tablet for actual work, though I think I personally preferred the notification system on WebOS when was using it.There are a few minor gripes I have, however. First, there are the general issues with the microSD slot not working on release. I'm an early adopter and can deal with things not being at 100% when they're released, but I do generally expect minimal functionality on the hardware. More annoyingly, as an engineer, this seems like a problem that just shouldn't be that hard to fix.Also, I've experienced a couple of troubling application crashes in apps that should be rock-solid (Market, Camera, Google Talk while video chatting). I understand a random game written by a third-party developer crashing my system, but I would expect Google-written apps on a Google branded platform to perform flawlessly - or at least not lock up so badly that they force a hard reset of my system.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the Xoom, but a) I think it's a bit expensive compared to some of the other Honeycomb tablets that should be hitting shelves over the next month or so and b) I'm a bit disappointed that some seemingly easily fixable bugs are taking this long to squash. That said, I was willing to spend the extra money to get the full \"Google Experience\" and receive updates sooner than anyone else. Unless that is something important to you, or you need a Honeycomb tablet right now, my advice would be to wait a month or so and see what other options are available.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Xooming in the Right Direction", "Author": "Frank N.

I tried the YouTube app out for a little bit as well and it worked well.

I read all the reviews and discovered that people either loved it or hated it.  Personally, I LOVE it.  I already had an Android based phone (Samsung Fascinate), so the transition to the tablet was pretty easy for me.  I think that alot of the negative reviews are from 'converts' (Apple users switching to Android).I think that it is important to note that the Android OS has a bit of a different user experience than the iPad. The iPad presents page after page of apps that you scroll through and open.  The Android has more of a 'desktop' type interface that you can customize to your hearts content move stuff where you want it, change your wallpaper, and then these cool little things called 'widgets'.  Widgets make the tablet form factor actually USEFUL.  I can add tweetdeck, weather, calendar and email widgets to one of the pages of the Xoom and they update in real-time.  I know the iPad has animated icons, that show how many new emails you have and even what the current temperature is, but Android takes that further - I can actually SEE the last few emails I have received, I can see the current temperature, as well as sunny/cloudy/stormy - for the next 5 days - the last 5 updates from my Facebook and Twitter feeds, CNBC Markets in real-time and my upcoming tasks on my calendar.  AND, I can do all of this without even opening an app.  That's the power of Android and Widgets.Now, if you are 'converting' from Apple (iPhone, iPod, or iPad), I would say to be prepared to sit down for a while and learn this OS.  It is SO much more powerful than what Apple lets you do with their OS.The single biggest complaint about the Xoom and Android tablets in general - is the lack of apps for the platform.  My experience thus far?  I have absolutely everything I personally want on my Xoom already.  I don't however, use it for watching movies - so the lack of NetFlix (as of the date of this post) isn't a deal-killer for me.  The support of Flash is much more important to me than is NetFlix (which will have an app out soon anyway, I understand).  That's the other thing - I have been going to the Android market every couple of days and there are ALWAYS new apps that are being released that support Android 3.1 (latest release).  Angry Birds is already supported (and downloaded), so who really needs much more than that?  ((grin))I purchased the Wi-Fi version of the Xoom as I use it mostly at home and at work where I have wi-fi readily available.  I also have a hot spot feature on my phone that I can enable when I'm out of range of free wi-fi - that allows me to get updates on my Xoom anywhere there is a 3G/4G connection for my phone.Overall, if you like to (or would like to) have control over your tablet and customize it for the way you work or play, Android is the way to go.  The Xoom is a fantastic example, as it is well-built, has a 5MP camera on the back and a 2MP up front for conferencing, and has a TON of fun stuff to download and install already (I have only paid for 3 apps so far - many, many free apps available for the Xoom) with more being introduced virtually everyday, then you should at the very least consider this tablet.  You won't be disappointed.I highly recommend the Xoom for purchase consideration.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "My fifth review.....and loving it more than ever!", "Author": "Lisa M.

Last Christmas I put a motorola wireless keyboard and wireless logitech mouse (to be used together) on my Amazon wish list and received both of them for Christmas.  I did not use them (actually keptforgetting I had them) until last week (7/1/12).  Stupid me!  These are the greatest accessories to compliment your Xoom.  I find that using a real keyboard is a must have/helpful in some situations and wanted to try it out.  It didn't disappoint.  Using the keyboard when on facebook or typing a lengthy email is a great asset. It also came in handy while trying to choosesome actions where your fingers just won't work on the first try.  Using a tablet is great, but sometimes we wish we had a realkeyboard and this is the perfect accessory for this tablet.  So sometimes I have a tablet and sometimes it seems like I havea laptop.  Either way...I love this accessory and it works like a charm.  The mouse and/or your finger works without having toswitch anything over. Just turn on the keyboard (or not) and the mouse (or not).  The beauty of all this, it all fits in my purse :)4th review 6/2/11....had another weird situation this time with my magazine/book subscriptions but before you think it was the Xoom...it wasn't.  This time it was my fault...stupid, stupid, stupid move on my part.  Going through my Xoom and exploring some apps that I had not previously explored and I came across \"Gallery\" full of my photos and many many magazine/book photos and artwork and magazine/book covers tons of them so I figured why do I need all this taking up my memory/storage space so I start to delete and delete and delete them, of course I thought maybe these needed to be there so I did a little test and themags were still there that I had deleted...OF COURSE THEY WERE!! but with no artwork/photos left in them.  Arrggghhhh!! Whathave I done?!  So after a hour of trying to figure the whole thing out I gave my Xoom to my gadget savvy husband and asked himto work on it.  After about 15 minutes he called Barnes and Noble and had a service tech help him out.  After a few tweaks they were able to redownload all my books/magazines and everything is back to normal.  So the reason for this embarrassingreview is to let you/anyone know to NOT just start deleting stuff from your Xoom unless you are certain you are NOT deletingimportant very much needed data....dummy I am :)3rd review (5/10/11)...had a bump in the road with my new Xoom :(  It locked up on me during the Honeycomb startup, have no idea why but there was nothing I could do and  the Motorola (help desk) could not help.  So after the disappointment and the wonderful support from Amazon (sending me a brand new one, it was still under the 60 warranty/return policy) I got over my disappointment because I love this product even though my first one hit a bump in the road.  While setting up my replacement I also learned some new things and lost ONLY the photos/videos I had taken with the Xoom (I never did save anything to my PC, sothat's my fault).  I was able to retrieve everything else (all apps, etc).  The more I use it, the more I truly believe I madethe right decision on purchasing this product.  Thank you Amazon for the quick response on my replacement (by the way) no questions asked.  Sorry I had to mention the start up issue, just in case others come across this. In reality things happen andyou can even purchase a $80,000 car and it could be a lemon....so hopefully there will be no more issues with my new Xoom.2nd review (April 2011)...after using the Xoom for about three weeks now.  Very very impressed...the other day I sad down to use my Xoom and didn't know what to do first.  There's so much to do and soooo many things to learn.  This just happened to me this evening and I had to update my original review because of it.When I first received my Xoom I went into my email account (through Comcast) and the website just wouldn't load right and there was flashing of articles and other stuff (videos) and disappointed I left that website and mentioned to my husband that it would not load right.....right away he said nooooo let me have your emails forwarded to your gmail account (which is used when you first use your Xoom). A bit disappointing that I couldn't use my normal email screen, but whatever I let it go.  Been using the gmail email only when using my Xoom.  BUT tonight I was updating my Xoom with my favorite bookmarks and low and behold I went into my original Comcast email just to see what would happen...WOW it adapted to my Comcast account I can access ALL my emails, folders, address book and more without the ads and crap that tainted my view the first time...I was so impressed I just had to mention it.  Adapting ...how spooky and impressive at the same time1st review(March): I'm not a techy, a young adult or a \"gotta have that\" type of person, just a housewife, a working mom of two children and in my40's with that said, here's my review:I have not used a Ipad of any kind or Android product...but do know many many people who have, all around me everyday and because of that and reading many reviews I went with the Xoom WiFi only.  What a great decision I've made.  This product is quality throughout.  Love how fast and accurate each move is and I've impressed the Ipad/Adroid(cell phone users) with my Xoom.  Brought it to work this week and didn't see it for hours.  Comments from my co-workers: \"Boy this is fast\", \"Look how sharp the screen looks\", \"This is really nice\", \"Oh, you gotta have Adobe Flash\", \"This feels like really nice quality\".My decision to buy the Xoom over Ipad (which I came really close to buying) was because of the following:QualityAdobe flashHoneycomb technologyProduct can be updated in your own living room (as updates come along)Can do just about everything a laptop can do, just smallerCan't wait to see:Netflix appsApps to allow printing (probably out there, but not sure yet)What new updates will come alongWhat new games will come alongWhat new accessories (ex: covers, cases, bags to help protect my Xoom)Favorite things about my Xoom:SizeHow fast it isAutomatic updates on current saved appsTransferring my current personal email to the Gmail Xoom account automaticallyThe coolest apps:Disaster Alerts(around the world, Scanner (police,fire,emergency around the US), Radio app to listen to your favorite stations without actually going into each website, and many more.The built in camera/video player.

I obviously chose the Xoom and here are my reasons why.For $599 I get better hardware than the similarly priced iPad2 32gb version. For example, a dual core Nvidia Tegra chip which runs at 1ghz vs the A5's 800mhz per core. Superior front and rear camera that can record in HD and has a flash built in as well as digital zoom ( along with a nice toggle for lighting options and video/photo effects ). A higher resolution screen. A built in HDMI out and access to my files stored on the Xoom without having to use extra software ie iTunes. Strong and resilient Gorilla Glass. And the option to use different file formats, namely flac and avi through apps in the marketplace.The Operating System on the Xoom is more of a user interface than iOS is and Honeycomb has been around a month, while iOS is almost at 5. I can switch between different tasks effortlessly on the fly and the browsing is phenomenal compared to Safari on iPad. I've got 5 \"deskspaces\" that I can customize to my liking and everything feels smooth and natural. The virtual keyboard is very good, but I suggest that you purchase a thumb keyboard...it makes things flow that much better. ( I feel one step closer to the computers used in Minority Report ). Also, Flash support!!!!It does need more apps, and I mean Honeycomb Android specific apps. Although, that's not primarily why I purchased a tablet, it's something the detracts from the whole tablet experience when considering the general consensus.I feel like the Xoom and the iPad may both be tablets but when I think of what I want in a tablet, the Xoom is closer to what I have in mind.For the record I do own an iPad as well.

Some have commented that it is heavy compared to other devices, but I think it makes it feel sturdy (sometimes things that are too light feel cheap).  The placement of power key on the back is weird but not horrible and easy to feel so you don't have to turn it over.  Not all your normal apps from your Android phone will work with Honeycomb, but a lot do.  Some apps won't show up in the market, some just don't work right (or not \"optimized for use with a tablet\"), and others force close before they even open.  Angry Birds is SWEET on a big screen, so is MiniSquandron.The MicroSD card slot doesn't work yet, but it will with an eventual software upgrade (unknown date of when that will happen) but with 32 gigs of space unless you have videos or a ton of music and pics, its a lot.

Still thinking?", "Author": "Tiger", "ReviewID": "R1T3UTVJ629L5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am sure a lot of you are wondering, what's right for me? iPad2 or Xoom? This review isn't going to list battery life, camera comparison, and all the other spec related stuff, because, there are a lot of other reviews out there like it. Also, personally, I think it really boils down to what type of person you are and what you intend to use it for.Of course, these are just my personal views, but hopefully it should help you decide what's right for you. So here it goes.--If you are a \"reader\" type:I recommend the iPad2.The iPad2 has a more standard(closer to 4:3) ratio, and it's main mode is portrait mode. Naturally, reading books and viewing magazines are perfect. And there are more e-Magazines out there for iPad2 than for the Xoom. The only exception is if you like reading manga(comics). The Xoom's wider screen ration allows you to view 2 pages at once in landscape mode. It works out quite nicely if you set your zoom setting to fit width.--If you are a \"multimedia\" type:I recommend the Xoom.The Xoom's main mode is landscape mode, and it's screen ratio is definitely more wider than the iPad2. This makes it perfect for viewing videos, but it makes it slightly less than ideal for holding it in portrait mode to view magazines and such. In addition, although not supported naturally, you can get free apps from Android Marketplace to view multiple formats of videos like DivX, Xvid, and such. If you have non-standard videos (as in, not bought from iTunes), or if you like to watch foreign animations with subtitle files (SMI/SRT), Xoom is definitely the way to go. You won't be able to do this on the iPad2.--If you use Flash a lot:I recommend the Xoom.Flash does not work on iPad2 and it probably will never support Flash. If you (or your family/kids) like to play web-based Flash games, or frequently use websites loaded with Flash, iPad2 won't cut it. Xoom is the way to go.--If you buy all your stuff from iTunes already:I recommend the iPad2.It is easy to rent/buy movies/music on iTunes, and Apple does make it easy. Although you can still copy and play all the stuff you bought from iTunes (unless it's DRM-protected) on the Xoom, if you like the way your iTunes work with your current Ipod, iPad2 might be better for you.--If you like Fancy/cool stuff:I recommend the Xoom.To be honest, the iPad2 interface is easy, but very boring. You just get a bunch of icons. And more icons. And even more icons. Which you just click to run programs. It has been like this since the first iPod touch. On the other hand, the Honeycomb OS (Android 3.0) on Xoom is great. It's got different styles of widgets you can put on the background, showing you real time information at a glance. It's also very fun to interact with these. Honeycomb is a platform specifically targeted for tablets, and it does it well.--In short, if you like to read and love using iTunes and buy a lot of stuff from iTunes anyway, iPad2 would be better. However, if you are more multimedia oriented and like to view different types of videos and want the flexibility of Flash support, Xoom is the way to go.And if you decide to get the Xoom, I also recommend getting \"Tablet Keyboard Free\" from Android Marketplace. It's a free keyboard with split screen keys, which allows you to type with your thumbs while holding the Xoom. The paid version is in Amazon Appstore as well - Tablet KeyboardBoth iPad2 and Xoom are great devices, and they both boast high speed dual core processors with large display screen. Battery life is good on both devices, and I really think it's less about \"which device is the better device\" but more about \"what do you want to do with your tablet\".Lastly, as for comparing this to other Android tablets, the Xoom beats all others hands down. If you are going to get an Android Tablet, definitely get the Xoom. The Honeycomb OS (Android 3.0) is much better than other earlier versions of Android (Froyo and such).

I ended up purchasing the Xoom (pronounced Zoom just in case you are wondering...I was curious so I looked it up on the Motorola website)and I totally do not regret it.  There are four main reasons  why I choose the Xoom over the iPad 2. These reasons are not in any particular order.1. Cost: I purchased the WiFi only Xoom with the 32gig of memory for just over $500 from walmart (I was to impatient to wait for shipping so I was willing to pay a little more and have it right them). The 32Gig, Wifi only, iPad 2 from walmart was about $600. The 32gig Xoom is the same price as the 16gig iPad. I did not purchase the Xoom just because it was cheaper.2. The Xoom has a microSD card slot. I put in a 16gig card so now I have 48gigs of memory. Do I love the was the Xoom handles the microSD, well no. It is not as user friendly as I'd like it to be but I am willing to bet that it will get better as time goes on.3.  I like Adobe Flash.

I agree that there are not as many apps available in the Android market as there is in the Apple market...but the Apple products (iPhone, iPod, iPad...) have been around a lot longer that the Android market.  It is only natural that there would be more available. So far, there hasn't been a single thing that I've wanted to do on my Xoom that I haven't be able to find an app for.

I got mine very early on, and I use it every day, so I have plenty of familiarity.As for the device, its outstanding.  The touch screen responsiveness (in tandem with the resolution of the screen) is wonderful.  The Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and sound are all great.  The gyroscope and cameras are fair, but I don't honestly care about those.  The speed is very smooth and impressive.  You don't really need the awesome processor, but hey, why not.  The RAM is not much, but I have never noticed issues since Android is so extremely light.  I also like the aspect ratio of the screen, which is more of a pleasing, long rectangle than the iPad.  The main negative is that it feels a bit heavy, but it also feels very rugged, and the battery lasts a long time.The operating system is great.  It is basically just Android with a UI supped up for the big screen.  The main thing is the Browser.  It's gotten a lot better since 2.x.  Since the latest update, its outstanding.  I honestly feel as comfortable with it as a desktop.  I have tried some 3rd party browsers like Firefox for Android, but the native Android one is so terrific.  As for the rest, I like the multiple desktops and how the icons are managed, the very well organized and complete device settings interface, and some of the little included apps like Gmail.  There is no real bloat ware, just a few free games.But, contrary to what I have heard, there are plenty of great apps that, when added to Android, make this like a real operating system.  File explorers like ASTRO, Text editors like Ted, FTP Clients like AndFTP, Security apps for password protection like Perfect AppLock.  I have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and to me this thing is basically a tablet that can transform into a nice netbook.  I am also very happy with the support.I would say if you want an Android tab over an iPad, this one is a good choice, especially since they dropped the price.  I would also not be scared of getting any Android tablet instead of an iPad, they are awesome.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motorola Xoom Convert", "Author": "Justin Granger", "ReviewID": "R9SK2KN9NABN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm sure most of us who purchased the Xoom were waiting for something better than the iPad before jumping into the tablet scene or, at least, I know I was.  I was waiting for news on the iPad 2 to see the new features it would have.  Once I heard the news about a WiFi only Honeycomb device, I became intrigued and began to follow rumors and news I could find on both devices.  Eventually, I listed my pros and cons before making my purchase.  My needs were:I wanted to:browse the internet without having to use a touchpad or a mouse.play all of my favorite emulators (these apps have since been shut down on the Market place)tether to my cell phone's data network and, since I don't have AT&T; or Verizon, it made sense to go with Android, imo.use bluetooth with gaming controllers to play games wireless without touching the screen.playback HD movies that I moved from my computer to the tablet.browse the entire screen through HDMI-out onto my big screen TV without any limitations in place by the developer IE: all apps view on TV.access to the file system via USB on my computer and in-device.be able to download, install, browse, etc everything in my system (for the most part) within the device without relying on a computer to do so.flash capability even though some flash sites drain everything from resources to battery life.be able to read eBooks through Kindle or Google Reader apps.be able to import or purchase comic books and read them through a comic book reader.be able to upgrade the memory in the tablet.So, after researching and reviewing tech specs, opinions, and the like all over the web and through family and friends, I came to the conclusion that the Motorola Xoom met all of these needs for me.Like a previous reviewer said, there is a learning curve to the device and within the first week, I was hardly impressed.  I kept tinkering with it and and learning the device to the point of becoming reliant on it for simple web browsing, reading, and gaming.  I'm a desktop PC kind of person over a laptop so this device made perfect sense for me and gives me a break from sitting at a desk and can accomplish these things at my leisure and then go back to my daily routines elsewhere.  The battery life is pretty decent for me.  Typically lasts about 5 - 6 hours of constant use ie: moving apps.  Strictly using the reader apps, it will last longer, obviously.  The one thing that blew me way was how good the cameras were.  The front facing camera has a lower megapixel lens so the quality there is a little less but it's perfectly fine for a webcam and the picture taker on the back of the device takes decent quality large pictures.  I did not expect these to be on a device like this yet.  I'm glad Motorola invested in them.There are a few negatives for this device.  Firstly, Honeycomb is not a mature platform yet and there are a ton of apps not yet optimized for the tablet.  Obviously, this will be fixed as it gains in popularity, and the ones that are optimized are very nice.  There are creative apps that you can make use of day 1.  However, it's obvious that Google jumped right into Honeycomb and the developers are still playing catch up.  Over time, more and more apps will become optimized and make use of the entire screen but, as of now, there are quit a few apps that run in cell phone mode ie: small blocks on the screen or the apps take up a corner of the screen and the layout repeats throughout the rest of the screen.  Not a deal breaker but expect these types of situations if you purchase this device.The other negative I have is that the screen sometimes becomes unresponsive.  Occasionally, the apps stop working and the screen just does not respond to my fingers.  A simple tap of the standby button to turn off the screen and another tap of the same button to bring the screen back on always cures this dilemma but it's strange that this little quirk happens.  It does not take away from the experience whatsoever although when showing off the device to friends and explaining that quirk makes the device seem disappointing when you're trying to get the word out.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Xoom, Xoom, Xoom", "Author": "K.

Firstly and most improtantly I am a convert and no not ot Apple but to the whole Tablet PC idea, I believed they were just another electronic toy and served space between a Smartphone and Laptop.  They are in fact little PC's and can serve up a good PC experence and take up little space in the process, they are reasonably quick and with the right Software should be able to perform most LapTop functions reasonably well.  Course were not talking raging speed here but more than adequate for most task and easliy capable to surf the web, chat, e-mail etc.Rather than to discuss my preference for Tablets I'll just say up front I like the Xoom, the Operating System, Performance, and Unlike Apple delivers a overall better experence if your looking for a complete product versus one that has been Nutered and all the decisions made for you what is and is NOT important, then the Xoom is your Tablet.  All the basics are there and those not working yet will be during the Update process at some point, as for the IPad some of these Basics are NOT there and will never be possible even with furture Updates.  In short what may be trival now could be the difference between a true Laptop replacement or one that partially replaces it and Annoys you when a Function doesn't work cause someone said you can't have it.Of course there are things that the IPad does better, the Screen on the IPad is Spectacular but on the flip side the Xoom is Beautiful (no deal Breaker here), The IPad is simplistic, you know the difference between what is and is not and who makes the decision ( a personal decision)!

She likes to browse the internet, play games, and manage her emails.  But she doesn't like the bulk of the dell laptop she has to lug around,not to mention the slow performance and software issues we recently had with it.  So I went down to our local office supply store (sorry Amazon) and purchased the wifi version last weekend. Let me say that this thing is awesome.  The OS is super responsive and the internet is blazing fast.  Setting her email up was easy and it ties in nicely with the Google calendar she already uses.  Maps are beautiful and Angry Birds is crazy fun!I was a bit worried that she wouldn't get the OS because she is used to the iPhone, but she got it right away.  And it was nice that I was able to link my droid x marketplace apps to the Xoom.  She hasn't complained about the weight of the unit and the power button location has not been an issue.  The only complaint I have heard from my wife is that the volume buttons are a bit stiff.  After I used it I would have to agree, but it seems like that is the only gripe we have.  Heck, I am even starting to look for it on my downtime so I can play with the unit!Now, this is just my review of the Xoom and I won't get into how it compares with the iPad2 because I don't own one. I am sure it is a fine product, but the Xoom meets our needs and does everything we would like it to.  I guess the only thing I can say is that price point and availability somewhat contributed to my decision.  Overall, we are extremely satisfied with the purchase.  I just cant wait for the marketplace to get flooded with tablet optimized apps!Update 1 - Flash works beautifully on the unit.  I was able to watch the latest episode of Fringe without any problems.

But since I go to college and have to lug something around for my books and to type up notes with. This thing works amazing!Let me get into my breakdown of things I love about this thing.OPTIONS!: Loads and loads of options, this tablet is so customizable down to every little detail. Android has an amazing set of Apps, you can change anything. You can download anything. You can play anything. Basically, this thing is so close to a laptop it is scary. Which is what makes me change my tune about tablets some.Battery Life: From the first time I fired it up and charged it. It lasted about 10 hours. And it is very efficient at saving battery life, big thing is dim the screen brightness when you don't need it. And let it go into standby mode when not in use. Some days, I'm at school all day, and by the end of the day it still has juice left. Love itFeatures: This tablet I chose over others because of how versatile it is. Micro USB, and Micro HDMI ports. front and rear facing camera. Volume rocker on the side. Head Phone Jack. Well placed speakers. Many tablets have the front and rear facing camera the volume rocker, head phone jack and a spot for a charger....maybe even 1 type of USB connection, but an HDMI port! wow. And like i said everything is well placed and well thought out.Quality: This thing feels very well built and very high quality. Motorola is usually known for good quality products. This is very sturdy. The screen quality is vibrant. Everything looks sharp.The only con I can actually think of is the weight, because this is one of the heavier tablets out there, but realistically, to me all tablets are light. I dont have any issues with the weight or carrying it around. But for some it could be thats why i listed it.Overall, the reason why I picked this over say, an Ipad is because this has so much more versatility. Sure the Ipad has its set of amazing apps, but it is so limiting. You can only do your music through them. you cant really customize it outside of the stuff the set up for you to customize it with.

I won't get into the whole adam fiasco too much but after waiting 2 months I got a defective unit, it took another 6 weeks to get my replacement. I was no longer interested in it after almost 4 months so I bought the xoom. I really love Honeycomb and the build quality.

I have never owned an ipad so I can't compare it to an ipad like people like to do so often. with all the bad luck I've had with tablets lately I was fully prepared to be returning this within its 14 day return period, if it was too buggy or I was very unhappy with it.

Wilsted \"Amarron\"", "ReviewID": "R149SCMJ23P5A6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I fully agree with the guy who made the chess analogy. This is a great device but you need to be able to look beyond the obvious to use it well. An instruction manual bigger than 2 pages might be nice. I am a former iPhone user (very satisfied with the switch) and have played extensively with iPads owned by colleagues. Very limited in their productivity and Apple's idea of multi-tasking is laughable. They mostly just seemed like large game-boys to me.Xoom seems to lend itself more to productivity and is much closer to the laptop replacement that i am looking for in such a device than the iPad, though not quite there yet.Anyone who complains about the lack of apps hasn't actually tried downloading apps for it. As of 01May2011 I have 96 non-sprint specific apps on my Evo phone. of them only 6 have not work perfectly on my xoom. of the 6, 4 didnt make full use of screen space, and one i could not get to install. Not a single one was downloaded from the \"tablet specific\" store. So yes while few android apps are specifically made for Tablets, at least 90% of them seem to work just fine even if they are not \"optimized\".Those who complain that it doesn't play all movie formats need to do a little research as there are a number of great free apps that work perfectly on xoom and will play all movie formats i have tried. I recommend MoboPlayer. Its free and works for every format i have thrown at it.For music; Try Mixzing. could use an interface uplift but works on all sorts of music formats including my music i thought was eternally corrupted with iTunes formatting and DRM.Battery life has been great thus far. i did not recharge it at all for the first 4 days fairly heavy use. I understand that when watching movies, you can expect 10+ hours. I cannot confirm this but i can confirm that i have gotten at least 15+ hours of what i would call normal usage (some office work, some movies, some games, a lot of downloading, etc) and this took it down to 30% battery life.The weight issue is null to me. I have held it in my hands performing a variety of functions for hours on end and experienced no fatigue what so ever. The convenience of Flash far out-weighs the extra 4 ounces this thing has over other devices.With the Flash issue fixed, i currently have only one technical complaint, but i am confident it will be addressed soon. That of course is the still lack of ability to make use of the SD slot. This one thing, in my opinion, makes Xoom, non-comparable to the iPad. So many reviews focus on internal memory. Once the SD slot is activated, Xoom memory will be essentially unlimited.Other than that i still feel that the price is a big hurdle. As far as tablets go, i believe this will give you more bang for the buck than the leading tablet, however 600 bucks for a device that is not yet a laptop replacement still feels steep to me. If not for the fact that i am in the military and getting deployed in a few weeks, i would never have purchased this at $599. Still when it comes to convenience of stowage, tablets are hard to beat.-----------------Update-------------------------Bought mine with Deployment looming. Now 3 months into deployment its absolutely the most satisfying purchase i have made in years. Use it for everything including talking to my wife with google talk regardless of which device (computer, phone, or her own xoom) she is using.  Also of note, a friend of mine is now on his 3rd Ipad began because they are so fragile. Apparently they cannot withstand the slightest drop. I have dropped the xoom from my top (approximately 8 feet) rack and merely a few scratches and no detriment to functionality. Also of note, i tend to find better wi-fi signal with my xoom, than my liberty buddies that use iPad. Laptops still get better reception unfortunatly, but they have to deal with their limited battery life.Pros-Flash player-Customizable interface-great screen quality and pixel count-great mobile movie player (download moboPlayer and learn to use it)-excellent wi-fi and blue-tooth reception (essential when you are deployed and spend liberty looking for a place with wifi)-expandable memory-**Durability**-**Battery life** (easily get 12 hours of video)Cons-SD slot available but still read only-Price -> I personally believe that the correct pricing for any tablet should be in the $200-400 range for full functionality.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect - but very, very close.", "Author": "ScOObydoo", "ReviewID": "R1WJE1LAOZBXPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Reviewing the Motorola Xoom could be a pretty unfair list of things this tablet lacks, so lets get that out of the way right away.The Xoom has an SD slot, but it doesn't work (yet). It has the newest version of Android (Honeycomb), but it is pretty unpolished. It runs tablet optimized apps, but there are only 100 or so of them.OK - with those things, you'd be forgiven if you felt that the Xoom was a bad purchase. But you'd be very, very wrong.The Xoom is in my opinion the first REAL alternative to an Apple iPad. Yes - the Samsung Tab came out last year with Android, but it really was nothing but a big version of their phones. No real tablet apps, a phone style browser and very basic hardware.The Xoom is what Android tablets should be - the right size, awesome battery life, perfect balance of speed and power and a very, very good first version of a tablet OS from Google.Honeycomb really is an amazing OS - if you now Android, you'll find your way around just fine - but enough has been tablet optimized to make it \"new\" enough to let go of its Android Froyo/gingerbread past. Thankfully, Google kept the best parts of Android in it - but updated things when needed.Things that came from the phone versions: the awesome homescreen with widgets and multiple screens, the notification bar.Things that were radically updated; the browser, the market and the email client.The browser still renders pages brilliantly - they really look just like on your desktop. The email client uses the whole screen, and features side by side folder lists and preview and the market was completely rewritten for tablets. And yes - Flash does make a massive difference -- it means sites actually work instead of just displaying half of their content.The price is a big issue - it isn't too high, but there is no option for a cheaper (16GB) version - you either pay $599, or $799 (for the 3G version).As someone who purchased two of these, I'm not the best person to ask whether the price can be justified - I invested $1200 in them, and I haven't regretted it once. In my opinion, neither will you.In closing, I do have one or two things that annoy me personally - the charger is proprietary, and uses a very small pin.

Albeit not as often, apps on my ipad2 crash as well...they just don't tell you when it happens and merely returns to the home screen.Flash was not shipped with the xoom but I downloaded it from the Android market immediately and it works flawlessly. I have been watching internet videos off the chrome browser.The only time I use the ipad is when I am facetiming with my family who live outside of us because that is one of the most convenient features of it...otherwise it is just a big iPod.The live wallpaper is one of the best features of android...making the device appear \"alive \"and so much sexier.Widgets is a must have...especially the YouTube one. It is designed like a Rolodex and let you flip through the videos you subscribed to.Notification and multitasking work great together - eg. You are watching a video and you get an email notification,  it tells you who sent it with a small pop up and you can click on it to check on it...when you are done, all you do is press the back button and you are back to the video...no need to reload the app like the ipad does all the time.Almost all the android apps for phones work on the xoom even though there are only 67 apps designed for android honeycomb. And the apps work great.On the negative side, the xoom is heavier than the ipad..using it as a handheld gaming device can be tiresome...that's why I bought their case/stand which is quite useful (much better than the ipad magnetic cover.The other negative is HD video. The HD video you shot with the xoom looks great, but HD video has to be ripped using the basic profile at a lower bit rate or else it will be choppy.otherwise, SD contents play just fine.HDMI cable has to be bought separately, but that is a great feature...looks beautiful on my led TV.

Mejia", "ReviewID": "RKPPARIGV7XMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In person, the Xoom has an impressively large screen: like an angler with a fish, you feel you need to spread your hands really wide to hold it. In fact, the screen is only just wider, and very slightly thinner than the iPad's; yet the overall effect of the 16:9 aspect ratio (compared to the iPad's 4:3) is that you're holding something that's designed in Cinemascope. This turns out not to work in its favour, but we'll come to that.Turning it on is just a matter of ... where's the button? For reasons best known to themselves, the Xoom's designers have hidden the power button on the back, on the top left, recessed into the chassis. (Rory Cellan-Jones at the BBC had the same perplexed reaction.) If you need a laugh, hand one to someone who's never held one, and see how long it takes them to find it. One minute is good going, by which time they will have prodded the USB output socket, HDMI output socket, and power input socket, and volume buttons (all of which, sensibly enough, are on the side of the device).OK, power on. And now we have Honeycomb - Google's 3.0 version of Android. It has clearly been almost completely rethought for a tablet (though there are a couple of leftover references to \"phone\" in the system: rather than the PIN or \"draw a pattern\" screen of an Android phone, you get a padlock sitting in a circle; you have to drag the padlock to the edge. (Neat, though it puzzled some people I tried it on: they pressed the padlock, they pressed the circle, they didn't find the \"pull the padlock to the edge\" idea self-evident.) The default home screen on the Xoom is a deep blue background. As on the Android smartphones, there are five home screens; Honeycomb, though, arranges them in a carousel - you start in the centre, with two empty ones either side to which you can add apps when you swing them around, or use the button in the top right menu.And also in the top right menu, there's a button with \"apps\", which takes you down one level into an \"apps folder\". How does that make sense? Why is Honeycomb giving us a pit into which apps are dumped, while also presenting you with four completely empty screens? It's not as if there are too many apps: the default installation has 24 buried in that folder, while each of the five screens can take at least 48 apps.This is bad user interface design which reduces the chance of people using apps - and hence the tablet. Forcing the user to head down into a folder and then make apps return to the surface to use them means you're less likely to find them. Some people (because remember, some people who use computers and tablets are not that savvy) won't notice the \"Apps\" tag in the top right for quite some time. The most powerful setting on any computer is \"default\": it's what most people use most of the time. Google isn't doing itself any favours with the Honeycomb defaults.The Xoom does well - it achieved as much as the iPad. Ten hours, more or less - although note that Flash will halve that. You think you don't spend all your time watching Flash? If you open a lot of commercial web pages with adverts or (of course) watch YouTube, you're hitting Flash. More on this later.Flash aside, the battery life is longer than a typical working day. You can tweak the life by changing how quickly the screen turns off, dimming the screen, turning off Wi-Fi, and so on.Note though that setting the screen's off delay will mean turning it on a lot - and reaching around for that power button quickly gets tedious. In fact, that back-mounted button is my major criticism of the Xoom itself; yes, it falls under the left index finger if you pick the device up in the correct orientation, but you won't always. And if it's lying down and turns off, picking it up is a pain. Contrast having a button on the front and/or side (both, with the iPad): much easier to activate.I can also say that OS based it looks like Android was the good choice for this tablet, and i hope they can bring a 7 inch tablet \"Motorola\"", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love my xoom", "Author": "Patrick J Guiett", "ReviewID": "R3HNVDDUOSB3MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited till I've had my xoom for 2 months so I would have a more complete evaluation of it.....and I LOVE IT!

While the Transformer is a lovely device, it has a large black bezel surrounded by a smaller metal band.

The Xoom has been criticized for its weight, but to me the weight is offset by its (at least compared to the Transformer) slim profile.

The Xoom is a bit rough, even after the 3.2 update, but not so much so that it is unusable or even unpleasant to use.  I think most of the issues stem from apps that don't play nicely with honeycomb.  The camera is actually decent, more so than most smartphones I have used. The photos are clear and have good color. Its only weak spot is that it doesn't handle movement so well. Your subject needs to be relatively still to get a truly quality photo. But all in all, still good for a tablet camera.

I've been waiting to get a tablet PC for a year and I'm glad I waited. Although the Xoom is a wonderful device, I agree with others that it doesn't feel like a totally \"finished\" product yet, it feels a bit rough, but hopefully that will change in the coming weeks.There is no question that the operating system is different, as others have pointed out, and there is a bit of a learning curve but I feel like the difference has been exaggerated. In my case, in less than 24 hours I'm already totally comfortable using it (this is my first tablet PC by the way). The Xoom is refreshingly fast when surfing the web. One negative point is that a lot of \"important\" apps like Yahoo Mail are not available to download at this point (as of 3/29). Hopefully they will be added soon.The camera is okay but don't expect to take great pictures with it (reminds me of the Evo's camera, which everyone was praising when it first came out, but I have the Evo and I feel like it takes pretty bad pictures).I'm a fast typer and I have to say that the keyboard is extremely responsive for the most part (the only exception I've noticed is when you type a word that contains the same letter twice in a row, in which case it will frequently only register it as one letter). You still can't type anywhere near as fast on the Xoom as you can on a regular keyboard but it's a huge improvement over smaller Android devices.One thing that I was surprised was that the Xoom only has a micro USB \"input\" slot so you can plug the Xoom into a PC but you can't plug a camera into the Xoom, for example. (If there is a way to do that then I'm not aware of it).This unit will definitely not replace my laptop because there's a lot you can't do with the Xoom (like any type of serious video editing, etc) but for instant access to the internet it's a wonderful unit.One thing I'm disappointed about is the fact that you can't watch movies from Netflix on this device. Apparently, there are different apps that you can download that allow you to do that but every one of them (that I found so far) costs around 30 bucks. Does anyone know of any free ways to watch netflix movies on the Xoom?4/6 update: I spoke with Netflix's customer service a few days ago and they told me that a Netlifx App is about to be released \"very soon\" (as in days or weeks according to the guy) and he told me check netflix's blog every few days to be notified of the announcement.Also, I still like my Xoom a lot but there are frustrating aspects. For one, even though it was running very quickly and smoothly the first few days, I find myself having to reboot it, sometimes more than once a day, because it gets very slow for no apparent reason and sometimes the browser seems to stop loading pages altogether. I have three different browsers installed on it and all three stop working (yes, wifi is on and the Xoom is showing as being connected to it). Hopefully, it will become more stable in the next few days and weeks with new software updates.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Xoom - the perfection", "Author": "C.

I should have bought this one from Amazon as I have usually shopped for the last 12 years on Amazon.  Amazon is simply the best place for online purchases.  Since Target offered the 32GB Xoom for $399 with a free Motorola tablet case worth $40, the price was irresistible.  Therefore, I decided to get the Xoom from there.For the Xoom, I don't want to talk all the good things about it.  There are so many good reviews being posted in this forum.  All I can say is that this Xoom is the best.  Now, with the most recent software update for Xoom, I can read files stored in a micro SD card that can be inserted into a dedicated slot in Xoom.  The brightness of the screen is one of the main factors convincing me to get it after looking into other tablets. I really enjoy it!  I just have so much fun with it.Overall,  flash player is something this tablet as well as other Android ones can support while it is solely restricted in Ipads.

Now, I am a deep and thorough convert.  You should take my cynical entrance into Xoom-ownerdome with as much gravity as the fact that I am a pretty technically savyy person who had done massive research prior to purchase and has continued to evaluate options since.  I've been comparing notes daily on a friends progress with his ipad which he bought almost at the same time.  As I found apps and ways to do things on the Xoom, I've also figured them out for the ipad on his behalf.Generally speaking, the Xoom and the ipad can both do everything that we've found necessary and desirable. I have found them equally easy to set up and work with.  Having said that, I am not easily daunted by computers in general.  Still, if I were picking a device for my computer-illetarate grandmother, I would have no more hesitation handing her a Xoom than an ipad.  In fact, certain features of the Xoom would make me choose it.  Desktop widges and the general behavior of the desktop are one.  The ipad has given me a respect of apple products that I had previously lacked.  HOWEVER.  There was one reason and one reason only why I went to buy a tablet at all -- and that was to be able to hand write on the screen with a stylus, while a third party app recognized my writing and turned it into text.  The app in question work very well and exists for both devices.  However, there's a crucial difference.  On the Xoom, this app is allowed to become one of my collection of input devices.  There's the default on-screen Android keyboard which I love.  There's the handwriting pad.  There's a sliding keyboard.  I can use any of them in any application.  So, I can choose my favorite note taking or word processor app, and use any of the keyboards with it.  In ipad, everything is locked down and super-proprietory.  That's Apple's core philosophy.  So, no, you can't give a brilliant third-party app access outside of itself.  This is an example only, and an elaborate one, but you can extrapolate from there.  There are all sorts of options and controls available to me on the Xoom, that are locked down in the competition.  It might not bother some, but it would drive me nuts.  I am a huge proponent of customization.  Computers should conform to our work styles and make us more productive that way. I don't buy the answer that if I want to do something one way and it's not supported, then there's something wrong with what I want and need to learn the \"right\" way of thinking from a devices design limitations.  It's a major and irreversable turn off for me.  With the Xoom, there are many abilities than are missing elsewhere and would be barriers to my progress had I gone with a different device.On the physical aspects, it is a little heavier.  I wish that were not so, but I care more what's on the inside.  I can do almost everything on the Xoom that I can do in a full laptop, and this baby is a lot smaller and is always on.The screen is beautiful, large, widescreen, great resolution. I constantly watch streaming movies on it and I love it.The speakers are very good.  Seeing as I AM using it for movies so much, though, I'll be buying the speaker dock.The device is very solid and I have confidence in it.The camera is of phenominal quality - and of course there are two of them - front and back.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my choice and I find new reasons why I was right to choose this every day.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Delighted", "Author": "STEPHEN LYNCH \"Stephen Lynch\"", "ReviewID": "R2AT0QNNAO0CD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally looked at the ipad2 but I do not like being told what to do.

I can say that the tablet is everything I need to use from a personal and business aspect.Personal Use.I use this for email, web surfing, and games, and reading ebooks(Kindle over Google Books) Better Book selection plus the book are located on the computer not the cloud.Business Use.RDP (Remote Control Computers) using WYSE software.Business Documents using DocsOnTheGo which integrated in Google docs already it makes it easy to send document via email via a share command.Testing Business Application that Run on flash (Sorry Apple)One down side to this product until Cisco licenses it to Google is that the tablet can do VPN IPSEC but not with group authenticate. In which most companies use, but a work around is I leave your computer on at home and RDP into that box and VPN to work.  If you are setting up RDP on your computer I would consult someone at your work IT department. Because, it requires someone with knowledge of IP routing and port forwarding on the computers modem or router. If you have more than 2 routers that makes even more fun like I have in use on my network.A tablet is not designed to replace a computer but more of a complement for any users who need to travel light but can still get everything they need on the go. Personally, I think the tablet is a good decision for anyone how is traveling a lot or is just a normal computer user that just uses email, internet for basic usage. You can do a whole lot more with this tablet than just the basics. Look at the Android App Store and looks at the different software either free for purchased to see if it will fill your niche that you need for program needs.Time and market will tell which one between apple and android.One of the main reason I also choose Xoom is that this is the development platform for Android's Honeycomb tablet OS. So when new releases are launched this device should get is first over others because it is plain Jane OS and doesn't have anything added on top OS (IE. Samsung's TouchWIZ). That would require other companies to develop for and make you wait for 6 months to a year for them to release the OS update to you. When android is already 2 version ahead.There are still come bogs that I think developers need to work out in their software in order to make this a perfect system, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone.One thing someone might say on this is wifi only, well here is a little secrete I do I have android cell phone with an unlimited data plan and I connected through my cellphone via a wifi tether and I now have a fully mobile tablet why pay for a data plan of anything over a GB of data, gets very expensive.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "bigjer", "Author": "Gerald B.

Speaking of which the rugged design has come in very useful since he likes to drop it on the floor and otherwise bang it around.  It has an aluminum case and gorilla glass front so no cracking or scratching (we have laminate over concrete floor).  The 32 gig memory means I have plenty of mem left (20) after installing 36 programs.  The graphics are fantastic games play very smoothly.  I use the wifi exclusively and have xfinity 15 meg internet.  It is verizon enabled I just don't subscribe.  Videos play well.  Overall it is very responsive to my needs.  I purchased this refurbished for $351 and got square trade 3 yr warranty for $83 so I ended up with better warranty for a cheaper price then buying new.  Also the battery life on this is fantastic!  I can play a game for over 7 hrs before it says I should plug in (screen on game actively played) also I never turn wifi off so it is constantly sending, receiving and updating while playing games.  The only real drawback for me is the power cord.  It is bottom center so you can't rest the device on you while reading or playing certain programs.  (some programs don't change screen orientation).

I primarily use this tablet for reading, browsing, Netflix, music and movies, although email and the game apps have improved by leaps and bounds...and the Zoodles Kid Mode app is a godsend for tablet users who have little kids :-)I have run this tablet on 3.2 Honeycomb, 4.0.4 ICS, and now on 4.1.1, and I must say that even though the experience was a bit rocky with 3.2, it has only gotten better! It has improved to the point that my laptop is pretty much always put away, in favor of this medium, which has awesome battery life (in comparison), and is also far more portable.For those frustrated with slow scrolling speeds in the Netflix app (which was a major complaint for me), Jelly Bean actually fixes that. On ICS, you apparently had to Force 2D rendering in the developer settings to make it smoother.The tablet keyboard now functions smoothly, and (at least on mine) the scrolling smoothness rivals that of the iPad 2, which was this tablet's direct competitor at release.Fact is, unless you are willing to shell out more than 500 bucks for a 10.1 inch tablet, this one has the overall best build quality, and doesn't have as much in the way of bloatware or altered interfaces. Unlike with my droid phone, I have not felt the need to root the device for optimization, or use ADW to make the launcher look/function better.If you want something completely intuitive, with little to no setup, and don't mind being restricted to iTunes, an iPad is probably best for you. If you don't mind doing a bit of exploring in the OS, and want an experience that isn't as restrictive, then Android may be the better way to go. With JB, this tablet is a great buy.Watch out for grey market sellers. Personally, Warehouse deals, while not always the lowest price, is probably best. It has never let me down.

I still love my iPad.  However, I always believe in being open-minded to new things.  One of the things that made me choose Xoom over other non-Apple tablets is its better price and features, Xoom has a GPS chip (while other non-Apple tablets don't have GPS), Xoom has a larger screen than iPad, it has a memory card slot and it's not an Apple product.  I like Xoom because it feels more like using a typical computer, compared to an appliance-like iPad - not that having a computer behaving like a reliable appliance is bad, however.  Here are some of the observations I have:  Xoom's touch screen seems a bit less responsive than iPad 1; Apps written for Xoom don't seem to work as well as the same apps that run on iPad; there are nowhere as many apps for Xoom than the iPad; I have to pay to have the same apps I purchased on iPad so that I can make my Xoom as closely resembles my iPad in functionality; I now have to invest in a car charger for Xoom; no Netflix on Xoom yet at this time; Xoom battery seems to run out faster when using a GPS application, compared to the iPad 1; there are no cool built-in effects for the cameras.  Essentially, owning Xoom is almost like owning a PC, and owning an iPad is like owning an Apple computer.  I feel it is essential to have an alternative to iPad.  Xoom has so much potential, and I can't wait for more apps to be available for Xoom.UPDATE:  Netflix is available but it seems unofficially available.  The video quality of Netflix on Xoom is very poor compared to Netflix on iPad.  Hopefully an official release Netlfix app will be just a good as the one for iPad.  I find Xoom's battery drains very quickly.  I have not measured precisely how long Xoom's battery last. But I need to charge it much more often than the iPad 1.

I purchased this to compliment my HTC EVO and my MacBook Pro 13\".I am a non-traditional student and this device was purchased to bridge the gap between the many times I don't feel like lugging my MacBook Pro (which isn't heavy, but I have a bag for it which is heavy), but having a 4.3\" screen like my EVO isn't enough.  It's for that 15-25 minutes you are burning between meetings, classes, or before a class.  It's for sitting on the couch and vegging out and not having to deal with a MacBook's lid.The downside for this is the weight.  It is lighter than an iPad 1, so it isn't dork heavy, it's just heavy enough to be uncomfortable.  Having the proper protective case for it helps give you the confidence to hold it in ways so as not to worry about scratching it or whatever.  In fact, I don't even think I would like to have it if they didn't make a great case for it; and I carry my EVO in it's full glory of nakedness.  Another downside is the smearing, but I don't know how you'd fix that.The strengths of the Honeycomb 3.1 OS are fantastic.  It's buttery smooth, just like the iPad.  While there aren't 100,000 Android tablet specific apps out there yet, like the iPad, I would say there's enough to keep you busy and happy, and a lot of the apps already in the app store(s) are sufficiently supported by Honeycomb and they look just fine.I do suggest getting your hands on a 3rd party keyboard.  I have SwiftKey and I also have Thumb Keyboard and I totally suggest the Thumb Keyboard.  The marketing isn't as sexy, but the TK is THE keyboard and no I have no affiliation with them.Good luck and enjoy the tablet.

I could easily transfer all the transfer videos,mp3 directly to this device via uPNP client(DNLA service).

I could read every possible known ebook format in Motorola Xoom.I am completely blown off by the quality of Android apps available in the Market and they are comparable and in par with the apps from iTunes. Can you imagine installing Antivirus software in a tablet that scans each and every emails and apps for any potential virus or trojan horse? You can do it in this tablet. Can you imagine running easily 20 to 30 apps in the back ground and still not compromise on the cpu? You can do it here. All the networking apps (vnc, logmein,ssh,....) are available in Android world. The widgets are cool and the level of customization that you can do with these is really great. I am sure that the Android app store will overtake apple app store in a year or two. I think people, who are sick and tired of looking at Apple same old GUI again and again, should start looking at Honeycomb and appreciate the effort that has gone into this.Of course, we easily saw tonnes of bugs in iPad in the early days, but the look and feel of it made us mesmerized and forget all those issues.But, when it comes to Honeycomb, it really makes me laugh after reading the silly reviews that these people post in Amazon.com about the reason why they did not like Motorola Xoom and I really feel sorry these people who don't realize the level of customization, tweaks,... that could be done in this device.After rooting it, I could do a lots of things, like connecting a USB hard disk, Super user rights, side loading, install non android apps, ap*****et, titanium back ups, skype with video,..and the list goes on and on...(I cannot reveal more than this...Join xda-developers for more info...)Hats off to Motorola for making this one of a kind tablet and good luck to all the iSheep's who are still out there reading this review.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "flawed beauty.", "Author": "xoomlover", "ReviewID": "R16HFYZGEQ7ATO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a xoom a for a coworker of mine to use as their one and only computing device.

My biggest complaint is that the apps that motorola and google were showing off at trade shows are either not there or missing or somewhere in between. there's a problem with the youtube app not being installed on many of the xooms out of the box. mine included. still trying to fix this bug. I don't appreciate the fact that neither google nor motorola is helping to remedy the situation. the skype app that was being shown at several trade shows isn't there either. you can find one on the app store but it can't do video. not sure where the skype app that you can watch on youtube for the xoom went to, but i'm a bit angry that it's not there.

I was using a Aluratek Cinepal MP4 player with an 8.9 inch screen, so I wasn't willing to downsize to something like the Kindle Fire, which would've been 1.9 inches smaller in screen size. I wanted something easier to use, more power, yadda yadda so when I heard about the Xoom I figured I'd save and get one. Flash forward through several economic annoyances and I finally bought one. I'd never used an Android device before, but I checked Youtube for tutorials on the Xoom and Android in general, so I wasn't totally clueless.Pro'sBig, has a solid feel to it. It's thinner than I expected, but feels solid.Android is ridiculously easy to use. Seriously.Screen is bright if you set it to brighter levels, and the speakers can get pretty loud, though I have a Bluetooth headset for when I need audio.Charges fast. Showed up about 30% charged, and it was fully charged in 2 hours.Plug and play with a PC for file transfers, so I was able to jump my music, pics, and some vids over without any serious problems, though I did get popups about possible incompatibility.Hot swappable, so no need (Or ability) to eject it from USB, just plug, go, then unplug.ConsScreen is a fingerprint magnetVolume rocker is annoyingly stiff and smallThe power plug is proprietary and tiny. Know the lead in a number 2 pencil like is used at schools? The plug is seriously that thin.Minimal apps pre-installed, though you can watch movies, look at pics, listen to music, and do other basic tasks, plus there's all the google specific apps like maps, mail, and so on.Had to create a GMail account to get the bleeping thing setup. Since I've avoided GMail, being forced to use it's annoying, especially since Youtube, apparently also owned by google, let me use my main account.Won't connect to my wifi connection. My wifi router is a solid brand, and no one's ever had problems connecting to it before. My mom's used it to surf the internet, my brother to do his net surfing, drivers downloading, even play PS3 games. However the Xoom insists the connection's low powered and slow, so I dunno what's up with that.Overall, I'm loving the thing. It's exactly what I hoped, and once I can get the apps I need, it'll be perfect. I'd definitely recommend this tablet to anyone not needing a ruggedized tablet, though it does seem pretty durable.

Robinson \"I like stuff.\"", "ReviewID": "RHY45561K2JI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've actually had the Xoom since last September.  I've finally gotten around to constructing a review.  My reasoning for even getting a tablet of any kind was for school.  I'm enrolled in electronics engineering but it's an online curriculum, so most of the text books are ebooks.  I do a lot of recreational reading so I hate reading theoretical material on my laptops for too long.  Also, I do most of my reading at night so the fan bothers my wife when she's trying to sleep and I'm not a fan of the heat output.  So I was able to trick myself into getting the Xoom.  At the time of my research, I was initially going to get the Samsung Galaxy.  The thing that stopped me was the Xoom had more storage and was like $50 cheaper if I recall correctly.  Also, Samsung and Apple were in their legal dispute.Now about the actual device.  The internal storage of 32GB is nice; the expansion capabilities are even better.  I love my multimedia so the more the better.  I'm never bored when my wife and I are traveling via bus, train, or plane.  The 1GB of RAM is sufficient for this tablet.  I'm content with the resolution.  Forgive me, but I haven't done any video recording or taken any pictures with this.  I honestly think it would feel pretty awkward doing so.  But I suppose it's good to have these capabilities at your disposal.  I have skyped with my sister who's on a deployment.  The picture is pretty clear, considering it's a tablet and not a laptop or desktop.Bluetooth connectivity is what you would expect.  This allows me to connect to my headphones and do morning cardio on the elliptical with no problems.  The power button being on the back really isn't a problem for me.  But then again, this is my first and only tablet so I'm not really comparing it to anything.  The glare from the screen can be quite bothersome at times.  When I'm traveling by bus to the city it's pretty hard to read.  Also another problem for me is the media players.  I'm using MX video player for the Xoom and my Droid Razr.  No Android VLC yet; still in production.  What's the big deal?  VLC plays mkv no problem.I downloaded the ICS upgrade when it was available.  There are a few upgrades over Honeycomb.  In my opinion, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker.  This was my first Android driven device so I was impressed from the start.I won't make this too long so I'll cut it short.  Overall, I'm more than content with this purchase.  I can do all the reading I want at night.  Browsing the internet is faster than I anticipated and the user interface learning curve wasn't as long as I thought it would be since this was my first Android device of any kind.  If you're anything like me, the current lack of VLC compatibility or screen glare might be annoying.  However, don't let it stop you from at least trying this device out.  Especially if you don't want to pay full price for the Xoom 2.  That being said, ask yourself what you plan on doing with this device before you buy one at all.  I've read or viewed reviews on most of them and it usually boils down to personal preference.

The recent ICS update (no other tablet besides the xoom and transformer prime has it as of yet!) was a great improvement for the Xoom, as it is now a lot faster and looks a lot cooler! When I first got it I was concerned about weight due to past reviewers. I was actually surprised to find it so light! My sister has an IPad2 and its barely a quarter of a pound lighter! The Xoom is great for school as there are TONS of note-taking and organization apps on the Android Market available (my favorite is ClassBuddyPro)! There is also a large selection of casual and hard core games too, In fact I just bought MC3 on sale for 0.99! The only thing about the Xoom that I'm dissatisfied with is the amount of apps that are specifically designed for tegra honeycomb/ics tabs. Also, I've heard complaints about not being able to charge with a micro USB cable, and while it may be inconvenient, the charging time is a mere hour! Overall BUY this product (the Xyboard or Xoom 2 is actually slower and more buggy than the original - yet 300 bucks more) today!!!PS: I got the Xoom Protective case as well as the gel one and they work just fine.

The only exception I have found so far is YouTube: it \"knows\" you are on a tablet so some content is unavailable \"on a mobile platform.\"If you use Fire Fox (free with \"don't follow\"), this app still doesn't play Adobe Flash; the in house Internet web browser does have this capability and as such CNBC Pro and ESPN3 play with little problem (I can't figure if ocasional problem with ESPN streaming video is with my provider or ?).Needless to say, this is my first tablet (I'm an old guy who awaited powerful laptops to acquire only after the price dropped to <US $1000) and I got the 32 meg for about US $405 and bought locally just after Christmas.NB one thing you need to know:  while Google bought Motorola Mobile which means this will be supported with timely updates as ICS, it does weigh just over 1.5 pounds (US).  My left arm thus is getting stronger.  Unlike a book which can be of some even greater weight, which can be easily grasped from either hand, a tablet as with the PC, one had controls a mouse. Here my left holds up the Xoom, my right hand taps and flicks.Finally I have both Motorola Bluetooth mouse and keyboardMotorola Wireless Keyboard for Motorola ATRIX and XOOM (Motorola Retail Packaging)GTMax Bluetooth 2.0 Wireless Optical Mouse with 3-Button + Mini Brush for Laptop Netbook.  This mouse is great in its ability to click on the smallest web link and a scroll down roller; but so far it has no \"right click\" capability.

This is an awesome tablet for the money. I went into best buy and I didn't want any low quality Asus or Acer stuff so I decided to narrow it down to Samsung and xoom. I was dead set on Samsung but it has two low amount of memory and the xoom was a clear winner with that in mind bc for the same price you get a16gb Samsung you can get xoom for 32gbwith room for more in the future. Also xoom is the tablet that will be the first to receive updates. Samsung is still stuck on 3.1 while Solomon runs 3.2 which lets you resize apps made only for phones. Also best buy had all the accessories for half of as of 8/2/2011 so I got the xoom Bluetooth  keyboard and portfolio case for 54 plus tax. It also runs flash beautifully with a free update to 10.3 also xoom charges faster than Samsung as xoom takes about an hour while Sammy takes up to 4. Samsung dies have a beautiful screen and is hell of a lot thinner ans a little lighter. But as don't sacrifice what makes an android an android by purchasing it. Not SD card no HDMI no USB mass storage mount, one propitiatory connection sounds more like apple. Xoom is a better deal. My sister called me an idiot for explaining her why I was sacrificing a larger memory and SD card for a thinner tablet. She was like\" REALLY when your okay with carrying your laptop in one hand your complaining about how one is thin er than the other and how it is a little heavy. They both weigh less than a laptop and you know your gonna fill it up with music movies PDFs and book.\" So that's it that was my reason why I got the xoom. Hope you would do the same.

After reading countless reviews, watching tons of video comparisons, and thinking hard about what I wanted my tablet  to do, I went with the Xoom. I got my Xoom the first week of April, and I've found that it's like an extra body part at this point.The operating system is fantastic. Honeycomb 3.1 is the version I'm on now, and it provides a great experience for using apps, browsing the Internet (no other tablet beats the Xoom at this so far), sending email, or playing games. While the Android Market still has some catching up to do on apps, most of the necessary apps are there at this point. Netflix is the biggest missing app right now.The Xoom is a little heavier than the iPad 2, but the bigger screen and better web experience make up for it in a big way. Right now there's some newer Android tablets hitting the market that all look great, but the WiFi Xoom should be a satisfying purchase for just about anybody.Note: If you are planning on putting videos on your Xoom, DVD Catalyst is an excellent program I've used to convert my DVD collection to optimized files for playback on the Xoom.

It is faster and packed with more features compared to the ipad. Don't waste your money on apple's shiny piece of plastic.

All your contacts, email, calendar automatically sync once you sign in. You need to use a credit card only if you make any purchase on Android market.  You will get all the Google goodness. To improve performance turn off animations. Settings->display ->animations. The only difference between ipad and the xoom is,the xoom cannot play Netflix. Netflix does not have an app for Android yet because of DRM. I don't care much for Netflix because I use Amazon instant video which plays flawlessly on the xoom. The Xoom more than makes up for the lack of Netflix by supporting flash. There are a ton of flash based videos and games that I would prefer to watch, but ipad does not (and will not) support flash. So, I will pick the ability to play flash over ablity to play Netflix.update: Facebook app force closes all the time. This is not Andriod Honeycomb or Xoom problem I think the Facebook app is not optimized for tablets. There are a handful of apps that are really optimized for the tablet. This is where Ipads win over Andriod. If Google wants Andriod to be successful they need to force app developers to optimize their apps for the right device.

I've done some critical listening with my Beyer DT235 headphones and found that they both sound remarkably close with a solid bass and well defined mid range.  But the Xoom nicely reproduces brushed cymbals that sound more like hiss on the Nuforce.  The Nuforce will drive the headphones a bit louder but the Xoom gets the fairly inefficient Beyers up as loud as I would care to listen. And the sound is just as good on the headphone out from the dock so it makes for a convenient and great sounding combo.Yes, the tablet may be a bit heavier than some of the competition but its very solid with a nice screen that actually has a natural, very good color balance - not too cool/blue like many displays tend to be.

I was eager to try this tablet given it was the first to use the new tablet centric Android OS. I wanted it to be as good as Apple's but the truth is, it isn't. Despite having Flash support (which Apple does not), Android Honeycomb is just not nearly as smooth or as trouble free as Apple iOS. In the month I have used the tablet, I have had one serious hard crash that nearly had me sending the tablet back. That's because the recovery process is so arcane, it would be nearly impossible to figure out without detailed instructions, which I eventually found on the net. It involved interpreting a series of obscure error messages, engaging a series of timed button pushes (power, vol up, vol down) in the correct sequence and then the navigation of a somewhat clunky text menu system (reminds me of the old DOS command line system). The good news is I brought the tablet back to life. The bad news is should not have have been nearly this difficult. The Touch has crashed plenty but always comes back with a simple forced reboot.  Xoom forced reboot procedure did not work in my case. Had to do a factory reset from boot, which is much more complicated.)But on to the usability issues. Xoom works fine in the broad sense of the word. It basically does everything the Apple OS does and them some. But it's not quite as smooth. Pans are sometimes herky jerky. Oreintation changes are slower than on the Apple. Overall, just not as polished, which is what you would expect when you compare a 6 month old OS with a years-old one. Still, the Xoom suffers a bit in the comparison. I might be able to overlook this if not for another problem. The library of aps simply is not as good on the Xoom as in the Apple universe. There are a precious few Android aps built just for the Tablet and even when they are, they sometimes offer far less funtionality than than the corresponding Apple version. Prime example: CNBC's excellent financial ap. It's amazing in the Apple version, providing tons of functionality. The Android version is a bare bones sibling, with about one-tenth the functionality of even the one for the iPhone. Since it's all about the aps in the smartphone/tablet world, this will be a real deal killer for some folks. I expect the Android landscape will improve in time but it falls way short for now.That said, there are some areas where a tablet is a big improvement over a smartphone. Notably, reading books, newspapers and magazines. The preloaded Google books ap is excellent, with realistic page turns and all the functionality you would expect of a reader. There are also several notable tablet centric news aps, including USA Today and Pulse. Both take advantage of the extra screen real estate to make selecting and reading stories easier.Watching movies is also much better on the Xoom's bigger screen but there is no comparable iTunes environment in the Android universe to port over digital copies. You must rely on streaming or getting a version is the correct format and copying over as a playable file.Xoom also offers the advantage of a micro-SD slot, notably missing on the Apple products, and a micro HDMI port for porting movies to an HDTV. It also has better front and read facing cameras than the iPad. Screen resolution also is better, if you are just reading the specs. In real life, however, it seems most people like the output of the iPad a little better.One other issue: Sound quality is somewhat lacking compared to my iPod Touch. I use a bluetooth headset and sound quality is noticably better in the iPod than on the Xoom.Bottom line: If you can get one of these things at a huge discount, as I did, you might want to consider it. The official $499 retail for the 32-gig wi-fi only model is still way too much in my view, especially with Amazon's much cheaper Fire about to debut. You might as well go with an Apple model if you are going to spend that much.

I already had an Android phone so I went for the wi-fi only version of this tablet thinking I can just tether it to my phone if I need data out and about and there is no wi-fi available. It gives my phones battery a punishment but otherwise works really well and saves me having two mobile data contracts. As for the tablet itself, it automatically installed all my favourite apps once I had signed in to my Google account. Adobe flash websites work fine but I'm still waiting for the memory card to be enabled. The new user interface is very good, maybe not as good as the iPad but it's still great and you can put widgets on the home screens and I'd be annoyed if I couldn't, all that screen space. The sound quality is alight, not bad but nothing spectacular, if it bothers you, use head phones. The graphics are impressive, I've become addicted to a 3D flight sym game on it and even my 10 year old nephew who's permanently playing games though the graphics were impressive.

I will keep it short because let's face it, writing a long review on a tablet computer without an external keyboard is tedious regardless if it is an ipad or xoom.  I bought an ipad last year and returned it within a week.  Why you ask?  Well let me say that apple's product made the tablet market what it is today so it wasn't for lack of the sheek factor and I also felt they did a good job in simplifying the OS for the tablet.  Still, I knew something better would come along and the product felt unfinished in a lot of ways.  Very few ways of connecting externally, no flash support, and to be honest the OS was almost too simple for me.  Now to the xoom, boy am I glad I waited.  The OS is smooth and just a little more customizable and interesting for my taste.  I should note that I also own a droid phone so I was already familiar with it.  Having flash support on a tablet is quite simply awesome especially after my experience with the ipad.  I can stream a sports game and watch it from my bed or the couch without fail.  I really enjoyed browsing the web with the ipad but the lack of flash support was a pain.  Apple's OS simplicity is a blessing and a burden...multitasking is a pain and the notification system sucks in my opinion.  On the xoom, all your notifications pop in the bottom right of the screen allowing seamless movement between tasks and programs which require your attention.  Switching programs is easy and you can quickly advance to the next song on last FM and get back to writing that email.

Silly.  You'd think you'd be able to watch them on any digital device, which is not true.....you can watch them on your computer, or iTunes will convert them to use on an iPad or iPod.  Pretty crappy.  Once I figured this out, I realized I just needed to find a conversion software.  Unfortunately most of the cheaper conversion softwares do not convert Blu-Ray.  The software that costs more and claims to convert them don't always work either.  I've been using DVD Catalyst which works well and was only $10.

I was really excited before it came out. I had read all the iPad vs. iPad2 vs. Xoom reviews and wanted the Xoom because of the flash capabilities, the expandable memory, and the flexibility compared to doing everything on iTunes.I don't want to give an in-depth review since so many others have already tone that.  I will give my general impressions.  I never really cared about the iPad2 being lighter & thinner.  Compared with my laptop, the Xoom's size and weight aren't an issue.I was worried when first started using it: the flash had just been released and still wouldn't play the videos & games from some of the sites I went to, and I couldn't get the digital copies (that came with my blu rays) to play once I had transfered them over to the xoom.  Hulu and netflix still arent available either. I got on a xoom forum which helped a lot with figuring things out, including how to keep the mobile version of websites from loading by default.  I had to buy software that would legally break the lock on the movies that I have (yes, I am sure there was free illegal software out there to do the same thing).  The flash is working much better these days too.I definitely think the Xoom isn't for everybody.  Its much harder to learn to use (I saw another revier use a chess/checkers analogy, which I kinda agree with), but I like how I can set things up exactly how I want, load off-market content, and even root the device if I ever decide I want to do that.  The android market lacks the polish and all-encompasing media capabilities that iTunes has, but it looks like Amazon might be ramping up to fill that void.  The iPad is great b/c anyone can pick one up and use it...my toddler has an iPad which is perfect for her, whereas the xoom just wouldn't work for her.

It is surprisingly heavy for its size.  To me, a 7 inch screen is a more \"one-hand-holdable\" size (and much lighter), and the 10 inch (whether this Xoom, or iPad, or whatever) is simply too big to be used well with one hand.  Personally I am surprised that iPad has sold as well as it has, because I think it is too big to be portable; 10\" screen is OK for coffee table use, not carrying.I'm still looking for a quality 7\" screen tablet, and I'm surprised and disappointed that Motorola chose to copy Apple's size preference.  I want Android (Honeycomb, especially) so I guess I have to wait for that in a 7 inch size just a little longer.  Look at the Samsung Galaxy and Blackberry Playbook - THAT is a great usable and portable size.  But they are not Android Honeycomb with dual core processors.Bottom line, even though I'm rating it 4 stars, I returned my Xoom for a refund.

First, the manufacturer is Motorola, a company which I'm a big fan of...great products, great customer service...I go back to the RZR days with them..and even the original BRICK phone from the 80's...When you hold the ANDROID Powered XOOM it feels light but solid build.  I was blown away by the Beautiful 10.1 inch TRUE HD 1080 display..other tablets including the IPAD 2 have less than 1080 HD...they call it HD but its not 1080..the maximum you can get...the other thing was the screen layout..its aspect ratio is like what you have on your HD tv at home...not a square box like the old tube tv's...(this is what the IPAD 2 has)..so you get the complete HIDEF movie screen...the other thing was the multiple home screens the XOOM has...5 total...while the IPAD 2 has 3....plus the XOOM has sizable widgets...which are like \"live shots\" of your apps...I have my calendar,email and browser bookmarks...so I can instanly see my email, calendar and bookmarks and even scroll thru them right on my screen without having to go into the app.  Also, the music layout simply blows away the Ipad 2 and others with a beautiful diagonal flowing cover art display..and here are the deal makers..The XOOM has 32 gigs internal memory plus an SD slot to expand...IPAD 2 does not...XOOM has dual led 5 megapixel camera IPAD 2 has 2 megapixel with NO FLASH! XOOM has a 2 megapixel front facing camera for web conferancing IPAD 2 has a VGA camera!! thats less than 1 megapixel!  PLus the XOOM has an HDMI and USB port..IPAD 2 does not..Overall, I think the DROID XOOM offers the better experience...I found the IPAD 2 to be very stale...it's technology felt antiquated..pretty much a glorified e-reader..3 home screens, a music/video player..and very compartmentalized multi tasking..not true MT..If you want a tablet experience that seems closer to that of a full blown computer, the DROID XOOM, with Internet FLASH capabilities, dual core chip, widgets, live wallpaper, peripheral compatibility and memory expandability, is the CLEAR CHOICE...BTW, I just received my HONEYCOMB software update and it is AWESOME!!

Partridge", "ReviewID": "R3K0UD4JC1645K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There is finally a true tablet OS, not a frustrating implementation of desktop OS (think UMPCs) or an inflated and over extended phone OS (iOS/iPad, Galaxy Tab, and other android 'tablets').  It's really impressive to see and use and feels like a new OS, just one that's based on the Android we all known (and love).The implementation is good, remarkably good for a brand new OS that only really exists on one device (officially I mean, we know you can stuff this on a Nook).  It's far from perfect, but again it's very nice for a first shot.  There are bugs, but nothing show stopping (the music icon pops up again and again long after I've stopped playing it) and nothing that shouldn't be resolved in due course.  There are some shortcomings with the software (the browser is jittery and more than a few websites only load mobile versions [I know you can enter debug mode or use another browser, but I don't want to do that all the time and I don't care for Dolphin or Skyfire], there seems to be a lot of blank/white space in the applications that might be better used, and the widgets start to look weird on non-blue backgrounds [notice most of the ones included are blue]) but again, they should be worked out and improved in time.Where it falls in this particular implementation is mostly hardware.  I'm not a fan of the fingerprint and dust magnet that is the screen (it's really terrible).  Also, the screen just isn't that good.  It might be fine compared to some cheaper laptops but it gets incredably washed out at higher brightness and has only \"OK\" viewing angles.  I'll note that I'm more sensative to these things than other people, but I'd really like to see one of these with an IPS screen (like on the iPad). (-1 star)Personally, while the device is nice, it doesn't fill a need or purpose for me.  To me a tablet should be more about entertainment and creating a more personal experience than I can get with laptop.  This, for the time, just fails at that.  Part of it is just the methodology used here.  Each time I use the tablet for something that's truely unique to it (say versus my iPad or my Nexus S) I feel I'd just rather do it on my laptop for a better experience.  I've found a use for my iPad and specifics for when it's best (e.g. curling up in bed to watch netflix when a phone would be too small and a laptop too noisy/cumbersome/distracting), but I haven't with this.I guess the obvious reason for that is just lack of applications that I want in a tablet.  There's no Netflix, no Hulu, no working version of Pandora, etc.  These should be solved eventually, but there's no timeline for this from any of those companies. (-1 star)While I know some may argue that it's unfair to judge a product that is fresh out of the gate and that software will come, the issue is that new hardware will come as well.  There's also the issue that due to different hardware and such hulu or netflix may never come to this specific device (Hulu has stated 'select devices' for whenever they get their android version out, and netflix seems to need specific DRM capable hardware as far as they're claiming now - this could change, but who knows).  With quad-core Tegra chips coming late fall, rumors of a Nexus tablet, and whatever else happens in the next 6 months, I have to judge what a product is based on what it is now or will be in the immediate future.  Maybe Netflix and Hulu will put out android versions, but it may be another year and a much better tablet.I still think this is a great product, but it's just not for me.  Baring the screen quality (again it may not bother you as much) this is a really solid device.  If you need a lightweight and portable device this is a very solid and viable alternative to say a netbook.

I contacted Verizon Wireless to request for a free replacement since it has 1 year warranty.  Verizon Wireless directed me to Motorola since Motorola is the manufacturer of this device.  So I called Motorola.  I was shocked to hear that Motorola told me the best replacement they could send me is 4GB Micro SD card.  I told them my Driod X came with 16GB Micro SD card and that I am entitle to get at least equal value replacement.  They refused and insist the best they could do is to send me a 4GB card.  I politely told Motorola no thanks and called Verizon back to let them know Motorola refused to honor the warranty.  Verizon made it right, they told me buy a 16 GB card from their store and will reimburse me for it.  I faxed the receipt to Verizon and they deducted the amount from my phone bill within 2 business days.  I was happy with Verizon's service but shame on Motorola.  I therefore from now on will automatically deduct 1 full star on any Motorola product reviews in anticipation that I might run into warranty issues again in the future.  Because Motorola did not honor the warranty I'm entitled to, they have lost me as a loyal customer.  I will still buy Motorola products provided I have no other choice.  But I prefer to stay away from it whenever possible.My 6 year old son used to play with his Aunt's iPad on weekends.  He loved it.  After a few days with the Xoom, I was surprised that he liked the Xoom more.  The weight didn't bother him a bit.  He now wakes up extra early in the morning just to play Club Penguin on the Xoom.  Thanks to the Xoom's ability to run Flash, he could play Club Penguin and other popular Flash games.  The iPad simply could not let him do that.  Of course, besides Flash games, he loves native apps like Angry Birds, Farm Frenzy, and few others.The wife loves the Xoom too.  When she is using it, the son has to yield.  The son is actually happy too because he is the new owner his mom's laptop. That's right, the wife no longer wants her laptop.  She used to occupy the TV during each evening.  No longer!  She is now too busy with her Xoom.  And I actually get to watch baseball in the evening!!The build is top quality.  Feels solid but not too heavy.  I know the wife and son will eventually drop it, so I placed the \"Smoke Argyle Silicone Skin Cover\" on it.  Even after the silicone skin is on it, the Xoom still don't feel bulky.  It is just about right.Honeycomb OS is intuitive.  My non-technical wife figured it all out herself.  Even my 6 year old is pretty good at using it.  The only thing I did for them was the wifi setup and Bluetooth tethering.  It was easy as cake.The Xoom is actually helping the wife to keep fit.  She watches YouTube while on the treadmill.  Because she enjoys it, she runs more frequently and for longer duration.Battery life is pretty good.  We set the screen brightness to auto.  Even under heavy use, we charge every other day.The screen resolution is good, but color does not pop.  I expected more vivid colors, but so far no complaints from the wife, so I guess it is acceptable.The Micro SD card slot does not work yet.  Motorola better provide an update to fix this soon as competitors are rolling out more similar featured Honeycomb tablets which comes with Micro SD card slot working.There are not many native Honeycomb tablet apps yet.  But I know the numbers are growing daily.  I myself is working on a native Honeycomb tablet app to be release in a month or 2.  And I do have plans to develop more apps for this platform.I am in the market to buy 3 more Honeycomb tablets within a month.  Although I have no regret buying the Motorola Xoom, I am open to consider other Honeycomb tablets that are rolling out.  The Asus Transformer tablet look very attractive to me.  I'll order 1 from Amazon as soon as it is available.  And if I like it, I'll order 2 more.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, if not a bit expensive", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "R3IVL2TNDXZ26P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received an iPad for Christmas from my wife and decided to return it for a few reasons. The first is that rumors had already started about the iPad2 coming out and I didn't want to get the first iPad 2 months before the new one came out. I also didn't really want to need to buy a whole new set of apps for iPad since I already have an Evo Android phone. I had also been reading a lot about all of the new Android tablets that would be coming out this year. So, for all those reasons, I decided to wait.The Xoom came out and the biggest initial issue that I had with it was the astonomical price for the Verizon version. I knew that there was no way I was getting that. Then rumors of a Wi-Fi only version started to surface. The price still sounded higher than I would have liked, but it did look like a really good piece of hardware. That is the entire basis of my review, great hardware that is at least $100 more than it should be. If Android hopes to make any headway against the iPad, it needs to be cheaper.The new Honeycomb Android OS for tablets is good, but not yet great. It is definitely functional at this point, but I can see that it needs a bit to go. I won't really dock the Xoom points for that since I know that the OS will be continually updated and that it is not really a Motorola issue. As it stands, it is pretty good. The biggest issues right now are the lack of tablet ready apps (which will also change soon enough) and the force closes (crashes) that happen a bit to often right now (again, I am sure this will be fixed quickly).So, to sum up, really nice hardware that runs fast and smooth, a pretty good OS that does need a few things fixed, but is pretty good, but still a bit too expensive.

At that price, it was either a very reasonable tool, or an expensive toy.Note.  I was able to connect with a lot of help and some user apps.  I would encourageGoogle to put more focus on enterprise connectivity. I may upgrade my rating still more in the future depending on my experiences.Unfortunately, it seems to be more a toy, although an elegant and very interesting one.I work in a large corporation, which uses the LEAP protocol for WiFi security. The corporate user name contains the window domain.Amazingly, in the time that Android, and now Honeycomb, has been out, it never was configured to handle a windows domain attached to a user name, when using the LEAP protocol.  Actually, the native WiFi settings cannot recognize LEAP, but third parties have been able to create apps which can authenticate within LEAP...except if a windows domain name is involved.  In that case, according to a developer's notes, the Honeycomb is simply not constructed to be able to handle domain names.This cuts the Xoom out from accessing the WiFi, mail, etc, from many large corporate sites.  Incidentally, all the Android phones have the same problem: they cannot connect to a WiFi protected by the LEAP protocol if a windows domain name is necessary.I can access the WiFi, and all the apps from the Google and other markets, from home. At the price I got the Xoom, I have no plans to return it.  However, it is mind-boggling to me that the Google developers of Honeycomb would not give their operating system the extra attention to permit it to access the many corporate systems with LEAP.  Needless to say, the apple iOS has no problem, either with the iPhone or iPad, in handling the LEAP protocol.I don't need a tablet for my working environment at this time, so fortunately, this egregious omission won't really hurt me.

Now comes the caviat.  I'm not sure who at Motorola thought that using that teeny little charging adapter was a good idea.  It doesn't seat all the way and I can see that it will not last long before it breaks.  Combine that with the fact that if the charging port and the headphone jacks are plugged in at the same time (if you are watchig a movie and charging at the same time) you can't hold the tablet in landscape orientation without the risk of breaking the charger connector off (charging port and headphone jacks are opposite each other on the long sides of the tablet).  There are a few other small things that bug me (like the volume buttons that are hard to operate and the small bugs in the Gingerbread OS) but I could deal with those.  The charging port/connector fragility is a deal breaker for me.  I want something I can expect to work for the next few years and this Xoom (typing on it right now), though I love it compared to my I pad, I can't trust it won't break on me in the near future so it is going back to Best Buy tomorrow.Hopefully the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 will come out soon and not have any bad design flaws like this.If you don't think you will use a tablet a lot and can set it down or in a charging dock while it charges then this would be an awesome tablet.

Most people can complain about how slow and laggy the Xoom is compared to the Ipad2 however if you think about it, Apple doesn't have true multitasking which controls the memory it uses making it seem less laggy. Also for the people who complain about the slow browser experience between the Xoom and Ipad2, people may not have noticed this but ipad2 tends to show the page much faster than the Xoom however it doesn't fully load it. (if you scroll on the ipad2, you will see those white and gray grids). I know many people don't factor these \"small\" details in however it should be known. Xoom tends to show the page slower however will load up the entire page when it's done.I'm not a Apple or Android fanboy, i'm a fanboy of customization therefore I went with the Xoom.

The Cost-co bundle includes a decent case. I also bought a Toshiba 8GB microSD card from my local Office Max, thinking I could use it in the Xoom. Much to my charin and disapointment, I found out the microSD function was not working yet -- and as of today is still not enabled. Adobe Flash, on the other hand, worked out-of-box, but not always.Overall, the hardware is pretty nice, from the snappy processor to the nice touch display with its 16:10 widescreen aspect ratio to the dual cameras. It's heavy, probably the same weight as the 1st-gen iPad, so my arm and wrist get tired if I hold it for more than 15 minutes.The Android 3.0 OS, however, is quite buggy. I've downloaded only 10 apps so far, including the Amazon Appstore app, which, interestingly, is the one that constantly crashes. Just minutes ago, the Amazon Appstore app simply shut down the entire Xoom without warning, just seconds into launching it. Other apps (all of which free but mostly downloaded from the Amazon Appstore), including Google's own, have had frequent force closes (fc's).  Very frustrating.The mail app is also frustrating, as it keeps switching between a 3-column view and a 2-column view. The Chrome web browser has trouble with many normal sites (normal in the sense that I've never had trouble having those sites rendered in desktop IE 6 through 9), including the regular Amazon.com. Interesting -- U.S. Dept of Justice should take heed -- the browser has some serious trouble with the Bing homepage. And of course, you cannot use any other search engine as the system-wide default search tool -- another thing the Dept. of Justice should take heed of.As all \"professional\" reviewers have opinined, the OS feels like it's still in beta. It's also a little convoluted in its interface.

I've been looking at reviews and tidbits about the tablet market to semi replace my very outdated laptop.  I already own a Droid phone, so I suppose my love was a bit preordained.  I went to town getting a bunch of really cool apps for it right away and discovered in the process that if you use the same gmail account to link it to the market, (most of)the apps on your Droid will suddenly appear on the Xoom as well.  I have yet to decided if that is good or bad.  It's a bit heavy for reading books and the screen times out but I assume I could change that in the settings.  When I plug it in, the charging icon does not always appear, though I know that it charges.  The camera works pretty well, though I've only tried it for stills as of yet.  It seems to be of a sturdy construction and very easy to use.  I put it side by side with an Apple iPad and its screen was not as bright but it does not seem to bother me.  Our friend even took his along on a recent trip to England (where the Droid phone does not work) and managed to find a way for us to use it to call home through wifi, and download map directions for use in the countryside.

I think the big difference for me, as compared to the iPad, is not having to use iTunes, a slightly longer (but more narrow) screen, and using the Android system already in use by my cell phone.

I tried this several times over the week, it wasn't a matter of connection (I had full bars) and I left the download go on for hours.Upon reading various forums on the internet, I see this is not an isolated problem but appears to be systemic.I would not recommend purchase of this product until the issues with applications are remedied.  Without Apps, the tablet has limited appeal and functionality.JMcSan Francisco CA", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Xoom - quick and of great quality", "Author": "Barbara Sanchez \"Angel Love\"", "ReviewID": "R18898ZSE2CXVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It came quickly and I also received a packing slip with balance due of $0.00 which I needed for reimbursement from my company.

I can't believe it's taken half a year and it's the only decent one to arrive, and it is seriously flawed. I played with it and almost bought it because it is a nice tablet. I'm glad I didn't go through with it, though, as I would have simply had to go back and return it. Yes, it would have likely done what I needed it to do, but I'm just not willing to give a company that much of my money for such a half-cocked product. There's the obvious ones, such as no working SD card slot and no flash (stock), which need no further elaboration.Edit: I was informed by a Xoom owner that flash has indeed been recently added and is working fine.And of course the proprietary power, which I think a lot of people, including Motorola, are missing a big point with regard to: It's not just about having to spend $30 for a charger, but then if said charger gets left behind, you're out of luck, with absolutely no backup except maybe being able to pick one up for another $30 at a nearby store. Even if USB charges slow, slow is better than nothing. Also, just because it's USB, doesn't mean people are going to be limited to the current output of a computer's USB port. A $5-20 AC/DC charger and USB cable combo can provide 1-2+ amps. So you could either spend a little more, but still less than Motorola wants, to get fast charging capability, or get slower charging for only a few dollars. I keep chargers and retractable micro-USB cables strategically placed so I always have access to one in case my phone needs a charge, and it would be nice if I could just use those same components for my tablet. Even if I could overlook every other flaw with this device, this is the one that absolutely will keep me from buying one.The last major flaw I've discovered with the Xoom is the case. Motorola released a nice, expensive, fragile device without making sure a good, protective case is available for it. The one they released is generally reviewed very poorly, and there aren't many other options, and not one I could find that is a portfolio type. The whole Xoom release was handled very poorly, and I hope Motorola suffers for it. I love to see the competition to Apple, both because I'm not a fan of Apple and competition in general is good, but companies need to wake up.Finally, Android devices have a bad history of receiving one OS update and then being abandoned, not to mention taking forever to receive that update after Google releases it. Hopefully the non-subsidized tablets will be different, but I have my doubts and am hesitant to make a $600 bet on it. Consumers should demand an update guarantee from Motorola before purchasing them.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Less than beta product", "Author": "Rafael", "ReviewID": "R1T9CAUN8HODVV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Honeycomb #fail. full of bugs and it's just like windows vista.google has to get over it and bring us ice cream as soon as possible.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Horrible piece of junk!!", "Author": "Daniel G.
