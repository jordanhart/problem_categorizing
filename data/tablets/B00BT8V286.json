{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as durable as expected", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R3G63A84IVD6YX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for my young children and although they can navigate and  play games with easy, and the software pre-installed on the product is quite well suited for a child's experience, I find it lacking in physical durability. The unit has been dropped a few times, which should be expected of a product targeted for children, and each time either the volume or the power buttons shoot out as the casing easy split apart. Although the casing easily snaps back in place, getting the button back in take a bit of work. Also the touch screen seem to have a sensitivity issue especially near the corners of the screen. I have this same issue on two separate FunTabs, it takes multiple attempts to hit the X in the corner to close out of the kids mode. The product is also lacking in Google Play integration for installing apps. You can manually install apps by downloading the apk files but providing Google integration would make this process much more painless.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useless paperweight!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MGMC3ZLW5VBE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this for my daughter last Christmas and it never worked.  After almost a year, run around after run around, excuse after excuse, I give up.  I am now the proud owner of a useless paperweight and my daughter didn't get a Christmas present.  I wanted to post this to warn others not to waste their money or disappoint their kids. This company should be put out of business!!!", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Avoid this Product", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "R2MO8MCO6B7FV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this product in May and by June it stopped working.  Device overheated and the screen cracked.  Wrote to Ematic for a warranty replacement and they wrote back that if the screen is cracked, they won't warranty it.  I stated that the device cracked from the inside, that it was never dropped and that there's not a mark on the  exterior as proof.  They won't even write back.  Meanwhile we've had three different Leap Frog products for years and they all still work great.  We erred in not going with the proven product that we already know.  We won't buy any more Ematic products.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice tablet for kid", "Author": "Monique L", "ReviewID": "R1RSQOXPWDMLKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A gift for my grand daughter who is very happy since she received for her birthday.
