It does handles windows 8 mode apps pretty well.Most games work really well others simply don't work at all .(ex.Hydro Thunder,and pretty much any game from Gameloft, ie 6 Guns runs laggy and Asphalt 7 doesn't open at all and 8 runs with a weird green tint...) This tablet works very well with windows 8.1 .Its real limits only really show when using regular programs, because of its very low specs but that is to be expected..It comes packed  with Acer bloatware but that is easily removed. Acer actually does updated on this tablet quite often to iron out any issues with it so I don't really have much more glitch or force close issues.The real limits of this tablet is the same as any other windows 8 tablets  laptop or PC ,the store doesn't have much yet but it's growing.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I quite liked it", "Author": "Angelos", "ReviewID": "R39M0E3KF61G6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautiful display with nice colors and handy size.
