{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Meets expectations; used daily.", "Author": "Britton", "ReviewID": "R1VJ8XGNNQYFPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received as a birthday gift around the holidays and I have used it every day ever since.I am a bit of a techno-phile.  I've been using computers since the days of parachute pants and the mullet.  I have both Windows and Linux computers and have fully embraced the Android OS.  I still cannot bring myself to spend the money required to own Apple products, so I cannot and will not compare this to an iPad.What a handy device it really is!  It's wifi ready, has a headphone jack, a mini-HDMI output, and it can be charged with either a supplied A/C charger or a micro-USB charger.  Its 7\u201d screen size keeps the whole thing manageable but much bigger than a phone screen.  I think it\u2019s an excellent balance of size and convenience.  My wife can keep it in her pocketbook without feeling weighted down or feeling like it has taken over her bag.  If I had to, I could keep it in the front pocket of a pair of slacks (not jeans, though).Even a newbie Android user should be able to figure out how to use this tablet.  Follow the instructions to fully charge the batteries before using without the plug.  But I started working on it right away with the device plugged in.  The Settings screen is accessible through the bottom of the screen and the apps list button on the home screen.  Through Settings you can get to the wifi settings where you log in to your local network.  I was on the internet in less than a couple of minutes.  After a quick download through the Play store, all my favorite apps including IMDB, Accuweather, Firefox and more were immediately available.  It also loaded my favorite games including 7 Little Words, Angry Birds and Texas Hold\u2019em.  To add a recent picture I took as my wallpaper, I loaded QuickPic to organize my pictures and Tonido to access all my favorite files from my home computer.I asked for this tablet as a gift to provide two tasks, both of which it handles very well.The first is to give me internet access - mostly IMDB - while I'm watching TV with the Queen.  The wife and I love to watch TV and movies and we are always wondering where we've seen that actor/actress before.  It works very well for just about any online access you will need.  I\u2019ve even used it in the kitchen to try a new recipe for banana bread.The other task was to have an easily portable tablet available for when the Queen and I are running errands or on a road trip.  I've installed the 'hot-spot' option on my cell phone so when we're out and about, we can easily log into the internet via wifi while driving or shopping.  Our previous tools for that were either our cell phones (not as easy to see) or our laptops (too big and clunky for the car).  This tablet provides the perfect balance.Some downsides to the Y88 are the battery life and the availability of apps.  My favorite weather app is WeatherBug which is not available for this tablet.  Not sure if it\u2019s the tablet or WeatherBug that\u2019s at fault here, but I found a reasonable solution with Accuweather.  There were a few other apps that I looked into loading and they were not available, but I\u2019ve also found viable workarounds.  The battery issue is not unusual for tablets, so no major complaint here.  I\u2019ve dug up some eBay sourced micro-USB chargers from around the house and have plugged them in where I sit with my tablet around the house and just operate \u2018wired\u2019 as necessary.  Not that big a deal.  We do the same in the car until we need to go wireless.  Simple.Overall, this tablet met all my expectations.  Hope it does the same for you!", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolute Junk", "Author": "Crunk Panda \"Crunk Panda\u2122\"", "ReviewID": "R3GUYUPHVQD7K0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My kids each received one for Christmas from their grandparents.

My son's screen broke within 3 days. Granted, he probably threw it or something, but he's played with my Kindle Fire for over a year without damaging it in any way. Within another couple of weeks, the power button on the pink one got stuck and the tablet cannot be turned on at all. We thought maybe she had done something wrong because she is young. But like my son, she has played with my Kindle for some time without ever causing any damage. Within a month after that, the purple one did the same thing. This happening made it clear to me that the product is the problem. My oldest child is 8 and knows how to handle and take care of tablets. She has been playing with my Kindle since I bought it 2 or 3 years ago. So now I have three useless tablets that I paid almost $80 a piece for. I am also giving 1 star for customer service. We contacted Amazon about returning the tablets (pink and purple only because we aren't 100% sure that our son didn't do the damage). They authorized a return for one, but not the other claiming it was out of the 30 day return period. Well, duh. Of course it is. We bought these for Christmas presents and did not wait until the last minute to buy so 30 days pretty much passed before my kids laid hands on the things. Frankly, if you're going to sell crap, you should be prepared to refund money for crap. I don't want to replace crap with more crap. I want my money back so I can buy something worth my money.

This tablets screen, i would be surprised if it was truly 1280x600 hd from a quality control stand point.  In the same note, the front/back cameras seem to take equal quality pictures, yet the back camera is rated at 4 times the picture quality.  The picture is maybe half the quality as a kindle fire hd.  This tablets picture seems to be recessed into the tablet so the pictures cannot be seen clearly except for straight on and is very low lit.  Frustrating for anyone who has used a kindle as there screen seems to display right at the surface and withvery viberant.  You will need to buy speakers of some kind for this tablet.  This tablet 85 compared to kindle fire hd with camera at 140 used or 200-225 new.  Save for the kindle unless youre like me and buying several for kids as that can get expensive.

I've read mixed reviews on this and was very concerned about a lot of the negative reviews but decided to give the product a chance.As always Amazon has amazing fast delivery, product came within 2 days.When opening the packaging the first thing I noticed were a few scratches on the cameras. It appears as if this may have been either poorly put together or simply refurbished and sold as new. Knowing that this device wasn't the top of the line android I fully expected the performance to not be amazing. The casing seems to be very cheap plastic and the screen is flimsy and weak feeling. The size of the device was perfect and the carrying case that we purchased with it looked great initially. After charging the device for a full 10 hours the battery life seemed to die pretty quickly with no apps running while navigating through the menus. During usage I began to smell burning plastic possibly internally of the device. After powering off the device because of this, the device turned on its own with no user interaction, possibly a bad chip set or power button? After shutting it down again and letting it cool off I turned it back on and tried to connect to my wireless network. This device was unable to connect to my home WIFI and my Galaxy S4 in tethering mode. I tried to connect also to an open network in my neighborhood but the device was unable to pull an IP address. To me that immediately indicated this device has a faulty wireless chip. I decided to turn to the web to see others reviews on this product which were also very similar in negative feedback. One major red flag I saw after looking through the included documentation it states on a few small cut sheets of paper. \"Please follow the steps if you have any difficulty of powering on your tablet for the first time\" and has instructions on how to perform this. On a yellow sheet of paper with big bold red letters \"CALL US BEFORE YOU CONSIDER RETURNING THIS PRODUCT\", that pretty much tells me they've had issues with their devices and have included this in the documents. Not a good sign for a consumer on unboxing. The last piece of instructions \" How to make tablet run faster and last longer?\", instructs the user to search app killer in the play store to save on battery life and cpu usage, almost as if they advertise a fast processor but have doubts on its performance.Overall I understand that this was a cheap product, you basically get what you pay for but I at least hoped it would work out of the box from the start. I'll probably never buy a product from this company again.

I received an email back saying the tablet screen was broken and that it wouldn't be warranty.  They asked me how it had gotten broke.

Not that good of a tablet...", "Author": "TigerBite", "ReviewID": "R25PX65U2XC7TL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for my brother as a Christmas present because it was an inexpensive tablet that wouldn't break my bank. It came in and after about three hours using it, my brother gave it back and said he didn't like it (what an a-hole, he could've been done it a nicer way). Yeah so I'm stuck with this tablet because I ordered it awhile back and it's passed the 30 day return period. From first glance it looks nice but when you get into playing around with it that you'll find that it is limited and cannot do as much as you'd hope. First off the display is is pretty clear and is HD but not as good as an iPad or the Surface (I have neither but my friends have them and they are really nice.) Video quality from Youtube on this thing is garbage, the sound isn't that loud even on max, the charger it comes with doesn't work. Even though it's a standard Android charger, my phone charger can't get it to charge. The screen has a negative type effect to it if tilt it so you'll get distorted colors. I can say more but I won't. If you're thinking of getting this, don't. Save your money and spend a little more to get a Nexus or Galaxy Tab.*Update* (1/11/14)I found out last week that quality from the Youtube app is better. I was using the browser for Youtbe so that's why the quality wasn't that good. Soooo... today I accidentally dropped the tablet (yes, my fault) and the back piece came off and the wire got disconnected. Since I'm not a techie I didn't know if you could've just re-wired it or something but now my tablet is broken.
