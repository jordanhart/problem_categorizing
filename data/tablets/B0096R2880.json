Getting the games to download, however, was a different story. The play store ran very, very slowly, and downloads were very slow. Also, trying to get onto the internet, facebook, or pinterest was nearly impossible. Every time I try to use the internet, it either runs as slow as molasses, or it pops up and says \"not responding, please close\". I finally gave up on ever trying to do anything on it, other than playing bejeweled. I finally have contacted the seller to request returning the item and receiving a refund.
