(and I expected good its great)", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "R2V2T3SFXJMHGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before you read my review, I'd like to point out that you may see Acer pictures on Amazon that make it look like different machines with different prices. They are not. There are two models available the W500 (this model) has Windows home premium and W500P, has windows professional. Now on to my review of the W500:Received my Acer Iconia 32gb windows 7 W500 Tablet/ netbook from Amazon yesterday and immediately I unwrapped and fired it up mounted in the keyboard. After starting, I removed Adobe reader 9.1, Acer games, Ebay world, Skype4.1, and reloaded Skype 5.3, added Firefox with the grab and drag add on for easy tablet use, added sumatra pdf (takes no space compared to adobe9.1,  removed live essentials and more. My previous computer was a Asus T91mt tablet/netbook, right away I noticed the following about this Acer, screen is much brighter and more detailed, audio is louder especially on earphones, installed my 32gb SD card from my old computer with all my files and I could easily transfer to various folders on the computer. I adjusted the stick mouse and found it easy to operate. (But I am a old IBM user so you may want to use a USB mouse while in the keyboard mount) I have read reviews that the screen is top heavy and could fall out of the keyboard. Not so. Although the screen is heavier than the keyboard, I found it sits attached to the keyboard very nicely, I even leaned the screen and keyboard way back and it still would not tip and in fact I'm typing this review on my lap now!!! (Leaning the screen forward toward you while in the keyboard it could come out since that's how you remove the screen) Haven't experimented with the tablet yet, but I can see it is well built! Very well built! As a test, I played a 1080 blu-ray movie (the Mask) from my SD Card on this unit and it played with out a glitch. This is a movie that would not play on any of my previous netbooks and I've owned 4 of them. I have read in other reviews that this computer handles everything thrown at it. I also read the match up of the INTEL dual core 550N against this AMD C-50 CPU/GPU and the AMD blew away the intel. It took AMD 5 years to develop this special processor, a blend of a Processor and a graphics chip on one die! Very Incredible. AMD calls it a APU. Goodbye CPU! I can do everything on this machine that I do on my desktop, connected to my home wireless N in seconds, connected to my wireless HP network printer in seconds.  More to come! So far very happy! This unit blows away my former Asus T91mt tablet/netbook! I am so glad that I didn't get sucked into the hype of all the latest tablets with honeycomb 3. I'll keep my android software on my phone where it belongs! I must mention there is a review by Sticky on the other listed Acer W500 on Amazon that was very passionate and convinced me to purchase this computer and he was right on with his review!UPDATE:It has only been a few days later. I can't stop playing with this unit!!  I skyped with my grand daughter 50 miles away and the incoming picture and  audio was perfect. I was told my audio was noisy (I later found the microphone setting in windows was boosted to 30+) I adjusted that. I can't think of one item I don't like about this computer. Its so quiet! Tablet is bright, very detailed and easy to surf the web etc. The tablet has a nice  border, which makes the unit easy to hold so you are not putting your fingers on the glass. Bought a Targus capacitive stylus. Perfect for drawing and writing and browsing on the tablet. This is a must have, especially if you use the Microsoft journal that comes with the netbook for writing or printing notes directly on he screen. (Plus it keeps the glass clean) Tablet is fantastic, it came from the factory with a clear very thin plastic screen cover. You can use the screen with the cover on or take it off. I peeled mine off, but I didn't notice a difference in response. Screen is very responsive. I haven't read all the gestures that can be performed, I know if you hold your finger or stylus on the screen it will act like a mouse right click. I like the windows button (which lights blue), which allows you to access the task bar and start menu with ease. My old Asus tablet had a problem accessing the task bar especially if you set it to hide position. Not with this unit! Still experimenting!UPDATE: (a week later)Love this machine. Purchased the Targus TSM148US mini bag. It is in my opinion the perfect bag for this machine, holds the keyboard and screen with plenty of room for your power supply and earphones , capacitive stylus and more etc. I also purchased the tablet holder by Arkon, it is a folding tablet stand and this solves the problem for people that complained that the screen doesn't fold while attached to the keyboard. Works like it was built for this tablet!  I am also using my android phone with PdaNet app to get internet on the train via blue-tooth. Very cool! I'm easily getting 6 hrs of battery life browsing the web, even more with the wifi off and reading my Ebooks using kindle, my skype sessions with my grand daughter are incredible! The video and audio are perfect! Also I like Internet explorer 9 as a touch browser. This Acer is better than any previous netbook I have owned. This  machine is a keeper. Brightest screen I have owned in a netbook, great screen detail, with windows 7 I can do everything I need in a computer! I could go on and on.UPDATE (1 month later)All the above still stands, this is to date the best netbook/pc I have ever owned. It is super quiet, bright screen and nice clean resolution. There is a new bios update at the Acer site. I ran it and upgraded my bios to 1.08 This is truly a very well built tablet and after a month of use, I'm enjoying it more and more. I just played a HD Movie file that was 1920 x 1080 with not even a glitch. My dual-core 2.5ghz desktop at work can't play this file with out glitches/pauses. This machine is incredible! One last point, I don't remember if I mentioned it in the past but this computer has been reported to accept SDXC cards. Why is this important? SDXC are the newest SD cards and they can go up to 2 terabytes!!  Of course at this time a 2 terabyte card would cost you 5k, but you can purchase a 64gb sdxc card for about $115 dollars and this means this computer unlike many other tablets will always have the room for your future programs!UPDATE (2 months later)Everything above still stands. In fact, my main laptop was a HP 14 inch dual core machine. I gave it to my brother, this Acer is my main laptop, Netbook, Tablet, what ever you wish to call it. Bright screen and very quiet. BTW, I stopped using pdanet and switched to the virgin mobile 2200 mifi to get internet on the train. It is a fantastic product. No contract, buy from wally and you will get a free 1gb upgrade of data per month.UPDATE (January 2013)For those that will question a use of a windows tablet. There is no doubt that if you want a tablet, a windows tablet has many more functions then a android tablet and windows 8 is perfect to install on this unit. For the year 2011 this was a nice tablet/laptop but now its 2013 and OMG there are so many choices out there with windows 8 already installed. There is the HP surface, the Lenovo ideapad, the Lenovo twist and much more. All these mentioned are now better than this machine. Technology gets better every year. So I too have moved on, Presently I am using the Acer Aspire one 722 netbook with the C60 processor but I am looking at one of these models mentioned above. For those who still have their Acer w 500 I bet you installed windows 8 on it to improve touch screen functionality! Right now its the only way to go!", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Tablet idea with a need for more space", "Author": "Rudy James Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3ELNJLA9F9TCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tablet since it was released two weeks ago. The look and feel of the unit is great. The touch screen is very responsive and HD videos look great on it. You get 2 gigs of system mem and 32gig SSD. Of course you get a full operation system in win 7. Web surfing is no problem the only site I have had a problem with is the Apple movie trailer site. I am not sure if it is the unit or the fact I am using Explorer 9.Wifi connections worked great and the keyboard add on is very easy to use but be warned you can not use it on your lap unless you have a laptop tray or flat hard surface to place it on then on your lap. When put together the tablet part is a bit top heavy. I have used it to watch Unbox video and did some netflix streaming. Installed office, Itunes and a PC stragey game all worked with no problem.The bad:: I wish I could say all is great with the unit but sorry to say the biggest thing that is holding the unit back from 5 stars is that it only has a 32gig SSD. And out of the box the user has just 17gigs of that to use. Believe me that is not a lot of space thses days. My Itunes collection took up over 10gigs and adding office on top of that was really killing the SSD. I did try and find and remove the bloatware stuff but found very little of it. I did not see away to open the case and replace the SSD with a larger one. The other bad spot is the cameras recording video on the rear mounted cam is not that great I found dropped frames and jerkness in the video. Also both cams are 1.3meg I think the rear should be at 5mp.New to the unit is an APU not a CPU. What the APU is a combined CPU and GPU. On the APU is a 256meg graphics card and I have to say it performed very well. The battery life from my use was showing about what most reviews say 5 to 6 hours. The screen can handle at lest 5 touch points which I tested. Not sure if it handle 10 it is hard to get 10 fingers on the screen at one time.Portablity is no problem I have a small case that I carry the unit with keyboard and my ipad all in the same case.Over all I enjoy using the unit that cost less then some Honeycomb tablets and the added keyboard made me like this unit over the 16gig Asus Transformer. There is room for improvement and I hope a patch to fix the cam. All in all if you need something portable and touch with a full operating system this is a great unit.May 2 2011 UpdateLast night I tried more netflix streaming useing wifi and battery and I was met with a lot of lag. It got worst when I went full screen. I then switched to Amazon Unbox streaming for a movie I owned and it was perfect no lag very smooth end up watching the entire movie on battery. I know Netflix uses siliver light that could be the problem.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "as an engineer, i think this is an fantastic tablet for work and entertainment", "Author": "alberthyc", "ReviewID": "R35ECZDAZ5FN4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an electrical engineer, so i'm kinda geeky and technology oriented. I was looking for a tablet that can be used to do some real work, install some softwares i need,  and I want a tablet with highest price-performance ratio.Apple Ipad is for entertainment and have low price-performance ratio. Android tablet has decent price-performance ratio, but i can't install softwares,(apps are not really considered softwares to me). So my choice is the only Windows tablet and i came across this one. After checking out other reviews and youtube videos, i bought this immediately when there was a deal. Here's my experience after using this a while:Fantastic Fantastic Tablet!The hardware: AMD C-50 apu is really doing a good job, 2 GB ram at 1066MHz and a SSD is simply fast enough. I have workstation with AMD 6 core CPU, 16GB 1333MHz ram and SSD with r/w speed of 250MB, which is lightening fast.With comparison, i have to say that the tablet is pretty good! Of course it's slower, but definitely within my tolerance range.The screen: beautiful and bright. i have IPS monitors, but still find the tablet screen to be very sharp and crisp. Personally, i don't like glossy screen, too shinny for me, but that's me. Touch is very sensitive and accurate.The battery: upto 3 hrs of straight video playing. With power save mode, i can get 5-6 hrs of normal use, ie,surfing internet with wifi on,running some programs, reading pdfs. You can't charge this with a USB, that's not really a downside for the tablet, since USB port output power is simply not enough. Ipad and android tablet has ARM architecture which have much lower power consumption compare to the laptops or netbooks that have x-86 architecture.You'll never see a laptop that have USB charging function.The keyboard: a bit small, but you'll get used to it. Can be very handy when working on some Word documents. but, dock and undock process can be cumbersome, and the screen tilt is fixed when docked.The speaker: loud, the sound quality is decent.The camera: the tablet came with front and rear 1.3MP camera, you can do video chat with it, the picture quality is not that great, but i personally don't care. for emergency, i can just use the cellphone camera, for other case, i have a DSLR.Other: the tablet does have ventilation, but it's very quite even when CPU is 100%My usage for this tablet:I used this tablet to do 3D-design work. Yes you heard me. Since this APU have a HD6250 gpu inside, it handles 3D graphics very well, 3D structure rotation,zooming all works pretty smooth.I also installed Hamachi software to create a vitual LAN between this tablet and my workstation. Then i remote control my workstation from the tablet. So once i get my 3D design finished on my tablet, i'll send the design to my workstation to let it simulate for hours(very CPU and RAM intensive, so tablet can't handle and it's not intended anyway). If you have a smartphone like android, you can turn your phone into a mobile wifi hotspot, so the file transfer can be done anytime, anywhere. Very convenient! Windows tablet shines when it comes to real work.I use it as an e-reader as well, holding it is a little bit heavy, so you can grab a tablet stand, put it on the docking station or just put it on table. if you go to school, you can use this to take note by hand writing, just get a stylus pen. You can also install MS office suite for obvious reasons.Internet surfing is smooth, i would prefer to turn the smartphone into a wifi hotspot and use the tablet to surf, much better experience.The tablet have 2 usb2.0 ports, so you can transfer files to/from other device, even charging your dead cellphone,lol.Watching video is also nice, playing 720p very smoothly.Major Pros: VERY HIGH price-performance ratio, good hardware spec, using win 7 can get some real work done , nice screen, docking keyboard is handy, having USB 2.0 ports IS GREATMajor Cons: a bit heavy, isn't the best look tablet(which i dun care :P), docking and undocking can be cumbersome, screen is a fingerprint magnetI can't really comment on the reliability of the acer product, since i haven't use this for that long. So far so good, i'm very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this tablet to anyone.additional update:I would like further comment on the tablet. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, but the back of the tablet is not. The back is made of plastic, have a ok touch feeling. It's not as fancy as Ipad's metallic back, but Ipad trades off wireless signal strength for the looks.I'm a cellphone antenna designer, and large metal piece could be bad for antennas, it act as shield to block out the signals. So Ipad does have signal strength problems which ppl complains about losing wifi connection(do a google search:iPad WiFi Woes - Myth or Reality?), because there's freaking large piece of signal blocker. So if the wifi signal is from a particular angle, you may have weak wifi signal. Therefore, many manufactures sticks to plastics,ie, thinkpad,dell's inspiron. Plastics is cheaper to make and have less signal problems.Maybe it's less aesthetic then shinny metallic looks,but when you frequently losing or having weak wifi connections, you'll find this to be very annoying and frustrating.For this tablet, wifi signal strength and range is great. I had 1MB/s download speed.Tips: install programs on SSD, get a SD card, move my documents,my music...etc, all the storage related folders to SD, incase you need to reinstall win 7 on tablet, you don't lose anything.do a optimization for SSD, stop unnecessary programs that runs on startup, so you tablet runs faster~for gesture controls, you can customize win7 build-in gesture control called flicks, you can also download a very useful software called flicks2, it greatly extends the number of gestures you can use, quite convenient", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Day 2 Update", "Author": "John D. \"john-d8\"", "ReviewID": "R125BPTHEWB57A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "24 Hour ReviewI have had this tablet/netbook/convertable for a day and I'll relay my first impressions.First the oddities.1. When attached to the keyboard, it sits at one angle. No ajustment. This doesnt bother me much, but it might some people.2. The keyboard is slightly off center to the center of the screen. This does bother me a bit as a touch typist; and the home ribs on the F and J keys are the line at the bottom.Oddity or benefit?The keyboard needs to be traveled with imo. The tablet portion locks into the postion with the keyboard which forms the protective side for the screen.Likes.1. Audio quality from the headphone jack is excellent. (Pandora + Monster Turbines)2. Very nice looking screen, with fast seeming pixal response.3. Touch Screen is responsive and acurate.

Sure you can use micro on a adaptor, but why pay that much extra?Will update as I get more time with it.Day 2 Update...Basic battery test; Wifi streamed Pandora, headphones, powersave mode, LCD off about 60% = 5.4 hours until Windows started on the \"automaticly sleep\" stuff at 7% battery remaining.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thought I'd like it - but instead LOVE it. One of the best tablets available.", "Author": "mikebreakall", "ReviewID": "R1FTYS1YT3D3O4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows touch devices have been out for a decade at least, most being bulky and for use with pens. Many had resistant screens instead of capacitive ones that have become so popular. The Acer W500 is one of the new tablets released after the iPad let people realize what hardware really works on a tablet, but with the full functionality of a Windows computer.Windows 7 is wonderful with a touch screen, no matter what you read elsewhere, and I find the W500 exceptionally responsive. Things like Windows Flicks, Chrome touch addons, and Win Gadgets make the browsing experience just as good as non-Windows tablets. There is nothing like having a tablet design in the same size and weight range as the iPad (which I also own) that also gives you the full computer experience. After having this for about 4 days, the iPad started to look like a huge gimmick. Don't get me wrong, I love Apple products. I had an iPhone for 18 months, and still have a Mac Pro as my main device at home. I use the HTC Thunderbolt now so have also gone deep into the world of Android.  After all that there's nothing like having a tablet that does every single thing that a normal computer does. I'm not limited to buying apps or something simple like not being able to have two programs on the screen at the same time. Anything you can do on a Win7 machine, you can do here. This means Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, etc, will all work normally without any special subscription or apps. It goes without saying that Flash works fine, and you can have Microsoft Word or Open Office installed, along with VLC, Photoshop, FTP Clients, Chat clients. Just the other day I was reading an article, downloading a program, listening to music, had a movie paused and minimized, and chatting with multiple friends on gtalk/facebook. No matter how good multi-tasking is on Honeycomb/iPad, it can't show more than one of those thing happening on the screen at the same time.If you are in the Droid or iPad echo-sphere, go ahead and stay there, but boy are you missing out. This tablet has not a single limitation, and at the end of my couch surfing morning, I bring it into work, plug into my 20\" monitor, and do my normal days company work with corporate e-mail and programs on the exact same machine.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A full Windows PC in a form that's actually mobile...unlike a laptop!", "Author": "swyzlstyx", "ReviewID": "R2RA4HL8C7495F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I'll say my review is based on the fact I bought the W500 to replace an Acer laptop, which I use almost entirely for running my small business. Aside from my monster PC used for editing videos, I run my business and personal stuff pretty much entirely with Google Apps, and OpenOffice for editing/creating MS Office compatible work. So I don't need a big hard drive, 6-core processor, or automatic features that let me tell all my pretend friends on Facebook how much I need a cup of coffee.I don't play games...at all...on the computer.I work from home, so I don't need 4G in my computer. I have a wireless router. I use Google Voice for telephone service, and Google Video Chat for videoconferencing, both of which are completely free. Both work exceptionally well on the W500, using my wireless router and cable internet.I didn't want my tablet PC to be a phone...no 4G needed...no Android or iPhone junk.  I don't need \"apps\". The only \"apps\" I use are Google Apps, which I use to run my small home-based business, through the Google Chrome browser. Email, Calendar, Documents, Blogger (my website), Youtube for video hosting, telephone service, video conferencing, and more, all free and work exceptionally well on the W500 using my wireless router and cable internet. When I do need a cellphone, I use a cheap prepaid that cost me about $30 a year for all the \"minutes\" I need.For even better sound quality, I picked up the affordable Logitech USB Headset H360 (Black) headset, which makes voice/video calls sound amazing.I find the 32gb hard drive plenty big. About the only thing I have loaded besides Windows 7 is OpenOffice, Kindle for PC, and Google Chrome/Voice/Video. The drive is less than half full! All of my docs, pictures, and videos are hosted on the web.I deleted the mounds of crap the W500 came loaded with, and removed/turned off a bunch of the Windows 7 garbage. Acer has some sort of \"social jogger\" application which I deleted first. I think Facebook is pretty silly, and don't need to tell a girl I sat next to in 3rd grade that I had tacos for dinner. After deleting all that junk, turning off a bunch of services, and letting Windows spend the day updating itself, the W500 is lean and runs fast. I think it boots up in like 15-20 seconds. Yes, updating a new install of Windows is a PITA...it always is. Just buy a case of beer, and spend the day getting them all installed so it will quit bugging you and let your computer perform like it should.I think the battery life is awesome. Checking email throughout the day, browsing Amazon, checking my bank accounts, and finding a place to eat, the battery will last almost all day! Then again, I'm not comparing this to a cellphone...it's not a cellphone...it's a tablet PC. My Acer laptop doesn't last a couple of hours...with a NEW battery. And then the batteries die after a few months, at which time you have to replace them. My Acer laptop pretty much had to stay tethered to the AC power cord, which defeated the purpose of having a mobile PC.Plus, a laptop is so heavy, it's not like you can carry it when running errands/grocery shopping. I maintain my shopping list in Google Docs, print it to a PDF onto the W500 desktop before I leave the house, and drop the W500 into my small messenger bag. No more printing paper shopping lists. Wanna browse the internet in the local coffee shop/bar? No need to clear a table and setup a whole office with a laptop...just pull out the W500.I'm not sure what all the negative comments are about the keyboard are either. It's ingenious, and works great. No, the screen angle isn't adjustable...but it's already at a perfect angle for me. I leave the keyboard in my den, along with a wireless mouse and mousepad, to use the W500 when I'm out of my office. Then I just pop the tablet off the keyboard when I go down to the bottom floor to the kitchen. It's totally mobile...unlike a heavy/cumbersome laptop. Wanna take the keyboard with you? It doesn't take a bunch of difficult steps, like some suggest. The tab pulls straight up off...no catches/releases to press. Then you just lay it face down on the keyboard. one side is automatically locked with two magnetic pins that pop out, and the other end has a manual lock, to keep it from being accidentally pried apart. The whole process takes about 2 seconds...it couldn't be any easier. If you're using the keyboard on your lap...then you probably should buy a \"laptop\" instead. Yes, it will obviously be top heavy when on your lap...why wouldn't it be?The software keyboard works great, especially with a stylus. I got one of these, that also has a regular pen in it. Works perfectly: TouchTec\u00ae II Capacitive iPad Stylus and Ball Point Pen for Apple iPad 2, iPhone 4 and Droid Phones - 7mm (Black)It has a full sized SDHC card reader, which is awesome for uploading photos/video straight to my photo/video host website from anywhere with a wi-fi connection. I put a Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10) in there \"just in case\", but haven't put anything on it yet. I may use the card to store my library of CD's, which I have converted to MP3. (Yes, I still buy all of my music on CD, convert to MP3, then store the CD for safekeeping. I'm old, I guess!)The full sized HDMI connection is also really cool. I plugged it right into my big flat panel TV, and the picture was absolutely amazing! It would probably be really cool to use for video conferencing from my den, on the big TV.Yeah, both of the USB ports are on the bottom...which are blocked when the keyboard is attached...but the keyboard has two USB ports on it. I only use my USB mouse and USB headset when I'm using the keyboard anyways, so that works fine for me.The touchscreen works great for me. For better accuracy than my fat fingers can produce, I use the stylus.Screen flip/rotation works great. Most importantly, it has a manual locking switch on the bottom, so the screen isn't flipping all around when carrying the tablet in my hand. I only need it to be oriented one direction at a time! ;) Also, when you have it locked in portrait position, it will automatically go back to landscape when attached to the keypad.This thing has been a great investment for my home based business. I can run my business on it from any room of the three-story loft, and reply to emails from potential clients instantly, which is VERY important in landing jobs. If you actually have a personal life (or pretend one on FB) and a real day job away from the house, and want all the fun and games \"apps\" can bring, a cellphone tablet running Android and a battery that lasts for days might be a better option. If you need a full blown Windows 7 personal computer to take care of your professional and household operations, that you can carry with you anywhere in a small pouch, I don't know of a better option out there.

The seperate key board is great. I have read some other reviews concered with it tipping over I have no problem with that at all. The keys and extra ports on the attachment com in handy for adding an external drive and a mouse.I own this and a first gen Ipad this unit feels better in my hands then the Ipad. Of course all websites have no problems I did upgrade to Explorer 9 which I would say is good but the changes made in version 9 is less touch friendly then vesion 8 or I am still getting things set on it. The touch screen can handle up to at least 5 touch points.The bad the 32 gig SSD fills up quick out of the box I had only 17 gig to use from the Win 7 and Acer installed programs. I have been working on freeing up more space. The back cam is only a 1.3 which I question why so low the video performance of the camera is not the best not very smooth when taking video I notice some dropped frames and jumping. To help with the storage the SD can handle another 32gigs but it doens not combine it with the ssd space to reflect a total 64 gigs. I know on my Acer Netbook I have a sd slot that does combine with the hard drive. I also know on newer Acer netbooks they took this out.Over all I really like the unit even with the limits of the storage (will not be able to put all of my Itunes lib on it) The look is great the feel is wonderful the price is less then the cost of an Xoom or about the same as a Asus Transformer with keyboard but this unit is much more then a media comsumition device.I will update the review as I spend time working on the unit.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "W500 for a total new experience", "Author": "H. Tuyen", "ReviewID": "R114GS2VLU2O0C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I would like to say that I had the iPad for two years, and now I owned this Windows 7 tablet. So what I will compare directly between the iPad and this Acer W500 Windows 7.GAMING:+This tablet is not for gaming, I'm pretty sure about that. On the IPAD, you can find thousands of games that help you to entertain. But with this tablet, I can barely find some Flash games, or 2d games that compatible with the touch screen only (and most of them are pretty old actually, Bejeweled 2 for example :) This tablet is not for gaming, if you really love those mini games, don't get this because you will soon be disappointed because of its limitation.+HOWEVER, if you play the games with the keyboard and mouse (I offer the bundle of wireless mouse + key), it is a completely different issue. I've tried to run some online games, yes serious online games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends at minimum setting and it worked perfectly to me but some people may not like playing with minimized graphic. I've also tried Red Alert 3 on it at minimum setting, it work fine but it lagged sometime when there were too many NPC. Those are serious games, but you may not like it when it fit on a 10\" screen.NOTE: when I turned everything off and run only WoW or LoL or RA3, the cpu is about 50%, 60% and the memory is about 80%, but when the game get busy, the CPU heated up to 80%, 90% and when it hit 100% the game get small lag or freeze. So if you want a Windows 7 tablet that have fun games, get a wireless mouse and it still have potential for you to enjoy many great games.SOFTWARE:+I'm talking about the MICROSOFT OFFICE here, not the Lite version, not the minimized Page version on the iPad. Microsoft Words and Microsoft PowerPoint (both 2007) worked perfectly to me at low hardware usage. I forgot about my old days when I have to use pages on the iPad for emergency stuffs, it really hard and very limited for what you can do on it. But in this W500, I felt like I carried the whole PC with me when I do the Office.NOTE: Sure thing, you will need the keyboard when you type on this because of how wide it is it wont allow you to hold the tablet with two hands and type with two thumbs.+This is when it get exciting: PHOTOSHOP. I installed the Photoshop CS4. I used the HD images at the size of 1920x1080 or around that for this review. You may not like it when you need to PTS those heavy 15MP images, but resize it in around half, it will be fine. How did I photoshop it? I created several layers (4 or 5) and did all those works in there, included: Cropping, resizing, Texts, Blending layers, changing HUE, changing Light, free transformation, Lasso tool, Marquee tools, Magic Wand tool, BRUSH tool... so many thing to list so just image yourself using the photoshop on it (with TOUCHING). on the iPad you WILL NEVER find an app the give the power of the Photoshop itself. I remembered I collected around 30 apps that contained every tiny tool in each app and I still not feel like I can photoshop with the iPad. When I photoshop with those images, the CPU usage is around 60%. But when you get to the 3D, Wrapping tool for example, it heated the machine up, but still worked fine.Conclusion: This is why we should get the Windows 7 tablet for, they give you the fully operated software, not those tiny app. I love photography and with this I can finally have a real Photoshop artwork when I'm go out.INTERNET BROWSER: I highly recommended you to get Google Chrome. It worked way faster than Internet Explorer. Oh yes, FLASH. Now I can play youtube video without worrying about limitation. Apple keep telling me that I dont need Flash in the tablet, but that is a false statement. FLASH give you the fully and perfected experience when you browse the web. Now I can check in with my Facebook games, watch the Youtube videos, dont have to worry about \"Flash is not supported\" when I need to use a webpage to work. Oh, I opened Youtube with 3 360p videos or one 1080P video and the CPU usage is around 80%, no delay and freezing.MUSIC AND MOVIE: PERFECT, just PERFECT. on the iPad, if I want to play 1080p movie, I have to convert and sync, those two steps took me a long long time and I had to worry about the memory usage too when one 1080p Movie cost my around 25% of my iPad memory usage (8gb in a 32gb).I played MKV 1080p Movie with Media Player Classic and the codec pack. Some of us may find difficulty when trying to watch the 1080p movie in here but do some research and you will get there. It work perfectly at around 80% CPU. If you worry about how heavy those files are, get the portable external hard drive (1tb is good?) and you will never have to delete any files again. 1080p movie + Dolby speaker system gave me the perfect experience, just perfect. Those Dolby speakers have strong bass, solid sounds, clear and loud in any direction you pointed it to.HARDWARE:+Battery: sad thing first, the battery it kinda WEAK. iTunes playback at 50% volume gave me 4 hours. 2.5 hours on 1080p Movie, 3.5 hours on 720p movie (with the speakers on and medium brightness). It saved alot of battery % when you use the headphone, earphone etc.+Touchscreen: very responsive and high resolution. but it kinda have pixelated dots when you stare at it extremely close since it had the different screen display compare to the iPad. One thing about the touch screen, some people have problem with the touch screen with it not working and move randomly, I never have to experience that. but However, sometime the screen does not response when I turn it up from Sleep mode, I had to restart the machine to get it work. ( a little bit of worry!?)+MEMORY USAGE: the SSD gave you 32gb. I believe those gigabytes are only for software like Office, Photoshop, Windows OS (Windows itslef took 13gb), or any others programs, but not video, music, and may not even games. I installed the games, video, music, pictures in the memory cards or external hard drive. You can \"upgrade\" your memory % any time by getting a new card. The 32gb SDHC card is around $50, way cheaper than when I had to upgrade the iPad memory usage($100 for 16gb). BY THE WAY: it read SDXC too (the fast cards that worked with the DSLRs).NOTE: you may not like the external hard drive when you use it and it eat all of the battery when you dont charge the machine.+KEYBOARD DOCK: it give you only two option, you dock the tablet up around 135 degrees. or you put it completely down. you cant rotate around when docking. Only one position. The keyboard included the \"mouse\" like the red dot in those Thinkpads. It is a full-sized qwerty, responsive and big-enough buttons.+CAMERA: HORRIBLE to be honest, it is slow and laggy when I take 1024x720 images, but it is fine if you reduce the resolution.LAST NOTE: this is not the dependent machine, it work completely independently. They dont give you the USB cable to connect btw the Tablet and the PC because there is no output for that. Oh here is the funny thing, I synced the iPhone with this Tablet, yep, iOS may have to be depend on this (iPad have to be dependent on a Windows 7 tablet?!). This is the tablet for anyone who would bring there works outdoor, but one more time: you may not like the gaming part of it.4.5 STARS IS WHAT IS DESERVED.UPDATE: I actually forgot about one thing, some may like it but some may not: The battery charger is long,(about 6ft), way better than the iPad's charger, but it is a little bit bulky ( way bigger than the iPad's). ONE MORE GOOD THING: it is designed to plug to the electric outlet BOTH VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL WAY.I tried to give my best shot in this review. feel free to ask me anything I will try my best to answer them. Sorry for any spelling and grammar errors. :)UPDATE 2: Someone asked me to try Pogo and I did. I found many games on it that I can play with. However, I could not play some games without the mouse, most of the game in there is compatible with the touch only (which is the left-click on the mouse), but again, I need the mouse for the right-click or the scroll wheel(for setting the amount of bet in Monopoly for example). Yeah, I think you can play all the games in there if you have the mouse.**One more thing: I installed Java and tried the Pogo games first with Google Chrome, for some games it worked just fine(Scrabble) but some others(Monopoly) it worked a bit slow (about 8 frames per second or so). Then I switched to Firefox and Monopoly I played just fine.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "It works for me!", "Author": "PKSmart", "ReviewID": "R28W97JT85UR4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this Acer W500 2 weeks ago - And LOVE it!  It will take some tweaks to get this machine up to speed, but well worth it.First off let me say that I looked at getting a Xoom or Ipad  I have a droid phone and love all the things it can do, but it did not meet my requirements for working with the programs I use extensively like Photoshop, OneNote and Outlook.  After searching for many months this machine seemed to do everything I need to keep my business going.This tablet was shipped quickly and includes almost everything you need to use:  The tablet (screen), keyboard, power cord and recovery DVD's.  I would recommend purchasing an SD card and external DVD player, as well as a case to carry it.First thing I did was remove all applications I did not need.  I hate bloatware and would rather have a clean machine to begin with.  Removing the bloat, updating windows, and updating the BIOS took a good day's work.  One thing I kept on the machine was the Acer backup manager.  After all my work, I made an image of my machine and can always go back to my `clean state' whenever I need.  As with all my PC's, I will reload every 9 to 12 months.  Although I made an image, I have not tested this as a restore yet.  I have never been a fan of Windows Backup and it has failed me in the past.I removed the following to make this customized for the way I work:* Acer games (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Bing Bar* Ebay worldwide* Clear.fi* Clear.fi client* Office 2010 (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Social jogger (had to delete the folder after uninstall)* Times reader* Virtual earth 3d* Nook for PC* MS Touch Pack* Acer VCM (will need a reboot)* McAfee (will need a reboot)* Acer screen saver* Acer touch application Suite* Acer welcome center* Acer registration (I registered first)* Acer Device Control* Auepo* Bluetooth suite* Acer device controlI also deleted the Netfix folder and the Skype folder.  These were not installed and I would rather make sure I have installed the latest and greatest instead of what was current at the time of shipment.Then I changed windows folders to single-click instead of the double click that I am used to with a mouse.  This makes touching the screen so much easier!  It's kinda funny that when I go to my other laptop, I am touching the screen expecting it to act like this tablet.  This is how fast it is to get used to the touch.I also turned off windows features:* Games (I don't play games on this machine)* IE8 - Chrome is much better and I can sync folders* Internet printing* DVD maker* GadgetI then installed and mounted a 32 GB SD card.  Mounting the card allows me to install applications to the SD card instead of the c:\\ drive.I installed the following to my mounted SD Card:* AVG Free* Chrome - and set up to sync* Photoshop* Dreamweaver* Dropbox* Turbolister* Mastercook* Office 2007* Quicken* Adobe Acrobat* Picasa* Canon PrinterI do notice that running these programs are a bit slower than my other PC, but the difference is not making me pull my hair out.I love the fact that I can take this anywhere.  I purchased the Belkin Top-loading Messenger bag (for laptops up to 10.2\") which holds the screen, keyboard and power.  Its small lightweight and has 2 padded compartments - I put the screen in one compartment, the keyboard in the other.Overall, this is a work machine, not a toy.  I am very pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it more than I thought", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2Y4PY2WTGLLQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the Acer W500 Tablet PC from another place $100 cheaper than here, on 4/13/11 and it arrived 4/15/11 in perfect condition.  My 8-year-old son and I love the machine and the Microsoft Touch games.  It does everything I need it to.  With the Acer, I really can leave the laptop at home.  When I need to I can remote connect to the server or laptop or desktop.  I use a program called ProComm Plus to connect to controllers at work using a Serial Port or RJ45 LAN port for my job.  The Acer W500 has two USB ports, with a USB to serial adapter it works great.  I also on very rare occasion need to use a dial up modem again USB to dial up modem not a problem, or I can remote to the desktop with it over wireless using internet sharing on my Windows mobile phone.  The keyboard dock that it comes with is great for a keyboard and dock with 2 USB ports and 10/100Mb/s Ethernet jack.  I am a Lenovo/IBM fan for the TrackPoint so when I found this had a Track Stick I was convinced that it is the one.  I love the TrackPoint if there is no mouse then that is my preference.  I briefly looked at some other Window 7 Tablets but price and features lead me to this Acer each time.  I am pleased with all aspects and I am very happy I got this one.I had a hard time finding actual real life reviews of this Tablet.  I had it preordered for a while and it was released before the ETA.  I guess I was one of the first to get it.  There are some reviews and videos online but I am very surprised that there are not more people raving about this.  I read many complaints about Windows 7 not being very touch friendly, I very much disagree.  Most people try to compare it to an Ipad, I am not an Apple software fan however; I love the hardware like the IPad and MacBook Air.  I used to have a MacBook Air but all I did was run Windows on it to use the programs I needed so I sold the Air for what I paid for it and bought a Lenovo tablet pc with double the ram, double the processing power, more ports, and triple the hard drive.  I will probably get rid of the Lenovo now that I have this Acer W500.The only thing I wish is that it had more storage for movies because they look so good, I want to load more on the hard drive and SD card.  I do have a 1tb ultra-portable USB powered hard drive that holds more than enough media.  The Acer USB ports powers and runs the hard drive flawlessly.  Playing a HD Movie off the USB drive with the screen at about 35% brightness (even at 35% it is bright and has such a good sharp smooth picture) I got around 4 hours battery life.  I did not use a stopwatch and I am by no means a professional tester.  Before starting the movie using the wireless network I checked my email and surfed the web for a bit then sat back watched a Watchmen Blu-ray rip about 3 hours.  After the movie, I checked email and surfed some more the power meter showed about 8 minutes before I plugged it in.  I left the wireless connection on the entire time.  I have turned the brightness down to the lowest that I would actually use it properly about 5% and then unplugged the power and the power meter showed 7 hours 41 minutes remaining.  I do not believe that it will last that long but it is very optimistic.  I do use it throughout the day off and on and never needed to charge during the day.To sum up this is a great tablet with Windows 7.  If you are reading this and want windows on a tablet this one is very good. I am not saying it is for you, everyone has different wants in their device.  If all you want is an internet browser that does not support Flash and a bunch of apps to play with, do not get this.  I wanted a real Tablet PC and I got a good one.  To quote a review I read online \"it's still a proper computer rather than a steroid-injected smartphone with ideas above its station\".", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best of both worlds - a fun AND productive tablet!", "Author": "Adi J \"technogeek + sportsfanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R1V4L7G7TP2HOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for my wife after searching for a few months for a tablet that is not only fun but could also prove useful for normal business tasks like word and powerpoint.  Nothing beats the iPad for the cool factor but after the wife played around with it she quickly realised no matter how cool it was, ultimately it would just end up as a toy for playing games only.  She needed something that could do real work and that means office - hence android was also out of the question.Pros- Well built although abit plasticky but not shoddy - feels solid and that it would last- Surprisingly fast performance for a netbook tablet - the C50 really is a great APU.  The SSD is also blazing fast and loads Win7 pretty fast.  Note that for graphic intensive apps, although performance is acceptable, its not blazing.  Booting from cold takes less than 50 seconds and if you tweak windows you can get it down to 30+ seconds.  Going to sleep and waking up from sleep is blazing fast - a matter of seconds hence we always put the tablet in sleep mode for quick access.  Summary, faster than an average netbook but slower than an average business laptop- The screen is bright and responsive.  Viewing angle is also amazing.  Rotation is just ok with some lag when you rotate to/from portrait - not iPhone smooth but acceptable and hardly impacts the experience- Touch on Win7 is surprisingly good.  Not sure why people say its not acceptable.  I am an iPhone user and so is the wife and the touch experience is comparable to the iPhone although not on par.  Think about it, Win7 was not built from the ground up for touch and considering this, the experience it provides for touch on such a machine is amazing!- IE 9 is also surprisingly good with responsive and really smooth scrolling.  I had IE, Firefox and Chrome with touch addin.  IE 9 was the best for touch and I was surprised since I have been a Firefox fan.  Chrome was the worst performer with jittery scrolling- Handwriting recognition is also surprisingly good.  One of the reasons the wife wanted a tablet instead of a normal laptop is so that she can take handwritten notes in meetings.  For this the tablet works wonders.  I bought the wife an elago stylus which had a string and plug that you could attach to the earphone jack. Once you rotate the tab in portrait, you can take handwritten notes right away in Word or even in Notepad.  But i do recommend OneNote since it makes taking and organizing notes so much easier- Productivity.  What can I say?  Out of the box the tablet has Office Starter that was good enough.  I installed Office and the tablet was elevated to a whole new level - it wasn't a toy anymore, it was a real computer.  Pair it with the keyboard and you have a tool you can use to make corrections to your presentations and documents- Full range of real software - be it games (I have installed all sorts of games that are touch friendly - Farm Frenzy, Montezuma, Angry Birds and even afew others for my daughter like Dora etc), Office, photo editing (Art Rage).  You can even mount ISOs- Full file transfer and sharing capabilities - just stick in a USB and you can transfer your file.  Or if you're on wifi, create a mapped drive and you can do your pc-to-pc transfer or even use bluetooth if you so wish.  If you're wondering how to install software from CD/DVD there are two ways.  1. Get an external USB DVD drive.  2. Connect to a wifi network where there is also a second PC with a CD/DVD drive connected on the same network.  On the second PC, share the CD/DVD drive and on the tablet find this share and map it as a drive - its that easy.  3. you can always make a copy of the CD/DVD on a usb stick.  Ah, I almost forgot to mention P2P - load up your favourite client and you are sharing files in no time!- Expansion with an SDHX/SDXC is just a memory card away - an SXHC 64GB card is only $115+.  Cheap!- Battery life is also good enough.  4-5 hours of normal use and a bit less with heavy video and graphic intensive gamesCons- Well the tablet is not perfect - the first gripe is the keyboard. The keys have good feedback but some of the keys are too small especially the arrow keys - so if you're trying to play games that require them, forget it!  Next the docking mechanism although is workable is a bit flimsy.  Once docked and on a flat surface, you're ok.  but if you're using the laptop on your lap, although its still possible to work, you will also have to balance the laptop at the same time.  Also, its difficult to transport the tablet when docked since if you tilt the tab the wrong way even a bit (towards the keyboard), the tablet will pop right out!- The built in SSD is small for Win7.  Although you can expand with an SD, it would have been good to be able to upgrade to a larger drive- It would be nice to have a faster processor but for this price range, the C50 is hard to beat - good enough but not blazingly fast.  Also Win7 as configured and shipped on the tablet is not tuned properly and hence makes the tablet slow.  But once you load the latest updates, drivers and firmware, and remove and turnoff unnecessary bloatware - the tablet is much quicker and gives a whole new experience- Both the built-in cameras are bad.  Haven't played around with the settings but picture quality is subpar and the camera tool is too slow!- Weight and thickness.  I am nitpicking now but wouldn't it be great to have a Win7 tablet that is as light and thin as an iPad?  Now that would sell like hot cakes!- The lack of accessories is also a problem.  I am still unable to source a nice leather folio case to my wife's taste as there are only two that i can find on the market - one on ebay from China which people have said is a bit plasticky and one from Tuffs which although is leather looks a little pedestrianSummaryAll in all, this has been the best gadget purchase in years.  Not only can we consume content like watch movies or play games or browse the web, we can also create and produce content using familiar standard tools like Office without having to worry about compatibility and conversion etc, all at the same time and most of the time with multiple windows open at once - nothing beats a real OS in multitasking and hence in being productive.  Its not the perfect tablet but its the tablet that makes most sense for both having fun and being productive.UPDATE - 26/7/2011Desktop Enhancement SoftwareIn my quest to make the start menu more user friendly and to make the tablet interface look more like a standard tablet, I have installed both ObjectDock and Winstep Nexus to allow easy access to certain menu items.  I have hidden all desktop icons, so that the tablet can showcase the wallpaper in full effect and have kept Winstep Nexus dock for the app launcher.  Winstep Nexus allows grouping of shortcuts into groups (sub-docks) which makes the desktop neat.Educational SoftwareI have a 5 year old who is used to our iPhones and picked up using the W500 in no time.  But I wanted her to not only watch videos or play games but to really use the W500 for learning.  And when I browsed Amazon for children educational software I was pretty disappointed that there is not alot of titles available that were not published after 2006!  All the great reviewed edu-software were created for older windows OS i.e. XP/2000 and some even for Win95/98!But I did take a chance and installed Reader Rabbit and that has been proven a hit!  Although made for XP, everything works well and now we have to fight over usage of the W500 when its laying at home.Reader Rabbit 1st Grade Capers On Cloud NineUPDATE 28/9/2011I have installed Windows 8 Developer Preview on the w500 and it's amazing!  The tablet is now blazing fast and IE10 provides such a smooth experience dare I say surpassing the ipad.  Boot time is only a few seconds (seriously about 5 seconds!) and ALL the apps including MS Office runs faster.  I am amazed that it took MS so long to come up with this OS.  The touch response is also much much more responsive and handwriting recognition is also improved.  Battery life also has improved (no formal testing though).  Now Windows 8 is still in developer preview so it has some small minor bugs but I have decided to keep it on the W500 instead of loading the backup Win7 image - it's that good!  I can't wait for the full release of Windows 8!", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, great price, powerful", "Author": "Christian Strama", "ReviewID": "R54ZQLJ992DVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for 24 hours now and I can't get enough.  It's taken a bit to get the bloatware off and get the Win7 updates and some virus protection, but I've also been surfing the web and I installed Steam so I could play a game or two.First off, let's get one thing straight.  Nothing beats a full OS. Period. Sure, I have an iPod Touch that I love and a Motorola Droid that I love.  But nothing beats the power of a full OS.  I installed Flash in an instant, I installed Chrome in a couple of instants (man IE is soooo slow), and now I put on full versions of software like OpenOffice & Steam.  I plugged in a USB mouse and the included keyboard dock and I'm rocking and rolling.The touchscreen is very responsive and accurate and it is surprisingly easy to use the touchscreen keyboard included in Win 7.This screen is fantastic!  Bright, clear, and a great resolution.  Most netbooks run at 1024X600, but this goes up to 1280x800.  So much fits on the screen and it is not all scrunched up.  I went to YouTube and played several 1080p videos at full screen.  I streamed some NetFlix movies through the browser (no special app needed, thanks full OS) both at full screen and smaller and the colors, brightness, and crispness was astounding.Sure, the SSD is pretty small, only 32gb but really around 17gb after all the software is on.  I removed a lot of the crap pre-installed by Acer, but that only saves around 500mb~1gb.  Good thing there is are some USB ports so you can plug in some external drives.  Or if you have an SD card, go ahead and plug that in.  Try getting that on most of the tablets out there.The keyboard dock is nice.  It locks the screen in place, so don't try to adjust it, you only have one angle at which it sits.  The keys are nicely spaced, so my hands don't feel cramped at all and typing is a breeze.The dual core processor with built in graphics GPU is wonderful.  After you eliminate the Acer bloatware and get a decent browser (FF or Chrome) this thing screams with 2gb of RAM.  Sure, it's not a high end gaming rig, but that's not why I bought it.  I have my gaming machine.  This is for entertainment purposes and doing a little bit of work on the go.  I played some Steam games just fine.  Sure I had to drop the video settings, but if you want to play games at the highest resolutions then you need to buy a proper gaming machine.The battery is only good for about 5 hours.  Sure, some people will complain about that, but personally that won't be a problem.I ordered this from Amazon on a Friday around 4pm and it was sitting on my doorstep Monday mid-morning.  Holy Cow! That was fast shipping.  Thanks Amazon!Summary:It's $50 more than the cheapest iPad, $250 less than the Xoom, $500~$600 less than the average Win 7 tablet, and ~$100 more than your average Android based tablet.  This is the best deal out there, hands down, no argument. And it comes with a keyboard!A full OS, nothing beats it.  If anyone tries to pump up the iPad or Android tablets saying they are \"better\", don't listen to them.  Like I said, I'm a fan of Apple and Android, but don't kid yourself about the capabilities of them. Let me put it this way.  The iPad needs to be synced with iTunes before it can even run for the first time.  iTunes can only run on a full OS. This tablet can be used to get an iPad running.  The iPad can't help this tablet in any way.A great deal, lots of fun to use, and it does everything I need and more.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Acer Iconia W500: Nice, Cheap Windows Tablet", "Author": "Dane Adam Orion Vick", "ReviewID": "R1200IC8ANFNFX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would prefer to give this 3.5 stars as four is too much and 3 is too little.I will review this with Windows 8 as the default OS installed on this tablet. If you're using Windows 7 on a tablet, then you're doing it wrong.Pros:With Windows 8, this thing boots fast, runs fast and lo and behold, you don't need apps. Because Windows does everything and navigating with IE10 is easy, fast and just removes the need for apps. Every app opens and runs smoothly and the onscreen keyboard is terrificVideo display is terrific and stellar as well as sound.Screen is responsive and multi-touch/zoom works without flawPrice: with a 32GB SSD and 2GB RAM.

Battery is just too weak for typical use.Keyboard is abysmal as well as how it connects. Not sure why a Bluetooth one was not used instead. It's nice to have a mouse pointer but it's performance is sub-standard at best.With Windows 7 as the default OS, I would not even buy this but since Windows 8 came out as a Developer Preview, I went for it.***UPDATE:***Since so many seem inclined to respond to my review, I will expand as I've now had the tablet for about three months. This thing is great ... for some things. It is a Windows tablet, which means it can do everything and performs just like a Windows machine should. I have tried Windows 7 on this and it sucks. Period. If you think Windows 7 is great for a touch screen only tablet, then fine but I am telling you (the potential purchaser of this device and not the persons who already own it) that if you want a tablet that is touch friendly, don't put Windows 7 on it. Windows 7 is a great OS but it is horrible for touch and the boot time's too slow for my taste as well.It is also very heavy. Way too heavy for easy reading and/or video/movie watching. If you plan to watch movies with this, get a case that will allow it to stand up or tilt. Holding it for an extended period of time gets to be a pain.Also, it gets hot when watching HD quality videos; really hot. I compare this to playing the same video on an iPad 2 (iPad 1 can't play the content at all) or Honeycomb/ICE (Transformer Prime) based tablet; both do not get as hot.And, last but not least, an expansion on the keyboard: the keyboard is horrible! The way it attaches is just crap and detaching it is a pain. The keys suck and the mouse is no good either. This isn't to say they don't work in some capacity; sure they can help you point at things and type after getting used to it after about three months, but as far as design goes: no good. The crappy keyboard also lights the way toward the imbecilic placement of the USB ports at the bottom of the tablet. Just stupid design. Most will use this device in lansdcape. Why put USB ports on the bottom?Those are the things I have come across in using this tablet that make it sub-par and not really a prime time player, which, to my benefit, allows it to be a cheap, low-cost tablet. So I am stating that those things are definitely bad but at the same time, they are likely the reason the thing's so cheap: it's cheaply made.And battery life still is no good for me. 3.5 hours max and the power adapter is awful as well. This is from normal use and not watching HD content constantly. I do not believe you should lower the brightness of the device in order to stave off the battery deterioration; you don't have to do this on other tablet devices so why should it be a requirement here? I like a bright screen so I can see everything easily. Sure, I can lower the brightness by 50% and likely get another 45 minutes of battery life but I'd need a better prescription for my eyes after six months.After using it more, I hereby lower my stars to three.Final word, if you're thinking of getting this because you want to tinker with Windows 8 to try it out or you are an IT guy looking to get a feel for Windows 8, then buy this. It will definitely help with that and the kicker is that it does not cost too much. It's worth the investment to get to know Windows 8. That, TO ME, is the only true benefit of this tablet.

I still really liked the W500, but the C-50 processor needs more muscle to handle cpu intensive applications like Silverlight when playing Netflix. It just seems like Silverlight will never take full advantage of the gpu acceleration offered by the C-50.First we have to start with the Good:1) Windows 7 on a tablet is great: I found no issues navigating with the touchscreen, and I get all the programs I am familiar with since this uses a windows OS. The touch keyboard is small but you can't expect a full touch screen keyboard on a 10\" screen.2) Docking station is outstanding: You get two more USB ports with the docking station, a trackpad, mouse buttons, ethernet port(not available on the asus ep121 slate)and a full size keyboard which I found to be very comfortable, quiet, and responsive. Unmounting the screen is very easy, and really is no big deal like some reviews say. I was surprised about how easy it is. Probably takes me 10 seconds at most to take the screen off and mount it to the keyboard before putting it in a bag.3) Exception build Quality: The top finish is very nice, and the gorilla glass and screen really look great. I have found build quality with acer to be top notch. The viewing angles are good...it has a high quality screen overall. I really like the built in accelerometer that auto rotates the picture as you move the tablet from the horizontal to vertical position, and vice versa. This really is a great function when viewing pictures or internet page, ebooks, or documents on the internet.4) Performance: Now when I'm talking about performance, I'm talking about a highly portable and lightweight machine that only consumes 5-6 watts or so forregular usage. To be able to play 1080p HD videos from the hard drive very smoothly on a machine like this is quite a feat, and certainly annhilates any netbook or tablet with an atom processor. Navigating is responsive, loading Windows is quick, and I really think this could be someone's main pc who really just wants to browse the internet, enjoy media, maybe is a student that uses office programs a lot, and is on the go for the most part. Can be used for very light gaming for older and less demanding titles which is nice. But seriously, don't buy this for games. I have used this for cloud gaming and it did quite well. I played metro 2033 on onlive and it was quite good. It supports dx11 which is another plus. Youtube video performance needs work for hd playback, so hopefully ati and adobe can get together and figure it out.5) Very quiet especially when just browsing the internet and doing normal tasks. Battery life is absolutely superb. Most people report 4 to 4 1/2 hours when playing video. When just doing regular tasks like browsing the internet, etc. you'll probably get 5-6 hours. Get yourself an external energizer laptop battery and I'm sure you are looking at 10 hours and up. Asus slate only gets about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.Now for the Bad:1) 32GB SSD isn't much hard drive space, and 2GB ddr3 ram from just what I've read around the net, is not removable and not upgradeable. After the Windows OS and other programs installed, you are only looking at 15-17gb free space. That's not much if you are a media freak. However, get yourself one or two 32GB standard SDHC cards and stick one in the memory slot and the other one in your bag/wallet and you'll survive. Then get yourself the Kingwin Dual 2.5/3.5 inch sata hard drive, and add a couple of 1TB 3.5\" sata hard drives and you'll never have a problem with storage. Also the msata hard drive can be removed, so I imagine it can be upgraded. However accessing it requires the ability to pull the plastic cover off. There is a video on this which can be found here: [...]2) 1080p video performance on youtube isn't smooth and becomes choppy at times when resizing windows and doing other tasks in the background. 720p however is usually smooth, but for some reason, when resizing the window, playback becomes choppy. However, I was able to get 1080p youtube videos to be smooth if I paused before the video loaded, went to fullscreen mode, then selected 1080p, and then played the video. It's really strange. It could be that this has to do with the flash player not necessarily supporting the graphics accelerator on the C-50. Seriously, why does flash player utilize so much CPU? I monitor the cpu usuage and it gets to 90 to 100% at times when playing flash videos on youtube. So for some reason, flash videos are not utilizing the gpu accelerator very well.Now if you are a media freak, don't freak out just yet. 1080p HD videos played from a hard drive is smooth as silk. And there is a program called the youtube downloader that you can get at the cnet downloads section. You can download youtube videos up to 1080p and they will play back smoothly.3) While the AMD C-50 processor really is outstanding hardware, ATI drivers are pretty horrible. Using an external display via HDMI with newer drivers such as Catalyst 11.5 ...I would get no picture on the external screen when connecting via hdmi! Which is a shame. With 11.1 drivers I was able to get my external 32 inch 720p display to work perfectly, but for some reason on the 720p plasma, the picture would not fit on the screen, even though it was set at the correct resolution.And yes, I understand that this is where you would enable GPU scaling in the catalyst control center and you would usually be able to adjust the underscan overscan options. However, I've tried drivers from amd from catalyst 11.1 to 11.5 and there are no underscan/overscan options available. Might just be the luck of the draw because one of my monitors worked perfect with 11.1 drivers as stated, but more likely that ATI needs better drivers.4) The Acer W500 is a litte bit on the heavy side when using as a tablet. I would imagine the ipad is probably much thinner and lighter, and more ideal to walk around with and hold with one hand. With one hand, it's kind of hard to do with the W500 which may be a fatal flaw for some, especially if you plan to hold it up constantly to say, read an ebook. But the thing is, the W500 can do so much more than an ipad.Sumarry:The Acer W500 is the best Windows Tablet on the market. It has a great screen, it is dead silent, performs reasonably well for a tablet especially for media. Now some might argue the Asus Slate is better because you can use a waicom pen to draw, etc. And if you really are going to benefit from a waicom pen to take notes or draw, obviously the asus slate is the one you want. Plus the Asus Slate will provide better performance with the i5 480m processor. So depending on what you are doing, the asus slate might be in your best interests. However, be prepared to have to deal with the mediocre battery life of the slate, light bleeding on the screen, no ethernet port, and a sub-par wireless keyboard solution, and the bloated price tagThe performance of the W500 seems untapped due to driver issues when viewing HD flash videos, and the current driver problems when using an HDMI port, which is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. However, for the most part, you are going to love this machine, as I certainly do.What would I recommend to use with this product?- Kingwin EZ-Dock 2 dual bay external sata 3.5 or 2.5 hard drive bay- WD Caviar Blue / WD500AAKS 500GB 3.5\" sata Hard drives (has 3 year warranty and I can say they work fine with the EZ-Dock 2)- Plugable 10 port powered USB hub which connects you quickly to your usb keyboard, mouse, external hard drive, printer, etc. while only occupying one usb port on the w500.- External Samsung Slim USB DVDRW Drive.

How could there be any doubt it isn't?? $550! :)Windows 7 has a plethora of great touch features. The usual complaints about the on screen keyboard, the web-browsing experience, blah blah blah. Why would windows not rock out in all these aspects?? How about I just sync my bookmarks and passwords from my Google chrome browser at home to my tablet real quick. Ah..done. With a full windows pc there is no compromise. EVER.This thing is more than powerful enough to run anything you throw at it. Have 10 applications open, playing a video, and on and on, I've never seen this thing stutter in the week I've had it. Battery life is great too! All these people saying 6 hours isn't enough. Dude.....when the screen is off or its in standby you are using practically nothing. This thing lasts me 2-3 days sometimes & I bring it everywhere!!I could go on & on & on & on & on. It has everything a windows desktop has. A FULL sized hdmi port, 2 usb, on & on. Why fumble with your printer app on ur ipad? Just add the network printer to your windows 7 tablet in a snap. Map your network drives and stream content from ur other pc with the massive hard drive. That makes 32 gb on board seem plenty big. You can hope that a skype app with video comes out for your tablet platform or just have windows and download Skype. WTF!!!! Easy choice for me.Bottom line is: Its bright, beautiful, well built, the touch screen is as responsive as any of the best on the market, the weight difference of .5 lbs is not even enough to notice a difference between a full pc tablet and other gimmicky phone os tablets.Anywhere I bring this thing people are in awe. \"A whole pc in that?\" \"Where did you get that?\" and so on.I go to best buy to get a case for this thing and I see the salesman demoing the Iconia Android tab, xoom, and others. I bust up his presentation and show the customers the power of windows 7 on a tablet. Needless to say, they didn't buy an android tab that day nor will be getting an ipad2. They will be looking online for the W500 BITCHES!!!!!!!! get this thing......its like WHOA. I just wish they put together a bigger marketing campaign for these new windows 7 tablets (tv spots, radio, mag ads). I mean push this thing dammit! We all know people are getting tired of the basic nature of the \"oversized phone\" tablets. We yearn for more!!!! And this tablet gives it to us :)btw I've tried all other \"serious\" tablet competitors before throwing down on the acer. The ipad2 is nice & light, sure, but its so simplistic its all just gimmicks, and I could never get past the fact that its just a big iphone, which isn't even any good on a phone when its put next to android. All the honeycomb tablets (xoom, iconia, etc) garbage as well. Like using a calculator or something. Way too simplistic for something of that screen size. I just recently played aroudn with a blackberry playbook also. I actually liked the UI a little more than ipad/honeycomb but it was still so simplistic. A great example of windows 7 tab vs. all other tabs....Recently, a week after the playbook came out, they finally released a facebook app and a video chatting app. Hoo-f'in-ray! An app that won't have all the features u want, I'll just open google chrome and go to facebook.com. Seems simple enough right? And the video chatting app, just like Apple facetime, only lets u chat between like devices. So a playbook can only video chat with a playbook. I just open the windows skype application and connect to anyone I want. Simple enough right?This is one of the first of a new generation of devices, a full OS on something so portable changes the game completely. You just watch, apple will be releasing a tablet in the next 1-2 years with their full OS on it. but it'll be too late.

Using it off and on and using sleep after 10 minutes of idle, it went 2 days (45%)before I charged it again.Performs as advertised.Handwriting recognition works better than expected.Full retail windows 7, no Apps needed to use the internet or your fancy emails 8)Like with any new computer, you need to update it fully(update, reboot, repeat till done) and let it sit overnightwith it powered on and running. After that you should start to remove any pre-installedapplications that are not used every day or for the proper function of attachments.Out of the box, no HD video, moving finger in circle on screen took 100% cpu and wouldbe jerky. Wifi could only get 32Mbs(4) max, even on 150Mbs(18.75) connection.After updating , letting sit, then removing all unused programs (especially things that readcontiniously for screen input).  Google to learn how to use power managment to increase power when you needit and to reduce power (battery usage) when you dont need it.Wifi is at 80Mbs(10), my 1920x1080 9.3Mbs bluray rip will now play 8)Moving finger around only takes 20-30% CPU now.  Netflix plays ok on the device, sometimes it is stilla little skippy.All in all, I am pretty happy with the device, there are some things it could improve on,but for the price performace and portability, it is pretty costeffective. I have a dock atwork and home and it has just about replaced my other units, it is handy to have a linkto your data via vpn or other, but to have your whole computer with you is very handy.Mostly it stays on the dock and in sleep mode (2-3seconds boot weee), but when I need to do somethingbut do not want to be tied to my desk, the unit comes right off and I am outside workinglike I was in my office with no window.It really is a netbook, maybe a little faster, better video, with the ability to leave the keyboard on your deskbut in the end, it is a netbook not a quad core 8 gig system.Update:02-2013: Installed Windows 8 32bit Pro Retail with the Media Center addon pack and I love it.Windows 8 seems much faster on this device even with CPU mark at 2.3 . Netflix and HDtv playback from a HDPrimeis now flawless. I had about stopped using the device with windows 7 on it, I have faster thingsto use, but since win8 I have started using it more and more. No pauses or lag.When I installed win8, I only installed the win7 device control and the win8 G sensor driver soI could rotate the screen. Everything else, including bluetooth worked fine and didn't need me to install drivers.The metro interface windows 8 uses works well on this device and is clean and quicker than 7.With that said, I hated the metro interface on my desktop and reverted to clasic style on it.Moving finger in circles only uses 3-8% on Win8 compared to 20-30 as before.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing! plus Win 8", "Author": "ElViejo", "ReviewID": "RF15EY3NB2K7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After three weeks of heavy use I can say that the w500 isn't amazing because it can dance at all:its amazing because it can dance with the stars.  I would give it 4.5 stars if half stars wereallowed, but they aren't, so it gets four stars because its not quite perfect.I will dispose of the complaints up front so I can concentrate on the good stuff.1. Weight:Just over two pounds doesn't sound heavy, but, at 50% more than the weight of most tablets withthis screen size, you won't be one-handing it often.  You'll need a place to rest it.2. Size:In landscape mode, its too wide to allow two-thumb typing.  In portrait mode, its so narrow thatthe keyboard gets a bit small.3. USB Placement:The USB ports are on the \"bottom\" edge of the tablet, in landscape mode.  That makes it hard torest the unit on your lap or on the desk.  You can turn it up-side down, but then you may blockthe air vent.4. No GPS:I don't care, but you might.5. Cameras(?):Today 1.3M cameras seem awful since phones now come with 48M cameras, but these camerasmatch the screen resolution and are adequate for video chat.  NOTE: The cameras are better thantheir software.  I played back video I shot and it was almost useless with dropped frames andaudio distortion.  I saved the file and played it in Media Player, and it was MUCH better.  I thenwent into Movie Maker and shot some video using the webcam capture feature.  That was quitegood.  Use competent software for competent results.The Good Stuff:1. Windows 7 Power:I couldn't get a tv network web site to play last night's programs.  I discovered the W500 hadFlash 10.x software, so I updated to Flash 11.x software and the programs played.  The point is Ican run the programs and web sites I want to and I can update my software when I need to, notwhen the tablet vendor gets around to doing it.  I couldn't run a program because I didn't haveJava:  I downloaded Java and ran the program.  End of story.  I was worried about being able toprint.  No problem: I downloaded the driver from HP and printed(wirelessly too).2. Input Options:You can type on the touch screen or on the dock's keyboard, you can use pen input to record yournotes(Windows Journal), you can use pen input to convert your writing to text and insert the textinto your word processor, or you can use voice dictation to input your notes. By the way, thedock serves as a cover for the tablet when you want to carry the tablet around.3. Input Connections:Two full size USB ports, a full size SD port, and a full size HDMI connector are convenient, andyou save money on funny adaptor cables.  The AC plug on the wall wart is adjustable, so you canposition it to avoid interference with other plugs.4. Entertaining:Windows Media Center is a touch-friendly environment for media viewing.(Download theInternet TV option).  The Windows Touch Pack has some nice games and utilities that make thetouch tab fun.  You can access internet tv and radio, and you can use your Windows 7 desktop asa media server for the W500.  You can run HuluPlus, Amazon Instant Video, and read yourbooks(Kindle, Nook, etc.).6. Mahjong Titans is really fun on the touch tablet.I'll stop here.  There's more to say, but obviously I recommend the W500 highly.UPDATE, WINDOWS 8The review above is for the W500 as it comes from Acer.  The update is for the W500 with Windows 8 Release Preview installed.  My emphasis is on the W500 installation, not on Windows 8.I could not figure out how to get 16 GB free memory available in Windows 7: I had added a lot of stuff since I got the W500, and I had only about 10 GB left on the SSD.  I went ahead and plugged in a DVD player and loaded in Windows 7 fresh from the back-up DVDs.  That took about three and a half hours.  I still needed some memory, so I removed the back-up program, Touch Pack, and Clear.fi.  Installation then took place without a hitch(in about four hours: I have a slow DSL line).  This is without dual boot, vitualization, etc.Touch functions, cameras, screen rotation, HDMI, DLNA, printers, and wireless worked ok, but I had to install the Bluetooth software from the Acer site.  The Catalyst software was listed as incompatible by the Win 8 installer, so I downloaded a Win8 beta version from AMD.  With hints from the web I was able to load a new copy of the Touchpack.  I found a way to download Media Center from Microsoft.  This somewhat works: when I added the Internet TV software, the video will not play properly-audio is ok, but video is almost missing.  I'm working on these items.  I have not checked the LAN.  I am sad to report that Solitaire and MahJong Titans are missing from Windows 8.  Also, Microsoft just dropped Office-Starter-To-Go support, but I can edit Office documents in Skydrive.After about fifteen days, I can say that most other things work pretty well.  Win8 boots up in less  than 30 seconds.  You can scroll across the Start screen at a literally dizzying speed.  The \"active tiles\" are impressive to watch.  My SSD memory after installation was about 7 GB and it fell rather quickly to about 2 GB.  I did some optimization and got back to 5 GB, but memory looks like a battle.  I put in a 32 GB SD card and installed it as an extension to the SSD.  I haven't yet tried installing executable programs on the SD card.  Photos work fine from the SD card.The summary is that Windows 8 look very impressive, but I thought Windows 7 was good on the W500.  I will let you know.December Update:I updated from the Release Preview version to the full release on October 26.Here's a quick update.  I can't get the automatic screen rotation to work, but otherwise I am very happy.  Dumped \"windows.old\" file, and I have about 10 gigs of space.  Have loaded WordPerfect Office onto the 32 GB sd card and it runs fine.  Media Center works ok.  Microsoft has put in all sorts of apps, so MahJong and Solitaire are back and more elaborate than ever.  I can sync to all my mail accounts.  All in all, Windows 8 is a winner on the W500, and the tablet continues to function well.  Very nice user experience.

Another toy is just a bit redundant, no matter how flashy and attractive it may be. Despite this the sales are high, but from my personal experience the uses are still fewer than they should be. The main obstacle that stops it from achieving universal \"need\" is the proprietary limitations. This, gladly, lets other devices step up to the plate to compete.  Leave it to a computer manufacturer, and a reputably cheap one at that, to come up with a viable solution. The Acer Iconia W500 is a brilliant device.  I believe there is a large confusion concerning the nature of this Tablet PC. Reviewers give it a low score when compared with the simplicity and speed of other tablets, and computer enthusiasts look at the low specs and scoff. For the record let me state that this device is not only underrated, but probably the unsung powerhouse of the year.  The Iconia windows tab features the full blown Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit edition at your fingertips. This has negatives, as have been grossly poked at in many other reviews, but let me focus on the positive points. Windows can run nearly anything, browse nearly anything, watch nearly anything, listen to everything, and perform work related tasks like it was supposed to. The processor, the delightfully new AMD C-50 APU (Fusion tech) is one powerful chip. The dual 1 GHz processor had me worried, but the dedicated graphics and overall performance is incredible. Full HD video, 3D games, and many more options present themselves flawlessly. More on that later.  For the major downside, the Windows keyboard input, this device solves the problem with the included dock, a brilliant design choice. While top heavy, the keyboard types fluently and has yet to freeze the device when hooked up in a pinch for me. This is a stable PC. For me the largest flaw is actually the Hard Drive. While for other tablets sporting 32 GB might be laudable, this device cannot operate extensively with such a low limit. I consider myself a gamer and sport some titles that would easily fill up the remaining space (around 17 GB available on first startup) with one mighty swallow. That being said, however, if you can get a game on this computer they usually run very well.  I was utterly shocked when Half-life 2 ran at an acceptable framerate at near highest settings. My jaw dropped farther when Heroes of Might and Magic 5: Tribes of the East ran silky smooth at the highest settings available. I would like to see an Ipad try either games.

I realize this and I have tried to evaluate this unit based on the strength and weaknesses of this Win 7 Tablet, without prejudice to any particular platform.Justification for Purchase:This unit, while heavier than an apple or android counterpart, does offer a wider selection of options for modification and can do a lot due to the full Win7 operating system.I needed a tablet that could be used in my graduate program for reading PDF files, using Microsoft office or open office and for interacting with the online site Desire2Learn, to work on and turn-in assignments.I wanted to access Flash video, Netflix and Hulu Desktop (I like Hulu Plus, I just don't like being dependent on it for functionality, since several shows are not available through it vs the normal site.)I also wanted a system I could use art/media programs on, this tablet can do a fair amount of actual production work, not a powerhouse mind you, but it can run Sketchbook Pro 2011, Photoshop Elements 6.0 and even used movie maker fairly quickly for a low power system.I also like the thought of playing old PC games and even some low spec games in this.Battery life:This is not a great system for battery life.The brochure says 6 for general use / 4 for HD video... the brightness level of the LCD determines a lot of your mileage.Outdoors, I used it on a car trip, and the battery lasted only 2.5 hours, but that was with brightness turned up full blast to compensate for sunlight.Indoors, I get about 4.5 - 5 hours on slightly brighter than default. I have watched a full movie, and still worked on art work for a couple of hours. It really is good for my needs, but I definitely want to stress this is not an all day ally. If traveling I plan to use a power inverter and run it off a car battery, and when inside, I can use the ac adapter when possible.Weight:A bit heavy. I am not a weakling, but I tend to use this supported by my arm when standing, or my leg when sitting. Reading on this is nice though. I have used it to read various assignments from school and it is so much easier than trying to juggle a laptop or sit in one spot for a desktop.Physical Keyboard:It can be useful... but I haven't used it very much. The tablet is top-heavy when connected to the removable keyboard, and only balances on a very flat surface. The tablet has 2 usb ports, and 2 on the keyboard... you can only use 2 at a time however, as the usb ports on the tablet meet the keyboard when docked.Accessories:Good luck finding a folio or case that fits perfectly. I'm still looking for a good folio, but Belkin makes a sleeve [...] that works fairly well. It is a tight fit for the tablet sans keyboard, but the best option I've found so far. The unit can use capacitive stylus pens (like the kinds used on the ipad/ipad2 and android tablets) I bought the one offered by TARGUS [...] and it works perfectly.Strengths:This is a great system for me in regard to functionality. I don't use this as a primary computer, I use it as a nice travel system. Anything I've thrown at it works great. However I'm not using this for new PC games, so I'll have to see what limits exist. I like the built in HDMI port, as it does a great job exporting the computer desktop to my 52 and 42 inch LCD TV sets. I also like the ability to connect to my home network drives and printer and access any files I need. I even installed one of my programs by inserting the DVD Disc into the DVD-Rom of my main Desktop and accessing the drive via wifi. Set-up worked great!FINAL THOUGHTS:I would recommend this unit, I just hope as a potential buyer, you will understand your needs and make a decision based on those needs. If you can stand the drawbacks and utilize the benefits mentioned in this review I wish you a happy purchase! If I can offer any additional advice or answer questions for you I will try. Thanks.UPDATE! 2 Things I wanted to let people know. Fresh from the factory there is a hardware error in the Touch display. The mouse will automatically move to the bottom right corner near the DC-Power In. This is VERY annoying! However ACER has released a firmware update that fixes the error. Just go to the driver section for the W500 on ACER and look under BIOS. Problem Solved.I also recently purchased a 128GB SDXC Card from Lexar. The W500 will read it just fine. The tablet only detects 122GB... but that's normal for hard drives and removable media to boast higher capacity than is accessible. If you create a virtual hard drive on the SD card you can run programs off of the card just like a real hard drive.

What this won't tell you is that this is full windows 7, everything you can do on a desktop can be done here with only the power limitations to consider.I got this mainly because I knew it could play less graphics intensive games. I play Diablo 3, Torchlight, Puzzle quest, WoW, things like that on here and they run relatively smoothly. Some take a bit to load but after that they run great. I don't like the android and ipad games.I also got this because it has an RJ45 jack, so I'm not limited to wireless. Also the keyboard attachment is decent. It gets the job done. It has plenty of USB ports for external hard drive and mouse, so I have absolutely no complaints with the keyboard dock. I'm amazed it even has that ability.Windows 7 runs great with a touchscreen although not optimized for it. With 1200x800 resolution it's sometimes hard to hit the tiny icons but Acer did well with the touch response.The hard drive space is limited, but has an SD card slot and usb ports for external, so not a huge concern for me. When I go home I change what I want... I'm never out of my house long enough to worry about having limited space. This shares almost instantly over wireless between my home computer so I can transfer files in a decent amount of time.I removed everything I don't use, which was practically everything it came with besides windows, updated all of the drivers on ACER's website, and everything runs well. One complaint is stuttering streaming video with youtube and netflix, but I don't use those often enough to let that bother me. It happens over wireless and I assume it's a driver bitrate issue, because silverlight and flash are terrible for streaming video on tablets. Amazon's streaming service works very well though :) Interestingly on ethernet, streaming video works perfectly. I don't understand that.Nitpicking I can say the usb port on the bottom is annoying... but why am I going to hook up USB while I'm holding a tablet? I'll connect it to the dock before I do that. But it would have been nice to have the USB port on the side when I do connect it to the dock just for the extra port if I ever need it... but not like I'm looking to plug all kinds of things into a tablet. The more I carry the less portable this becomes.Overall I'm pleased with the full windows and ability to play games, 5 hours of battery life is to be expected with this kind of hardware. I can edit my excel files and powerpoints for work, send e-mail, print documents, run my work applications... it's perfect for that on the fly last minute changes. I no longer have to worry about stupid Ipad and Android apps being compatible or viewing issues.

I don't use the dock anymore for any reason.Do not uninstall \"Device Control\". Every time I open my tablet, I need to open Device Control to enable Bluetooth before my keyboard works, especially since I am not using the dock which can also turn Bluetooth on.I find Internet explorer browser painfully slow on the tablet (and the latest version is installed). But the Google Chrome browser is a dream. The sound on this gadget is much better than my now disposed of, much heavier Dell laptop..I can actually watch Youtube.com videos without speakers, the first time in years.I don't have problems with Netflix streaming at all - I just run Netflix in the Google Chrome browser.  I didn't do any tweaks I am aware of, just uninstalled some of the Acer Ring components (except Device Control, as mentioned earlier it is needed to turn on Bluetooth capability every single time I turn on my tablet from the shut down mode- wifi is always on, though).Previously I used to change my laptop quickly because the keyboards become so very dirty. Now it is great to have bought a separate bluetooth keyboard that is more disposable than my computing device.I use a leather case with stand (Tuff Luv) and keep the tablet in there all the time except when I clean the case and the tablet, every few days. The tablet has a nice Skinomi sticker covering its full body. I removed the factory installed skin protector which made it look dirty with all the bubbles, and haven't put on any other screen protector.It is really fast but avoid using Internet Explorer.Handwriting recognition is very good. I imagine I could write handwritten notes with this device too, handwriting renders beautifully even using the eraser end of my Roocase stylus..I imagine a tipped stylus would be even more authentic.Before I got my Bluetooth keyboard, I spent some days using the virtual keyboard. I still use it to sign in with my password. I guess it is something that is very usable, but for me my tablet didn't feel like a productivity tool till I got the Bluetooth keyboard. I mean I can type very fast using the virtual keyboard, but it just did not feel psychologically right using that for more professional work.It is great to have a device that so easily switches from professional to entertainment, or vice versa. I love the back and front cameras - my much heavier now disposed of laptop did not have a rear camera.Sticking something in the USB port at the bottom makes the tablet jut out just a little less than aesthetically from the leather case that I purchased, but for short term usage (like plugging in a USB CD ROM drive to install a program) it should work just fine. Alternatively, rotate the tablet so the USB port is on the top. Windows auto rotation isn't the fastest, but that isn't the primary reason I got this device.Oh, and the full HDMI port is awesome. I haven't tested it yet, but it is awesome to not look for special adapters/cables like for all these other, especially non-Windows tablets out there.I love this purchase! And I got an extended accident protection warranty from SquareTrade, from Amazon.This device suited me because I just did not want to leave Windows for Ipad/Android..I can't predict all my needs or whether the newer OS's would always have the apps I need..nor do I want to invest the time finding out an app to use for every single task..Windows is entrenched and a quick Google search always reveals the programs I may need for any reason.At some time in the future, I may buy an SD card. But since so much of my work is Cloud-based, I store almost everything on the server. I can use the programs I need to, then upload the file and delete it.So now I have an all in one main computing device that I can use for any present or unanticipated future needs.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get yourself a w500 and move into the future.", "Author": "T.

The w500 can handle things an iPad and Andriod tablets can't because it has a full operating system.  Unfortunately, my biggest issue is the processor is under-powered and I wouldn't buy this device again.  I still find this device impressive since it connects to all of my existing devices printers, external hard drives, etc.I realize under-powered is relative since it depends on what you will use the system for.  I work extensively with Word documents that are several mb in size, they run very slow on the w500.  Note, I have tested Office 2010 and 2013.Also, the Solid State drive size is limited & you will quickly fill it to capacity & then try to figure out what you can do without or what you can put on a thumbdrive, etc.  If you put Windows 8 on it, you will notice a dramatic performance increase.Yes, I think this is useful for less resource intensive applications and does fine surfing the web.Note...I now only use this tablet as a back up since I have purchased a Samsung Slate 7 which is quite the impressive slate.------------------ I have modified my original review ----------My main needs for getting a new device were - High productivity & portability1) High productivity meant to me ability to run MS Office 2010, graphics editting, & other other windows applications2) Portability meant long battery life, small, lightweight, & ability to use without a keyboard.3) I also required that there be at least one USB portUnder-powered processor, small disk space, & low RAM causes performance problems with the above high productivity needs.I was carefully looking at getting an iPad, but it wouldn't fulfill my needs.* Battery Life: I believe I've gotten 6+ hours* Price: very reasonable, especially considering what you are getting* Touchscreen is very responsive & it supports at least 5 finger input <-- Unfortunately, there is no stylus that is great with this device, it's mostly for touch* Performance: -- There has been some speed sacrifice when switching from my old laptop that has 4gb RAM & much faster processor, but... -- It's not that big of a sacrifice - I don't use a lot of video files, so I can't give a lot review information on that topic, but I've watched possibly some Youtube with no problem. -- The sacrifice mostly comes when you are running multiple applications that are resource hungry**Major resource hogs have been, MS Access, Word, OneNote, paint.net (Graphic design)!-- Let Me Express & Stress that generally it runs very smoothly for lower proessor --!* When at home: -- Many, many times I've hooked up my large monitor (HDMI), a USB hub (Which has a wireless keyboard, CD burner, wireless mouse, & a thumb drive... --  Results? - You wouldn't even know you are using a tablet, it would appear as if you are using a regular PC.* Video/Graphics: --  Splendid from many angles --  Screen is bright/vibrant (Even for graphic design)* One of the main reasons I purchased this is because I wanted to use Office 2010 on it - And - It works(I know I mentioned a performance sacrifice, but not a large one)* The Feel of it: --  Very light weight (Even when the keyboard is plugged in) - Not too light where it feels like it will float out of my hand! --  Sturdy feel to it, doesn't feel like it's going to easily break.

As an ipad 2 owner, i was interested in what the w500 could do, so when it came in, I removed some garbage software,tweaked it to my liking, and went at it.I was very happy to see how responsive everything was. The onscreen keyboard is nice and responsive. Touch input was surprisingly accurate and easy to use. Being able to install Steam for some games, and teamspeak to keep in touch with my game pals was a joy. After bout 3 hours of playing, I let the lady take it and off I went into the other room with my ipad2. No more then 10 minutes later I found myself frustrated that some flash site I had been on was not supported. This prompted me to ask myself... \"why am i putting up with this crap\". I ordered an iconia w500 the same nite!This is not to say that the Ipad2 is garbage. It is a beautiful device. Thin, lightweight, a pleasure to carry, and the IOS is simply a pleasure to use.The apps are amazing. Everything from games, books, to remote desktop software. (of which i used a lot to get to flash sites and java enabled sites, however annoying to have to do this and deal with the lag of RDP connections.)However, with the Iconia you now have windows 7 in the palm of your hands! Everything you are used to is available and compatible! Going to java web enabled websites! Flash pages! No more \"This isnt supported\" nonsense! Having full Microsoft office 2010! The detachable keyboard is great, and being able to easily hook up my logitech m305 mouse makes the experience even more delightful.The fact of the matter is that no tablet today is perfect. Apple cripples their devices with their stubbornness to control the computing industry. (which they seem to be doing quite well...). Other tablets like the blackberry playbook look like a joke, and android tablets are basically in the same operational boat as Apple, (with the exception of flash, however java web is still lacking and who knows what other web standards I missed in iOS and Android devices!)The Iconia as well has some flaws when compared to the norm setting iPad2. In tablet form it is seemingly twice as heavy. Even more so when you attach the keyboard essentially turning it into a netbook. The screen itself is plastic as opposed to the very nice aluminum used by Apple, and some features that it tries to mimic, such as the screen rotation, function quite poorly, mainly due because Windows 7 was simply not made for a tablet interface to begin with.In the end, I am a heavy windows users. I don't like to be hindered in any way when it comes to basic usage, and sadly, the ipad 2 does that too much to me, forcing me to apps that get me around issues in a half baked fashion. I will happily use a physically less attractive device with no limitations (basic usage). If you do not have the same attachment to windows as me, I say, get an iPad 2. Otherwise, you will be more then happy to go Iconia W500.As a side note, I should note that the C-50 AMD Fusion processor is lacking in terms of a windows CPU. The Apple A5 is probably faster however they cant really be compared, (A5 uses ARM instruction set, different from windows CPU's)The GPU on the die is definitely nice, but is certainly bottle necked by the CPU as you may discover if you try to run an application/game that is too intensive. For a tablet as intended however?

Really insane.I also love how BRIGHT the screen gets. The brightest I've seen on anything, even a smartphone. Battery is exceptional for me at roughly 5 hours continuous use on balanced setting and half brightness.I'd also like to comment on the enormous sound this puts out through the headphone port. My highly custom built desktop doesn't even push the sound out as loud through the headphones. The speakers are actually very good. They don't crack and pop when things get loud. It just simply plays it without a hiccup. They are placed on the bottom, so if you've got it on your lap or something, it can get muffled.Also this tablet handles Android x86 and Linux with no problem. I've played around with all these including Windows 8 and have even wiped my SSD and now it's back to Windows 7 Ultimate.Most say Windows 7 isn't the best for this tablet but that's all user preference and with some getting used to, it's really not as bad as people say. Maybe do some calibration to get things more spot on. I personally hated Windows 8 even with how \"touch friendly\" it's supposed to be, just couldn't be my main operating system.The full USB ports and the HDMI really makes this stand out among the others. You either need a special adapter, or it simply doesn't have it. I've used the USB many many times and it's a real saver.

Suspend works flawlessly and instantly.  It's basically like having an iPad or Android tablet that you could actually do more work on!

I went ahead and loaded the full Office Suite.I added the Windows desktop gadgets that I like, removed the bloatware with Revo Uninstaller and now this feels like a full fledged tablet.  The touch screen is excellent; Acer has a firmware update for it.I ordered a mini Bluetooth keyboard with a touchpad that can fit in my pocket (although I really don't need it, the keyboard on the tablet works fine), an optical drive to burn and watch cd/dvds, and Bluetooth headphones.  I also ordered a 32 GB SD card for extra memory.  Folio cases are not abundant but they do sell them specifically for this tablet on eBay.I am very happy with the W500 because it does not seem like a toy.  I can actually use this tablet for productivity as well as entertainment.I forgot to add that bluetooth tethering is a breeze, no need for me to pay for a tablet with another data plan.

I have dropped it on tile from standing (I don't recommmend you try this), and it survived (with a few dents on the edge). I installed MS Office 10 Professional. All applications worked great. I've used this to output streaming movies and TV via the HDMI port to a projector, also great results. I downloaded Kindle App for PC (along with some other book reader software) and also used it to read books.Using it as a netbook is a little clunky, because of the design of the keyboard port, but not bad for using while on the go. I owned a different usb keyboard, so at home I placed the tablet on a picture frame stand and use my full size usb keyboard and mouse, instant PC!I recently wiped the tablet clean and installed Windows 8 Consumer Preview. OMG! I am so excited! It is just what I wanted. A tablet that works like a tablet (full screen apps), but still is a PC (mulitple users, multitasking, desktop inteface option). The touch interface for Windows 8 is incredible. The onscreen keyboard rocks, so responsive and just the right size! Also Windows 8 uses less space than Windows 7 plus all the Toshiba software. So, all the things I felt were missing (as a tablet), or see people complaining about input, storage space, no real apps ... Windows 8 brought to the party!I loved this little tablet before (out of the box it works great as a mini touch screen pc/netbook), but since its Windows 8 facelift.

Very firm and professional packaging.I believe it is a great deal. This is going for $500 with the keyboard.I've used Asus Eee PCs with Intel Atom CPUs. Eee PCs and most netbooks run on windows XP. This Acer Iconia tab W500 runs on windows 7 and is not as slow compared to those Intel Atom netbooks.It is also very responsive. The touch screen is great.It is a plastic finish, but feels very sturdy. No complaints here. When i bought this I was looking for a affordable tablet running windows 7, I did not expect metal parts just to look and feel kooler.It's a 1GHz CPU they say. However, I believe it runs ridiculously smoother then most Intel Atom notebooks because it is a hybrid CPU/GPU processor with 256mb ram. People don't understand the difference in CPU models brings a lot of performance difference. There is a reason why Intel labels their Atom CPUs \"Atom\". They are very small, use very little energy, create less heat, and R slow. An Intel i5 or i3 CPU at 1.3GHz will out perform a Intel Atom CPU at 1.6GHz any day.The AMD CPU in this Acer iconia w500 tablet just seems to be well designed for this setup.5 Stars because I'm lovin' it and it's $500 from Amazon with free shipping. This machine is Ideal and not slow at all for the price. If your looking for intense gaming and high performance your looking at the wrong place. You should be buying a desktop.Believe me I have been shopping around for a Windows7 tablet/slate for quite a while. Asus has a 12\" windows7 tablet/slate running a i5 CPU at 1.33GHz, however it runs for over $1000. I'd rather buy a laptop with $1000.A note: people keep saying windows7 tablets are slow and the accelerometer switch from horizontal to vertical is slow because, due to the weak CPUs they have.

In fact, I am writing this review on the computer. I really like it. Some of the video reviews I looked at did not give it much of a good shake. However there were many good comments on this site, so I went for it.I think that some try to compare this Windows based tab with the ipad. I don't think they are comparable. I bought this computer because of the productivity of Windows. Android just didn't do it. Also, I play poker on-line. Apple does not support flash and on-line poker software does not work on Android, as far as I know. The one thing that is missing is 3G or 4G connection. However, and I am no computer geek, I believe I can accomplish that another way.The power of the computer seems adequate for me. Internet surfing is very fast. I hear that storage is lacking but this isn't my main computer anyhow. I plan on using my desktop for file storage. Also, for a small keyboard this one works very well, IMO.One thing that is a bit of a nuisance is that \"Point-and-click\" on screen with my finger requires precision and so isn't the best. Also, I am accustomed to using a finger pad so I have to get used to using the screen and the little \"eraser\" thing to move the pointer. But actually the \"eraser\" works fairly well. Another thing mentioned in other reviews is that while docked in the keyboard it is a bit top-heavy. That is true, but again, it is a matter of perspective. When I need the keyboard I am likely to be sitting where there is a flat surface, and it works great there. Also, I did use it while sitting on the couch and it wasn't that bad. I would rather not use a keyboard on the couch anyhow. And, the screen keypad works well. One other drawback is the relatively short battery life. I have fully charged and used the battery twice, and it seems to get about 5 hours of use on one charge.Put in perspective, this isn't an ipad nor is it my main computer, I like it. I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because of less than desirable screen/finger selection and because I would like to have better battery life. Those drawbacks are fairly minor, at least for me, so I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this computer to others.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R7X1ZEY6T107", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a mini notebook with touch functions.

Thankfully, I remembered reading a review claiming the system improved dramatically after updating and that is exactly what happened in my case.Over several days of lengthy updates, I watched the Acer evolve into a very responsive and easy to use tablet PC.When I initially began to use the W500, I was distracted by scratches on the screen.  I saw conflicting reports as to whether the units were shipped with screen protector overlays and for the life of me could not find any evidence that an overlay was installed.  Others have noted the Windows Logo is attached to the overlay making it appear as if the tablets are shipped without any protective covering.I had decided to return the unit because of the scratches and after the screen developed horizontal black lines in most displays. The black flashes disappeared after another series of updates and with focused pecking at the corner of the screen I was able to remove the protective sheet along with the embedded scratches. The screen is now scratch free, bright and crystal clear. The ACER W500 is a keeper!After replacing the installed sluggish and resource hogging antivirus software with Microsoft Security Essentials  and updating and updating and updating ... the system works remarkably well.  In fact, I am writing this entire little review using the free Microsoft speech recognition software and a wireless Logitech headset connected to the built in USB Port (try that on an iPad or Android tablet).I've installed the Chrome browser, Evernote, Firefox, Freeze Framer heart rate monitoring software with companion USB PPG interface, MindByte Revitalizer II audio files and my much loved Mixcraft 3 audio editing software.  The Acer has been transformed into an ultraportable stress management tool and podcast recording studio.I disagree with those who claim that the external keyboard is impossible to use while holding the unit in your lap. True, it is a bit top heavy but sits comfortably in my lap and, as a previous ThinkPad owner, the joystick mouse control and buttons are familiar and easy to use.  I do miss the ability to simply tap on the top of the \"eraser head\" to emulate a left click.A disturbing discovery was that it is impossible to use either my Creative Labs USB audio interface or the wireless Logitech headset when connected to the keyboard USB ports.  Both audio interfaces worked perfectly when connected to either USB ports on the bottom of the tablet. For some reason once the tablet is connected to the keyboard the USB ports located on either side of the keyboard do not allow external audio devices to be used without distorting the audio input.  Strangely, the audio output is excellent.Several people have reported issues in playing Netflix or high resolution YouTube videos without annoying breaks in the video stream. I experienced less than perfect streaming of Netflix videos when using any of the installed browsers but find they play beautifully when using Windows Media Center software. HD YouTube vids play without issue when power management is set to high performance.I've mentioned in several comments, Microsoft has done what I believe is a disservice to customers and shareholders by not promoting two outstanding advantages it brings to the tablet arena. One of course is the excellent speech to text software bundled with all Windows 7 installations. The second is the often forgotten, touch friendly, Media Center software which not only allows access to services such as Netflix but is an excellent platform for managing on board and off board media (Media Center automatically connected via Wi-Fi to my HP Media Smart Server.)  Windows media center also allows access to a growing library of \"Internet television\" options and HD video podcasts.I have spent several days with a first generation iPad and many months with an android based Pandigital e-book/tablet and believe the Acer W500 offers an exceptional tablet experience. The W500 discredits the naysayers claiming Windows is unsuitable for tablet platforms.  Without a full Windows OS it would have been impossible for me to have installed applications and USB hardware I depend on and for which there are no \"App versions.\" There is simply no iPad/ Android replacement  for MixCraft 3 or Freeze Framer. And no ... Garage Band is not a suitable replacement for MixCraft.I believe I am consistently getting close to 6 hours of use with the balanced power plan and brightness setting of 44%.  This is acceptable but I would much prefer something closer to 8 hours.  This is the only real weakness  for me but  not a showstopper.Update:I was hesitant to add my Zune Market Place account and software to the Acer because it downloads a tuck load of unwanted tunes on my other two machines. A fellow blogger suggested I turn off the Zune DJ option to keep Mr Softy from filling my flash drive with \"recommended songs.\" I followed his advice and now seamlessly access my Zune music library using the Acer. The speakers are good enough to skip using my portable Logitech speakers. Unfortunately, the Zune software will not let me assign the Flash E drive as storage for downloaded subscription songs. I can copy them to my flash and play with Windows Media Player but tis an unfortunate work around. Spent too long last night while in bed discovering new music. Used a BestBuy bluetooth earphones to keep from disturbing my wife.Enhancement:I never understood why Microsoft dropped the 3D View of open applications from the default install of Windows 7. It is a slick, natural way to navigate applications using touch. I found instructions to accessing the feature via a task bar shortcut on the Windows Seven Forum site. This is the link:[...]Not only is it intuitive, it looks cool.Ah see Amazon killed the link. No worries ... just do a search for: Windows 7 - Switch Between Windows - Flip 3D Shortcut That should take you to the SevenForums tutorial page. It really adds a very nice \"touch\" to navigating amongst the many \"apps\" you can have running at one time (i.e., task multi-tasking iPad users.) I have been experimenting with different font size settings ... increasing all the way to a DPI of 150%. At that setting the keyboard was larger and easier to use. When I returned to the 125 DPI it felt too small. And then I noticed the familiar sizing mark at the bottom right corner of the keyboard. A simple drag down and to the right and I have a larger and much easier to use keyboard.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great as netbook or tablet", "Author": "Thomas C.

I bought this to test the Windows 8 Developer's Preview. It's less than 1/2 the price of the machine Microsoft handed out at their Build conference but is quite competent running Windows 8. There are a number of YouTube videos of this and Microsoft is using an Iconia W500 as a test unit in their labs (and other machines as well).For the price, the unit is well equipped. I did see an Asus last night at Best Buy in a similar layout that I might have considered had I known it was out; however, I have no regrets. If nothing else, the Acer looks better.My unit arrived with a slight cosmetic problem. The Pause/Break key sits at an angle. But it works so it's not worth returning or really worrying about. The detachable keyboard works well enough. My only complaint is I use the arrow keys a lot and they aren't placed in the greatest position but you'll have to take you hands off the keyboard for them even on a full-size keyboard so not a big deal. There's an eraser-head style mouse in the middle of the keyboard. I tend to like these and it works very well on the Acer and is easy to control.I like the fact it comes with 2 gigs of RAM versus 1 gig in a typical netbook. Performance running applications is generally snappy. I have found doing disk intensive work (e.g., setting up disk compression) is slow; however, that hasn't affected day to day usability.It comes with Windows 7 Home Premium installed. Once I upgraded to Explorer 9 the Internet smoked on the Iconia. Using Windows 7 on it with the keyboard is just like using one of the better netbooks. As a tablet, using Windows 7 is a matter of personal taste. I don't think it's nearly as bad as lots of people make out. Sure, the buttons are tiny but I hate to be the messenger but cruising the web on any tablet is a mixed experience because so many web sites aren't finger friendly.The Iconia runs Windows 8 very smoothly. There are a couple of caveats like you can't open programs side-by-side but that's due to Microsoft restrictions on screen resolution. The Iconia ships with Windows 7 on disk so I can roll back to Windows 7 at any point. However, I'd need to buy a $30 or so USB DVD drive to use it per their web site's recovery instructions.CNet's review made a huge deal over attaching the screen to the keyboard and closing the screen with the keyboard. Closing the unit it up for carrying is trivial. I don't know what the reviewer's problem is. I do have a complaint that Acer is using a cheap plastic hook to lock the keyboard to the screen. A metal once couldn't have cost them but a few pennies more. Attaching the screen to the keyboard to use the unit takes a little bit of effort but there are guide posts so you line it up right. The effort is similar to plugging in any USB device into a socket. Detaching it is similar but requires a bit more effort.If you want a flexible unit capable of being a netbook or tablet and likely being future proofed to run Windows 8 this is viable choice. By netbook standards it isn't cheap but I consider the Iconia to be a bargain.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is what it is...", "Author": "Ezra Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1F1ICMPI8HF1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll get right to the point... Let's be honest... is this unit as polished as an iPad?  Nope.But who cares?  This is a full version of Windows 7 in a true tablet form factor.  And if Windows on a tablet is what you want, this baby is an absolute gem!  Considering what you get (C-50 dual-core, Radeon HD 6250, 2 GB ram) as well as the overall quality of construction, and the included keyboard dock, I think $500 is fair....To put it into perspective:  I have a friend who received one of those free Samsung Series 7 Slates that Microsoft gave out at the recent Windows 8 developers conf.  His unit has an i5 processor with 4 GB ram and a 64 gb SSD (compared to 32 gb in our little Acer friend here) It's twice the machine the W500 is... BUT IT'S MORE THAN TWICE THE PRICE!  Besides, if I wanted a blazing juice-draining system, why in the world would I buy a tablet?  The fact is this Iconia provides the same utility the Samsung tablet does at half the price (and I would guess a little more than half the speed).  Done...next...And sure, Windows 7 was not designed from the ground up for a touch experience, but what do you want?  It's still a beast of an OS, and IMHO Microsoft did a good enough job of making it touch friendly.  When doing tasks like navigating through the puter in general, using programs, and surfing the net the W500 is responsive enough (but don't expect i7 core speed here...) Plus, I have to guess that half of the people that complain about the touch experience of Windows 7 never actually take the time to be creative and customize the OS for their fingers (increasing icons/font size, installing the Chrome touch extension when surfing with Google Chrome - [which is a must btw] organizing their desktops with useful icons/links, etc., etc.)As for the quality of Acer's construction, it's quite solid.  Although I wouldn't want to drop this thing, but then again I wouldn't want to drop an iPad either....  As for weight.. well, heh... this unit will help you develop some wrist strength that's for sure, but its not as heavy as a gold bar either... (the tablet itself is 2 1/2 pounds)I must admit the included keyboard dock is pretty sweet (if you plan on using this thing like a netbook).  And that reminds me: another way to sum up the W500 is that it doubles as the world's slickest netbook, even if it doesn't go down as the best tablet that was ever manufactured...The screen is beautiful (but the large bezel hurts your impression of the size of the screen itself), the battery lasts as long as advertised, etc.etc.etc....listen I hope you all get the point..No, this unit is not the \"light saber\" of today's tablets, but its not exactly \"Thor's hammer\" either.  If you're half-way intelligent and know what you need/want/are looking for, then you'll know whether the W500 is for you.  I personally feel this unit is a fair trade for your money... and remember, it runs a full fledged version of Windows!  Not some cheesy-pretty mobile OS that only does half of what you wish it could...  bottom line:  if want an iPad, then get an iPad... if you want an android, then you deserve what you get (ha)... if you want windows 7 in the same sleek form factor as those already mentioned, then get this little jobber.  gn.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Month with the W500 (lengthy, moderately technical)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJ2SZG7WO6SH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had some emotional highs and lows with this device.  I bought it May 19th and received it after the 23rd.  I did my happy dance because I've been following and purchasing ultra mobile PC's and was excited to dip into the tablet selection. First accessories are a 32Gb Class 10 SD Card, an HTPC remote with keyboard and mouse from Lenovo, and a cheap capacitive screen friendly stylus.  Pleased with all.During customization I found myself regretting my purchase and wanting the new shiny's running android 3.0 and Tegra 2 but now that it's running the way I want it I couldn't be happier with my device.  I now get 5-6 hours of battery (after the BIOS update) while surfing the web and playing music.First thing I did was start going through and removing the bloat like MS office trial and anti Virus.  Loaded Open Office instead.  Works fine and uses less disk space.  Panda AV (free) runs from the cloud and saves on the storage space.  Started playing with the ACER software and seeing what was interesting.  ACER Games were interesting but the variety wasn't to my liking.  I like the ACER ring because it's pretty and can be functional but ended up only using it for the device controller so I removed all things Acer from the slate except for the battery manager and camera optimizer.  Try 'Circle Dock' for an ACER Ring alternative.Loaded Firefox and searched for touch compatibility add-ons but only found one.  Works great for web navigation but was hoping for more touch friendly menu and tab/window close buttons.  I recommend X-Marks for bookmark/tab/password/history sync across devices.  Chrome also looks pretty slick on the slate.  I tried loading the Chrome OS builds from Hexxeh, but it's not compatible with the hardware yet.  I'm also eager to try BlueStack to see how Android runs as a virtualization like on the ViewTab 10.Loaded Steam from steampowered.com because of their wealth of mini-games.  The desktop service allows me to remove and download any game that I own at any time and keeps all my game data organized.  Many of the mini/indie selections run well and seem to cooperate with touchscreen.  Especially adventure and strategy games like Machinarium and Battle Slots.  Found the freeware of Desktop Dungeons and play that almost every day.  Get all of my music anywhere using Google Music Beta.  Hulu Desktop app works well with streaming video in standard (Non-HD) resolutions but the touch controls are tricky, seems to be designed for HTPC with multimedia remote.  Works best with any sort of keyboard.  Netflix also runs great in standard def.  Using Rosetta Stone to try and learn Gaelic for an Ireland trip.  Thank God for fresh Guinness!It's great to be able to use it in the office also.  Loaded some programming software for different servers and I like being able to set it up in the limited workspace and remote in to do my work.  Use it off and on all day and rarely come home with a dead battery.  Network port in the dock comes in handy and the slate powers up from standby in seconds.That's most of what I've done with my ACER IconiaTab W500, now for theCONS:An apparent infrequent Engineering flaw in my device happens when the frame is gently twisted.  I say gently because holding it lengthwise, at an angle, in one hand can cause the magnets on either side to activate the touchscreen on the lower left Start button or the bottom right show desktop button.  I don't mean it does it once.  It causes the touchscreen to rapidly press that corner until it the frame is gently twisted back or, failing that, the system is put to sleep and woken up and sometimes not even then.

The Iconia W500 has met all my needs above, especially my most important one, which is eBook reading and note taking. Incidentally, for that purpose, I have installed Kindle for PC for Amazon eBooks and Bluebeam Revu for reading and commenting on PDFs.  They work very well for me. (Bluebeam Revu is tailored to tablet users more than Adobe Acrobat is. And it registers handwriting so much better, since they have designed (or at least claim to have designed) their software to be pressure sensitive to touch.) Besides, a 10 inch tablet is just about right as a reader and a note taker. 12 inch would be a bit big (and heavy) to hold.  And 5-6 hours of battery life for eBook reading and note taking is acceptable.  It is important to know exactly what you are looking for before giving your take on a product.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be a fair-minded review. If (3) is your most important objective, i. e., if you want to take something on the road to entertain yourself, you are probably better off with an iPad or an Android tablet. Or if you expect the W500 to be a high-performance laptop that can do all sorts of multitasking, i. e., (2) above, then you should pass it up as well.  While there are certainly some things that Acer could have done better with the W500 such as the awkward keyboard dock design and a drive with stingy disk space--an 8-hour battery would be a plus, overall if you have the kind of priorities as I have, the Iconia should fit your bill (for just around $500).

This tablet contains a high-def audio system, so you can set it to 24-bit, 192kHz and enjoy all your studio-quality music with your headphones.  I have this tablet paired with a Headroom Airhead portable amp and my Sennheiser HD 650 headphones (I didn't spring for an 800 model yet) and the setup is great for when you're mobile!

Aside from this tablet, my only option for high-def audio would be a Sony M10 digital recorder, which has a memory card slot and uses AA (or was it AAA) rechargeable batteries, but all my music would have to be converted to WAV for use on the player.

I eventually settled for the Windows tablet due to lack of features on the Android. My goal was to have a tablet that can replace most of my desktop usages, which includes; internet, email, video, music, light gaming, ebook and Microsoft Office. Overall, I would say this tablet can perform all those tasks with ease, only suffering slightly from its limited CPU power. However, if you tune your system right its actually fast and responsive.I would recommend this tablet for advance Windows users who are willing to spend times setting up and customizing it first. I can not recommend this tablet for average users who want to use it right away and have an easy touch experience, it's not due to the tablet itself, but because Windows 7 is not designed for touchscreen.AESTHETIC AND BUILD:-This screen is covered with Corning Gorilla glass to provide better durability. I can still push very hard on the screen and see the liquid crystal distort underneath. Still, its much more durable than plastic.-The device can get quite warm in the back, which is plastic. The hot area are in the middle and near the air vent, its cooler on the edges so you can hold the tablet comfortably. The fan does not bother me because it blow out warm air (and sometimes hot) away on the top and is quiet enough, but I can't consider it as very quiet.-Two USB ports are useful, they are close together barely enough that you can use the \"Y\" USB cables which are needed to provide extra power for some portable DVD-Rom and hard drives.-Yes this tablet weight two pounds (maybe more). A good solution would to buy a leather case that allow the device to stand up on a surface.-I managed about 3-4 hours of battery life depending on uses.USABILITY:-First off, you can use all your Windows desktop programs which should be a primary reason for getting a Windows tablet.-The touch sensitivity is very good, objects are small with Windows 7 interface so you will require a bit of marksmanship. You need to spend time customizing and tuning the OS:-Raising the DPI to 120dpi or even 144dpi to make fonts and buttons larger. (Go to Personalize -> Display.)-Disabling unused services and uninstalling junk programs, otherwise preloaded apps running in background can use up the CPU processes and RAM. (Search the net on 'acer w500 tweaks').-Acer's Device Control is useful for things like setting screen brightness, turning off wifi and changing volume. The interface isn't very responsive. I prefer using 'Windows Mobility Center' which provide similar controls, but uses less memory, I pinned it on the taskbar for easy access.-Spend a bit of time tweaking you inputs. Such as reducing the time it takes to 'tap and hold' to trigger a right click. You'll be amazed as how much right clicking you'll be doing. (Go to Control Panel -> Pen and Touch -> see 'Touch' tab)-I don't use the keyboard dock too much since it doesn't have a touchpad, but instead a \"track point\" (some people like it though).DISPLAY AND SOUND:-I'm impressed by the display and sound. This device has an IPS display (better viewing angle and colors), which isn't the best I've seen, but much better than regular TN displays. It's very sharp, texts looks great, colors are nice and it goes bright. As long as your eyes are further than a foot from the screen you won't notice the 'pixel grains'. The viewing angle is okay, but still limited.-The speakers can go relatively loud, but its on the back and is mono. The sound gets sharp on highest volumes and needs EQing to sound comfortable.-I'm also impressed with the headphone output of this device. The sound is overall crisp and the output power is strong. It can power headphones with high \"impedance\" and probably do a fine job powering portable speakers.HD VIDEOS PLAYBACK:-The device will be able to play 720p and 1080p h.264 MP4 videos smoothly. To be able to play hidef MKV videos smoothly, you must enable hardware acceleration (DXVA) feature for your video players.-It can play YouTube 720p Flash videos smoothly. 1080p gets frame drops and choppy in windows mode, but very smooth when switched to fullscreen mode.CONCLUSION: For the price, the Acer W500 offers a nice display and acceptable sound. After some patience customizing the OS and figuring out how to play HD videos with hardware acceleration, I'm very happy with the purchase. Two main areas I find lacking are the battery life and not having built in mouse buttons and sensor (similar to the MSI Windpad 110W) which would make it easier to use a desktop OS on a tablet. However, upcoming Windows 8 might provide much more usable interface.LINUX: I gave Kubuntu 11.04 a quick try and it seems to work great, wifi works automatically. I definitely would like to use linux on this tablet, it would take up less space for one. Too bad, I can't yet because as of Kubuntu 11.04 I have not find out how to enable right click via touch. I'm looking forward to the KDE's new Plasma Active interface which is built specifically for mobile devices.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Windows Tablet is the most versatile", "Author": "J.

Since a lot of reviewer have already covered pretty much all aspect of the W500. I'll rather talk about why I end up choosing the W500.My needs:Mainly I want a light weight media player, book reader and some light office work that I can carry around easily. Something that I can take with me for a short getaway trip without having to take a laptop along.My choices includes the following:Apple Ipad 2I already have an iPhone so it's just mostly a larger screen. The problem is no Flash support and it does not support most non .mp4, .mov video format. I would probably end up spending more time converting videos than watching them. No USB port also makes it tough to get files on the go and the non-expandable system RAM is really restricting.10\" Honeycomb tabletsI got my hand on a review copy way before any of them actually shipped. I was initially very excited. nVidia Tegra 2 should mean pretty good video performance while Android OS should mean plenty of apps for anything you might want to do.I have to admit that I never used an Android device before this and while it might work OK as a phone OS. It's really not ready for prime time when it comes to be a tablet OS. The biggest disappointment is the file management. It's a mess. There was no file manager apps by default and you have to download one just to move files around. The file structure is extremely confusing. Took me a while just to figure out that you have to place your ebook in a specific folder in order for the Reader app to see it.Media playback was another disappointment. Tegra 2 cannot handle high bit rate 720p mkv video files which is one of the most popular format around. Netfilx was broken and is still not fix unless you use a third party hack.ASUS EP-121 12\" Win7 TabletSomeone at the office have this and I borrowed it for a weekend. Really nice in most respect except a bit heavy and and short battery life but for PC user. Nothing is easier than using a Windows tablet so you just do everything you normally do without concern of finding a compatible app. The Wacom pen also makes this a perfect tablet for those doing a lot of graphics stuff. Having USB and full SD slot makes it easy and cheap to add additional storage space.Then finally comes the W500.It's definitely weaker in the CPU compare to the EP-121 but since I don't expect to do anything really heavy on the tab, it works well most of the time. The lighter weight and the longer battery life also balance out very nicely and while the AMD C50 is fairly weak as a CPU (Netbook class). The on chip ATI HD6250 means really good media performance. Handles all known video formast up to 1080p. Although the high CPU demand from MS Silverlight means that Netflix HD will not work but Amazon 720p will. Surprising good audio for the unit size. Although heavier than the iPad 2 and the other 10\" Honeycomb tab.

It would randomly do this mostly when I was holding it but also when docked as well.  Sometimes it would occur every few minutes and in other cases after an hour or so of use.  I tried holding it different ways, but it didn't really seem to matter.  I took a video of it being possessed -- Google 'Acer Iconia Tab W500 Touch Screen Problem' and you will probably find it (Amazon apparently doesn't allow posting the URL).Acer Tech support had me try reinstalling the touch drivers and then ultimately doing a factory restore, but that didn't resolve it.

I've used the developer preview and consumer preview and both have worked out extremely well.  Installation was a breeze (either via USB stick or attached cd/dvd drive).  Everything worked great out of the gate, no need for additional driver installs or anything.  Put simply: it is working out perfectly for me.As someone that has used countless computers, notebooks, tablets, etc, I was looking for a tablet that could do more than just play games and check email.  That's where the Acer Iconia Tab W500 came in.  Sure, you can play games and check email, but you can also do just about anything on it that a full-size desktop can do.  Programs that require a bunch of memory or processing might be a bit much for it, but this is a great tablet for general use, work/professional, or just about anything.This device packs a dual-core cpu, 2gb memory, and a 32gb solid state drive.  You also get a 10.1\" screen and it all runs on Windows 7 Home Premium.  As for computing power, it does very well.  I run all the basics (Acrobat, Office, etc) plus graphics software, some CAD software, and other specialized applications.  I'm pleased with its performance.  If 32gb isn't enough storage for you, you can put install a SD/SDHC/SDXC card in about one minute.  I added an SDXC card and it is super fast.  The screen is nice and has a good touch response.It is about a half pound heavier than an ipad or some other tablets, but you clearly get more bang for your buck here.  Good hardware, good screen, expandable storage, USB ports, HDMI, etc.  You can print to just about any printer, use most of your current devices, etc.  I would certainly consider this device to be a workhorse over its competitors.  I also purchased the Iconia Tab W500 to play around with Windows 8.  I won't really consider that a part of my review, but it was simple to install on the W500 and play around with.  Plus, it handled the new OS very well.You also get a keyboard, but honestly I don't use it that much.  I've used it to install some software, etc, but the device stays undocked most of the time.  My only issue has been finding a decent case to put the device in.  Most are very bulky and just do not do the device justice.

But if you want a portable computer with functional touch ability that enables you to do productive work, then iPad is not something you should get. Acer Iconia W500 is a versatile windows-based, touch-enabled little computer that allows you do anything that a mid-range windows PC can do, word processing, excel, outlook, etc (probably not gaming, but I can not tell for sure as I am not a gamer). I installed both MS Office Pro and Open Office on this unit. I also installed putty so that I can connect to a mainframe. The screen is awsome. Multi-touch is not as good as ipad, but is fully functional. I hope the forthcoming Windows 8 will make touch more like iPad.

Others have written compelling and informative Reviews here and so, I hope, mine will attempt to add to their experience.The most compelling reason to get this tablet is not only the excellent hardware and price-point but also the fact that you have a light-weight touch friendly device running a full fledged Windows operating system instantly. Sure, you can use some customization like making the menu bar/scroll buttons larger as well as installing Chrome Touch Extension but, even without these, the touch experience is not all too bad and you have a device ready to be your e-reader (Kindle for PC) your media player (home networked video files/Netflix to HDTV), your light-work (or full for some) computer (with the keyboard) right away.Let me emphasize how easy it feels to have your tablet doing all you can without having to worry about 'app' searching for tasks. I also own an Asus Transformer running the latest Android 3.2. But I found out that for most functionality I had to hunt for 'apps' and then configure them after finding the right ones. Netflix app alone was a pain to find and then hack-install. Want to Remote Desktop? Buy an expensive app with below-bar experience. Want to use your LogmeIn account to connect to some home machine? Yup, buy an app. Office functionality? The supplied application not up to the task for that. Play home videos from the network drive? Not easy. The Asus would be great if my needs were only about web browsing.But this Acer can handle all that. In a few hours I was setup for all my basic computing needs. I played Netflix just fine (except HD to the TV in full screen occasionally halted); the home videos off a network storage run just fine. Remote desktop setup fine. VPN client to corporate site fine. Haven't tried Office but that would be fine too. LogmeIn just fine.If you are craving for a reasonably priced hardware to run Windows (and that too with physical keyboard option) then get this one. You can always install Windows 8 Developer Preview on it--the tablet experience is much better with Windows 8.

The Blackberry was a nice tablet but I thought it was a little small and I didn't like the lack of expansion ports.  I have been extremely happy with the Windows version of the Iconia.  You are getting a laptop and a tablet all in one with plenty of expansion ports (both USB and SD), the security of Anti-Virus/Firewall and the ability to use it as a business laptop while on the road.

The Iconia played full 1080P movies compressed to 720P on both the tablet and the TV simultaneously without a single issue!Don't let the size fool you, this is a real computer, not a tablet toy like some of the others.At this price there's not another tablet more powerful than it at the present time.I linked the tablet to a wireless Motorola S305 Bluetooth headset.

It may cost more than the other tablets as a whole, but it offers you complete computing capabilities the others can't give you.Within 10 minutes of firing it up, I had it connected on my network and sharing on my home group.

Remember, that you got an AMD dual core processor in this thing. And the touch experience is waaaaay better on Windows than Ipad or Android....yes, that's right! Don't believe the hype about Ipad or Android.....unless you have hot dogs for fingers, using the touchscreen is like way easy. It's very exact, and faster and more responsive to the touch than Ipad or Android.The onscreen keyboard in Windows is mind blowing, like you can actually type faster on it than you can with the Ipad keyboard or Android. What's cool about this tablet is the physical keyboard they through in....it's really nice, and the keys are easy to type with, but it does take some getting used to. But overall, the keyboard is cake to use. Ipad and Android (Asus) make you pay extra money if you want a keyboard.The browsing experience is incredible, like you dont have to worry about all the restrictions on browsing the Web that you have with Ipad (no Flash) and Android. They only give you a fake internet experience...you get MOBILE versions of websites....but on this Acer Iconia W500, you get the real Internet, just like on your desktop, laptop, or netbook. Android and Ipad are just big blown up versions of the phones they make....they're not computers and they cant give you the Internet iike this device can.Also, Ipads and Androids dont give you all the ports this thing gives you....you got multiple USB ports, full size SD card, and HDMI outport.....none of that can be found on the Ipad, and most Androids won't give you all that.Now, I read some of the professional reviews of this device on line....they're all written by peeps who think a giant phone (Ipad and Android) are worth 400-500 dollars and probably get paid by the same companies...just stick to reading the CUSTOMER reviews of the W500...from real people who actually bought these things and use them. This W500 is both full computer and full tablet....not some big version of a phone that Apple and Android are cheating us on.This thing is like so fast, both in Internet browsing, programs, and multitasking. It opens webpages really fast, and it's not like Android and Apple, where you wait and wait for the full page to load, and then you only get a MOBILE version of the actual webpage...there aint nothing like the real Internet, baby!Do yourself a favor and buy this sucker....you'll impress your friends and family with it because just putting the tablet on the keyboard really wows people, and the screen on this thing is HD, and has higher specs than the Ipad screen or most Android screens.....the price is perferct (480-500) and you get way more bang for your buck.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is NOT a Toy like the iPad!", "Author": "S.

I bought this as a companion to my ACER ETHOS, which in itself is an impressive machine but the ETHOS is too big and too nice to travel with.I am surprised to find that the W500 fits my every need when I travel and even at home.  The WiFi connection is super fast and will connect to a new and available network within seconds.  Preset networks, the one at home and at my office, connect instantly.  I can't even say that about the DELL I am forced to lug around for work.Storage is not a problem as long as you know how to use existing services.  For example, I have over 200 gigs of music stored at home and a bit over 1.2 tb of vacation pictures.  Now, I am not expecting anything but an external drive to house all these files.  However, when it comes to music, I use Amazon's could music service.  I load all my music and stream to the W500.  Same thing for vacation pictures.  If I am traveling, I take them off my camera load them onto the W500 post to FaceBook and save them onto my Amazon cloud drive.Think of the W500 as your introduction to the CLOUD!Now, a week into my W500 I became a bit frustrated.  It is very easy, too easy, to get used to the W500's touchscreen and completely start ignoring the mouse.  Touch is a heck of a lot faster than a hand held old world mouse...and I like fast!  Without thinking, both at work and at home, I've caught myself taping like a fool on my laptops' screens expecting them to work like the W500.  Then, of course, being a bit irritated when I have to use the mouse.

It's completely solid state and doesn't have a fan. I've built a home studio to record audiobooks, and my netbook that was running the mike mixer had a hard drive that was loud enough to appear on the recording when it spun up. The little Acer tab works fine in this application, running the same recording software I was using before.What I did not expect is the way it has assumed almost every other computing task I have. It's running every Windows app I've thrown at it, including Quickbooks and the whole Office suite. It's replaced my Kindle. Its replaced the laptop I was using for media. It's almost replaced my desktop. I threatened to fill up 32 gig faster than I thought possible, so a 16 gig card lives in the memory slot for pictures and videos and such.I downloaded a driver stored on a thumb drive, plugged in a Sprint aircard, and the Iconia recognized it, defaulted to 4g and took off like there was no big deal. This thing absolutely smokes on that 4g aircard. I can watch Youtube and Netflix all day long. Having a full size USB port on the tab is very nice indeed, although I find that I watch most videos with it docked to the keyboard.Web browsing is an interesting experience.

Adams", "ReviewID": "RC03GJ9GPSSCQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, first off, this tablet is superb.  For what it is, it's extremely capable.  The CPU, while very low power, can manage every day tasks without breaking a sweat.  And unlike most other AMD processors, it seems to run rather cool.  The unit will get warm, but but the fan isn't running all the time (core temps are around 60*C...toasty but acceptable...).  Also being an APU with Radeon HD 6290 graphics, it's pretty capable.  Most any online videos play fine on it.  It might need a moment to sort a few things out but after a second or two it'll stream most anything nice and smooth.My major gripe with it is the lack of RAM and upgradability.  With only 2GB RAM, it's a bit limited.  I run my systems without paging enabled thus I can easily exhaust 1.6GB (all that remains after shared vram).  And lets not forget, not only does paging slow a system down but it could shorten the life of the SSD.RAM aside, it's really not that bad of a unit.  The tablet itself is very well made, with the keyboard an obvious \"bonus\".  While not terrible, it's clearly not the same build quality as the tablet, feeling very hollow and keys feeling spongy.  But since 90% of it's use will be touch-based, we'll stick to that portion.  The screen is brilliant.  LCD is bright with wonderful colors and the touch portion is very accurate.  Battery life is around 3-6 hours depending on what you're doing/brightness/etc.  I've not used bluetooth yet but wifi is fine.  Antennas are at the top thus rotating the unit can degrade the signal, but never drop it completely.One of the main draw-backs with this unit, though, is software.  Not what Acer has for it (though I'd avoid all that junk :P) but operating systems and such.  Windows 7 works fine with tablets but obviously isn't built around touch like iOS and Android.  They keyboard isn't as well designed and doesn't always come up as needed.  Icons and what not are too small.  And of course, software is typically also deisgned for mouse/keyboard, so icons are tiny.  With some tweaking things become more usable, but it's never going to be an ipad.Oh, forget about Windows 8.  Maybe I'm completely wrong and more software will be developed for Metro, but the bit I used Windows 8 made me even less inclined to try it on any of my machines.  Sticking to the tablet on this review, the \"start menu\" is a horrendous mess of random icons and programs that don't support Metro are even less usable than with Windows 7.So, if you don't mind customizing your machine a bit and tweaking everying, you really can't beat this little tablet.

I had done the research and found the positive reviews helpful and decided this is what I wanted, and I am glad I did.  This little unit works as well as one could expect.  Most complaints I've heard or read come from trying to compare it to other tablets on the market (such as iPad, Xoom, or Galaxy Tab).  This is not in the same family as any of those.  This runs a full Windows 7 operation system.  If you are familiar with Windows, then you will be able to do everything you need to do on this.  But because it is a full OS, the apps and operation of the system will tax more resources.  If all you want is a small gaming tablet or web searching, then one of the others is probably a better choice, however, if you want the power of a full OS and functionality, this is the way to go. I have loaded all the normal programs on it, and then added all the programs that we use at work so I can log in remotely or on the network at work and use it productively as well.The battery life, which is one of the main concerns with a Windows tablet, seems to hold up reasonably well.  I seem to be getting between 5-6 hours of moderate use on a charge with no problems (moderate use meaning powered on and \"playing with it\" but not necessarily taxing it heavily).  The screen is awesome and very responsive to touch.  The keyboard dock is nice, and other comments have mentioned the lack of adjustment when docked together, which is not great, but not a deal killer either.  I do not like, however, that the usb ports are on the bottom of the tablet when in landscape.  It makes it difficult if you want something else plugged in to then stand it up with a case.  I have also found that the full size HDMI output is nice so you don't have to get an adapter or a special cable to change the sizes.All in all, I have been completely satisfied with this tablet.  If you are not a Windows power user, though, I would do a little research and find some of the tweaks that will make the OS work better for a tablet.  Several things can be adjusted to make for a better touch experience as well as extend battery life.  I would also suggest getting a capacitive stylus for it and using the handwriting recognition input that is built in.  Much better than pecking at an onscreen keyboard.  Also, for those who get one, in case you don't know, Word 2010 has built in software for tablets where you can use your finger or a stylus and write directly in word.

It seems to be as fast as my Dell laptop (that died and needed to be replaced) but is not noisy or hot on my lap. I like the fact it has a keyboard that I find very easy to use. The touch screen capability is also helpful, even with the keyboard attached. Without the keyboard, it is also a nice machine. I have noticed that internet explorer 9 is much better than chrome for touch screen capabilities. It's not as smooth as my wife's IPAD 2, but the touch screen capability does actually work pretty well. In that regard, I look forward to windows 8 and internet explorer 10 for making the touch screen capability even better.I am glad I have this machine instead of an IPAD 2. For me, it is important that it can run all of my windows based programs including flash. The IPAD 2 prints best with an apple printer but this PC prints with almost all printers.One small thing I had to get used to was how easily the touch screen can come detached from the keyboard. One needs to be careful picking it up when they are attached to each other to prevent the keyboard or the screen from droping on the ground. That would not be good.

However, I did have the same problem some other reviewers had where it did things randomly without touching the screen at all.

After installing the firmware update, it has only had the problem one time.In spite of that, it's still a great little table computer, and I'd certainly buy it again.  I love that it runs all my Windows programs and that it runs them as fast as my desktop computer.  I don't mind the keyboard, either.  You do have to press some of the keys a little harder than normal, but not much harder.My only suggestion to Acer is to put a second USB port on the screen.  Right now, if you have a flash drive plugged in to the screen, you have to remove it to be able to plug in the keyboard.  (You can then plug the flash drive into the keyboard, but it's annoying to have to close your current file, eject the flash drive, plug in the keyboard, plug the flash drive in to the keyboad, and re-open your current file.)  I've gotten in the habit of copying my presentations from my flash drive to the W500 so I can easily plug in the keyboard as needed without interrupting my lessons, and that solution has worked well.I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Acer tech support rep I contacted didn't know about the firmware update.

I live in NZ and this was my first major electronic purchase from Amazon ( Ihave bought books and DVDs before). I ordered the tablet Sunday NZ time to take adavantage of the exchange rate. As Amazon is 16 hours behind NZ this meant the tablet did not ship until Tuesday my time (Monday in the US). But with the excellent racking service I could watch in real time the progress of the tabelt. And guess what? I got the tbalet at 7am on Friday morning, it took only four days from Arizona to my door and that was at the normal shipping rate, not the more expensice rate! Awesome!Tabelt arrived well packed and undamaged.Now here are my first impressions. I like it! But I knew what I wanted, a tabelt that had an operating system that I was familar with, could add and take off what I like, use for travel and play my favourite windows based games on.But if you want something to play with straight out of the box get an ipad2. With the w500 you will need a few hours tinkering to get it how you want it, getting rid of bloatware and deciding on the right web browser. Suprisingly I am finding IE9 much better than Mozilla on the tablet, even tho I use mozilla on my desktop. IE9 seems better confgiured for touch screen!But it is an amazing little machine! I have so far installed my favourite strategy games like hearts of iron 3 - runs it no prob but I don't recommend playing via touch screen! I can map my desktop DVD drive and I am currently seeing what else I can put on it!Now what I love about this machine is its compatability with my home network. Yes, if you are a windows user and have a windows wireless network at home this tabelt is awesome. It has synced up with my server automatically and now I can access content anywhere in my split level home! Today I was tinkering down in my garage, 2 levels down, with my tablet playing my favourite music and films while I worked direct from my server, my playlists were all automatically there. I loved that! Music and movies can be viewd, moved and edited without having to conver things to like itunes! Stuff can be grabbed and dragged onto the tablet via touch screen on the server.The picture and sound quality are excellent. The screen has better viewing angles than my led desktop monitor.The main reason I got this was because I am planning a major trip in acouple of months, over to Europe, some long flights from NZ so I wanted something I could use to keep in touch with ppl and keep me entertained. I think this will do it but I will update on how this works out!Now this thing isn't perfect and is not for people who just want a toy. But here are my main gripes:i. Lack of accessories. When you type in acer w500 for accessories most of what Amazon puts up are for the A500 and not compatible. That's not on Amazon and you have to read carefully to not get caught out. I would very much like a travel adaptor for this and a docking station etc like the A500 but there does not seem to be any available.ii. it is heavy and bulky compared to other tabelts. Apple still wins hands down for design. I must admit this tabelt can start to feel heavy if you are holding it up for prolonged periods.iii. windows does need more time to boot up than tablet and pad optimised systems like android. You must accept this if you want win7 on your tablet along with shorter batter life.In the end I think this is a machine you will either love or hate especially if the reviews are anything to go by! I like it but I was definitely not an iSlave and I am happy using windows and I like windows based games and apps.Update 16 August:I have been playing Civ IV on the tablet. Works really well as a touch screen game! Only thing I can't do is change the name of cities cause I can't bring up the virtual keyboard in game.

With a full windows pc there is no compromise. EVER.This thing is more than powerful enough to run anything you throw at it. Have 10 applications open, playing a video, and on and on, I've never seen this thing stutter in the week I've had it. Battery life is great too! All these people saying 6 hours isn't enough. Dude.....when the screen is off or its in standby you are using practically nothing. This thing lasts me 2-3 days sometimes & I bring it everywhere!!I could go on & on & on & on & on. It has everything a windows desktop has. A FULL sized hdmi port, 2 usb, on & on. Why fumble with your printer app on ur ipad? Just add the network printer to your windows 7 tablet in a snap. Map your network drives and stream content from ur other pc with the massive hard drive. That makes 32 gb on board seem plenty big. You can hope that a skype app with video comes out for your tablet platform or just have windows and download Skype. WTF!!!!

The ipad2 is nice & light, sure, but its so simplistic its all just gimmicks, and I could never get past the fact that its just a big iphone, which isn't even any good on a phone when its put next to android. All the honeycomb tablets (xoom, iconia, etc) garbage as well. Like using a calculator or something. Way too simplistic for something of that screen size. I just recently played aroudn with a blackberry playbook also. I actually liked the UI a little more than ipad/honeycomb but it was still so simplistic. A great example of windows 7 tab vs. all other tabs....Recently, a week after the playbook came out, they finally released a facebook app and a video chatting app. Hoo-f'in-ray! An app that won't have all the features u want, I'll just open google chrome and go to facebook.com. Seems simple enough right? And the video chatting app, just like Apple facetime, only lets u chat between like devices. So a playbook can only video chat with a playbook.

The bluetooth on the Iconia pairs with my headset without any trouble, actually the easiest bluetooth pairing I have ever experienced. I sit at my computer workstation and speak into the calisto pro and this tablet captures everything using Dragon without any errors or dropped communication. I finally have a voice recognition system that works - and I have been trying to get to this point for 15 years. Extremely productive. A life saver if you are anyone from a professional to a life long learner. It's a dream come true for a voice recognition capable portable device.My son enjoys the art program I have on it but it frustrates him as I have not figured out a way to lock the menus and screen. Sometimes his hand brushes an area of the screen and some other window opens. Not good....  he does spend an hour drawing while we are on a plane though, then watches children shows. I purchased an external lithium battery pack for extra power while we travel.The cons are:You must get a screen protector and install it immediately. The screen scratches very easily. I also purchased a touch pad stylus as my fingers are too big for some of the icons.The wifi receiver is weak, guess to save on batteries, and it is the 1/2 speed N.How to make it better:Boost your system by inserting at least an 8 GB class 6 SDHC card to expand the memory and for heaven's sake get something like ebooster 4 and set the memory cache on the SDHC card to 4 gigs. You will get at least a 14% speed boost, it's a major improvement, I think mine is closer to 20% with Dragon. Windows 7 comes with something like ebooster called readyboost but I don't bother with Microsoft tweakers as they are never the best.Otherwise I won't repeat what others have said, but there is a reason this baby's price has not gone down in 7 months whereas I can get Android game playing internet tablets for half the price and the Acer Iconia Android model is dropping a lot this month...  I have regretted buying netbooks (we have 3, one is a media center that is rarely used, one is for security cameras and the other is my wife's and I try to stash it somewhere dark so I don't have to look at it).

There were two chief complaints about it. 1.) windows 7 and 2.) slow. I must say when I got the tablet I was a bit disappointed because I found those reviews to be true. This tablet was very slow on windows 7 and windows 7 is not user friendly on a tablet; however, I never intended on using it with windows 7. I discovered that there was a free copy of windows 8 available, and everyone who put it on their Acer w500 talked about how much windows 8 improved the experience. I installed windows 8 immediately on the laptop. This has improved the laptop 200%. Netflix runs smoothly and browsing the internet is a pleasure. I cant wait for the complete version of windows 8. To me it is a pleasure to have a full Os and a tablet Os in one package. This gives me the ability to have it for the entertainment and work in one mobile package; however I understand this isn't for everyone. It takes some work (it took me maybe an hour total to get windows 8 on it) and some know how. Most people want it to work the way they want out of the box. For that I think Acer should be promising windows 8 free to all buyers, and without any bloatware (what really slowed windows 7 down).To sum it up.Pros:Speedy and smooth with windows 8.Beautiful  screen with better resolution than even the ipad.Keyboard dock adds functionality.Full os.A gpu with dedicated gpu memory (u can play some good older games).Full hdmi slot for easy connection to tv or monitor.Usb ports.Full sd card slot up to 128gbs.Cons:Only 3 stars w/ windows 7.The dock is nice, but should secure better and is top heavy and easy to tip over.A little heavy.Added notes:I will add little notes from time to time.Netflix does run poorly when watching hd movies. I have fixed this by not allowing Netflix to stream hd. This is a pain because from time to time I'm going to have to change it back when I'm watching on my tv. It runs smoothly on non hd, but this also sucks because you lose the high quality screen.I think google chrome is a must. the reason isn't because its better, but because google has its own little app store on chrome. it is nice because u get facebook notifications, games, and other utilities. microsoft needs an app store!", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Affordible and Practical for those who need Windows on the go.", "Author": "Mad Cow \"mooooooo\"", "ReviewID": "R167FPKECF31BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cons:Small SSD hard drive.  32GB is nothing to write home about, especially when the OS takes up a bulk of the precious space.  Takes the mini-sata version of the SSD, which costs a bundle to do a simple upgrade to 64GB.  Not worth it.  The AMD c-50 processor isn't the fastest thing either with dual cores running at 1Ghz.  Also, the Acer Ring takes a while to load.  Sometimes when you put all five fingers down - the Acer Ring activation message - it doesn't work.  Just better to hit the Acer Ring icon on the desktop and wait.  Most of the categories on the Acer Ring are junk, but it's the quickest and easiest way to access the cameras.  The USB ports are located on the bottom - so if you have it in a case and want to use the USB slots, you have to lay it flat - which is a dumb design, especially if you use the case to stand it up and want to use a full sized wireless keyboard and mouse.  I wish the dockable keyboard had a track pad instead - I would use it much more often, but as it is, I just tossed it somewhere.  Cannot install more RAM.  Does not have palm-canceling technology when using a pen to write notes.Pros:Support for SDXC - means I purchased a 64GB SDXC card where I install all of my programs and have all of my media stored.  Battery lasts 4 hours - plenty of time to keep you entertained in the doctor's office.  Faster than single core Windows-based tablets such as the Exo-PC.  Super bright screen and accurate finger touch controlling, even on non-touch friendly programs.  Regular sized HDMI port, so no need for an adapter cable.  Comes with a dockable keyboard, which is handy since it doubles as a protective case for the screen.  Front facing and rear facing cameras with decent quality.  Small, but not too small, and in a case, looks like a little book or day planner.  Needless to say, very portable - much more so than pretty much any laptop or netbook.  Weight and size isn't an issue.  It has run every program I installed pretty well, Adobe Photoshop CS4, Adobe Acrobat X Pro, MS Office 2010, VLC, NERO 10 and others.  Burns DVDs perfect with a USB powered DVD burner.Comments:I purchased this and an EXO-PC.  The design of the EXO-PC is much better, but the functionality and performance of the Acer beats it out.  The Acer is also smaller, more portable and has much more aftermarket support.  I normally carry mine around in a case that doubles as a stand.  I use it all the time at work, the doctor's office and at the mechanic waiting for my car to be fixed, and wherever else I can snag some free wi-fi.  It has an issue with connecting to some older Linksys wireless routers, but I've only encounterd that once.  The keyboard is ok as I've used it when holed-up in a hotel, but I still have to use a wireless mouse.  It's a great travelling companion, especially when you need to get some work done in MS Word or Excel, which is often for me.  I have other non-Windows tablets, and most seem aimed at entertainment.  For the price, I wanted something practical and productive.  I don't need it to play games, and playing movies and music or reading e-books is the same as on any other Windows 7 based machine.  And if I'm itching to play something over my network or from a USB drive, I don't have to worry about connectivity, converting, or compatibility...it's a Windows 7 based computer in slate form.  Many will equate it to a netbook without a keyboard, but it's faster than many of the dual core netbooks out there (mainly the cheaper versions - which is almost all of them).  The only upgrade I can see from this slate is the ASUS slate with the Core i5 - but it's more than double the price of this one.  This will do for now, especially at a respectable $400.

Notice that it doesn't come with a pen, the reason presumably being that they just don't work well on it.  Also, it boots up surprisingly slowly for having all solid state memory.

Setup took approximately 1 hour. The second boot again was a little slow, again an the same expectation. However subsequent times after that, the boot and the shutdown took forever and a day. Boot takes more than 4 minutes. I have a Toshiba Laptop running Win 7, that 5 years old and it takes 1/2 the time to boot  than the Acer Iconia does.Since I did not require high graphics I thought to lower the shared memory for the graphics to 256k rather than the 384k that comes standard. The BIOS does not allow any changes to the shared graphics memory, thus leaving me with just 1.5 gigs of memory to run my applications. Window 7, as are all MSN OS', are memory intensive and with 1.5 gigs, this thing doesn't move very fast.Before I gave up on this Acer, I went and looked at the performance of this AMD C-50 Processor at \"[...] and found out that it was only rated at 452.

First I bought the Blackberry Playbook and although the device is fantastic and is very responsive, fast browsing, bridge and teetering worked just fine, I realized any app that I was looking for my work related stuff was either no there or was under development. In my opinion the app market and the no support for native email are the major cons.I returned the playbook and then got the iPad 2 from Best Buy, again no complains with the product but lack of flash, as lot of my work require me to use flash site and too closed environment, make me realize that I don't want my tablet just for surfing, music & video but something that can extend my work from my regular laptop.I just received my ICONIA W500, thanks for Amazon's super fast shipping. I opened, plugged the power and ready to use. First impression, very sleek, the touch screen is working perfectly fine. The device is top heavy that's for sure but when you put it on a desk it stays put without any problem - on the lap it's difficult.I am in the process of removing the unwanted software's and will update my review again in few days. So far it's an excellent device (finger's crossed)Update (End Day 1)==================Most of the day I used the tablet attached to the keyboard I was little hesitant on the touchscreen keyboard, I used the entire evening undocked from the external keyboard and I must say its very neat. I am positive people who are used to iPad will not find the touchscreen smooth but I must say its good enough to get your work done and not bad enough to get you annoyed. Considering that windows by default is not designed for touch interface, the device performed excellent.Update (Day2)============One thing I missed is that the Dolby Sound, the clarity and fidelity is just fantastic. Its better than my Dell Latitude laptop. I had some trouble adding the - NetFlix to the windows Media server, because I found when watching in browser, there is lag. Make sure you use the Silverlight 3.0 for NetFlix to play from media server. I had to remove the Silverlight 4.0 and then install the ver 3.0.

After several updates I am noticing significant improvements in touch screen and ooverall performance. I watched yesterday the entire movie Iron man II, just one word fantastic. The sound effect and clarity for this size is just fantastic. I installed office 2010 only word and excel and didn't felt any difference in performance.

Limited space, currently have 14gb free.Month 1 Update==============Still enjoying my laptop tablet hybrid - I noticed keeping the windows update in automatic mode was filling up my space few MB every few days, had to turn off to manual mode. The only complain I have so far is the space constraint. Although I haven't purchase the SD card, I feel you really have to be very selective in what you want to install.

I am able to play full fledge games like Tomb Raider Legend, Tomb Raider anniversary at 1080p, Yea thats right 1080p with everything just about turned all they way up.Second is this tablet does everything. Unlike other tablets there is nothing you can not do. I am a software developer and i can use my Eclipse compiler and an additional monitor and it actually runs.That said, all other chores are pretty easily done. I had an Ipad 2 and still have a Acer Droid but wll probably sell it because with this tablet there are no limitations.The keyboard docking station is nice if you want to get some work done like serious typing. It also has additional USB connectors for drives, xbox 360 controlls and evertything. else.Ok so the only draw back i have found so far is that web browsing is not as snappy. I think the reason is that it renders everying on the page versus the Ipad which does not support flash.Altough windows 7 is not a true tablet OS it does the job well. I think you have to get use to using the os on the tablet to really see how it works.Example if you want to create, close, or add directories just hold down on the item for a bit and you get a full menu of options.

I got it because I want to use it on the road for work and didn't want to mess around with downloading apps and learning new programs which were compatible with other tabs.  I have had an ipad and the Xoom.  The Xoom was great but still didn't have the compatibility I needed to work on the road.  Iconia has it all!  I have worked on Windows 7 a good portion of the day yesterday and it is flawless.  Set up is easy and the keyboard is great to have.  I LOVE that there are USB ports available and the size it great.  It is only a little heavier than the Xoom.  I used it all day yesterday as a tablet and today I'm using it as a laptop.  I couldn't be more happy.  It has all the features I need.  Not all the confusing bells and whistles of other tabs - and ones you can't get rid of that just use up memory.  I am confident that I am going to get a lot of good use out of this tab/pc.  The memory may be a bit smaller than needed for someone who wants it strictly for games and videos, but then the Xoom would work great for that.

The spring in the latch for the keyboard dock lost some strength so it no longer pushes the latch fully upright making it not lock in place.  I contacted support and got a response in 1 day, but their response is that I have to send in both the keyboard dock and the tablet to get the dock repaired - if they don't choose to blame me for it.  Further, I may have to pay shipping one way (with the device under warranty), and typical repair times are 7 to 10 days plus shipping times.  That would leave me without my tablet for up to 3 weeks.  They also require that you provide them the administrator password to access Windows.  I have some sensitive work data on the tablet and I don't want to have to wipe the drive before sending it to them and then putting everything back on when I get it back.  I'd be fine with wiping and reloading if the tablet was having the issue, but not the keyboard.  And before anyone thinks I shouldn't have sensitive data on the tablet because I could lose the tablet, I am using bitlocker on the drive plus another layer of encryption on the files themselves.I am hoping to get them to take just the keyboard dock for repair, but if they will not back off of their position of needing both I will just not send it in for now because I don't want to be without the tablet that is working perfectly fine for 3 weeks.  If support changes their position I will report that back.Original review:The W500 is a great tablet, as long as you keep in mind that it is a tablet, not a desktop or desktop-replacement style laptop.  I wiped mine and re-installed to a clean Windows 7 Ultimate install (I always wipe computers that come pre-loaded) and I have loaded Office 2010, Project 2010, and Visio 2010.  In addition I have installed many troubleshooting tools such as Fiddler, SQL Server Management Studio (not the server itself).  Then some communication stuff such as Skype and CUPC.  All of it performs great.Just to see how much I could push it, I installed World of Warcraft to the SD card and tried playing it.  Not perfectly smooth and a touchscreen is impossible to use to control the game, but with the keyboard/touch-stick attached I was able to play it quite acceptably and it would be fine if I had 30 minutes I wanted to kill in an airport.The default onscreen keyboard size leaves the buttons too small for my fat fingers to hit, but I increased the size of the keyboard to go almost edge to edge across the long side and it is quite easy for me to hit the right keys at a pretty fast pace.

Plus, I also wanted to play around with the AMD Fusion APU and see what it can do. The tablet has an average design that probably won't turn any heads. The display is good, but the resolution is a little on the low side (you will want 1366x768 for Win8). The performance of the APU is great. I was expecting something like an Intel Atom, but it is much faster than your usual netbook. The hardware accelerated graphics are very useful, and you can even play some StarCraft 2 (low settings). It plays 1080p Flash videos without any issues or hiccups, but it can be strained when watching high quality 1080p MKV rips (720p MKV rips are fine). UEFI BIOS is amazing when paired with an SSD drive, especially when combined with Windows 8. Boot/sleep/hibernate performance is amazing. On WDP, the sleep/wake takes 1 second, cold boot takes about 10 seconds (from the time you press the power button to login screen). Obviously the times will be slower when using Windows 7. I get about 6-7 hours of battery life with a combination of web browser and media playback. One of the biggest downsides is the small SSD. There are also driver issues when running in the 64-bit version of Windows (7 and 8). This wouldn't be a big deal in 2005, but we are now in 2011, and Acer needs to support both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. The biggest downside (and the reason this tablet gets 4 stars, not 5) is the Acer techincal support. I contacted them because one of the drivers was malfunctioning. They told me to contact the original component manufacturer in order to get help with this issue. I've worked in the IT business for a while now, and I have never seen any tech support refer a customer to a sub-contractor/parts supplier for help with an issue. I tried calling back at a later time to get a different tech, but they weren't much help either. This is a stark contrast to the support I've received from HP/Dell/Lenovo/ASUS. However, the tablet itself is very good, and highly recommended (assuming you can't wait for a Win8 tablet).Pros:Great APU, relatively powerful processor and graphics chip (for this type of product).Great battery life.UEFI + SSD = fast boot/sleep/wake performance.Good display (quality wise).Relatively light and thin (remember this is a x86 tablet, not an ARM one).Comes with a good keyboard dock.Full-size HDMI port and USB ports.It runs Windows which means you can actually get real work done, and use it like a computer (external peripherals, displays, the whole lot).Cons:Screen resolution is only 1280x800 (need 1366x768 for Windows 8 side-by-side multitasking).SSD is a little small (32gb doesn't sound that bad... until you install Windows on it).It has a fan (this is something you will not get with an ARM tablet)Bad driver support in 64-bit Windows.Questionable Acer support.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A nice tablet if you keep it docked.", "Author": "C.Schmidt", "ReviewID": "RCVNV7LHF7HT4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start things off, I am a big fan of across multiple platforms.

The keyboard works and that is how I first started using it.It is when I undocked it that I was a little disappointed.  The touch screen is buggy and when selecting points on the screen, it sometimes misses or doesn't register.  The rotating of the screen was poor, the device seemed confused and would orient correctly fifty percent of the time.  When I started reviewing PDFs, the touch screen went a little batty.  It would scream through the document, a wee bit out of control.  I adjusted the touch screen settings, but no luck.  Another funny item was my son found angry birds and downloaded it on Chrome.  While playing, the touch screen would take him to the previous webpage, very upsetting to a toddler (lol), so I tested it and again the same results.If you are using this device as a netbook/notebook and docked, you will be happy, it is at the point of undocking that you will need to be patient.

The biggest dislike is that you are not able to increase the size of the memory.The tablet recognized our network immediately and was able to pick up public networks when we were traveling.  The screen rotates to either portrait or landscape mode and can be locked to avoid changing on the fly.  This is great for Kindle books.  Speakers are quite impressive for a tablet of this size and the screen is extremely clear.  It comes with a detachable keyboard which also acts as a protective cover when stored.  That being said the onscreen keyboard and handwriting recognition are very intuitive.  I don't have the best handwriting in the world but it was able to pick up most of what I wrote on the screen with needing edited.The big plus for me compared to the iPad is the integrated USB and SD card slots.

For another, I wanted several ports, including several USB ports, HDMI, ear phone.I wanted a very portable laptop for use within the house, with a built in keyboard, but the built in keyboard has proved to be less comfortable than using a $40 Logitech K400 bluetooth  wireless keyboard with a touchpad type mouse.  I can prop up the tablet with an old fashioned wire  bookstand  (like the $5 Fellowes Wire Study Stand), with the Logitech bluetooth dongle plugged to one of the two USB ports on the iconia.  The built in keyboard is fixed via pins in a rigid position of about a 40 degree angle, and somehow the junction feels fragile, though maybe it is stronger than I think. So if I were buying a tablet again, I would omit the built in keyboard.I found I did not like the touch screen method of operating the tablet, probably because my finger ends have large surface areas (many people have much more tapered finger ends with much smaller surface area, that helps to more precisely touch a small area of the screen, whereas my finger ends spread over too large an area often causing several icons to be pressed at the same time, causing all kinds of mishaps.I have found I can plug the tablet into our 42 inch TV screen, via an HDMI cable, and operate the tablet at long range with the Logitech keyboard, sitting comfortably a number of feet away, doing things like resolving factual questions on Wikipedia while seated with friends. This tablet gives a very good image on the TV, very clear, refreshing quite quickly.The Iconia also connects well with thumb drives and with external hard drives.

Oh...and that SD card slot? Never mind....Apple never listens anyway. Catch up!Also, be aware that accessories for this tablet are few and far between.  Cannot get a cover of any sort at the moment.  Even a spare charger is not available.  The Acer web site is pretty lame as well.Update: Because of the method used to mate this device with the keyboard in its \"closed\" configuration, there is no way for a cover of any kind to be designed for it that will allow it to be attached to the keyboard for transport.  This is a definite downside to the design of this tablet because the case material is quite slippery and prone to scratching.  Also, the lens of the forward-facing camera does not have gorilla glass covering it and it will eventually become severely scratched just by \"closing\" it onto the keyboard for travel.Update 2:  I loaded the Windows 8 developer preview on this tablet and it is absolutely awesome!

Kamel", "ReviewID": "R1FKEAUXEQO239", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long battle with other choices, I decided to go with my favorite company and get this Acer Iconia W500 Tablet.Acer:I've purchased many things from Acer. Never had a problem so far so I keep coming back. 3 laptops, a 22\" monitor for my desktop, and this. All of them working fine and it's getting past 5 years. Flawless performance for such low price. That being said, I have never had to contact their customer service. Mostly because I know what \"Google\" is and how there is answers to everything. This is just to backup my review as I don't see too many people in love with Acer. Hope they keep up their great work.Design:The main thing that drew me back from this Tablet is the color. Amazon said \"Silver.\" The pictures that amazon has are misleading. It looks very whitish grey. When in fact it is black with a hint of grey. I just do not like White for anything that I own. Gets dirty easily, and looks rubbish. Anyways. Now on to some points.1. Both USB slots are unreachable if you plan on using the Keyboard attachment. Which isn't a problem because I never use the keyboard. It has a touch screen for a reason.2. Weighs a good 3 pounds. Heavy, yes. But to be honest, it's amazing how they can fit an APU, a fan, and a SSD in such a tiny space.3. Heat. It is quite hot. Try touching top of your LCD screen right now, it's just like that where the air comes out. LCD's create heat. The APU creates heat. The HDD creates heat. And for the most part Acer has done a great job dispensing the heat out. It comes out from the top left corner. It also gets marginally hotter if it is plugged up due to the Battery charging.Software:Oh dear God, the bloatware. Lots and lots of it. I use a professional uninstaller and when I started there were well over 80 programs/links and about 7 or 8 programs that start up with windows.1. Use an uninstaller to remove bloatware, shortcuts, and start up programs as they slow you down by a mile (Do not use Add/Remove as it does not clean registries. The professional ones search in the Reg and also for leftover files and plugins from the program). When I started it up for the first time after initial setup it took about 2 minutes to turn on from the moment I pressed the Power button. However, After I removed all the shortcuts/adobe/skype/office/Mcafee and disabled other services it started it up in just about a minute 10 seconds. Which is phenomenal for a tiny 2.0Ghz APU. The SSD does help a bit I assume.2. The Acer ring, which I think is just awesome looking, is uncustomizable. You get the things that they think you need on it. Calculator, snipping tool, and a Acer's own TouchBrowser. I personally started to fiddle with it a bit and got around to changing the background and thumbnail images. Even thought it still is doesn't accept fully customizable programs and such. I bet with a little more fiddling I can get it to work. But for now, it shall remain eye candy.3. 32GB SSD. 30GB Free. 22GB Free after Windows. You can get the system down to 22GB free if you know what you're doing and uninstall stuff like Adobe and McAfee. I have no need for an anti virus or a PDF reader.4. Bluetooth works great. Transferring files to and from my phone without cables is great. You can also use your phone's internet and make phone calls through it.5. I used my phone's SD card to get some extra storage. I do not need much since I'm not going to use this as my main PC. I have my server for storage. You also need to remember that SSD's lose performance with their space. Try to never go under 3-5GB free.6. Defrag, defrag, defrag at least once a month. It helps a lot. Do not use Windows defrag as all it does is make you wait. Use Auslogics Disk Defragger, it's free and very fast. And remember to always restart your computer after defragging.Suggestions/Dislikes:1. At least an 80GB SSD next time.2. Change the location of the USB slot.3. Offer more color combinations.4. Make the Acer ring more customizable (Background and programs).5. If bloatware is making you lot of cash, keep it. It's fine. It only takes an hour to get rid of it. If it doesn't make a big margin of the low price then for the love of God, send me a fresh installation of windows.6. Give it a better name. Iconia is doesn't roll off the tongue skillfully.As you can see I'm just grasping onto straws. There aren't too many bad things about it.Impressions:I guess what I wrote up there is more of a guide to making this device even better. I don't think anyone can hate this. It's great, it's not that honeycomb uselessness where you even need to get an app to see your battery life. Please do not compare this to an iPad or a Xoom. Those are toys. This is a PC.Links: If you would like to see pictures that I personally took.

I chose it for a friend who needed it for her medical practice. Now that patient records need to be digitized, she hoped to use this less expensive tablet alternately with the Asus Eee Slate EP 121-1A010 to keep track of all her business's management needs, which include patient vitals, records, and billing. In the doctor's own words:\"I log into Athena, which is our electronic medical record and practice management, and then all the info regarding a patient gets put in. So, the girls will use the tablet to populate BP, pulse, etc, past medical history, chief complaint, etc. Some of it is clicking onto specific fields and it will auto-populate with a touch. I think the ASUS Eee Slate is the perfect size screen by the way. I really like that one. The Acer is good but, screen is small so it's difficult to maneuver over fields.\"The doctor purchased the recommended digital pen for the Acer, but it didn't provide the accuracy or manueverability that the ASUS has.  It was also impossible to get the Acer to interface with her printer.The Asus has the added advantage of a wireless Bluetooth keyboard and a digital pen, which I believe can be an asset for anything that requires a signature, e.g. a prescription or an MS Office Word business letter. It can also interface with the recommended HP wireless printer.  The Asus also comes with a mediocre MS Office program that can be upgraded for a better version.My initial favorites were the Apple iPad2 or a Toshiba tablet. However, neither of them comes with a Windows operating system (OS), which the folks at Athena.com, the doctor's business out sourcers, had recommended. Toshiba uses Google's Android and Apple uses its own system.

But use a regular-length stylus, not one of the short stubby ones.Updates:First, I have found that the SD card slot supports SDXC, allowing 64gb and 128gb upgrades.Second, I tried out a Galaxy Tab 10.1 in a store, and it was slow too! Flash video took a while to load and didn't reorient correctly between portrait and landscape--just like in Windows.My criticism and low rating remains, though, perhaps now expanded to Android tabs as well.***Forget about the \"keydock\" contraption. Consider the W500 as a Windows tablet, able to pair with any USB or Bluetooth keyboard, or just resort to the wonky on-screen keyboard. And what have you got?The greatest of all Netbooks, the least of all tablets.There needs to be context. There have always been Windows tablets--questionable Archos tabs, overpriced UMPCs, and convertible tablets with swiveling screens. Aside from a few hot-rod $1,000 models, the Netbook-based Windows tabs like the Dell Inspiron Duo and Lenovo s10-3t have suffered from glacial sluggishness and cheap LCD screens whose poor viewing angles make actual tablet use a pain. Hold it wrong and the image turns blue!But that's where the Tab W500 delivers. As a multitouch-based Windows 7 Netbook-tablet, it just works. Touch response is quick if not buttery smooth, finger-swipe scrolling works in Firefox and IE but not Chrome, and pinch-to-zoom...works on pictures but lags for websites. Now this screen--it's beautiful! Off-axis viewing angles are nearly perfect. The image is almost as stable as my smartphone, or an iPad.That screen quality is a huge deal, and it means that if you're thinking about a Windows Netbook at all, the Iconia W500 is the ONLY way to get an excellent screen!.But, as a tablet? The processor bogs down easily--one Flash video at a time, max--and battery life is insufficient for e-reader duty--4 hours of surfing, 2-3 hours of Flash video. It's also too blasted heavy to hold comfortably--two pounds for the tablet only. Compared to the iPad and slew of Android Tablets in its price range, the Iconia W500 cannot compete.So the point of this computer is really just Windows 7--full document and spreadsheet editing, PDF editing if you buy software, regular desktop programs, full Web support, both Flash and Silverlight, two USB ports, USB printing, and a full-sized HDMI port for mirroring and extended desktop. It elevates the experience of a premium Netbook by adding touch input and great viewing angles.The problem is, after spending two weeks with my new W500 tablet and writing half this review on its wonky ON-SCREEN keyboard, I'm still jealous for an iPad or any Android tab that runs Flash. Even with their limitations, mainstream tablets are very functional--focused, you might say--and they all have excellent battery life. This little touchbook is such a different machine, a traditonal computer that dressed up in a tablet costume, a jack-of-all-trades that excels at nothing, except for that screen. The Android tablets and iPad have a gravity to them, because they're designed to do fewer things but do them very well.The bottom line? The W500 is for those looking for a Netbook, not a tablet. As a Windows machine, it's a decent Netbook with a bonus touch screen. As a tablet, it's too heavy and the battery life is nearly inexcusible.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Muy Buena", "Author": "Jose Vera Gomez", "ReviewID": "R1GJ6WU3E26F34", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Necesitaba dos tablets.

The on screen keyboard takes a little getting used to if you use Apple products.  I find I can't type as fast using the on screen keyboard as compared to my iPhone and that maybe because of the screen size (it is pretty big). Now let's get down to the pros and cons.PROS:1. Vibrant, large screen.2. Running windows 7 which I think is a decent OS.3. Lots of additional ports (usb, hdmi) which many tablets don't offer.4. Hard drive space can be expanded.5. Satisfactory web browsing experience.6. Decent sound quality.CONS:1. Video streaming absolutely sucks.  I tried Netflix and also my dish online and they both buffer on all of the browsers I tried.  Youtube streaming only works well when streaming low res videos anything 720p and above stutters alot.  My other two laptops which are connected to the same wireless access point, stream videos without issue so it is clearly an issue with this tablet and unless I find a solution to this streaming issue it will be going back.  There's no reason why my iPhone can stream video over 3g and this tablet can't stream wired or wireless without bufferring and stuttering literally every 2 seconds.  Playing videos on my dlna network seem to work fine but it's just streaming videos over the web that I'm having a hard time with.2. Compared to other tablets it is quite heavy but I knew that prior to purchasing it based on other reviews I read.3. The dock keyboard design leaves alot to be desired. The screen is heavier than the keyboard and it tips over.  I have a netbook so using this as a laptop was not a requirement for me when I purchased it.I really like the tablet but the video playback issue really has me stumped and I've come across other tablet owners online who are encountering similar issues.  I've tried some of the recommended solutions but nothing seems to be working for me.  If I can't find a viable solution in 30 days I will definitely return it and continue my search for a tablet.

The volume control on the side of the tablet is a WONDERFUL addition and I find it very useful!  The touchscreen is not quite as sensitive as I would like but what can you expect when your using your finger...this is only a problem when you are trying to click a small window or pick small text.The \"Q\" key on my keyboard quit working within a week and I had only hit it like 5 times...this is a disappointment, and I was further disappointed when I tried to RMA it and Amazon told me that all I could get was a refund because they were out of stock.

It isn't a problem when placed on a hard surface but on a soft surface (ie, my lap) it kept tipping over. I also found the eraser-style mouse to be somewhat fickle: at times it wouldn't respond at all no matter how hard I pushed it and at other times it jumped to the right-hand side of the screen. I found a patch on Acer's website to \"fix\" the problem with the jumping cursor but it didn't completely fix it. I online chatted with an Acer rep and their recommendation was to re-install the operating system from the recovery CD because sometimes there was a corrupt driver file for the mouse. After I explained that I didn't have a CD drive to do the re-install from (the W500 doesn't have an internal CD drive so you need to buy an external one) and I wasn't about to buy one to fix their problem they suggested I play around with the driver settings for the mouse -- but wouldn't tell me which setting(s) to try/adjust.Aside from the issues with the product itself I wasn't impressed with the touch layer that sits on top of Windows 7. The virtual keyboard doesn't pop-up when you tap on an input field -- you have to open the keyboard for every field you want to enter something in. There even appeared to be two different keyboards that pop-up depending on what you're doing (one smaller and one larger). It also requires you to be very accurate in where you tap the screen due to the resolution and tiny cursor -- not like other tablets that allow for you to be \"in the vicinity\" of the field/link. Hopefully, Windows 8 will be more tablet friendly now that Microsoft is working with cell phones and the like.So between the issues with the eraser-mouse and Acer's tech support and the not-ready-for-tablets Windows 7 I sent the machine back for a refund.

I was about to return the XCOOM and go back to the Acer Android when I came across this machine.  WOW, just what I was looking for and I read every review.  The main application I tested on each of the big 3 was a product called LogMeIn and Documents to go.  Well, LogMeIn gave me the functionality but it was from my Home computer not the unit itself.  Furthermore if I could not get a good and fast line to the internet, it performed dismally.  Then there was Documents to go...  I was somewhat impressed until I tried to use a moderately complex workbook that had spreadsheets pointing to one another and used auto-filters to a great extent.  I could not even see my data.Then in comes the realization, Jack you need a Windows 7 device so you don't need this stuff and problems.  Further with Windows 7 I am able to use SharePoint so I will always have the latest files available to either my home computer or my Acer W500.  The Keyboard is a real bonus as well.  With the Keyboard, I am saving an additional $110 over the $599 price of the XOOM.  so I bought this here for $449 instead of $709 and expect to have highly superior functionality.This all would be moot if I were just looking for a music and video machine.  Then one of the Big 3 would have sufficed.Thank you for listening and I promise I will write and update to this after I have used my new machine for at least 1 week if not 2.

Unfortunately, the Acer Iconia I received has never held a charge from Day 1. It works plugged in, which is useless for me. Acer's advice was for me to reload the operating system. No time, so no thanks. Back to my old laptop and shopping for something that will work the first time.Also, the tablet is so heavy in comparison to the keyboard that it's constantly unbalanced and unstable. A serious disappointment, and I won't buy an Acer ever again. Customer service was a bad joke, complete with broken English.Update: Turns out it needed a BIOS update, which I only found out after spending hours doing the restore as instructed by Acer's support rep. Regardless, my rating remains the same for this product. Just not impressed at all.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "bugs bugs bugs", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3S24MKZW8ANH3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here is my history with tablets.  I have used Apple's Ipad(original) for the past year.  Liked it as a browsing device, but disappointed that there was no flash support.  I had to download Atomic web browser because Safari would always load websites in mobile form, which I hated.  Then I lost my Ipad on a plane trip and now need another tablet (how convenient you say?).  So I ordered this Acer Windows 7 machine.  I had a chance to try out the Asus Core i5 tablet and loved it, and I hoped that this machine would be a slower, downgrade version of it.  Here is the rundown:Pros:Windows 7 full operating system.Good size, but not too heavy for me.Beautiful screen.Keyboard attachment was nice, with a joystick controller.Cons:Slow Atom processore - I guess the same speed as a netbook would be.Capacitive touch screen was horrible.  had lots of problems with this.  WOuld not respond when touched, and then would respond with random actions without any touching at all.  I know how to use a tablet.  I had an ipad for a year.  I know it takes a little bit to get used to a different operating system's capacitive touch, but this is ridiculous.  The Asus Windows 7 Tablet did not have this problem at all and I played around with that machine for 3 days straight.It would randomly switch my brightness settings for no reason at all.Lots of bugs.Stay away from this machine. I am returting it back to Amazon as it is unusable.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a Tablet", "Author": "Concerned User \"Erratic Moves\"", "ReviewID": "R3U8MEX2IFITAF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This item should not be listed as a tablet.  The best description should be a netbook with detachable touch screen.  The tablet is the slowest loading solid state drive I have ever seen.  Window 7 is not designed for touch screen use it takes a double punch to activate most icons on the screen.  Sure you can change the program, but who wants to go to the trouble, and who wants to delete the boatware, and update the system just to make it run with some speed.  The internet access was so slow it would timeout trying to load apps such as Kindle.  This product weighs 3.48 pounds with the keyboard.If you want a tablet to do what a tablet was designed to do, do not waste your money on this product.  If you want a bulky, heavy, slow, netbook than be my guest.For the reviewers that say this tablet is 5 star, did you ask yourself why does the price keep dropping, and why doesn't Best Buy, or any of the other major retailers offer this tablet.  They offer the Acer A500, but not the W500 because once you pick it up you know it's not very portable, and it is the slowest operating tablet on the market.I will give Amazon a five star rating on the return of the product.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tablet is Great Amazon is less so!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3H3UZBQV93FAA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Okay the tablet is great although it REALLY needs at least a 64GB drive after loading office and a few of essentials on it, I have on 6GB of space left.  This is not a good thing.  It could also use more ram, but a larger faster harddrive would make all the difference.Now my biggest complaint is with Amazon.  I ordered this last Friday 7 Oct 2011 and received it on Monday, 10 Oct 2011.  I go back today to do the review and find the price has gone down $50 dollars.  I have requested a refund of the $50 since it was only a week since I order it and I have not even had it 5 full days yet.  I will change my review if they give me the $50 back.  I would very carefully check around for prices before buying anything from Amazon again.  If they do not refund the money, I will never do business with or through them again and I have done quite a bit of business with and through them!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004SBI2PW"}}
