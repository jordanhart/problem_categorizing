{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A leap in the right direction", "Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "RRSI97OZTY5K7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.First the good sides:This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.The not so good sides:As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.As a laptop replacement:The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "R2HWNDE1DXN1V6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The main difference between this item, and the wi-fi only version, is of course the sim card with 3G.  So, before I talk about the iPad in general, I'd like to explain my take on the 3G.3G Performance:The BOTTOM LINE:  Works good as long as you aren't using it in a moving car.  I ran an internet speed test on it and in the metro area it was 1.2Mbps down and 210kbps up, which is decent.The DETAILS: If you are doing basic computing, you will be able to be anywhere within a 3G service area to enjoy the internet.  (If 3g service sucks in your area, don't buy an iPad 3g)  Here is the only problem: when you pass from tower to tower the signal can hang as the data has to be rerouted to the new tower.  Lets put this another way.  If you are using the iPad netflix app to stream \"Kim Possible season 3\" videos to your iPad while driving at 60 MPH it will \"hang\" during the 22 minute show.  In summary: The AT&T; 3G works the same as my 3G expresscard from Verizon.2G Performance: Yes, you can use your iPad on AT&T;'s 2G EDGE network as needed.  The data is slow.  You won't enjoy it.3G setup:3G setup is simple:- press settings button, choose cellular data, press set up cellular service.- put in your *iTunes* password.  (AT&T; is \"invisible\" except for a logo.)- put your credit card into the iPad- voila! you have service for 30 daysIts very slick and takes less than a minute.  Its how it should be.Avoiding the 3G data charges:  If you are an iPhone user, and you have an iPad, you can avoid paying for 2 data plans by swapping sim cards.  Of course, you might miss a few calls while your sim is in the iPad because the iPad doesn't support phone calls.  If you have an older iphone: Older iPhones use large SIM cards and the ipad uses small microSIM cards.  You would have to cut your large sim card down to the microsim size, and put it in your iPad (you will need a needle to pop it out).  You would need to buy a little adapter (sold on the internet) to make your small sim fit back into your iPhone (so, buy the adapter first!)  But this isn't a great long term solution, because, if you want to use the iPad as a GPS in the car you will not be able to use your phone quickly or easily until you switch them back out again.  Here it is on Amazon:  Microsim Adapter for Ipad Iphone4g Convert Micro Sim to Regular Sim AdapterDO YOU WANT THE 3G INTERNET?Despite my little princess being vexed at Kim Possible hanging, the answer is yes.  Certainly, its wonderful to have the 3G access.  Everything about the iPad works better because its a bigger screen, and being able to access the internet (almost) anywhere is very, very useful for me.Now, the question begs to be asked:  why the ipad at all?I have to say I originally joined the legion of pundits who said \"hey, its just a big ipod touch\" and \"it won't replace my laptop\".  Certainly, this has to be the two most common things you hear people say about the ipad, right?  And yes, that can be the truth you choose.iPad vs. Laptop: If your idea is to buy an iPad to replace your laptop, and get an external keyboard, and a docking station, and bla bla bla... then you will be disappointed.  This is a different kind of device, and you can't put a square peg in a round hole.  The iPad is for even more mobile computing than a laptop can provide.  ***A laptop needs a desk.  But the iPad doesn't.***  Thats the point, and if its not compelling for you, then consider carefully before buying an iPad.iPad vs. iPod Touch:  To say its just a big iPod touch is not really fair.  The processor is much more powerful, allowing you to do a LOT MORE.  You also get a big screen.  And the 3g with this version.  So to refuse to upgrade from the ipod Touch is similar to refusing to upgrade from a Kia Rio on the grounds that all other cars do the same thing.But the biggest reason the iPad+3G will work for you, is that after a few weeks with it, you will want learn how to make it work for you.  You will *enjoy* using it and it will be easier to use.  You will say \"how can I change what I do so I can do it on the iPad\" not \"how can the iPad do exactly what I did before\".For an example: here is a day with the iPad.I get up in the morning, and if I'm not being lazy, I get on the treadmill.  I prop the ipad up on the treadmill while I walk.  I watch some news video on the iPad, read some email, play a game, catch up on facebook.  I'm usually not done with this after my walk, so I head downstairs.  Its like carrying a magazine, its so easy.  I bump into my daughter in the hall and show her a picture from her Grandmother, with the iPad securely held in only one hand.  While I'm eating breakfast, and shaving, and brushing my teeth, I'm catching up on a book I was reading on my wife's Kindle: using the kindle ipad app.  Then I can use the iPad when I leave the house, in a myriad of ways that I would not use my iPod Touch or Laptop.  And the iPad fits in the pocket in my car door.  Its really never in the way!So far I have used the iPad to:1) Watch streaming netflix movies.2) Read books on iBooks and Kindle for iPad, both to myself and to my children.3) Browse the internet without constantly having to use finger motions similar to \"pinch\" and \"peace\" (goodbye iPhone!).4) My kids use it as an interactive coloring book at restaraunts.5) I can control my laptop when I am away from home if something crucial comes up, as if I'm sitting at my laptop.6) Move pictures from my digital camera to the iPad very quickly and easily (using the camera adapter, sold separately).  Either for storage or for emailing.7) Listen to Pandora internet radio anywhere in the house. (ok, I can't really listen to \"Crystal Method thump thump boom boom music\" but most other music sounds good)8) I have used the internet to teach my children things when we are away from the house (Daddy, where does the word \"helicopter\" come from?)9) Watched owned or rented iTunes movies on my 42 inch LCD TV (using an adapter sold separately).The point of the above is that the iPad gives me more FREEDOM when computing, due to its small footprint and light weight.What you can't do on an iPad:1) Multitask.  You don't really need all those windows open, but, we're all used to that.2) Print.3) Use the iPad to connect to a TV and give a presentation.  When you use the HDTV adapter, the iPad screen blacks out so you can only use this for movies.4) See macromedia Flash based content online.  (a lot of websites use this, like Hulu)Steve Jobs says 1 and 2 are coming, in fact, multitasking is on the new iPhone4 so it won't be long.#4 will probably never come.  If you need to use Flash websites, then, stick with our laptop.  End of story.Oh and the battery....  The battery is consistently lasting all day, 12 hours, without a recharge.  But, its important to note that MANY USB ports will not charge an iPad.  None of mine will.  Also, my cheap iPhone car charger will not charge my iPad.  There has been discussion about this lately, apparently the charger or USB port has to actually provide the correct rated power.  Most don't provide enough power.  But the battery lasts all day for me so this is not a negative.If the reasons above don't help you make up your mind, consider Steve Wozniak's recent comments about the iPad:  \"Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.\"  No viruses.  No compatibity issues.  No wondering why your iPad is so slow (Apple vets all software to make sure this doesn't happen).  No questionable upgrades.  No cryptic errors.  All these things were things that took the joy out of computing for a lot of people.The iPad is such a simple thing.  And thats why the average person will love it and prefer to use it instead of a computer.I'll upgrade this to 5 stars if/when:1) More powerful iPad apps come out2) Multitasking 2 things at once is possible (at least web browser and word processing, or pandora internet radio app + any other app would be nice)3) Some kind of printing would be cool, although, I'm ok with paperless, really...There you have it.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch!", "Author": "Scott Showalter", "ReviewID": "R16U71KO7POLA2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a \"Kindle killer\" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term \"baby\" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an \"oleophobic\" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1\" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13\" or 15\" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring \"folders\" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a \"netbook killer\" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or \"Kindle killer\" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app \"iBooks\" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite \"iWork\" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term \"multi-touch\". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called \"Camera A\" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the \"Camera B\" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its \"getting something done\" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called \"iWork\", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled \"productivity\" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of \"apps for that\". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Comparison Between Kindle and Apple iPad", "Author": "The Big Guy \"Super Paratrooper\"", "ReviewID": "RHP63UO3B80A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Want the long and the short of it without having to read a \"mega review\"? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far:VERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category.DISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins.PAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down.CONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner.PRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain.AVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time.SEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book.MY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there.I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Video Review: 3G iPad", "Author": "D.

I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Yes, You Will Want 3G", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R1CNZN63V4P0SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 2 iPads. A 64 GB WiFi only model which I bought the day it was available, and this 32GB 3G model which I picked up last week. They are about the same price; if you have to choose between an extra 32GB of storage and 3G capacity, definitely go with the 3G if for nothing else future proofing. I consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 iPad variants.Right now, my wife is in China with a WiFi only model. She is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open WiFi hotspot. So, she goes days between checking her e-mail. E-mail which might be critical to her business. If she had a 3G model, I could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from Chinese Unicom, modified a data SIM to a micro-SIM, and she would be getting her e-mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing.  On the other hand, her iPad is loaded with media with over a dozen DVD quality films, all her music, and a large number of family photos. This does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole Internet.3G is not quite the great deal as it was yesterday, AT&T; is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. In the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $30/month with no contract. Now you can get a $25/month deal for 2GB, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video.  Existing $30/month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal.  There are also cheaper smaller plans. Right now I'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. I have been Skyping to my wife in China, using Google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. It is very slick. I tried the 250 MB/month plan and that was just too small for what I was doing.As for the rest of the iPad, it is great. I downloaded a free novel from the iBooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. It's my preferred device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of Flash. It's mostly ads though so that's fine, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. Over time, I expect this will be less of a problem as Flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now.The glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. Typing is surprisingly OK, I can type about as fast as I normally can if I concentrate. My kids like watching YouTube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. So, I find I use the iPad several hours a day, which means I can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iPhone charged.This is indeed a game changing device, and I think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hated it until I bought one", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R3PEH4660T41H0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS.Last spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.Then last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.Then last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.So when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this \"first ever tablet device\" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity.But no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an \"outdated\" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...So I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.But I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.But I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.But I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second \"main\" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.So I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.So two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.Unboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.The drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.Weather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.The last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the \"you can't do this and that at once\" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.So I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.The keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.Screen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some \"non fingerprint coating\" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.Screen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.So then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.That's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was \"restore?\"  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.Playing with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).I grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.So I went from the initial \"What a useless piece of junk\" detractor to the \"I wouldn't live without it\" supporter.I gave them all sorts of grief for using the term \"magical\" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...  All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.And with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...So for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a bit of a toy.", "Author": "Jack Showers \"attorney, developer\"", "ReviewID": "R2LNAMQ0YWMPFD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a WiFi, non-3G version, the cheapest one; I don't need GPS and don't want to pay AT&T; any more than I absolutely have to, and don't want another monthly subscription, either.  Got plenty of those, it seems.  And, at least for now, I don't need all that storage.I'm not what one would consider a \"Power User\" of the iPad.  I use a laptop constantly, and bought the iPad a couple of months ago because it is great looking and I was curious about it and I got a case of The Wants.  I've been involved with computers since the mid-60's when I first was employed as an IBM 360 (and 1401 before that) programmer, and I've continued messing with them pretty heavily ever since, though I changed careers in the early 70's.  Over the years, I've owned (in a small business) maybe 40 or 50 desktops and laptops, including several Apple IIe's way back when.  I've always liked Apple products, but not used them due to the overwhelming prominence of DOS and Windows products (both software and hardware) and the excellent pricing of IBM clones.But when the iPad came out, I couldn't help myself.  I now pick it up several times a day and use it.  I've taken it on trips without a laptop.  Here's what I think, mostly.Pros:1. It's cool.  No avoiding it, the little fella is great looking and has that Apple minimalist approach to design that they do so well.2. It's tiny.  Well, small, anyway.  That's good and maybe bad, but it does have its appeal.3. Screen resolution seems creamy, silky smooth.  Don't know how they did it, and don't really care.  It's good.4. I love Apple's approach to WiFi....  Walking into a new place, without even the slightest thought from  you, the iPad finds an open connection and asks if you want to connect to it.  If you say yes, you never hear from it again.  Done.  If the proper connection needs a WPA code or such, it simply asks for it.  No fuss.  (It seems like Windows, which I use for hours every day and have since it came out, has never really felt comfortable with wireless networking).5. No keyboard.  Well, face it, most of the time you don't use one, anyway.  Not having it is OK.  No mouse, either, for that matter.  Good.6. Scrolling is a dream.  Fabulous.  Effortless.  Scrolling, something that simple, is probably the single thing this little unit does best.  You have to try it to understand it.7. One of my apps (I don't have many) is a flight simulator similar to MS Flight Simulator.... X-Plane.  It allows pilots to practice instrument flying, so I got it.  VERY cool.  No joystick foolishness.  You must rotate the iPad itself like you would a yoke and the airplane turns or climbs or descends, or whatever.  Way easier than Windows products to do the same thing.8. Pilot friends who use other apps for charts and such love it, so I would guess that all graphics applications work pretty well on the little system, though I haven't tried.  Oh, yeah, Google Maps and Earth and such look great, too.  Apple always has done graphics well, so no real surprise.9. Ditto for video.10. Battery life is great.  Days on end at my level of usage.11. My Blackberry has a cute feature (maybe everyone has it, now):  When typing an email address or URL, when one presses the space bar, the OS converts it to a @ or a period, whichever is appropriate.  The iPad takes that to another level....  There is a \".com\" key that enters that when pressed.  A small thing, but more helpful than one might think on a device where typing ain't as easy as using an IBM keyboard.Cons:1.  It's hard to hold and easy to drop.  Needs a shell or something to protect it; that makes it as big as a netbook or small laptop, anyway.2. Can't keep several \"windows\" open at the same time to switch back and forth.  Not a horrible issue, because you can get back to a previous window relatively easily, but sometimes you'd like to have both open at the same time or be able to switch with a single click.  If there's a way to do that I haven't found it.3. Hotmail and Gmail don't work like they do on a laptop.  Or on a Blackberry Storm2, for that matter.  I don't know the issue, but I can't seem to find a way to send a new email (though it's easy enough to reply).  I'm sure there is some app or setting to fix it, but I really don't want to be troubled with that.  I just want it to work.  Like the way WiFi does.  (Since I wrote this, I actually went into the email setup and set it up; it works, but I would prefer to use Hotmail and Gmail as pure web based apps rather than something more akin to a cell phone feature, which, of course, it is).4. You can't print from it. I've read that there is a wireless printing feature in the next OS.  Waiting to see.5. When working with it in your lap, either in a chair or a recliner or bed, a laptop is just more well suited for the job.  The iPad has to be held up, and, the screen is lower, so you are craning your neck more.  I don't use a stand to put it in.  Things like that and the case to put it in detract from the advantage of small size, so you might as well use a small laptop which will make you happier in the long run for this sort of thing.6. No keyboard.  And don't tell me they make a keyboard for it.  If I have to buy that, I might as well get a laptop.  Typing on the screen is a trip.  If you use the virtual keyboard holding the iPad in the \"landscape\" position the keyboard is large, and a little awkward to span the keys with your thumb.  So, you end  up turning the iPad up to the \"portrait\" position where the keyboard is better suited to thumb-typing.  I haven't tried typing in the traditional way (\"touch typing\")....  I just reach for the laptop.  I'm using my Lenovo to type this review.7. OK, here we go....  No Flash.  Now, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I don't understand this.  Every now and then (pretty often, actually) some video will come up and the iPad will tell me that it doesn't do Flash. (Happens frequently on sports and news sites). I never even knew what Flash was before this issue came up.  Well, Apple wants me to go to iTunes to download their app that will let you view Flash files.  OK, y'all, why didn't you just put it in the iPad from the get-go?  I just want it to work.  Yesterday, I wanted to watch a video of a Tropical Storm in the Caribbean, so I clicked on the link to go get Apple's app.  Then I had to cycle through a few pages on iTunes.  Heck with it.  I just used the laptop (which has a larger screen, anyway).  There's a saying: \"People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes. \"So, what's the upshot?I like it.  I'd buy it again.  No, I wouldn't wait for the Android competitors to come out.  Well, I am curious about those and might get one of them, too, just to check it out.  But, the WiFi-only iPad is a nice, polite little computer.I do want to say this, and it's one of those potentially inflammatory things, but I don't mean it like that....  It's more of a toy than a tool.  If I am really in need getting things done....  Spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc, it's really hard to beat the tried and true Windows laptops that are available everywhere and are dirt cheap and fit in with the way things are done and the formats that are used throughout the business community.So, sure I use it.  This morning (a Sunday) I've been using it....  looking at airplanes for sale (daydreaming) and checking out a few football forums and generally surfing the web.  So, if this review seems a bit too negative, that's not really intended.  I like it.That said, a would-be buyer needs to understand what it is that he is getting, and what that is, is something of a media machine that requires you conform to Apple's way of doing things, a very good little web surfboard and a pretty neat little toy.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "People Who Actually Use iPads Tend to Like Them - A Lot", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R1CQWBNZ65EW9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone.[Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it \"used too much power.\" The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]In my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.This is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer.You have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)The speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything.Video playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.Third party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever.As for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).Be careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.It goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.As for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h.264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.If you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.This is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.If I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.I don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.In summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fast, Gorgeous, but Heavy", "Author": "Daniel G.

With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone.Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate.Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view.Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size.Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected.The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right.I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device.I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen.Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading.Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books.But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach).And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad - great tablet with annoying flaws in its major tasks", "Author": "Axemal", "ReviewID": "R1FRG41M4KZPQZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using iPad for 10 days and decided to walk away. It is a nice tablet device that I primarily was planning to use as:  - ebook reader while using public transportation  - showing movies to kids during vacation trips  - using as picture hub on vacations to store/review/sort photos  - browser (one that I can use on the sofa)  - generic computer for vacations and travel (way lighter than notebook)  - viewing and occasionally answering email at home when primary iMac is occupied.Usually Apple devices are aesthetically pleasant to work with. iPad is not an exception, unless you are outside. The device is great for reading at home in controlled light (though a bit harder on the eyes comparing to e-ink readers), but outside (on a train/bus) it has serios glare and reflections on the screen even without direct sunlight. It felt annoying. I guess after months of use one gets used to it, but in a few days I haven't started enjoying reading with it. I wonder if matte screen would have done better.As far as watching movies, its mono speaker lacks power. I guess I'm not a typical user here as I got two kids, so headphones aren't an option. Getting its speakers up to the iMac level would be excellent. I realize that it's hard to fit on a way smaller device, but a little bit better speakers would actually let two persons watch movie together. Again, glare and reflection of yourself on dark scenes are guaranteed in pretty much every lighting condition. Some people don't bother about it; some people do, so see for yourself.Having SD port would be great to transfer photos from my camera. I don't really want to mess with extra cords here.Overall, it's been a pity to see device coming short of expectations.  I'll wait for 2nd version, and would love to see better screen, better speakers and SD port there. And a camera would let me Skype. I don't care much about flash or multi-tasking.Apple, please, do something about the glare/reflections. These \"great\" glossy screens aren't that great for some of us, I do have mirror at home already. That stands for both iPad and iMac. Old white iMacs had way better matte screens than current glossy ones.

Yes, the display is absolutely gorgeous with its intense colors and sharp graphics.  Yes, it is sleek and easy to slip into a briefcase.  Yes, video and photos cannot look any better on a portable device.  But . . . .The iPad is dependent in part on apps that you can purchase in the iTunes store; however, many of those apps are either incompatible with the iPad (showing up on the tablet in iPhone screen size) or cost money.  There just aren't many free iPad apps the way there are with the iPhone.  The apps that do exist, whether for a price or free, just don't add much to the iPad's functionality.While the touchscreen keyboard is much easier to use than that of its cousin the iPhone (because of its larger size), it's not built for typing more than a few quick emails or notes.  Plus, if you use Word on your main computer, you can't install it on the iPad the way you can on a netbook.  You're stuck with Apple's note program or a separate productivity app purchased from the App Store.  As far I can tell, the only way to share notes is to email them.  You cannot edit an existing document.As an e-reader, it doesn't compare to the more portable, more book-like, lighter-weight Kindle 2, except in the case of books that have color photos and/or animated graphics.  It may compete well with the larger Kindle DX, although I don't have one of those to compare.  To download books, you have to be on a wireless network, unlike the Kindle, which uses free Whispernet for downloads. (Note: the iPad with 3G can download anywhere if you pay for monthly 3G service.) When I read on the iPad, it feels more like a computer than a book; the Kindle feels more like a book.The iPad does not have a camera, either still or video.  It does have a microphone for voice memos.  Its speakers are much better than those of the iPhone 4; you can start up the iPod and put the iPad on a table to listen while you do other things.  Still, I have a computer and separate iPod players in the areas of the house; music coming through real speakers sounds so much better.  I do like that I can play music while using other apps, just the way I can on all versions of the iPhone.  Its the only example of multitasking on the iPad.I'm leaving this iPad for my husband to use.  I'll get another when Apple releases a version that has a camera and FaceTime; when it can share and edit files; when more (useful) free apps are available; when it allows multiple open window/apps the way the Mac OS does -- in short, when it successfully replaces one or more of my other devices.The iPad has tremendous potential that isn't yet realized, but it is a fun toy to play around with.  As to whether you should purchase this wireless version or the 3G, consider how you would use this and whether you want to pay for 3G service.  You can tether your later model iPhone; however, that's an additional fee from ATT as well.  I recommend the iPad for tech geeks who have to own the newest toys -- and as toys go, this is great.  For the rest of you, hold off for a generation or two until Apple begins to fully utilize the power of this slender tablet.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "IPAD DEFECTIVE AND APPLE CHARGING RESTOCKING FEE", "Author": "Keith T.

Nicholson", "ReviewID": "R3HMPXJPGWR4UI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Addendum Dec. 13th 2010...Comments on new IOS operating sys. for IPadThe Big Three improvements:1.) Multitasking...you can't do split screens BUT you can close one operation (or several if you wish), open another and then go back to the original(s) and open it/them to the same page you were working on.  VERY convenient!2.) Folders...great to organize different categories of apps and will allow you to reduce IPad screen clutter of the huge number of apps that most of us will collect over time.3.) Mobile-me. This is now a FREE feature of IPad with the new Operating System...use to be a paid yearly subscription ($99/year). With this you can find your lost IPad on your home PC or Mac, and once Mobile-me is alerted, your IPad will beep in about 15-20 minutes. It will even allow you to REMOTELY WIPE YOUR IPAD MEMORY, so sensitive info can be deleted, if needed!There are several other 'improvements', most of which don't concern me as much as the 3 mentioned above.My original review...Some thoughts after having used my Ipad 64 for about 1 month.Some (but by no mean all) of the things I appreciate:1.) the large, high resolution, touch screen on an extremely thin idevice.2.) the CONVENIENCE...all because of the portability and the ability to connect ANYWHERE to the internet, locally with WiFi or globally with G3. Allowing me to travel and yet do all the things I'd normally do at home. i.e. check e-mail, pay bills and surf.3a.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy with an Itunes account to buy apps, music, videos, books, movies etc.3b.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy to copy, back-up and sync your Ipad with your computer at home...for example, allowing you the make copies of everything you buy from Itunes and even books etc. you may buy from Ibooks or Kindle...this means that if you've finished your book or don't need an App any more, you can delete it from your IPad, but it's still available to you on your computer if you should need to reinstall it again to your IPad.  You can also copy all bookmarks from your pc/mac to the IPad Safari browser as well as e-mail addresses from your computer to your IPad (even if you use a hotmail account).4.) the ease with which I was able to sync my Apple wireless Keyboard via the bluetooth available on the IPad...done in less than 1 minute.5.) the ability to adjust the font size (so you won't even need your reading glasses) and brightness when reading books, ESPECIALLY the option of 'white on black' screen for night-time reading (never realized how comfortable on the eyes this would make reading in a darkened area)6.) Google maps...just incredible with G3 service...Be prepared to say good-bye to your GPS if your IPad has G3.Lost?...Touch the 'current location' button at the top of your Google map App, and you get a satellite map of where you are, with your exact location marked with a red pin.Want directions from point 'A' to point 'B'...just type in your destinations.Want a restaurant, library, hospital etc. in the area your in, just type your request in the 'search' window and you'll find your inquiries marked with red pins on your map.And it gets better...say you asked for restaurants in an area, touching any individual red pin you got in the reply to your search gives you the name, address, phone No. and (if available) e-mail address plus directions to get there from your current location. AND it allows you to save this information (if you want) in your list of contacts, with a simple touch of the screen.7.) Audio...although the built-in speaker is mono, the headphone jack gives exceptional quality stereo sound.8.) About 10 hours of battery time on a full charge.9.) The ability to expand the size of anything your reading by simply spreading apart two fingers while touching the screen.What's missing:1.) no USB Port...maybe not as important as I'd initially thought, what with bluetooth available...may mean some additional purchase for such things as a wireless  mouse, keyboard, printer etc.2.) no multitasking...The one MAJOR shortcoming of the IPad...you can't open a split screen to work on, and as everyone who has used a computer is aware, this is a very useful, time-saving feature. But you know, with all that this unit offers in the way of quality and convenience, I can live with this one deficiency.Conclusion:More useful...more an indispensable part of my life than I'd ever have believed possible.The large screen along with its thin profile makes it the ideal traveling idevice.Because of no multitasking...4 3/4 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.1.) I purchased the 64 Gb edition of Ipad because I figured that Apps would fill it quickly...well this may eventually happen, but with nearly 3 screens of Apps, so far I've used less than 2 Gb of space2.)

I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!Obviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10\" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?After owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on \"HD\" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a \"gamer\" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the \"magical\" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other \"killer app.\"  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called \"Atomic Web.\"  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13\".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The \"acase\" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "I use it every day...", "Author": "Jodi Sweet", "ReviewID": "RHHH06N6YWDSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first wanted the iPad everyone I knew said the same thing, \"Isn't it really just a bigger iPhone?\"  Well, no but, at the same time, yes.  That was perfect for me.  Each time I used my iPhone I thought, \"I wish this was bigger so I could do more.\"  Much like any time that I used my Kindle and would think, \"If only the web interface was better and this was in color.  If only it was faster.\"  The iPad filled all of those needs.My Kindle was sold on eBay with in days of the iPad's arrival.  My laptop suddenly spent days sitting idle and untouched as my iPad took its place as my primary mode of web browsing.  Magazine subscriptions were halted as I waited patiently for iPad versions.  I could not be happier with publications like Vanity Fair and the New Yorker.I did buy a case and the Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad.  I found that these items added to the functionality and enabled me to get even more from the iPad.  I chose the option with 3G because, so often, when I had my Kindle and iPhone out in the world, I took advantage of the Internet access.  I did not want to have to rely on the existence of free or pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi.Here's a quick run-down of my impressions and how I rate each user experience.+ Web browsing - 5 starsIt is wonderful to be able to sit back and read a long article without craning my neck to look at the monitor.  The only downside is that I now spend a lot more time browsing the web than my pre-iPad self did.+Reading eBooks - 5 starsI have owned a Kindle and a Sony Reader.  While I understand the benefits of e-ink, I have to say that they are a bit overstated.  Yes, it is nice not to consume so little power and not have to deal with a back-lit screen to some extent.  However, unlike my laptop or computer monitor, the iPad screen does not bother my eyes even after prolonged periods of reading.  Also, it is terrific to be free from an external lighting source on airplanes or in bed.  With the e-ink devices, I often felt that the glare from any of the booklights I tried was distracting and difficult on my eyes.  I do not have that problem with the iPad.  All of my Kindle books are just as enjoyable on the Kindle for iPad app.  It's easy to use and the highlighting and dictionary features are even more useful without having to use the clumsy interface to navigate the Kindle screen.+Outdoor use - 3 starsThe screen is much tougher to see outdoors.  It's almost unusable in many cases.  Since I wear polarized sunglasses, I have to turn the screen to horizontally to even see it.  If I have them on and have the screen in portrait mode, it is totally black.  This is not a big problem for me since I don't really take an eBooks to the beach and rarely find myself in full sunlight wishing I could search the web.  It is fine in even slight shade so sidewalk cafes are still an option.+Business use - 5 starsThe calendar and contacts on the iPad are much more useful to me than those on the iPhone.  Having a larger screen makes the calendar feature much easier to use if you are navigating a day full of appointments.  I was awestruck when I first opened it after years of trying to get by with a Blackberry or an iPhone.  I also downloaded an app that allows me to store and read PDFs.  This was inexpensive and made keeping track of everything from whitepapers to meeting notes much easier.  I am anti-paper and this device really allowed me to put away all of my paper notebooks and avoid printing for weeks at a time.  I also have two mind map applications that are excellent for brainstorming and developing the top-level outline for a new project.+Movies (Netflix) - 5 starsThe clarity is amazing - even when I am on the 3G network.  I've also downloaded videos from the iTunes store and they are just as perfect.

Once it was released I went to the Apple store and played with it, like so many other people, and I walked away still liking it.  I figured I would play with it and walk away thinking that it wasn't worth the money or didn't work the way I wanted it to.  I was wrong.  I found myself looking up reviews just about everyday seeing what other people thought about it and finally happened to be in a store when they had some in stock and I took the plunge.  Was I nervous?  Yes.  Was I afraid that it would just be a toy and that was it?  Yes.  Was I scared about the price?  Yes.  However, I typically feel that way before any large electronics purchase.What I have found in the month I've owned my iPad is that I carry it with me all over the house.  If I'm reading something on the internet and need to go in the other room....I take my iPad.  A lot of people have been bashing the iPad without every really using one and I can honestly say that it has changed how I consume entertainment.  It's not a replacement for a laptop or netbook, though it certainly could replace a lot of things that you use them for, but it is its own \"thing\".  When it really clicked for me was about a week ago.  It was a lazy Saturday afternoon and I was home by myself.  I was using the Netflix app to catch up on a show that I had missed a few episodes of and I started out watching it on the couch.  Soon I carried my iPad into the kitchen with me to make lunch.  Then went outside and sat on the deck.  I even took it into the bathroom with me....never having to stop watching the show.  The iPad haters out there would say that they could do the same thing with their laptop, but the iPad battery is so great that it gave me true freedom to move about the house without worrying about wires, batteries or anything else.  This is the true value of the iPad to me.  I can consume entertainment/information anywhere in the house instead of having to stay in one place.  Before I would either go to the office or sit on the couch to browse the internet with the laptop.  That way I had a power cord nearby.  With a 10 hour battery, I don't worry about that anymore.Now, will it replace my need for a laptop?  No.  There are things I still need to do that will require more storage or programs that cannot be done on the iPad.  However, I'm okay with that.  If you are someone that spends a lot of time on your computer looking up things on the internet or watching movies or just wasting time.  You will be amazed at the freedom you feel with the iPad.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "IPAD...JACK OF ALL TRADES, BUT MASTER OF NONE!!", "Author": "S. Dorsey \"totalartist\"", "ReviewID": "RZXM2GE48KAP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is from the point of view of someone who already owns a Kindle E-book reader, a Sony PSP handheld video game device, an Ipod Classic, an Ipod Touch, an Ipod Nano, a Blackberry Storm cellphone and an HP mini Netbook.  I have all of the toys anyone out there wants, but I had to make a decision whether to pay a hefty price tag for the Ipad, something that does a lot of what those other devices can do.I chose to buy the Ipad for this reason...it is the best \"all in one\" device out there on the market.  Unless I want to carry around all the other stuff, it is a better idea to carry just the Ipad and my cellphone instead.  With my netbook, I had to have somewhere to plug it in, with only two hours of battery life, it just was not  easy to start it up and keep it going.  The Ipad has a 10 hour battery life (that is no exaggeration), and it is much quicker to start up than a netbook or laptop.  Instead of carrying around the Sony PSP, I can download fun games onto the Ipad and kill time that way.  Instead of carrying around the Kindle, I can load my E-books on the Ipad and read them on there.  This is a device that you can play games on, type a document, surf the internet, read a book, watch videos and play music ALL ON ONE DEVICE.  That is why I made the purchase. I purchased the 64GB wifi model.While the Ipad is no expert at doing any one thing, it does them all to satisfaction (or better).  If you are a person who just wants a device to read books, this is not for you.  You might as well just buy the Kindle.  If you are just looking to type on this, it is not the device for you, you are better off with a netbook or laptop.  But if you are looking for an all-in-one device that is easy to start up, and has a long battery life, no cords hanging around to be plugged into a wall,...this is it.The only thing the Ipad does not do, is snap pictures and make phone calls.  With just my Ipad and my cellphone, I can do it all...play video games, play music, play videos, read books, view photos, surf the internet, snap pictures (my phone) and more...  I don't usually have a wifi connection in my area, but I have a portable hotspot anyway ($45/month through Clear...unlimited bandwidth), and I have the internet on my cellphone, so that's not a big deal to me, but it may be to you.  If you are relying on the internet a lot, a wifi only device is not the thing for you.  Wifi is not accessible in some areas.  You aren't ever sure you will be able to connect.  But, they now make a 3G model Ipad, where you can subscribe to a monthly service ($15/month I think) for internet access anytime,and almost anywhere (limited bandwidth though).  Again, I have internet on my cellphone, so it was not a big deal to me.  If you are relying on heavy internet usage with the device, this is not great, just good in that area, because it will cost you.When you see the Ipad, you appreciate the light weight, the beautuful screen, ease of use, super fast start-up, long battery life and how many things you can do with it.  I prefer to also have the other devices too, so that when I want something that is an expert in any one area, I can still use it.  But, if you want to conserve space in your bag when you travel, and you want to keep it simple...you have all you need.  I recommend the Ipad with a screen protector such as invisishield, and the apple carrying case.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "J.

It has gone through a full day workout with my kids (who are enthralled by it) and a full day of work as an itinerant professional in the public schools, using apps that I had purchased for my iPod Touch and using the Netflix app. It has been used as a remote desktop for work; a note taking device; a book reader; a word processing device; and a music player. The only thing it has not yet been used for is games. Movies look impressive on Netflix. As a remote desktop, it runs fairly zippy on a local network, but a tad slow over the Internet. All of my iPod Touch apps run fast, although half of them look somewhat granular in 2X mode. Pages runs really well and opens all of my templates. Someone had commented that it messes up formatting when transferring between files, although this has not been the case with me. Regarding weight, it is lighter than I thought. I can easily whip it out of my carrying case and jot a quick note in the hall. The wifi reception rivals my MacBook. I have yet to drain the battery to check battery life.

I have all the latest gadgets as soon as they come out but actually waited on the iPad a bit since I really thought it was just a big iPod Touch. Well... it kinda is but it's not. It is basically the same software but modified for the much larger screen and much higher resolution. This really is a big deal and changes the way you use it. If you think you're just getting a big iPod Touch, you're right -- but not really and once you use it for a few days you'll completely understand what I mean. It's really amazing how quickly you get used to it, instant on is a given now days, but the 10-hour plus battery life is a bigger benefit than you might realize. The system is very responsive and there is a ton (that's an understatement) of apps available. Sorry to the Android crowd but you really don't want to use the iPad, it will make you feel very very insecure -- at least until Google gets a tablet version of Android out.Right now there isn't anything better in this form factor than the iPad. If you're looking to get a tablet don't get caught up in stats, they mean nothing if the software isn't good -- and right now only the iPad has software that was built from the ground up to work with it and that advantage is huge. Out of the non-critical computer / gadget related items in my house, I use this by far the most.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R1INL21NUOOKQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry guys but after reading review after review of people bashing the iPad and having never actually owned or used one I had to write this. First off would I be considered a \"Apple Fanboy\"? Well I guess if you consider the definition of the term I will say yes and I guess proud to be one. But I am going to give you the good the bad and the ugly without bashing the product.The Good:1. This is a tablet device that is easy to carry when you don't need the full power of a PC/Mac.2. The instant I saw this I Knew in that it had it uses in my field of work. I am a electronics tech contractor for the military and I work on equipment on trucks all day outside. If I tried to use a netbook( Which I have tried) to do the task of inventory and maintenance tracking while in the field the netbook would be trash in no time. This said the iPad isnt indestructible. If you use it like I do outside in a field environment buy the Defender series case from OtterBox, It is super tough and has a hard cover for the screen when its not being used.3. The apps are dirt cheap for the thing. I paid 9bucks for Apple Numbers (Spreadsheet app similar to Excel). That is way cheap for a functional spreadsheet app.4. I can use this for entertainment while traveling, which I do a ton of, without having to drag my laptop out of a bag and finding a place where the dust isn't going to gum up my keyboard.The Bad:1. If you want a full fledged laptop this isn't it. It is a complementary device to the laptop.2. In order to take full advantage of the iPad you need a laptop or desktop to sync it with. You don't have to have it but your not going to be getting many movies or much music on it otherwise.3. People will bash you for using the Apple brand of devices...but only because they are jealous or ignorant. Not because they actually use them and know their strengths and weaknesses. There is a misconception that if you use it your a tree hugging yuppy or something...which I am not.4. More cords and adapters to carry if you already lug a laptop around.5. They are not cheap.The Ugly:1. As soon as you decide to buy the iPad, know that next year Apple will come out with a better  and fancier product. They update products on a yearly cycle.2. Along with #1 that also means that when the newer iPad comes out that there will be functions you wont have and cant get without dropping more cash for a new one. You can only upgrade the software not the hardware.3. For those of you that like Flash games like Farmville, your SOL, the iPad does not support flash. Sorry.Thats my short OPINION on the iPad. My closing thought are this, if you are looking for a simple device to get on the internet and do light duty work while away from the desktop/laptop then it MIGHT be for you. Also if you like diving off in folders and exploring the guts of the operating system then I suggest looking elsewhere. Apple makes products that a non tech savvy person can pick up and fell comfortable using. Heck even my wife, who hates computers, would kill me over her iPhone. Lastly if your not sure whether it is right for you, find someone that has one, go to a Apple store give it a spin and do some research online into whether it has what your looking for.

I understand why people might say it is a glorified iphone, but let me tell you - the screen size is critical and all of the cool apps that are available have opened up a whole world of, well, everything. Some of the most helpful things:- Internet access on the go (Yes - GET 3G if you you are going to get this!!). I can cull email, order something I need to buy online, look up information I need (addresses, phone numbers, directions), and just read something interesting on a nice, readable screen.- Entertainment for my kids on the go. There are lots of cool apps for kids and it has saved me from some really otherwise difficult situations with active boys (doctor's waiting room for 45 minutes...). They have read-along books and lots of educational options, so its not just brain candy stuff, either.- There is a kindle app, so it can do everything a kindle book reader can. I LOVE being able to read a book on my iPad and highlight it digitally.- It is small enough that I can carry it around the house with me from room to room and use the notepad feature to make notes of things that would otherwise end up on scraps of paper littered around the house.It has greatly enhanced my quality of life and now that I am accustomed to a computer I can carry in my purse, I cannot imagine not having one.

My impressions of it are mostly positive; my two main gripes about it are these:1. On my Android phone, if I buy an app from the marketplace, I have 24 hours to try it out and decide whether I like it. As far as I can tell, there's no such feature on the iPad. So if you buy something and it really sucks, oh well. There's no trial period or anything for these apps. I don't recall this being mentioned in any of the reviews I read, but I think this is pretty important. I guess reviewers think anybody who's interested in an iPad already has an iPhone, so this would've been common knowledge to that audience.2. iTunes is just a huge PITA. I downloaded and installed a fresh copy of iTunes on my PC, hooked the iPad up via USB, and it promptly deleted all the books and apps I had on the iPad without so much as a warning. After that, when I set up iTunes on my dad's PC, it complained that the iPad could only sync with one iTunes library (presumably because I had already synced it on mine), and wanted to erase everything that was on the iPad. At least it warned me this time, but if you plan to sync the iPad with two different computers, you're going to have to jump through some hoops.Overall, it seems to be a very scaled down Android device, but that's ok, since this thing isn't really targeted at people who would ever know the difference anyway. Plus, there's a better selection of apps here. I probably would've bought one myself if I could find a way around not having to use iTunes to get content from the PC to the iPad. I did some searching to see if you could jailbreak it and just drag and drop stuff onto it without using iTunes, but no such luck.As far as my dad is concerned, he's not a complete computer novice, but not exactly highly skilled either, and he really likes the iPad. I installed the MLB At Bat program, and he can stream the audio from baseball games right on the device while browsing the web. I told him he could watch the games with an MLB.TV subscription, but he likes listening to them more. *shrugs*For those claiming it's just a big iPod Touch, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The size of the iPad makes it hard to carry around, but I can assure you... having a screen that's 3x bigger is a huge plus if you play with an iPod Touch (or similar device) a lot while on your couch :)And those of you who are dissing the iPad because it doesn't have USB/HDMI ports, a camera, or multitasking capabilities are really missing the point. In about 15-20 minutes, I was able to sit down with my dad and show him just about everything there is to know about this device, and now he can download and install his own apps and do whatever else, and he can do it while kicked back in his recliner. And I don't have to worry about him getting viruses and malware, and the ease of use of the iPad is certainly going to cut down on my support calls :) So I guess you could say that him having one of these benefits both of us.

If you expect it to be, you'll only be disappointed. Nor is it just an oversized PDA despite claims to the contrary. Instead, it's a robust adjunct to your main computer. It allows me to take most of my web browsing, game playing, email reading, etc. away from my desk. In large part, whether the iPad suits your needs will depend on whether you can find apps for it that suit your needs. So far there's a wide array of apps, so I haven't found this to be much of a problem--but again, it'll depend on your needs.It's true that there are some things you just can't do on an iPad, like view Flash content on websites. I do find this occasionally annoying, but honestly, I just hope it convinces more websites to stop using so much Flash content. I've always found that it bogs down my machine and causes more problems than it fixes.In contrast, I've found that the apps on my iPad load and run super-fast. They're streamlined to have a small footprint, and it shows. They load so fast that load screen tips in games often flash past before I can read them. They also take up a surprisingly small amount of memory; I'm amazed at how slowly I'm using up my 16G!The on-screen keyboard is actually pretty good, and suits normal finger size much better than that on the tinier iPhone screen, but it still isn't meant for extended typing. I'm also addicted to the touch-screen interface. It feels so natural that I find myself trying to use my laptop as though it had one.Since I do a lot of reading and reviewing, and I absolutely hate the other e-readers I've played with (the screen flash when turning pages would drive me batty before I finished a single book), the iPad's value as an e-reader was important to me. In this, it truly shines. You can download the Barnes & Noble reader and the Kindle reader for free. GoodReader makes a fantastic pdf reader (just import pdfs from the app tab when synching with your computer). iBooks, however, blew me away. As a book geek, I really like the experience of reading a book rather than a computer file. And iBooks looks the most like a book.I'm truly amazed by the screen quality, the speed of everything, the variety of apps available, and the utility of the iPad as an e-reader.

Very easy to type even when using one hand.2) iBooks - Simply fantastic , Hopefully, the catalog will expand massively. I prefer this to the kindle when I am indoors because everything in an iBook is in colour.3) iWorks - Fantastic even though you cannot export to Powerpoint or Excel formats. Only Word is supported. Even the lack of \"Track Changes\" option did not  bother me much.4) Good Battery life5) The ability to import Photos on the go.6) Availability of Netflix App7) You can actually do things efficiently using just an iPad and a internet source.8) Safari for the iPad is a very efficient browser. Obviously, it does not support flash, but then that is price adobe paid for some crime they committed some time back.9) Most of the apps that work on an iTouch/iPhone works on the iPad.10) Does not heat up much after heavy usage.Things that are not available in the iPad when they should have been1) Finder for the iPad2) Network Explorer( so you can drag and drop docs from your other laptops/desktops into your ipad without using iTunes) - I have tonnes of pdf articles/books and other docs in my home server and would have loved to have this functionality)3) Print functionality ( Though this depends on HP , Canon and their ilk)4) bluetooth mouse connectivity5) ability to transfer data (music/files) using the camera connector kit accessory) from a USB drive or SD card drive.6) A Nice Photo Editor( Apple developed).7) I really did not feel the absence of multi tasking, but then I can appreciate controlled multitasking wherein I have control over what apps are allowed to run in the background.Things that are annoying1) iPad is smudge heaven - you dont notice those smudges when it is on, but the moment you press the sleep button/lock screen button , you can see hundreds of smudges.2) The screen is too glossy - I presonally prefer Matte, but we dont have that option anymore.3) Reading in broad daylight when the sun is right over your head is annoying4) Absence of a Finder/Windows Explorer kinda applicationOverall, I feel that there is no show stopper here and that the iPad is actually a good device for the average male/female and for anyone who is not into anything too technical.P.S , I have a verizon mifi and my iPad tethers to the mifi device.

Sure, it's not the first tablet out there, but this year all anyone can talk about is a tablet, what's better, why to get an iPad, why not to get an iPad... I'm not sure when all the Apple hatred started, for me it was a lifelong obsession.  I grew up on DOS, moved to windows 3.11... I hated apple on principle.  I had an epiphany one night as I struggled to use my windows laptop and finally discovered that all those great things a windows based pc can do... I never use! So I switched to apple. My iMac replaced my unrelisble desktop.  My iPhone then replaced my irritating blackberry.  Then my iPod nano replaced my buggy zine (and iTunes replaced the ever changing nightmarish zine software - seriously, the original version was perfection MS, but alas). I had but one problem, my laptop.  I didn't want to do the full on laptop thing, since apple laptops have one of the same problem as all other laptops... Battery life.  For me, my laptop comes out when I travel, or want to window shop in the living room, but otherwise it gets put away in favor of my far superior desktop.  What I wanted was a laptop that I can pick up and go with.  Here is the iPad.  Me and a few friends got iPads, and now we have them all the time.  None of us ever carried around a laptop with us unless we were traveling.  Now, we have them at all times.The question for many is: can it replace my laptop.  The real question should be, can your laptop replace your iPad? I see far more iPad wielding corporate soldiers in the coffee shops now days, snickering at the laptop relic holder that runs in to plug his laptop in, not sure if he put it on sleep or power save mode before he left the house.  No, my iPad can't do more.  It can't play world of Warcraft or command and conquer.  But do you leave the house to do those things... No? Then why do you want your iPad to do it? Sure the iPad has games, but unless your a card game addict, it's only there to keep you busy for about a half hour while you can't do much else. Otherwise, I challenge you to find something I can't do.  Don't bring up flash, it was a sore issue at first, but since I found out either the anti iPad people are lying to me about the need for flash, or I just get lucky, I have found 1, yeah that's right 1 site that I don't get to play with, and it was just doing a search for a homework assignment and I found the site to be bogus on my desktop... Oh well.  HTML 5 is here and it's kicking butt. Flash has been on the edge for almost 4 years as devs looked for better ways to do Internet... And the iPad has ushered the revolution.  To think that this little device changed the Internet...I have complaints.  The first is that I am addicted to this thing.  It goes everywhere with me from the garage (how to vids) to the bathroom (why not watch a little Netflix or YouTube while I... Er... Download).  The second is that it is missing some things. It needs that camera on there.  IPad video chatting should be a next big step.  I want an sd slot for this thing, rather than be forced to shell out extra money for the bigger drive. The last thing I want is a screen lock switch.  It is funny to look at a photo and turn the photo to a different angle to look at something , only to have the screen adjust back to how it was in the first place.The best things... Simplicity, durability, longevity.  This is what makes it so much better than a laptop.  Simplicity makes it lessaggravating than a standard computer. You would be surprised at the durability of this thing (my 5 and 6 year olds play games on it all the time).  But the most significant factor is the longevity.  The advertised 10 hours is a lie.  I have not charged mine in two days, and I use nearly every waking hour.  Movies, airplay, dictation, games, everything... It's at 33% right now.  As a consumer I would have never even thought about an iPad if my laptop could go on batteries this long, I could have dealt with the frustration and blue screens all day long if I had power.  The iPad lasts forever. That is the number one selling point to me.  You will be surprised to see how much you can do if you don't have to plug in all the time.All this being said, if you can afford it... Get it, if you can't, sorry.From my iPad", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Complicated to Review, nice product, depends on the future & Apps", "Author": "BruceK", "ReviewID": "R3UC053Y6SW0S0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my iPad about 2 months after they came out and I had a chance to see it operate at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA.  Surprisingly after having bad experiences with other palm type devices and the Kindle, I found I liked it.For a \"Window to the Internet\" which is the main use I found for it, it works fairly well.  A major problem with the iPad, and a major problem with all computers and the Internet, the WWW, is the display size.  Many web pages are not designed with any kind of logic or order about the screen.  For example, I find the blogs I read to be just slightly too wide to adjust comfortably on my iPad screen so that I do not have to scroll horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling for each line is what needs to be avoided.  It is possible to read things on the iPad just fine, but not if they are in a window that is too wide for the text size.  Ideally a newspaper column width where the text can be expanded and vertically scrolled is really idea.My favorite App so far is the Kindle reader for iPad.  Conspicuously missing the text-to-speech facility on a real Kindle, it is a visual only reader.  I do not like that there is no way to number the pages, but the Kindle experience is much better on an iPad than it is on the Kindle. I always say that I would more often want to read in the dark with a back lit screen that I would on a beach in the bright sunlight with monochrome e-paper.  The Apple reader I can do without.  I suspect that Apple and Amazon may partner to change the face of publishing, Apple in H/W and Amazon in distribtuion and content management.Which brings me to the frightful mess, but getting slightly better, that is iTunes.  The iTunes interface is ... well, honestly, terrible.  If you go to the ITunes store it is so slow and impossible to negotiate that they think only when someone really needs to buy something and knows what they want would they use it.  I buy audiobooks from the Apple store that are not available anywhere else, but I hate the experience, and the reviews and customer feedback is not helpful at all.My main App for fun is the online Backgammon game which I really enjoy being a backgammon fanatic.  The finger taps often seem to misregister ... I don't know if that is the problem of the iPad hardware or the program, but it has provided a lot of entertainment and brain stimulation.In general though the Apps are terrible and underwhelming, and following the trail of ITunes the App store is awful.  There are so many apps and so little or none useful feedback on what is good and so much disinformation that I just do not get anything that is not free.  I need a audio recorder App, but there are so many and the ones I have tried are clumsy and irritating.There is hardly anything to just take notes with.The email client is not that great and has the same problems as the Apple desktop OS version.All the Apps are so stripped down there seems to be no good help for any of them and most try to be too cool or cute.  I just want a simple interface to jot down some notes sometimes, or to record audio at a meeting or in some situation that I want to remind myself of something.Despite all the drawbacks, I believe the iPad is going to succeed despite itself.  What is lacks in some aspects can be made up for in multiple ways.  For example people complained about the lack of Flash, which I don't care about, but then ABC and other websites have some up with their own Apps to watch video on.  I watched episodes of \"Lost\" on the iPad and it is fantastic.  I am disappointed that Hulu.Com wants to charge a subscription for their content,but I guess they have to compete with NetFlicks.The Skype application works too, so you can use the iPad as a telephone, clumsy as it may feel.  I do not have the 4G3G ... whatever G is the one that is sold optionally with the iPad, and do not miss it.  The object was to get something fast, versatile, relatively cheap and easy with no recurring costs ... and for that I love the iPad.I carry around about 180 audio books that I have ripped myself as well as some music and stuff I bought from the iTunes store despite it's faults.  All in all this thing is a great tool for many things.  I recommend the Ipad to people who invetsigate it and find they can use it.  Don't buy it just to be cool, it really is a tool, and as such it can be very very useful, and will be more so in the future if Apple can get some of the faults out of it.The one thing that sticks with me is the impression one gets of Apple when one enters the Apple world.  I have an iMac, iPod and an iPad now.  I never bought Apple before about a year ago, but I like the UNIX OS underlying, and the ergononomics and ease of use.  My 24\" screen iMac is just a joy to use.  My iPad complements that along with the Ipod ... BUT, Apple makes some some bad design choices and they refuse, maybe out of arrogance to fix them or do anything about them.  This is my on worry about the future of the iPad ... bad management decisions can kill a product dead even if it is a great innovative idea.Oh ... then there is battery life.  In all the months I have owned the iPad so far I have only once or twice gotten the battery down to about 40%.  For me, I find there is no danger of running out of juice and the battery life is really great.  After using the iPad most of the day one day I fell asleep listening to an audiobook and woke up in the morning and the thing was still going.One other thing that makes the iPad so wonderful is that companies and groups are making use of it too, as I mentioned above with ABC.  NPR has a fantastic app that lets you run through all the news in the last few days ... or weeks ... and then add the audio stories to a playlist.  Then you can set the thing going and create your own content for hours.  When companies perfect this webcasting thing like NPR this will be the way of the future, and a device like the iPad will the way to access it.I do wish the iPad had a camera in it, GPS would be nice too.  A better mail client also.  Multitasking is supposed to be on the way later this year, although I find it is not really a problem the way it is.  Bugs are fixed fast, and there are improvements as well ... so all in all I have to give the iPad a 4/5 ... which I mean to be close to the 5 than the 4 ... this is a really innovative product for those that can use it.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Apple iPad: I Knocked It Until I Tried It", "Author": "Michael Profit", "ReviewID": "R1XD9BUP838DUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the iPad was unveiled in January I initially felt very underwhelmed. The famed Apple Tablet, seemingly under production for a decade and now finally revealed, felt like a letdown: it ran the iPhone OS rather than Mac OS, it lacked sufficient hard drive space, and the on-screen icons were too small.Nonetheless, my curiosity remained at launch day, and I began to take a more serious interest based both on user reviews and my own personal needs. Trying the device out further solidified my interest, and this past weekend I reserved one and picked up my 32GB, Wi-Fi only model 24 hours later.The iPad fits my needs pefectly. I wanted a simple, consumption-oriented device that would allow me to watch my iTunes content, surf the internet, and would have access to applications that would further enhance it. The device would serve to supplement, but not replace, my laptop, would allow for instant access to the aforementioned features, and would be used daily. The iPad does all that for me and much more.Here are a few of my favorite features.Video looks superb; I've uploaded movies, TV shows, and video podcasts to my iPad, and each plays in high quality and without any hiccups. I particularly like the interface Apple selected for the video application, as the cover art for movies and TV shows is displayed in vibrant color; the video description feature, appearing to the left of the cover art, is a nice touch as well.While watching video on the iPad I'm left only with a thin screen to hold, which elicits a much more comfortable viewing experience with less mass to deal with. Though I've only watched a few videos, I much prefer it to watching video on my laptop. Audio, too, is great, both without headphones (mono) and with (stereo).Safari, the iPad's internet browser, is what really sold me on the device during my first hands-on. It's been said before, but viewing an entire web page at once, without the need to zoom in and out, is incredible. Both text and pictures look sharp, and pages render quickly thanks to Apple's custom processor. The \"Bookmark Bar,\" a feature that can be toggled on and off in Settings, appears underneath the address bar and is a feature not available on the iPhone due to screen size limitations. I've found this to be really useful, and have added all of my bookmarks to it which allows for quick access to my favorite sites.Like the iPhone, however, page refreshes have become a nuisance when switching between tabs. I've grown used to it through browsing on my iPhone, however with such a large device I'd hoped it would be less of an issue. It's not significant enough to detract from the overall browsing experience for me, but it is something to be aware of for those who like to have multiple pages open at a time.Lastly, apps. The App Store has become a huge selling point for Apple, and it's hard to ignore the numbers Apple proudly boasts in its ads. I've uploaded both iPhone and iPad apps to the iPad, and both types play great. However, the difference in quality between the two is staggering, and I'm left reluctant to upload any more iPhone apps to the iPad. While the scaled quality of an iPhone app isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, it's difficult to choose an iPhone app over an HD iPad app after experiencing both.Unfortunately, iPad app developers capitalize on this fact and subsequently charge many times more for iPad apps. While the price difference may be worth it to some, for others the lesser quality iPhone app will likely suffice.To conclude, the iPad won't be for everyone. The steep price can be difficult to justify for those who may not have a well-defined place in his or her life for a tablet device. Further, those hoping to get more features out of the iPad than the device offers may be disappointed in its functionality.  For anyone considering the iPad, defining when and how to use it can help to decide if it's the right purchase to make. You'll likely still need your laptop, but the iPad right now is the best complement device there is.Pros- Fantastic video quality and interface- Second-to-none internet browsing experience- The look and feel of the device- Photos in the Photo app look more than impressive- Snappiness with the accelerometer, opening apps, and other functions- Simple interface backed by easy set-up/maitenanceCons- iPad App Store pricing and selection- Hard drive space should be greater- Page refreshes in Safari- Price", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "the ipad goes everywhere with me!", "Author": "Mama Mia \"Mary\"", "ReviewID": "R25E3Y2IK16ON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im just loving the iPad. It eliminated me having to carry my laptop with me everywhere i went. Lightweight and fast! I opted for the 3G which is a feature that i couldn't do without. The ability to be online anywhere i go (almost everywhere i go) makes it easier for me to keep up with emails from work and up to date with the news while im on the train. I would recommend buying a nice case for this. I got one from apple for $50 and it was well worth it. Avoids scratches and gives you a better feel when handling the unit. 16g is plenty for the average user based on research i did online. The 32g and 64g are more the for people that need to download big files and a ton of songs and movies. A good tip would be try not to have all your emails directly on your ipad. Instead try to use a website that links you to your emails. This will avoid you taking up memory with emails saved on your ipad.

Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "RTBUC3E8F0INS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I started trying cases in the seventies and into the eighties, I would take yellow legal pads to trial. By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.By the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.For me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough.As to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.The iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook.On the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.My iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.

He described how he walked around the office with a block of wood to help him imagine what it would be like to carry and use a working PDA.  We have all walked around with a legal pad or something like it.  I think the Apple designers did this, too.  But with a little more awareness than most of us have.  The iPad is the result of this awareness.  I wangled mine at the beginning of this Christmas week and have had a few days to carry it around.  Here's what I think:The main advantages from my point of view: - Screen size.  As big as a piece of paper--not cramped like my iPhone screen. - Weight.  Just like a legal pad with a cover.  Maybe just a little heavier. - Keyboard.  Big enough to type with two hands.  Two fingers, in my case, but still... - Apps.  All iPhone's supported, with 2x mode for those that don't adapt to the big screen. - Convenience.  Type notes, documents, dissertations anywhere without setting up a laptop. - Newspapers.  I didn't think that screen size mattered for news apps, but it does somehow. - Web browsing.  As good as a desktop; better than iPhone special interface apps. - Pictures and movies. Wow!The minor disadvantages: - The size.  No complaints, but it is less convenient to carry than my iPhone.  Well, of course it is. - No split screen.  I really would like to have two apps side-by-side. - Not a laptop replacement.  This is fine--but don't kid yourself.  Keep your laptop. - Not an iPhone replacement.  Not small or convenient enough.  Also no phone. - Too shareable.  Unlike an iPhone, which is clearly personal, people feel free to borrow it.  Grrr! - Too pricey.  Worth it, but just barely.  Somebody at Apple is very good at figuring price points.I'm glad I got it and I don't think I will change my mind.  I think I will keep using it to write on the metro, in front of the TV--like I am now--and other places where using the laptop doesn't quite work.

It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have \"Facetime\" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!).

Fantastic!There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).Valid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.NOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos.

Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a \"third device,\" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for my son with autism", "Author": "CK \"Cathy K\"", "ReviewID": "R1QG94ZVV9P93C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it. But you won't convince me. I've been using my son's - and now I want my own! Books, email, etc. I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids.

This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.On the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with. Finally, I was surprised by how many mainstream web sites that I went to that were inaccessible because of Flash (and despite Mr. Jobs' assurances otherwise). I returned my iPad after three days. I am sure however, that for many, this will fit the bill either as a third device or for those with the narrow requirements that this device meets.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Product, No Buyer's Remorse", "Author": "A Hot Whizzer Summer...", "ReviewID": "R1RA795MZH5Z7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a very long time I have played with portable devices, trying to get one that met my needs. I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list.Despite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it.When purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time.In the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't \"drag it everywhere with me\", since it is too inconvenient for that.It is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?Update: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer \"pages\" and \"numbers\" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent. There desire to nickel and dime customers with there apps is incredibly apparent, almost every free app either has ads, or tries to get you to buy their paid for version. Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make \"ingame\" purchases. And seeing how easy it is to make a purchase once setting it up, definitely make sure you kid doesn't touch it or you could end up with a $200 bill easy.

Although I initially balked at the purchase price, I've got to say the iPad has been worth every penny! I've used a PC for work since the early 1980s and customarily spend upwards of nine hours a day in my home office using a computer to write and crunch numbers. So why did I need an iPad? I'm glad you asked. No longer bound to my desk in the evenings and on weekends, the iPad allows me to sit comfortably anywhere there's Wi-Fi while I browse the Internet, listen to music, view photos, access funny videos on YouTube, check out what's happening on Facebook, play games, etc. But my favorite use of the iPad, by far, is being able to read books. Whoever developed eBooks is a total genius! Sometimes I buy eBooks, but more often I borrow them from the public library. Whenever I happen upon an unfamiliar word or read about an interesting or exotic destination, I can quickly switch from reading the eBook to opening a page on the Internet to research it further. A competing tablet boasts that it can be read in full sun. While it is true that bright sunshine prohibits the use of an iPad, we should all be spending more time in the shade anyway! The iPad is a comfortable and easily portable size (approx. 7 \u00bd\" x 9 \u00bd\") and weight (just over 1 lb.). The colors on the glass screen are clear and brilliant. Playing games uses up more battery life than reading or browsing the Internet. That said, charging the iPad is simple and quick. Syncing the iPad with my computer is also easy and quick. There are thousands (and thousands) of apps available through iTunes - many are free. Sound quality isn't the best if you want to watch a movie, but it's possible to boost the sound with a secondary purchase of amplified speakers. The iPad is just as intuitive and nimble as you'd imagine an Apple product would be. I love being able to control everything with finger taps and swipes. Using the iPad is so easy that...well, my 83-year-old mother can do it! (Sorry, Mom.)

The only hesitation I had in buying an iPad was from reviewers that commented that the iPad dropped wifi constantly.  I can only speculate that Apple has fixed the issue.  It has worked perfectly, right out of the box on my $35 wifi router, and I've taken it to numerous hot-spots and friends houses where it has worked perfectly!  It sees the wifi, asks if I want to join, I press one button, and I'm going.I didn't spend the money on 3G, and haven't missed it once.  BTW, 32GB is proving to be plenty, unless you want to keep more than about 10 movies at once.  You can keep tons of movies in iTunes, and then just select/deselect and re-sync if you want to change the movies you have loaded, so it's not a pain to manage.Other positive notes: - Touch sensitivity is incredible.  If you use other touch devices, be prepared to be frustrated when you go back to them after using the iPad.  Apple has perfected this! - Screen clarity, resolution, image 'depth', anti-glare, readability from all angles - all these are spot on.  As far as I can tell, it is unscratchable! - App store is tons of fun - just imagine it - find it in the App store - and within a minute you are doing it! - The onscreen keyboard works great!  I had real doubts, but I am a total convert. - Despite other comments to the contrary, this is a fabulous device for doing real work. Apple has sold itself short on downplaying the iPad's ability to handle real-world work.  For example, Apple should get a real Msft Office app right away.  Current apps can be somewhat error-prone.  Apple needs to establish a line of certified professional-grade apps for real work (when you can't tolerate a crash).Room for improvement (note, despite these, I still gave it 5 stars!):In general, where Apple falls short is where it stubbornly refuses to even bend an inch on its \"principles\", all three items below fall into this... - File sharing (or lack thereof) is my principle frustration.  Apple has locked files to the apps, so there is no file management system per se.  In general this is not a problem, until you want to do some real work and share what work you did on the iPad with the rest of the world, or your other computers.  IMHO, what Apple needs is a web-based file sharing environment where apps like Pages (or that full-functionality Office Suite I'm waiting for), can seamlessly pull docs, edit them on or off-line, and then sync.  Then, you can access the same docs from your PC and just keep working.  Google Docs is on the right path, but they've put too much effort into the community file sharing/editing functions and skipped right past the more basic need people have for sharing docs between the various types of hardware/software that they own personally.  All of this is software based, so no reason Apple can't work it out in due time.  The iPad instructions tell you to use the iTunes app to share files - WAPITA!  Forget that, I just email them back and forth, which the iPad has made really easy. - Apparently Apple and the maker of Flash Player can't play in the same sandbox - shame on both of you - I'm taking a toy away from each of you!  As a user, you are likely to find several web sites that you enjoy that the iPad won't work well with because of this.  Frustrating - unacceptable! - Despite a really good on-screen keyboard and touch editing, arrow keys would be REALLY HANDY!!!! Once again, Apple won't bend on it's phylosphy.  But admit it, nudging the cursor one or two letters to the left/right/up/down would be so much quicker/easier than that little magnifying glass (which I really can't see over the top of my finger).So, I've rambled on longer about my minor 'dislikes', than my major 'loves', but that's because I care!Awesome product Apple - positively amazing in a first-of-its-kind product - but you've got some work to do if you don't want competitors to fill in the minor gaps and run past you.

He quickly learned that he prefers his Kindle e-ink screen to reading on the iPad screen... but he also quickly learned that our 2.5 year old toddler could work the device with minimal adult assistance.  Intrigued, we downloaded some learning apps.  iWriteWords, Thomas The Train puzzles, the Disney Toy Story ebook, and an app for developing hand-eye coordination.  The iPad has quickly become the center of my child's learning day.  He colors, learns to count, writes letters and numbers, reads, and completes puzzles.  He also watches cartoons on Netflix, which is great because this allows us to keep him in the same room with us and not have to be subjected to watching Noggin every night.Most of the apps (except for ebooks) take us a few days to teach our son to navigate.

Let's face it -- flash is useful for some things, but as the dominant media plugin it is on its way out.  I've found very little that actually needs flash and the sites that do use it, there is mostly an app that can accomplish the same thing but way better.Why not review it for what it is rather than something that you think it is not.  Obviously many of these people do not own one.  The common thread seems to be \"I used a friends\".I bought this about a week after it came out and I have used it every day since.  I have hundreds of free and paid apps both for fun and work. I recently took it on vacation with my bluetooth keyboard and was able to leave all sorts of things behind.  Watching movies, reading books, playing games on the flight -- perfect.  After taking pictures on my iPhone I was able to wirelessly send them to my iPad where I could edit and enhance them with the dozens of image apps out there.Every day something new comes out that enhances the experience as developers have jumped on board in a frenzy.  Gaming is a totally different experience as the size makes a big difference.  Going back to gaming on a phone is just not possible.Battery life is amazingly long.  Even with alot of use every day, I can get 2-4 days of use with no charging.  It's well put together and slick -- hard to believe it is the first one.And yes, everyone will jump on the bandwagon and try to mimic it -- and if Flash is your one and only destiny that you can't live without, then by all means wait.

Zhou", "ReviewID": "R2M9PAG16QXA0G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi there! I have just recently received an ipad, and for the most part, it is absolutely useless, for me at least.Let me tell you a bit of my background, I am a college student with a part time job. I have a powerful desktop and a semi-powerful laptop. My laptop has about 9-11 hours of battery life (asus ul30vt, $600). It also have 2 graphics card, 1 for hardcore gaming, and 1 for power saving, very intuitive. I also own a Mytouch Slide smartphone. My computer background is slightly advanced. Below is some aspects important to me (college student).General Use:The Ipad is for the most part useless to me. My laptop is only $100 more expensive, but much more useful, and it only weighs 3 pounds, with about the same battery life. I'm not trying to advertise for Asus, but just comparing laptops to this ipad. At home, I use my desktop most often. At school and work, I use my laptop for notetaking and serious work. On the bus, I use my smartphone for various stuff. The only time I find myself using the ipad is when I am in the bathroom taking a dump, or on bed watching videos (early morning or late at night when I am too lazy to get out of bed). It actually works fairly good on bed because it doesn't overheat, it is always cool. My laptop always makes my blanket too hot after a while.Battery:If the ipad came 2 years ago, it would definitely be the best gadget ever because of the insane 10 hour battery life, but nowadays, many netbooks and laptops offer that amount for much less.Gaming:I find the games on the ipad fairly dull as I am much into hardcore games like Halo, COD, starcraft, etc.Use-abilityMostly everything the ipad can do, including ebooks, I can do on my laptop. The pros of the ipad can be experienced for novice to casual computer users. The ipad OS is very simple and clean. It's also very smooth. However for my generation, computer is a very big part of our lives.Apps:Because of all the apps, the ipad can be used for a lot of different things. However...you have to have the money. Yes you can jailbreak it, but that's the same as stealing.Keyboard:Speaking of which. The ipad keyboard is not bad. However, to type correctly with minimum error, you have to look at the keyboard because you can't touch type with the virtual keyboard, and also you have to lift you palm away from the keybaord because the slightest touch can make a letter click. The auto correction system is OK, not great.Portability:The ipad is only 1.5 pounds, but it is as big as a netbook. Which means, I will have to bring a bag or backpack. May be useful if you carry a medium sized purse that you can fit an ipad in (but this is for college review).Price:I got my ipad used (mint condition, 16gb wifi) for $400. You can get a brand new 16gb wifi for $450 on Craigslist fairly easily. It is NOT WORTH it to buy a 32 or 64gb version because Apple overpriced the upgrade. I mean...come on, $100 for such a small upgrade? no wonder they don't offer removable memory, so that they can force people to buy the bigger memory. Also a 3G chip shouldn't cost $130 to upgrade.Performance:The OS is very smooth, but I did find some lag. A few times it just froze, it wouldn't register any of my touches.Multitasking:simply doesn't have it, should wait for the 4.2 upgrade. I use AIM for instant messaging, and if I press the home button, it exits out of AIM. It doesn't sign me off immediately, but it also doesn't tell me if I received a new IM or not. I have to go back into AIM to see if anyone replied.Social:For the most part, college students will view you as an Apple fanboy, which is NOT a good thing. For our generation, we tend to favor variety. Apple products in general are very strict and linear.People who may want to buy an ipad:1. don't have a long battery life laptop or netbook2. not technologically experienced, casual users3. casual gamers.4. all about the apps (if you can afford it).5. travel alot.6. Have the money.7. don't need multitasking.People who will regret buying an ipad:1. have a all-around laptop with great battery life2. no empty niche for ipad3. hardcore gamer4. touch-typist5. Video chatting is a normThis is just what I feel. 3 stars because it is an OK product. Yes it is smooth and very nice to hold, but not really what I need, or even want. I am looking to sell my ipad because it doesn't fit any niche in my life. However, like I said, the ipad will be perfect for people who needs an extremely portable device with great battery life. But then again, you can always buy the Asus 1005pe netbook (12 hours of battery) for about $280. or my Asus UL series for about $600. (yes i LOVE asus, they are the best laptop/netbook company, check them out, much better than HP, Toshiba, Gateway, Acer). The one thing that is incomparable with the ipad is its multitouch and smoothness. However, come 2011, the ipad should have a lot of competitors coming out.-College Student 101", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Erroneously Thought I Could Not Like This As Much as Macbook or iPhone", "Author": "carol irvin \"carol irvin\"", "ReviewID": "R214VT4DA35RXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update: We just went through the first big software update to the iPad and various issues have been corrected.  The chief one is multi-tasking.  I can now click the home button twice and a bar will appear which lets me choose other functions.  I choose one and my screen is visibly swiped for another.  Also, internet radio, like my Pandora app, will now continue to play if you leave to use another function of the iPad.  Prior to this, the music stopped playing when you left Pandora.  I now have a mute button on the side and the fix position button is now on the multi-tasking bar.  I've added a few more ereader apps and, as an ebook reader, I use the ipad all of the time.  It is as good for magazines and full color art books as it is for text books.  I have not discovered any downside to this update yet.  It of course still does not play Flash but I don't think that will change as Apple is opposed to Flash. My original review appears below:I use this every day and all day long.  I read all of my books on it.  I watch tv shows and movies on it--I have not turned on a tv set since the day it arrived. I listen to audios on it. I have no problem using the virtual keyboard and can write my emails just fine on it.  I look at my Picasa albums on it. I listen to audiobooks and music on it.  I surf the web.  Then there are the apps....oh, boy...the apps are something to get lost in.  I play scrabble against the computer on it, ditto gin rummy.  I play my crosswords on it and it downloads all of my New York Times ones. I have art history apps so watched art ones, beautiful images, while waiting for a nerve wracking CT scan.  In fact, I get so absorbed in my iPad that I am somewhat irritated when \"tourists\" want to bother me and ask me what it is and what I'm doing on it. However, my natural enthusiasm takes over and I find myself showing them all of the things I am doing on it.My husband got one after he watched me with mine for a few months.  He gets lost in it for hours every evening.  He has a few quibbles about the iPad.  His biggest one is that it doesn't play Flash.  However, I think his problem is that he doesn't realize that if he used Apps properly that he wouldn't even have a need for Flash.  I certainly don't.  I don't need it for my Crosswords, for example, because my App handles all of my crosswords brilliantly.When I listen to all the complaints about the iPad, I think it boils down to that somehow the iPad is not the macbook in iPad form.  I don't need another Macbook!  I have a macbook, an iPad and an iPhone and frankly there is nothing else I need.  What one may not do best, the other does.  At home, where I spend most of my time, I am surrounded by all three.  When I go out, I take the iPad and iPhone.  I used to take the Macbook too but that is rarely necessary anymore. Once you have these three products, you can junk the rest of your electronics.  I certainly did.  My nephew is now using my sony reader, my digital picture frame, our Hero phone and so on and so forth.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great device, but beware that sync to computer may not work", "Author": "R. Waring", "ReviewID": "R1WL8GMTRIOMKG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my iPad for a trip to Europe so that I would be able to watch movies for the entire flight, as well as read books. For that, with its great screen and 10 hour battery life, it is fabulous. You'd have to spend at least $500 to get netbook computer with comparable battery life and graphics power, but miss out on the touch screen and portrait mode.My problem is that I cannot sync the Ipad to my computer. I have an iPhone too and was able sync that until the iTunes release 9.1 that coincided with the release of the iPad. When I try to sync either device, the message \"Unable to load data class information from sync services\" appears in iTunes. I have spent more than 16 hours on the phone with at least ten Apple support techs, at the \"Genius Bar\" in my local Apple store, and on my own trying various \"fixes\" posted on the web. The senior Apple tech I am now dealing with tells me he has the same problem trying to sync his iPhone to his own computer. I briefly found a work around and was able to sync for a day, but then when I installed iTunes 9.2, it stopped working again. You cannot roll back to a previous version of iTunes because 9.1 changed the library file structure.I just spent two hours emailing myself 150 mbs of pdf doucments that I need to read, opening them on the iPad and then saving them in iBooks. If I could sync, that would have been taken me five minutes of effort at most. I also cannot load music or photos from my computer library.This problem with iTunes seems to be affecting a lot of people according the Apple techs I've dealt with and the web forums I've read. If you are planning to buy an iPad, make sure you can sync it to your computer before you buy it. Install iTunes and take your laptop down to your local retailer and ask them sync it to a demo iPad in the store. Otherwise, you may end up like me.So far, my experience has been ugly and stressful. It's disgraceful that in Apple's rush to get this product to market, they wrecked the iTunes sync capability for thousands of customers and tens weeks later they still have not fixed it.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Versatile", "Author": "mrnikkel \"Matt\"", "ReviewID": "R253FG9KPOA7CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.Let me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.A few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.Another example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.One more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.Those are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.Sure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice.Update: I want to add a few of my thoughts on how the iPad compares to the Kindle as an ebook reader, since it seems particularly pertinent in an Amazon review.  I've been using the Kindle app on the iPad for a little while now, and I've reached a point where I'm using each device in more or less equal amounts for reading.  Overall, I think I prefer using the Kindle.  The screen is easier on the eyes; the battery life is significantly better; the size and weight feel better in my hand; and size of the iPad's screen just feels a bit too large for reading large portions of text.That said, the iPad is certainly a capable reader in the right circumstances.  In particular, I use it more than the Kindle when I'm in bed at night because the back-lit screen means I don't need a reading light that will keep my wife awake.  Also, I've been using it more often when starting a new book.  Navigation of the store is much easier and downloads go much faster than on the Kindle due to the WiFi.In conclusion, I'm certainly not going to get rid of my Kindle now that I've got an iPad.  There are simply too many situations where I prefer it over the iPad for reading.  That said, if I didn't already own a Kindle, I think it would be much harder to justify buying one as well as an iPad, since the iPad does serve as a capable ebook reader in most circumstances.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great device, some seriously rough edges", "Author": "C. Franz", "ReviewID": "R1A8H1O2KF6WDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Refurbed 1st gen ipad", "Author": "Quest1951", "ReviewID": "R3OQIJJ78PBMZ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first entry into tablet market so I wanted something less expensive to try to see if we would use it.

The lack of a decent way to view photos in an album or read PDF (offline) is particularly annoying because those seem like things that would be good on the iPad.

I haven't bought an apple product since the second generation ipod years ago.  I have also played quite a bit with android based phones and have been eagerly researching and awaiting the release of android based tablets.  After doing considerable research, I have come to the conclusion that android 2.2 (FroYo) is not ready for prime time use on tablet after having some play time with a Samsung Galaxy tab.  Apps have to be scaled up, which makes them look rather blocky and atari 2600 on the Samsung's 7\" 1024x600  resolution screen.  This problem is further exacerbated on larger size screens like the demo I saw of the Archos 101 (10.1\" with a 1024x600 resolution).  At some point in the not to distant future, app developers will release modified versions of their apps suited to higher resolution/larger size screens.  At the moment, froyo tops out at 854x480 resolution, which will cripple the ability of developers to rescale their apps until either Gingerbread or Honeycomb are released by Google (who has yet to confirm which update will actually allow android to accomodate higher resolution displays).  Don't get me wrong, the hardware on the Galaxy Tab, Archos 101 and Viewsonic G Tablet (this tab in particular) are all quite good--better than the iPad--but without the OS and the Apps, the hardware really doesn't do the user much good.Rather than wait the 6 months to a year before the Android guys get their acts together, I decided to go online and find myself a used 64gb iPad on ebay.  I did this reluctantly, but I wanted to give apple products another try.  The iPad was purchased for about $120 less than I would pay for the same product from Apple.  I did notice that there was a burn in the LCD which caused part of the screen to show up white when the rest of the screen was black.  I have seen this type of defect before and it is a manufacturer's defect that should entitle me to a replacement device.  I registered myself as the user of the iPad and brought my \"new\" used iPad to the Apple store.  They looked at the issue and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the Apple Store with a brand new iPad under my arm.  Now that's what I call customer service!!!!  Steve Jobs scored lots of points on that.I brought the iPad home, loaded iTunes onto my Dell (again no Apples) and in ten minutes I had the iPad ready to go.  I have downloaded tons of apps since then, including kindle, nook, netflix, hulu +, angry birds, N.O.V.A., NYT, WSJ etc.  All the apps are designed specifically to run on the iPad and they function perfectly.  The device boots quickly and opens apps almost instantaneously.  The battery life lives up to Apple's 10 hour claim.  The interface is smooth and polished.  The device itself is well built and has a high-quality feel to it.  The screen in particular is gorgeous with great color reproduction, inky blacks and terrific viewing angles.  On the whole, this is an excellent product.  I am looking forward the release of IOS 4.2, which will provide the iPad with multi-tasking capabilities, the use of air play and remote printing.  This should significantly improve the iPad's functionality.What the iPad is not:  As others have said, this is not a replacement for your laptop or desktop.  If you are buying this as an alternative to a more traditional computer you will be sorely disappointed.  You can not expand the storage on the device, nor can you connect the device to any external storage, which signficantly hinders functionality.  Most similar devices, including soon to be released android tablets, have microSD slots, USB 2.0/3.0 connections (mini and standard), OTG capability that will allow you to connect thumb drives and portable harddrives--the iPad has NONE of these features. If you're familiar with windows/microsoft products, you'll come to see that the treatment of files is not the same on ios as you're use to using.  You cannot save a \"document\" or \"file\" on the iPad.  The iPad's document management system just works in completely different manner.  To be clear, this is a great device for web browsing, reading ebooks, watching streaming movies from netflix, playing games and light productivity software.  It is not a real productivity device for use in place of a laptop.  Although there is some watered down productivity apps for wordprocessing and spreadsheets, this is not going to replace the microsoft word/excel suite that most of us rely on in the business world.On the whole it is a great product with some limitations.  This really a tool for media consumption, not for productivity.

I can put on music (my files or Pandora) then switch to a newspaper, weather, or other app and enjoy it as it should have been designed in the first place.  Presently it is shipping with 3.x, so new users won't have those bennies until 4.2 is certified and released.  But even without it, it's a great tool.  I can take meeting notes without having to wait for my laptop to boot up, then shut down with a push of the button and wait all of about 1-2 seconds.  I can pop it on quickly in the morning to read news, etc.  My email (exchange) is fed directly to it as well as my personal POP3 email.

For both of these functions it easily beats a small portable computer because (a) it's significantly lighter, (b) the screen has the right form factor (and is of better quality than most small portables), (c) it's more social when showing a news item or other site with others, (d) the touch interface is more fun.My two (young) daughters also use it frequently to draw (with an app called \"Art Studio\") and play games (board games work especially well with this device). When we go out for dinner, my wife will just grab the iPad and drop it in her purse, and when service is a little slow, or we want a grownups conversation, the iPad works just perfectly to keep the girls entertained (again, much more effectively than the old laptop).We bought the simple dock (Apple\u00ae iPad(tm) Dock - White (MC360ZM/A)) to use the iPad as a picture frame when it's not otherwise in use.  It's in the kitchen, and it just puts every other digital picture frame to shame.

This product is really functional for school, and everyday things. It is like having your computer in your hands or in your lap, everything there at your fingertips. It is good for traviling, just put in the case and go! Just so simple, right there at your fingertips! You can do PowerPoint, documents, and sprend sheets (you have to get the apps 9.99 each). When you are ready to type, the keyboard just pop up from the bottom of the screen. It is amazing to hold you document, your spredsheet or anything els in your hands, ready to go, just hit the powerbutton and go. The iPad has multi-tasking, just double click the home screen button and the home screen appears at the bottom of the screen while what you are woring on stays there. It is very thin. The iPad can run ipod and iphone apps too. The iPad comes with a wall charger, to set it up, you do need a computer, it comes with an instruction packet along with stickers.The battery is 10 hours long (I believe so). It has accessories you can buy from the apple store, or any other store. The keyboard is basicly the size of a laptops keyboard. I do recommend this product.

It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have \"Facetime\" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!). I've used the iPad for quite a while now, and am not disappointed. Just remember not to expect a laptop, but more of a new type of device. I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "amazing device on its own terms", "Author": "paul jordan", "ReviewID": "R2SD6AXKZD37QT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing product.

There is no file system per se--everything is organized through theitunes browser. Also available at itunes are huge collection of apps--small softwareapplications. Some are truly great--like the autodesk sketch app, the kindleapp, and the marvel comic app. The device is very fast and seamless; and thedisplay is stellar. If your intent on doing  work on the ipad--you willbe frustrated by its form factor and lack of a true file system.

The first thing  noticed from opening the box is the built quality. It is superb. It is very sturdy and had a nice heft to it while you are holding it. It only had four buttons (screen lock,home, volume rocker, and screen orientation lock). It fits very nicely in your hands and is made from very high quality materials. I would definently recommend a case though because if you drop it then you are screwed.The screen on this thing is amazing. Watching movies is a pleasure. I have a couple 720p movies on here and they look absolutely fantastic. Normal definition movies also look very nice. The bad side to the screen though is it gets many fingerprints. They are not very easy to wipe off but with a lightly damped cloth they come off easily and the screen looks brand new.The internet browsing is very fast on this. Pages load quicker than my net book. The multi touch is great when needing to zoom in. You can have numerous web pages up at once. For some reason though every no and then the Internet starts to preform very slowly but fixes itself after a couple of minutes, but this is most likely my router causing this. Typing is very good and I got adjusted to it easily. I prefer typing in landscape because it is easier as in portrait mode it is a little awkward. By the way this whole review is being typed on the iPad without the Bluetooth keyboard attachment. The lack of flash player is not a big letdown to me because YouTube still works fine and I do not go on many flash websites.The speakers on this are very good. They are surprisingly loud but the sound quality is not lost much when cranked up all the way. When played at normal volumes or through headphones you will be amazed at how well they preform. The only problem is when you start to turn up the volume the device starts to vibrate a bit, but it is most likely no big deal.The apps are very good. Gaming is great, although most of the good games you have to pay for. They're are a couple good free games like tap tap radiation and air hockey but besides that not many. Some good paid games I would recumbent are x-plane, nova, real racing, touchgrind, need for speed, and plants vs zombies. Although these games are great they come at a cost. All of them combined are over 50 dollars. These games though will keep you entertained for hours and most are redisigned for the iPad while adding new features. Also they're are many good apps ranging from some similar to word to others for keeping baseball box score. One very creative app I enjoy is magic piano which is very fun to play around with. There are also apps like netflix and abc player which are very cool also.The battery life is insane. It lasts forever. I have gotten 9-10 hours on this with extremely heavy use. This includes hours of YouTube videos and playing very graphic intensive games like x-plane and real racing. Video playback time will easily be 13-14 hours at half brightness.It take about 3-4 hours to completely charge it. And also right out of the box it comes completely charged.The Only cons would have to be-Fingerprint magnet-Lack of flash( but only a con for some)-Apps are expensive and not many good free ones-Connection problems(but most likely only my router)-Apps take up a lot of memoryI would recommend getting the 32 or 64 gb version(like mine) because memory on this will become very limited with 16 gb. Most apps or games are between 100-200 mb.Also adding movies and songs will take up a lot of memory. My iPad had over 25 movies and more than 120 episodes of family guy,  more than 400 songs, and with about 20 apps and games installed and it takes up about 40 gb of space. I would also not recommend buying movies from iTunes as they are very expensive and take up more space. A normal 2 hour movie is 10 dollars and takes up 1.5gb of space so download them online for more space saving.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Out of all the devices...", "Author": "Meerz", "ReviewID": "RDJRYUJ428ALN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can truly say that out of all the devices I've owned, this is the COOLEST!  I am absolutely in love with the iPad. I do all my readings on it since I got it. I read books, pdfs, documents.. etc. The gaming experience is MUCH better than iphones and ipod touches. I use it a lot so sometimes I get into a state of \"ergonomical fail\" (if that's a word) and it could get heavy on my hands and it hurts a bit. But other than that I am absolutely fine with the product I think it's sleek and advanced. You could do a lot with it and it's much more practical that a laptop, given it's weight. I once used it as a GPS for an hour and a half drive -WiFi model. So you could do a lot of serious work with it.

For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.I bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!But, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.Next thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.You can probably see where this is going.- I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).First the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.Let's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.My first thought:- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the \"refuse to reconnect\" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, \"guns don't kill people\", but you see what I'm getting at.My next thought:- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying \"yeah, but it can do other things!!\" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams \"gimmick\" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).So on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.In other words readers:-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.So...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic \"NO\" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft \"YES\" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.  But don't expect a laptop out of this thing.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware of syncing problems", "Author": "A.

I am just a little angry about how bad and good this product is. Before deciding to buy, Google iPad sync problems. There are many problems and they are real. I have had to restore my iPad at least 6 times to get it to work and right now it is a paper weight. It does not synch with my latest edition Dell laptop. No music. No apps. I will update this review at a later point and hopefully it gets better at some point in the future.Beware. Their are issues that are major with syncing with iTunes. When it does work it's great. Right now it is not working.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "On Hand", "Author": "Grey", "ReviewID": "R203QZ0JMIHK2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Five years ago I didn't believe that Apple had anything more significant to offer than a fancy MP3 player. Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called \"gold rush\" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery. As I have already mentioned, e iPad as a device is not perfect, but it makes an excellent companion and you'll soon find your laptop collecting dust.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "COULD BE BETTER", "Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R37YLECAFFOIKZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9\" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection.You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad review for PC users", "Author": "Deej", "ReviewID": "R10I30NBTLDC96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17\" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads \"Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding\". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads \"not charging\".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest \"Batman\" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17\" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed \"OMG\" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted \"OMB\".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word \"gay\" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good start, but not there yet.", "Author": "Jon R", "ReviewID": "R15QF8PUI8E79B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad 16GB 3GS", "Author": "K.

I've come to realize most of the complaints that you hear about the Ipad are easily worked around (multi-tasking, flash player, etc).Pros:(1) the USER INTERFACE(!!!) is something that no \"ipad-killer\" (which by the way, you know you're with the right company with every other companies product is advertised as a \"Ipod killer\".. \"Iphone killer\".. \"Ipad killer\"..) haha, I mean lets be real, no consumer cell phone has ever \"killed\" the Iphone, Ipod, nor will any consumer product kill the Ipad nor come close.(2) the WOW FACTOR(!!!) everytime you're in public with this bad boy you'll get a ton of \"ohhhhs\" and \"ahhhhs\" which is definitely cool.(3) fast, responsiveCons:(1) expensive, but the cool factor helps(2) expensive(3) kind of stuck to the Apple world of Apps unless you jailbreak your device. not suggested, but i've never had any issues with my jailbroken device.(4) 70% of App Store apps are paid versus 30% of Android Market appsAll in all, I love my Ipad.

As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me.

Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14\" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.

I can edit home movie with my ReelDirector app. There is just so much. The app world is SO huge and the prices are so small that you don't have to worry about spending too much.

There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking \"Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99.\"  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a \"go back to your previous app\" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.

Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "No FLASH - The Real Reason", "Author": "J.

Instead of blaming Flash, Steve, just admit that the problem is with the iPad not being able to handle Flash, and not t'other way round. The processing power of the iPad is just fine for most things, but it's just too slow for full-on Flash applications and movies. Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue. Instead of delivering a product that you'd fully enjoy using, the only thing on Steve's mind is 'How much can we squeeze out of the punters on this one?' Okay, he's in business, and profits must be made, but if the profits are more important than user satisfaction, why should anyone feel any kind of loyalty to such a brand?If you've already bought the first-version iPad, you may love it, but there will of course be countless others who'll feel cheated not far down the line, when a much more powerful version is launched. Apple play the same trick time-after-time. Release the Basic Version, and when all the hype and sales start to slow, release a much better version that should and could have been released in the first place. This is because Apple knows that those who bought the basic version are so in love with Apple, they will happily fork-out for the better version too. One user - two sales. Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way.

I use it for many purposes, but mainly entertainment.  Movies are gorgeous on the screen, games are great and there are some games with incredible graphics that look amazing. I can't compare it to a kindle, cause I never used one, but in can say reading is great on the iPad.  The screen makes it so you can read in the dark, on the flip side, you can't really take it outside in the sun unless you get a shaded area, even then it's kinda hard to see the screen.I've seen a lot of reviews saying it's a bigger iPod touch, which it is, but that's what I love about it.

NO FLASH = GIMPED INTERNET......PERIOD!Okay...now that's out of the way..on to my impressions of this silly gadget. (Oops...revealing a bit too much early..but hey).So I get (have) to use one of these things for absolutely zero cost for the company I work for. We develop an application for this thing so I have to have one to test on this platform. I was happy that I would get to test drive one for free and then....poof...nothing. I have it sitting here right next to me as I use a real machine that I will not brand as PC or Mac for public notice (it does't matter..both are superior). It just doesn't do anything that my smartphone or a laptop doesn't do infintely better. Now I have to admit that I am a power user of my devices and demand a bit more control and that may have me a bit biased. However, it gives no excuse to the dilusional marketing aimed at this device by Apple.Let's get going with the reality. Say you spend 600 bucks on one of these things. From that point on...yer going to put use to this thing...or consider your money wasted. So...if you are to wrap your head around one of those options...it is going to be to justify your purchase no matter how silly...because you don't want to look foolish. That, I think is the case with the iPad. It's just not mature, and it has its place as a toy at this moment.Then there is Apple's customer-unfriendly way of charging for stuff that should be free. Ohh the App store. I could go on for hours about that. About how Apple locks you into using their tools to operate their hardware and it's all Apple...Apple..APPLE. Marketing..marketing...all things Apple. Use our app to get your music on our device. All else causes problems. There is just no variety with these devices and I despise that. Feels like you never really own the device you purchased. Just a lease with Apples conditions. With my droid phone....I can remote into my home PC and manage everything that a home PC can do. (And I have Flash...gonna be a running theme there...sorry. Jobs is a pompus a**)I think it is time to clear one other thing up in this review just so it's fair. There are two types of products, those that are easy to use, and limit flexibility...and those that are extremely flexible...but you must become an expert to flex that power. And all those in between. If you are looking for an easy way to do things, not critical about content, and quite willing to pay for solutions as opposed to figuring something out...maybe this is for you. Ignore my review...all the way.  I am just here to put this device in its place. If you have the money to spend on this thing for gimped couch surfing..awesome...enjoy. I will be on something that renders falsh at the moment. (Sorry...there goes another Flash dig...but Jobs...YOU DESERVE IT!)Let's talk screen resolution. EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE IPHONE. So all you get for your screen size increase is BIGGER PIXELS! (Leaset as far as I can tell..I can see the blocks) So maybe it makes it a bit more useable for the blind and fat fingered...but no real improvement.Bottom Line...call me when I can do work with this thing. I have to say...that all Microsoft has to do is do the same thing and give it a purpose..and Apple loses again. They have a lot of fans for this toy..no doubt. I will admit...millions of people cannot be wrong and it is only a matter of time before someone does this tablet computer right and the rest of us are holding something similar. However, most of Apples commercials and quotes promoting this device are grandiose and dilusional. Making music on this thing????? LMAO...maybe for the kids. Yes...that is what this is...a great KIDS toy. Maybe that is it....I am just expection seriousness from a line of hardware that was meant for FUN. In that case, they hit the mark...bravo Apple. Showing slide shows to the family...browsing a book, maybe a netflix stram in a pinch...but to me there are just no such pinches. I have solutions for all thsoe things already..and they do not let me down.Okay...okay...let's not make it totally bad. After all you can watch movies on it in bed (or you could get a TV for your room)...surf the internet from your couch  and play smurf villiage which I heard is absolutely ADDICTIVE. On the more serious side, you can get books and read in a beautiful format which I find very pleasent. One thing I found magnificaent about this device is it's place in the education system. Man could you do away with the books and such. For that..it's awesome..but that has to be your use of the device. However, remember...paying 600 dollars to make this thing have a purpose in your life is a bit much. So you better have it's purpose worked out for you, or you'll end up justifying its cost by working it into your life..Okay...so on to another phase. Here I sit...at home..with my first access to an iPad...and I want nothing to do with it. Why? Because every other device I have will play flash! (Ahh man the Flash thing again...darn it!) How can you have any internet enabled device and not have FLASH. Steve Jobs...you are a foolish idiot and will damned well pay for it. Sure HTML 5 is coming our way....but the CURRENT internet is not gonna be rid of flash for a LONG time you friggin DOPE! (Still talking to Jobs...sorry)My last comment to sum up is this. If yer looking to buy an iPad...don't be serious...and you'll be fine. Cheers.Final thought...I would rather be a PC user...using a tool...than a tool..using an iPad. BAM!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality product", "Author": "Thomas Wolf", "ReviewID": "R24Z0LSFO6WKBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my wife the iPad for her birthday a few months ago, and she's very happy with it.  However, she mostly uses it to watch Chinese YouTube videos and to surf a small set of web sites.  She occasionally uses the built-in apps (NYTimes, ABCnews, etc.)  Again, she's very happy with it in this limited capacity.We're also both very happy with the build quality and the fact that it works just like our iPhones - so the learning curve is 0.Where the iPad really falls down is when you want to (or have to!) visit web sites that use Adobe Flash.  No matter what Steve Jobs says about Flash (it being a battery hog, etc.) he did his customers an extreme disservice not giving *them* the choice.  His claim that only a small part of the Web uses Flash is pretty much a lie.  Just try to visit any commercial site that attempts to show its customers 360degree views of its products - none of them display with the iPad.  We're not talking minor web sites - try [...] (you can't even see their main page with the iPad because it's *entirely* flash based), volvo.com, honda.com, toyota.com.  Many games web sites use Adobe Flash for their games - again, none of them display on the iPad (I won't even go into the iPad's inability to display Java - forget about all the web sites that use it for games, or other content).And there's pretty much no chance that Steve Jobs will ever change his mind with regards to supporting Adobe Flash on either the iPad or the iPhone or the iPod Touch.  He simply decided that you should not have a choice in this matter.So while we enjoy the iPad for what it does, I can't give it 5 stars - because it is unable to browse a large swath of the Internet.If you want to be able to browse *all* Web pages with a tablet, you're better off getting an Android 2.2 (or above) based tablet - such as the Samsung Galaxy and a slew of other forthcoming tablets.  They all support Flash.-------------Update (Feb. 1, 2013): It's now three years later and Apple still doesn't support Flash.  But, guess what?  IT NO LONGER MATTERS!  Most web sites have moved their content to HTML 5.  We've moved on from from our original iPad to the iPad Retina, and from there to the iPad Air.  And we've been deliriously happy with all of them!  An added benefit of buying Apple products: you get a decent trade-in value!  Each time we traded in our old iPads (by the way Amazon has a great trade-in program for iOS devices), we've gotten at least two hundred dollars.  The competition gets you next to nothing in trade-in (I know - I bought my parents a Kindle HDX 8.9\" a bit over a year ago - that's already only worth $90 - on Amazon's own trade-in store!)So I'm upgrading the iPad review to 5 stars.

I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad 3G you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi plus 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t.; The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book.

Those are available on the Apple website.Physical and Visual Attributes (Snobby sounding, huh? Maybe the statistics that say most iPad owners are stuck up are right...)Firstly, it's just a big black and silver rectangle. It's not really what I would call beautiful, but it is pleasing to look at. Oh, who am I kidding! It's beautiful! Uhem.The brushed silver back is nice. It doesn't show fingerprints or scratches as much as the chrome or plastic that backs most portable Apple products. It's also cool to the touch, which I like.It isn't too heavy to hold, but it's going to be set on my lap most of the time anyway.iPod, Videos, and Photos (or, to go in chronological order, Photos, Videos, and iPod)The Photos app is actually incredibly nifty! When you open it up, granted you have put pictures on it, you're greeted with folders. Each one looks like a couple pictures laid out on a table.You can peak into one of them by pinching slightly or open one of them by pinching a lot. This is awesome and has to be seen to be fully appreciated. If you're not a fan of pinching, you can also just tap on a folder to open it right up.There are a few other interesting things that you can do with this app, but mostly it's for viewing all of your captured memories. Flicking from one picture to the next is fast and smooth.I really like the new look of the Videos app. It's much more...muchier. The bigger view of the DVD and TV show covers and the effect that happens when you click the play icon are both great. Oh, and I love watching stuff on the big screen!The iPod is a lot like iTunes. Instead of cover flow, there is a grid view of your music library. Other than that, everything is pretty much the same.Web Browsing and YouTubeAll of the people out there that don't like the iPad wish that Safari could view flash. That honestly hasn't been a problem for me, but maybe that's just because I don't make a habit of viewing flash-intensive websites.I think browsing the web on an iPad is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Sliding your finger to scroll down a page and tapping or pinching to zoom both feel really natural.  I'm really happy that it doesn't take long to load pages and that I don't have to zoom much.YouTubeAs I've said before, the big screen on the iPad makes watching stuff really enjoyable.  The YouTube app adds tons of videos to it without taking up much space at all.  (Yes, I actually got a 1,000...GB iPad!)Using the app feels like you're on the actual website, but at the same time much better.  The quality of the videos are great, and searching for a particular one is...fun.That's one thing I think is really cool about Apple's gadgets.  They make doing everything fun!  How do they do that?GamingPlants Vs. Zombies HD is the best game app there is! Alright, now that I've got that out of my system, let's me just say that playing games on the iPad is a blast!Racing on it is like having a Wii in your hands.  However, I don't think the iPad could replace a Wii or DS.  Apps can really add up, so make sure you watch how much money you spend on them.Mail and KeyboardThe Mail app that's on the iPad is much more better than the one that's on the iPhone and iPod touch.  In portrait mode you see one of your e-mails, and in landscape mode you see a split screen view of one of your e-mails and a list of any others you've gotten.When you want to compose an e-mail, all you have to do is tap on an icon in the upper right hand corner.  A box will then pop up that you can type in, and so will a keyboard.  If you're in portrait mode, the keyboard that pops up will be smaller than if you're in landscape mode.They keyboard is much easier to type on than I thought it would be!  I can type almost as fast on it as I can on a physical one.ConclusionI'm not sure how Apple managed to make such a great tablet computer!  One of the things that's great about it is that you can add to the things it can do by getting apps.  Maybe that's one of the keys to it, the iPhone, and the iPod touch's success.

Make sure that the apps you might need will work with iOS5. The rule of thumb - if you need it for more than basics - don;t buy it!It has no camera nor mic, so no pictures/videos taking, no Skype, no audio recording.I bought it for my wife as eReader and even though at first it didn't let me install iBooks (Error: iOS 7 required!) I found a little trick on the internet, how to get the older version:1) install itunes on your PC, download iBooks there, sync iTunes with the iPad.2) disconnect iPad from PC. If you don't see iBooks on your iPad, download it through the AppStore on your iPad - and THEN you will get the message that it requires iOS7 and the option to download older, compatible version of the iBooks.If you just try to install iBooks through the AppStore (without step 1), it won't give you the option of older version, just Error message.People say that this trick can be used to download older versions of some other apps as well (Facebook for inst.), so give it a try.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was everything they said", "Author": "Mario Ramkhelaman", "ReviewID": "RWZTN2O03FXP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worked perfectly in great condition, jsut be warned, 1st gen cannot go past IOS 5.1.1, so some application might not install", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "good price", "Author": "Lynda W.", "ReviewID": "RVSK1MDCPEP04", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice for a start, but there are apps you can not put on this Ipad, great for getting ready to move up to a newer version.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Kellie A.

I get so much use out if it, it's become like an appendage. It goes almost everywhere I go. I use it for everything from business to entertainment including email, reading and writing contracts when I'm on the road, watching movies, playing games, reading the news, surfing the web, and for directions and GPS info.There's so much more I use it for as well. There are thousands - maybe hundreds of thousands of apps out there that you can download for free or very inexpensively to do practically anything you can think of. If it isn't created yet, it most likely will be soon.It's easy to use, intuitive, and responsive. The graphics are fantastic, and the touch screen is easy to use. It's light, and small enough to go anywhere with.Personally I needed the 3G, so I can handle business anywhere I am. I also needed the largest memory for my work related activity. It's also good if you'll be watching movies. One reviewer noted that the iPad is slower when you're surfing the web while driving. I'll attest to this. It can be frustrating, but then I remind myself that I'm in a car surfing the web, which is pretty cool to begin with (not while driving, by the way).I did find that if I was doing a lot of typing such as with a business document, typing was too challenging. I purchased a portable keyboard to go with the iPad, and a tiny mouse. Now I can format documents easily.If you're deciding between a first generation and the newer models, here are some thoughts.- Though the first generation iPad is light, the newer iPads are lighter and thinner.- The newer iPads are 4G, and probably faster.- The newer iPads have cameras. This would be a great feature, and it would be nice to be able to make phone face to face calls. Using the camera can be a bit awkward because of the shape and size of the iPad, but it does work.So if you're deciding whether to buy an iPad or not, I would say that it's an amazing product that you'll find tons of uses for, whether it's for business, fun, or practical living.If you're deciding whether to buy an iPad 1 or a newer version, I'd say that this depends on your budget and your specific needs. By buying a first generation iPad, you'll be able to get 64 GB, and 3G at a lower price than with the newer versions.So far, Apple's operating system updates have been working on the first generation iPad, but I've got to wonder if that could change eventually.

Once set up, you will appreciate the larger, although grainier display than the smaller iPhone and iPod touch. However the larger display means that Everything you do on it is slower than the aforementioned smaller devices, including the original versions.The iPhone and iPod touch come with a number of handy apps that are missing from the iPad 1 (weather, stocks, clock, and voice memos), so you have to hunt for substitutes on the Apple App Store.YouTube works much as it does on any laptop or desktop, that is, somewhat more disorganized, disorderly, and slower than on the iPhone and iPod touch. It does not seem to be capable of streaming video on a full screen so that the user has to switch to a small window to get the video running but it still endlessly halts in the videos. So it will probably be better once Google releases their version of YouTube.The email app takes a very long time to display opened emails. And once you open one, you cannot close it. Rather, you have open the next or previous one. This is extremely annoying, unless your thought processes are as chaotic as the person who designed this app.ITunes works very nicely.

The 16gbs is enough for me because i already have a zune and an ipod touch to listen to all my music on that.  I use this device to mainly read books, surf the web, and do some email.  I did run into a small problem.  The ipad seems to freeze up when i used email and some web browsing activity.  For the email problem, i simply changed some settings so that when i deleted emails, so that it wouldn't stay on the servers.  As for the web browsing freeze, all i can recommend is to do a hard reset by holding down the hold and home buttons for a few seconds till the apple logo appears.  Also, itunes just sucks, i'm sorry but it just does.  Whenever i tried to sync my podcasts or add videos, it wiped off my data and settings.  I was able to backup my original settings, but i had to sync my data back onto the ipad.  Other than that, this has been an excellent purchase.  I didn't need some of the features of the ipad2 like the dual cameras because that just seemed like a waste and i saved about 100 bucks.  So, it has been worth it and i would do the purchase all over again", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "overall satisfied with this purchase", "Author": "Tereza Volna", "ReviewID": "R1VEMAQYX1EC3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not sure if I should get one as I'm not the biggest Aplle fan (had issues with previous products and really not big on iTunes).

I'm glad I decided for iPad after all, will surely use the other additional functions, too. All the issues such as playing different video files etc can be quite easily solved with various apps. The absence of flash can be a pain and I can totally understand someone can be annoyed by this but personally, I didn't experience any major frustration in this matter. I miss easier loading process, direct USB access for easier data flow would be a big plus, I'm really not fan of trasferring everything via iTunes.My other concer was the shape of the item that is sold as refurbished. I have to confirm the iPad arrived very fast, in original packaging and completely unused. works great so overall I can highly recommend this seller, this purchase was a great deal. All in all I can recommend iPad to everyone who seeks for ligth and very user friendly gadger, to ones who travel a lot or need to have their basic computer functions with them all the time.

It is not so great at creating content such as documents, but it is possible. Better than a smartphone for writing memos and writing/browsing email.Where it really excels is displaying content. Pictures, email, websites, and videos. Using your fingers to scroll or zoom in and out of websites makes it much easier to view than on a netbook or laptop. If you are a Netflix member, the free Netflix app is great. I also really like the free Amazon Kindle app which automatically syncs with your PC, iPhone, Android, iPad, and Kindle of course, but does not require a Kindle to use. There are also many games which work well with the touchscreen, one being Plants Vs Zombies.I really like the iPad and I'm sure the iPad 2 is even better, but with all that said, I think it is over priced.

I was a skeptic myself, but after owning apple products the past two years, I knew the company would live up to my expectations.  It is in no way just a large iPhone.I purchased the iPad 32gb wifi version and quickly began loading apps and movies. I also jail broke my version and am writing this review on the iPad itself!So far, I've noticed that the iPad is extremely efficient.The safari pages load quicker than my iPhone 3G and the apps open very fast.The clarity is unbelievable.  I think it's even clearer than my MacBook!The battery life is impressive.  I know it will withstand my 5+ hour flights from Boston to LA.  I watched a two hour movie this evening and played around with it for an additional few hours and my battery is at 56%.I was surprised at how great the volume level actually is. I expected it to not be that great, but when I was watching the movie earlier, I did not use headphones and found the sound quality perfect.  Additionally, the iPad does not emit any noise when processing.Apps:I just dropped a lot of cash on my iPad so I am not willing to spend money on apps yet.  I've explored the free ones exclusively.iBooks has me wowed.  Apple offers an array of free novels to meet anyone's taste.  Classics are my liking and I've loaded at least 15 of them.  You can bookmark your pages and skip chapters or browse.  I was impressed by how easy it is to read on the screen as well. I've never been a fan of reading on a computer, but this app opened my eyes to another world. I like having the ability to change the font size to meet my needs.Bloomberg did a great job of creating an app that offers financial news and personalization. I can track my stocks, track indices, and listen to podcasts.  I can't think of a more informative app out there.Installous. Everything your little hacker heart desires.  If you like installous on your iPhone, you'll appreciate it on your iPad.***********Edit:  Downside found!  Charging this device can be a pain.  I just hooked it up with a USB to my work computer (PC) and, the top right hand corner reads \"not charging.\"  Apple's website states the following:\"Some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad. When this occurs the message \"Not Charging\" appears in the status bar next to the battery icon.\"Be that as it may, other websites are claiming the Ipad still charges even though the screen states otherwise.

Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called \"DocsAnywhere\" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "iPad 64gb....

In many ways, there is just not much here -- design wise -- to comment on. The bulk of its surface is taken up by a 9.7-inch, 1024 x 768, capacitive, multitouch LED-backlit display surrounded by a glossy black bezel that some will say is too wide but, in practice, is an important design consideration that prevents the touchscreen from being inadvertently activated when handled. There's only Apple's signature \"home\" button to interact with, and the back of the device is a dutifully simple piece of curved aluminum. Like most Apple products, it's a beauty to behold, but it's not exactly notable for design flourishes; simply put, it's good looking but not terribly exciting. But if the design of the iPad is an exercise in restraint, it only serves to reinforce how formidable this technology feels once it's in your hands. The device has some heft, weighing in at 1.5 pounds, but is still comfortable to hang onto at most angles. Considering the computing power of the tablet, a thickness that tops out at half an inch is pretty impressive, too. But how does it feel in your hands? Well, that matte aluminum on the back surprisingly communicates warmth (though we don't recommend resting this on any bare flesh on a cold morning), and the rest of the design gets out of the way and lets you concentrate on what is really most important: that screen. And that's kind of the point, isn't it?The iPad does house a few other components you should be aware of: a volume rocker and screen position lock (which forces the device to remain in landscape or portrait mode) on the upper right hand side, a power / sleep button and headphone jack on either side of its top edge, and Apple's famous 30-pin dock connector alongside a single thin speaker on the bottom of the unit. There is nothing outwardly notable about the buttons or layout on the iPad -- if you've used an iPod touch or iPhone, you'll find yourself right at home... and that's exactly how Apple wants it.As far as ergonomics are concerned, the standard seated-with-iPad-in-lap move is a completely comfortable experience, but there are definitely use cases where handling a flat slab becomes a pain. For instance, single finger typing becomes a bit of a game of hunt-and-peck, and that's the situation you find yourself in if you're ever standing with the iPad or holding the device with your other hand. We mentioned that iPad has some weight to it, and while it's comfortable to hold, it is considerably more of a handful than an iPhone. You'll feel that weight in your arms after extended period of keeping it aloft. Apple promo videos like to show their users happily grabbing the iPad and swinging their legs up onto a table -- Fonz style -- but if you're like us, most of your heavy text entry is done while seated at a standard table or desk, which means that unless you have a dock you're going to be typing on the iPad as a flat surface. The thing is, we actually found the flat-typing experience to be pretty good; it takes a little getting used to, but it's not totally bizarre either. In fact, we'd say it's a much more enjoyable experience than single-hand typing. Still, just as with the iPhone, there is a learning curve here that may diminish some hit-and-run shoppers' interest.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "solid and easy to use", "Author": "Jon Santacroce", "ReviewID": "RV2DJ32ZJCU36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have both apple and google based products and the ipad is simply the best all around device period.

I like to type on mobile devices so one of my first concerns was whether I could use the virtual keyboard. I was pleasantly surprised that the keys, in landscape mode, are just in the right place and I can basically touch type. I did buy the dock with its real keyboard but don't use it. The screen keyboard is very effective for me.Another pleasant surprise I got is that, while I agree that this is not the end-all for e-reading (vs. the Kindle and such), it is outstanding for video. With streaming services such as Netflix it can be a nice TV and movie viewer for a single viewer or even two people.Finally the reason I gave it four stars rather than five is because I am a heavy user of my iTouch and the iPad doesn't add a whole lot to the experience. For me I measure the value of the iPad against the iTouch which I had been a big user of for over a year before I bought the iPad. The iPad does offer the touch typing that I can't nearly match on the iTouch. I can only thumb-type (at best) on the iTouch so the iPad offers a real writing experience against the clumsy iPod typing experience. But otherwise the iPad just doesn't get a lot of use for my set of apps because of size. I have the iPod with me all of the time and the iPad is larger so I only use it at home as a lightweight laptop substitute.In summary I'd say Apple made a good, very appealing product. I would recommend it to an Apple fan or someone who wants an outstanding web browsing and video experience. A particular strength is the browser which has the legendary multi-touch interface in the iTouch plus the better screen real estate. I would say it is the best plain browsing experience I have had on any device.

So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There are no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily.I would strongly suggest you to take a look at the Acer aspire 1410-2497 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. An adequatley equiped netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. And also when in keypad mode the keypad takes up like half of the screen. With a netbook you have a dedicated screen. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now.Gripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this.If you want one to take on vacations and to be able to look up places to eat or just to take to the coffee shop and do some web browsing then just get an itouch. It will serve it's purpose less expensive and you can carry it in your pocket and have with you all the time. On vacation it can come in handy. Most places have free wifi now. And if you have kids, just whip it out when they drive you crazy. Sure it's smaller than an ipad but your not going to carry an ipad around with you everywhere on vacation.So great for lounging, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. It does have it's place in the world but unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. Unless you use the ipad apps. And I believe the apps are limited on what you can do. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?Everyone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying.

It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a \"giant iPod Touch,\" although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.Completely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for \"couchsurfing\" and \"bedsurfing\" (and, uh, \"poopsurfing\") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.Basically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.I see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing \"augmented-reality\" applications.Lastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware of Return policy", "Author": "David Rosenberg", "ReviewID": "REQ1ORNMNED5Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are used to dealing with Amazon, and then you start dealing with Apple, pray that you never have a problem with the product.

He had to give up his iPad 1 16GB WiFi-only giant iPod touch model to do it, and it floored me. I spent over 24 hours on it almost totally non-stop after I got it, and between our MC343LL/A Time Capsule providing stable, Apple branded wireless-N AirPort Extreme WiFi and the iOS 4.3.3 it came to me with smoothing early production software on it out, I feel just like I did when I bought my MB325LL/A iMac-I may have gotten the older model, but I got a more pleasing product than a camera crippled iPad 2, no dual-core A5 processor is worth suffering through a crippled rear camera. It pleased me enough that I upgraded my MB531LL/A 2G 16GB iPod touch to the last iOS version it supported, iOS 4.2.1-which previous to the iPad I was diametrically opposed to doing.The iPad \"just works\", mostly DESPITE but a tiny bit because of iOS 4. A bug fixed iOS 3.2 would have been much more pleasing to me, but I didn't get that opportunity. Plus Apple's decision to torpedo, obsolete, and deprecate the perfectly functioning MobileMe for some stupid as everything iCloud service just makes me fume and want to hold on to what works for personal life and school.Apple's background machinations excepted, the iPad is front and center the best device I have ever seen bar all but the Macintosh 128k, who is the second-most remote Apple ancestor of the paradigm OS X 10.7 and iOS 5 are replacing. The 128k is still tops in my book, but the iPad is second. It is just so amazing I can't get over it. How did Apple make something that, despite their terrible record as a company under the Jobs regime of 1998-present, so fulfills (like the MB325LL/A iMac, the MC374LL/A MacBook Pro, the MB531LL/A iPod touch, the MC343LL/A Time Capsule, and the MB404LL/A MacBook White while I had it) all the hype Apple puffs up for it? Now the other devices you could say Apple didn't have to puff up quite so much, as they were improvements on existing devices (the iPod touch is a PalmPilot that works how I always desired one to work) but the iPad it had to puff up extra big because the Windows XP, Vista, and 7 tablets nor the Modbook from Axiotron, great though the latter one especially supposedly is, were a totally different type of device. Totally different. The iPad therefore had to be convincing that people actually needed it and could have a use for it. Once I got the primary production Intel Macs and the chance came along, I got the iPad and it meets EVERY SINGLE FREAKING THING Apple puffed it up to be and do.Well, for as long as MobileMe is still on life support. Once it's off life support, iCloud will spell the doom of some of the iPad's most incredible features, but then again the loss of MobileMe is what pushed an iPad into my hands, so I can't complain much at all-because otherwise I couldn't write this review.Go iPad! Go iPad! Go iPad! Even though your name may sound like a feminine product, go iPad! Three cheers for iPad! Hurrah! Huzzah! Hurrah!An outstanding yes to the question of whether or not I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Apple as a company however, I am forever angry at now.But we're not reviewing Apple...Update Independence Day 2011 (also will go on my MacBook Pro MC374LL/A review):I just wanted to add that when the MacBook Pro and iPad are added to my iMac and iPod touch (even an old, not fully iOS 4 supported 2G 16GB iPod touch like mine) I have flexibility that was worth waiting for, and I will have a great deal of it still even after the iCloud transition. I find that, for my personal needs, the MacBook Pro plus iPad is a far more flexible solution than expecting either a MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, or iPad 1 or 2 either one to be your in between device by itself. No one computer, none that I have ever seen, could even remotely hope to do all the varied tasks I want a computer to do all by itself, although a MacBook Pro Spring 2010 like I have with some iPad like periodical apps from the Mac App Store that enable it to have the periodical reading capability of the iPad while still having the traditional computing capability of the same MacBook Pro the way I have it now, would come awfully close (especially with the one cable plus adapter HDMI output capability.) With that said, I prefer having multiple options even with such a scenario, because my parents need to use a computer too (and I want the MacBook Pro primarily to myself.)So, with those caveats dispensed with, I love having the flexibility of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard plus Windows 7 capable primary laptop-indeed, primary computer, as the MacBook Pro has almost totally taken over for the iMac in practice, freeing it up for Momma or Daddy, with both OS options currently coexisting through Boot Camp, and I love having the iPad for the fun stuff that it is perfect for. I can also supposedly use it to read my textbooks, and I am excited about that prospect.The MacBook Air, by contrast, seems like a super-upscale (in both features and quality) netbook, whether the Apple diehards want to admit that or not. The iPad and MacBook Pro on the other hand, are immensely capable when used as intended computing devices which just simply are the best in their classes. The MacBook Air is too, it's just in a class I don't need.Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Un producto que hay que tener para disfrutar", "Author": "Jose Velasco (venezuela)", "ReviewID": "RUQN9IF91PX0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "He sido usuario de un iphone 3G y actualmente dispongo de un iphone 4.

The New York Times free app has enough stories to get me to and from work, and the ebook reader is quite easy to use. There are a ton of free books out there, mostly books in the public domain, but that's fine with me since I like to read old literature. The music and game apps are numerous and very good. The web is extremely fast and the pad \"just works\".On the downside, the iPad doesn't come with a clock or alarm clock utility. You can buy apps written for this purpose, but, since there's no multitasking, you can't depend on them to work. For example, if you have a meeting scheduled, and your alarm clock app set, the meeting notice will pop up and prevent the alarm on the clock from ever going off.Magazines look awesome on the iPad, particularly Wired and Time. The downside is that you can't buy a subscription and have to pay a very inflated price. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. I wish more magazines were available, and I wish I could get the entire New York Times delivered to the iPad in one fell swoop since I don't have a wifi connection on the subway I ride (the workaround is to go to all the articles before leaving the house, which puts them in a cache for reading later).Another downside is that you still have to sync the pad to itunes to do any kind of backup or file transfers, and the sync HAS TO be done via cable. At this point, with such a poweful technology, I cannot believe Apple doesn't just automatically sync/backup the ipad wirelessly when it gets near its \"mother\" computer. Likewise, there should be some way to map the free space on the pad as a drive to transfer files to and from the device.The glare problem is bad if you're trying to read in bright sunlight, but I read mostly at night in bed and on the subway so it's not an issue for me. The backlighting is actually very nice for reading in bed.Overall, a very nice device. The screen size is just right to watch movies and TV on the go. Lots of apps are available. The word processor and spreadsheet app (sold separately) are very nice, even if syncing back to a PC or Mac is a bit of a pain.I've been taking my iPad on trips instead of my laptop PC--it is a good device for travelling and lets me get basic work done (e-mail, web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets).I'm sure the device will only get better over time.Please note that amazon's price for the 64-gig model is higher than buying it at the Apple store, even after tax.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it !", "Author": "Regina Maria", "ReviewID": "RIJCG0LXNA9W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no nerd, so something that's basically self-explanatory is great for me.

Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Old Old Generation", "Author": "Eric Shepperd", "ReviewID": "R23FAGOQ9UIK8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product had dings on it and it was the very first apple IPad.

It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from \"internet disks\" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to \"internet disks\".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses \"tricks\" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "meh...", "Author": "smith", "ReviewID": "R2MJFJSIV1Q9WZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "so i found myself about to do a lot of traveling and deciding to test drive the iPad as a portable, temporary replacement for my very heavy laptop.  i got the iPad, the wireless keyboard, and a few other gadgets thrown in.after using it heavily for about four days now, i have come to the conclusion that this thing is really just a toy for people who can afford a $600 toy, $8 with all the crap thrown in.i honestly don't like anything about it except for watching movies.  reading books/pdfs also okay but i'd rather read an actual book.  and the thing is honestly much heavier than you think once you start holding it for awhile.the mail program is very unwieldy and not easy to organize.  multitasking -infamously - does not exist.  \"notes\" is dismally aesthetically ugly.pages, downloaded a la carte from iWork - at least on the iPad -  just honestly blows.  it's very difficult to use well tapping the glass, and this is with the wireless keyboard to type on!  it's not intuitive, it's not quick, it's not easy to format.  it's nothing i need it to be and everything i don't.if you can afford the 600 bones to watch your netflix movies and want to do that on a screen you can put on your belly, more power to you.  but i'm going to be returning this thing asap.  and, no, i won't be checking out the iPad2 or 3.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "acceptable product", "Author": "alyssia taylor", "ReviewID": "R2GG5JQ27T9IWC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When a person say acceptable who is it acceptable for the buyer.

His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking.  This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him.  So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son.  He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him.  He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting.  There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (NOT covered by insurance).  We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle.  But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad.  I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything.  I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device.  (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc.  Then don't buy it.  But you won't convince me.  I've been using my son's - and now I want my own!  Books, email, etc.  I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids.

Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.The iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.On the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in \"competing\" with iPad.This is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that.

At least 2/3 don't work with there!- impossible to synchronize to a PC that does not have an Intel chip. good luck on that one, since you MUST at least synchronize it once!- no camera, whether front facing or rear facing- no USB ports,- no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,- no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),- on-screen keyboard is not practical, if you need to type a bit, use a REAL laptop- screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,- there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,- no SD or other card readers for your photos,- screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,- ridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)- very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)- much pricier than alternative tablets like Archos with way more features and openness- you cannot change the browser for a better one. remember Apple is a closed system- expensive data plans if you use 3G- no support for email attachments. feels like back in the 1990's.- to watch movies from your PC, you have to download a video converter, or buy them from iTunes- Air Video (which enables you to watch videos you have loaded into iTunes) only works with a few routers, and notably not with any AT&T; Routers at all- no tethering to anything- no common laptop/netboook features: security software, voice recorder, or calculator- extraordinarily fragile device, do not drop it on your carpet, it WILL break.- heavier than you think. You won't be able to hold it in your hand for long.- cannot rest flat on a table or your lap, you will block the WiFi antenna behind the Apple logo and weaken your WiFi signal.And finally, to do anything you need on the iPad, you still need to connect it regularly to a PC or a Mac. You have to connect in order to sync up your latest podcasts and media files. You need to sync to get OS updates.

But it still has its place.", "Author": "Shoot Me \"The Messenger\"", "ReviewID": "R1D0JZA0QOVSG5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "THE IDEALImagine this: A tablet Mac with a pressure-sensitive touch screen that turns Photoshop into a one-stop Wacom-killing portable graphic design supersolution. It has a built-in iSight camera (as most Macs do) so you can video Skype with anybody in the world at any time, thereby creating a revolution in telecommunications and the eventual death of the cell phone! 3G is built in, so you can video chat any time without needing additional hardware peripherals. It has (at least) one USB port, just like the MacBook Air, so you can upload your pictures to iPhoto easily... unless you shot your photos directly from the iPad's iSight camera (which BTW swivels to either be front-facing or outward-facing). The device runs OS X just like any other Mac, so you can run all of your professional graphic design or pro audio applications on it, with the touch of a finger! That's right, it runs a version of OS X that fully supports pressure-sensitive multi-touch functionality. The price is between $1000 and $1500 depending on the configuration you get.Since hearing early rumors of an Apple tablet this is what I imagined and was hoping for. Now I am disappointed because my idealist expectations have not been lived up to. But enough about what isn't - let's discuss what is...THE REALITYThe iPad is not a Mac. It's a big-ass iPod touch. No, it's not even a big-ass iPhone, or something that can replace a phone. It's a big-ass iPod touch. It doesn't support Flash, or any other Adobe products. Steve Jobs has made enemies with both Adobe and Google now and you, the consumer, are bearing the consequences. OK, to be fair, it's not entirely Steve's fault, but he doesn't appear to be cooperatively working toward a solution for us.It lacks an iSight camera, so forget video chatting. There is only one port on it, which is the 30-pin connector for syncing with iTunes and charging. If you want to pay extra for the adapter, there is one that will allow you to plug in your USB camera or SD card. It makes sense when you consider it from Apple's perspective: allowing standard USB functionality would mean that you could just plug in your own thumb drive (or hard drive) and instantly upgrade a 16GB model to a 48GB model (or more). For me this all feels limiting since I am used to being able to open Finder and see/edit all of my documents, software, even system files, and transfer them to any external device.This leads me to my final gripe: All of the software you install on this device must be approved my Apple. It all goes through the App Store, folks. That means you can't install things that Apple doesn't like... i.e. torrent software, adult content, competing browsers like FireFox, your cracked version of the Adobe Creative Suite (not that I would do this), and all open-source software. Even if Apple approves some competitor's software (like Skype and Dropbox), they can pull those titles from the App Store as soon as they decide they dislike them. This disempowers you as an end-user. Apple is asking the masses to surrender their computing freedoms and since the majority of consumers don't grasp these concepts it is allowed to continue. 1984 was not like \"1984\", but 2010 sure is.Also, if you already own an iPhone and pay AT&T; $30 a month for 3G data, get ready to do it all over again with the iPad. That's right, $60/month if you own both!On a positive note, I commend both Apple and AT&T; for making the 3G version free of a 2-year contract. This is exciting news. Another pleasant surprise of the iPad has been the price. It ranges from just $500 to $830 in cost, depending on the configuration.CONCLUSIONSEven though the iPad is nothing like what I had been hoping for, can it be a solution for some people? YES! Yes, it can.The people who will benefit most from the iPad are people with simple needs looking for a cheap portable computer. It's not for me, but I can't say that it's not for some people. It's a cool device for kids to play games on or for your grandma to send you emails from, but it's not for multimedia professionals or die-hard Mac people. It's not a computer and we just have to accept that.Can it do some things that a Mac can't? Yes! It can run almost all of the same apps that your iPhone or iPod touch can, which is pretty cool. And most importantly, it has portable versions of all three iWork applications. This means you can create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on the go. The iWork apps are a step in the right direction for the iPad, making it more computer-like. I have been a fan of iWork since its initial conception on the Mac and it has always been easier to use and produced more professional-looking results than anything MS Office (or even Open Office) has had to offer. But don't expect the iPad versions of the iWork titles to boast the same full set of features as the Mac versions.To be fair, we must also consider that the iPad platform is still brand new and we will surely see many more apps released for it that will be useful to many people.OVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS1. iPad - Best for reading e-books, running apps, watching videos, web-browsing, emailing, creating simple documents, and listening to music.2. Hackintosh netbook - Apple hates them, but they're the cheapest portable platform for OS X and they do the job! I admit, I'm a fan.3. MacBook Air - It's a bit large, it's lacking in ports, it's overpriced, but it's lightweight and it's the smallest Mac you can get.4. ModBook - For those who just must have an Apple tablet. It's basically a Wacom screen tablet fused with a MacBook. Cool, but expensive.5. iPhone/iPod touch - You should be familiar with these by now. One is a phone with a paid internet subscription. The other is Wi-Fi only.6. PC netbook - Eeewww! Don't do this. You're only hurting yourself. (Linux users are somewhat excused)  :-)7. Amazon Kindle - The iPad has succeeded in making the Kindle and other e-book readers obsolete. Don't get it.Thanks for reading.

If you want functional devices then stay away from iPads! My $250 Toshiba netbook is far more functional than the cheapest iPad of $500. Heck, iPad does not even have a standard USB port (my Toshiba has THREE!). For iPad, you are supposed to dish out some (MORE) hard earned money to get an Apple-approved gadget to get the USB functionality. See how you are being fleeced?Don't fall for the Apple hype. Educate yourselves about what you are about to buy/into. Yes, iPAD is very fluid and my Toshiba can't match that fluidity. But the Toshiba is adequate for web surfing, easier to handle (light weight), has a physical keyboard, and has a 6-cell battery which lasts 5-6+ hours. And, running Windows 7, it has access to tens of thousands of free and time-tested Windows software out there.One more myth-busting about Windows: The Toshiba has NEVER been infected by viruses or trojans even though it does not run any anti-virus software. I take it to public places and hook up to public WiFi, still no issues. No 'Blue Screen of Death' either.
