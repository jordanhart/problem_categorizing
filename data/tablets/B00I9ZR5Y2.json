{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only slightly better, double the price.", "Author": "Ai Wintermute", "ReviewID": "R3O7B8NMWPT8EX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been using a Toshiba Encore for months as my primary computer, using a Y cable with power and a dock.  These Bay Trail machines are very capable devices.  However at the writing of this review, the TP8 has been out for nearly 5 months, and Lenovo cant even deliver them.Now that the Encore is $205 with prime shipping, it makes the TP8 even more pointless.Starting with the so called benefits:1920X1200 res screen:  At first glance, this seems like a really positive benefit of getting the TP8 over any other 8\" Windows 8.1 device, however after using Windows 8.1 on such a tiny display with that resolution, it quickly becomes a disadvantage.  Its hard enough using standard legacy windows apps at 1280x800, the same apps at 1920x1200 on such a small screen, become unusable with a finger.USB 3.0:  Sure, USB 3.0 is much faster than USB 2.0, who wouldn't buy this machine to gain that extra speed?  Oh... Wait... The USB port is also the POWER PORT, so when you get home and you want to plug your dock in, plug in your large monitor, keyboard, mouse, external hard drives, etc.  Suddenly you realize that you cant POWER THE MACHINE...  A problem with EVERY 8\" Windows tablet and clearly Lenovo put no thought into this, even though they advertise it with a \"DESKTOP MODE\".  MORONIC!Z3770 CPU:  Yes, its faster than the other devices using the Z3740, but only marginally, NOT worth more than DOUBLE THE PRICE.Lenovo could have released a very good competitor to the market place, instead they bring a slightly better machine at double the price and even then, they cant even deliver that.LENOVO HAS FALLEN SO FAR, SINCE THE CHINESE BOUGHT THEM...", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I9ZR5Y2"}}
