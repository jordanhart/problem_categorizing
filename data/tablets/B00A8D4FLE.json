YOU DO NOT GET WHAT IS DESCRIBED", "Author": "DVD Techie \"As you wish...\"", "ReviewID": "RREQ7CHK5K105", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is not at all the tablet described. It is an A7 not A* CPU (only 1ghz NOT 1.2). It also appears to have only 2BG ram NOT 4gb and no keyborad.  I mean if this was advertised as such and $15 bucks less it may be ok, but false advertisement is 0 stars!If the seller reads these reviews, please contact me and Jim.  I spent many hours set up the tablet, so I don't really want to send it back, I just want the promised keyboard.  The specs being a little off aren't that bad since it still works for my son.  If it came with the keyboard i would have given 4 Stars.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutly aweful!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Allen D. Warren \"ADWarren\"", "ReviewID": "RPZXATD0XZOJ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet is aweful! keyboard is hard to type with and may not come with it at all! Internet is slow and bad, not very good at searching up things, or finding what you need. If you get an app it will usually not let you get on it at all, will freeze up all the time and not very good with internet related apps. Mostly consisting with twitter, instagram, facebook, groupon, or practically all of them! Freezing up is a major problem!!! Camera is not good a pictures (light and focus problems). Will loose your internet quickly and a lot. I've only had like 5 times that this tablet has actually worked. Always shutting down constantly (on its own or if you have to do it because it freezes up). If you leave it on overnight or just for a few minutes it will probably stop working, like mine did right now! By the way this is coming from a kid!!!
