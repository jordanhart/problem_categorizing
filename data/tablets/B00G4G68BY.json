Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about.  If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game).  Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\".  Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"Luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems.  It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay.  Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together.  The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online.  Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading News stories.  As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the UK Daily Mail newspaper Online - personally I prefer a web digest from free app Zite).* Reading Books.  It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages.  Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films.  I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Reading and replying to mail.  I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos.  Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games.  From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio.  With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.  My personal favourite is London UK based XFM - alternative rock* Listening to music.  I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* The list goes on and on.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen.  If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay.  Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet.  A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen.  Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air.  Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference).  Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options.  The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store (which I would highly recommend - fantastic service), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory:  Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc).  However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+$100 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air).  But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads.  Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out.  Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular:  Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about.  This will add an additional +$100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card.  This means (for an additional $5-10 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move.  Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover.  Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it.  There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen.  Apple charge from $35 to $65 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from $10.  Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard ($20-$70), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor).  I'd recommend the ogitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Grey and the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully.  For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone.  Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.How should I set it up?--------------------------Well, if you already own an iPad or iPhone it's incredibly easy.  Just log in with your existing iTunes and iCloud accounts, and select the option to either set this up as a new iPad or restore from backup.If you've never owned an iPad before - read on to hear about how to set up an iTunes and iCloud account - it certainly confused me the first time I used them.+ iTunes account - is how you buy your music, Apps or films from Apple.  You register your credit card with them, and protect the account with a secure password+ iCloud account - is used to identify you as an individual.  This gives you 5Gb of backup space (your iPad will be automatically backed up when you charge it), and also means your iPad will work together with your iPhone.How to set them  up:1) Create a SINGLE iTunes account for your immediate family and children.  Then when you buy an App, it's immediately available (for free) to all the family members.  Maybe once the children reach 15-16 they'll want their own account (as otherwise they'll end up spending your hard earned cash on your credit card to buy music you don't want).  Until then - it's a great way to share the Apps.2)  Create YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL iCloud account for person.  That means if you buy an iPhone you can share data (eg. reminders, notes or calendar events) across both devices.  If you're partner (and maybe even children) have their own iCloud account they also have 5Gb of space, and can keep their own notes and documents private.Easy when you know how.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip.  Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including  + iMovie - edit and publish home made movies  + Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad  + Pages - Word processor  + GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit  + iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat.As the UK based consumer magazine \"Which?\" magazine put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested.  Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart.  If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "ReviewID": "R2RCYFJ9NNSROC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is everything I imagined it would be and a lot more. This latest generation iPad is so much lighter than previous versions; it is now approaching the weight of a Kindle - meaning it is easy to hold for a long time. The body is about two inches narrower, making it easier to hold. The retina display is so darn sharp and looks great.The iPad Air finally pushed me to upgrade my original, version 1 of the iPad. I bought that iPad on release day, seemingly millions of years ago. I loved that device, my one complaint was that the iPad was too heavy - everything else about it was great. Now that I've used the Air, I'll never go back. This was an upgrade well worth doing.November 2, 2013 Update: After using this for two days and thinking harder about the iPad, I figured you might want a few reasons why this might not be for you. Your iPad works just great and you don't do much more than read email, play angry birds, and look at websites all at home. In my case I went from a slow turtle first generation iPad to this lightning fast new version - I'm blown away. And if you have a latest previous version and get a great deal on recycling your current model (read at least $200) then it might make a lot of sense. This is an expensive device, and a MacBook Air is not all that far away from the iPad, after you add $60 for a case, $100 for two years of accidental breakage coverage, and maybe $60 for a keyboard. A MacBook Air at $1100 suddenly doesn't look all that expensive anymore, especially if you opt for the 128GB option of the iPad. Of course there is nothing like holding one of these new iPads and they are super sweet. If you are super logical and conservative, this is probably not the device for you.On the other hand, I decided to jump in both feet first.Setup was super fast and easy. There is a good step-by-step wizard to get the device running. Since I have an iCloud account, I was blown away with how fast this thing synced. That whole improved WiFi antenna is not hype - the device connected quickly with my network. Most devices take a while to connect to my network, this was painless and fast. Filling in the information for my mail account, it seemed like seconds and new email was downloaded - significantly faster than my other iPad.I had a choice during set up to restore from a backup or set up the unit as new. I chose new device, so none of my apps loaded right away. If I had chosen a backup, I could plug this into my computer and with iTunes could have grabbed my purchased apps. All incredibly seamless.Video is stunning. Amazon Prime Video took seconds to start (I've gotten used to 15-20 seconds). The video started in standard def, and within 15 seconds switched to high def. So much faster than happens even on my PS3. I have never seen buffering move this fast, scanning forward, there was a 5 second delay for buffering and the movie resumed. Sound is much better than the single speaker. It is still not great, just more passable. It is silly that they put two speakers on the bottom of the iPad. A speaker on top and bottom would give movies stereo. Music sounds better. Two speakers put out more sound, the stereo effect is minimal, the two speakers are one inch apart.This is an incredible display for films. The blacks are deep, rich, and have great tone range. Out of the box, this display looks fantastic.Everything moves so darn fast. Switching apps is a snap. New apps load with a blink of an eye.I'm glad I bought the full size iPad; Apple got this size and weight exactly right. I think this is well worth the extra $100 over the retina mini to be released the end of November. Apple has blurred the lines between these two devices. I guess they've done the same thing with iPods, so it makes sense they would do it with the iPad.If you've used iOS 7 on an iPhone, the iPad is essentially the same thing - you will feel right at

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version.  My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot.  Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad.  In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long.  Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed.  The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing.  The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user.  The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air.  I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.  The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce.  The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size.  The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps.  It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved.  It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!  This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.

I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful product, non-premium hardware.", "Author": "Avenging Taco", "ReviewID": "R52KR35VM0NQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several Apple products, and the iPad is the most distinguished among Apple's line up relative to its competition.  The most compelling aspects of this tablet are the beautiful design, and the 10 hour battery life.  These are the two features that made me decide to purchase another Apple product irrespective of their business practices which try to squeeze money out of their customers by not supporting devices properly after they are released.After having used this product for over a month now, I can say it is an improvement over my iPad 1.  The browser now crashes on the original to the point of making it worthless.  My original iPad had 256 MB of RAM which is not enough to load a lot of modern web pages without the browser crashing.  That is why I had hoped the 1 GB of RAM in the iPad Air would be sufficient, and it has improved, yet I still find that the browser crashes on occasion.  The scroll latency is very subtle, but noticeable to me.  It doesn't really impact my usage, but it could create problems for people who game on their iPads.  Putting in 2 GB of RAM (which is what I have in my Nexus 4) does not cost that much, and would improve the performance greatly.  For a premium product, I expect the best, and Apple has consistently under-delivered on processing hardware which created the same problems all the way back to the iPhone 1 I purchased on launch day.I take 1 star off for business practices which burn through your pocket, and the second star is removed for needless low-RAM browser crashes that are still a problem on the latest iteration (which is likely planned to force relegation of old devices and compel new sales.)  Still, I can say that this is the best 10 inch tablet available, and android has no viable alternative worth purchasing.  If you can overlook the two biggest strikes I have against Apple, you should consider no other 10 inch tablet at this time.UPDATE 1/17/14Today I called into Apple support because my browser is crashing frequently.  I am now experiencing 5 - 10 browser crashes a day when it was only 2 - 3 times a week when I first purchased it.  Speaking with the Apple support technician, he said that they have not received many complaints about this issue yet, so I may be experiencing a rare software or hardware problem.  I looked through my crash log (which had over 100 crash reports in it since Nov. 11th) and the vast majority of them were low memory crashes.  However, the tablet did not operate this way when I initially purchased it, and it began to increase in frequency about 2 weeks ago.  Therefore I suspect that there is a software conflict (I still have 4 GBs of free flash hard drive space, so I doubt it is a conflict with virtual memory, although a RAM hardware problem is possible).  I went through some basic procedures the technician recommended, and I was advised to do a system wipe if the problems should persist.  I will test the tablet for a few days before wiping everything and starting over. I'll update this review once I am confident of what the issue was.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple still rules the tablet world.", "Author": "Makavelli02", "ReviewID": "R3AWGSO5C50M8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of let me tell you I am not an apple fanboy. I own and support samsung products. I carry a galaxy note 2 with me every day and would not consider an iPhone until the make some huge changes to it. Last year I bought a nexus 7 and loved it. Now that it's specs are getting a little dated I had to look for an upgrade. The new nexus 7 didn't impress me with it's dated CPU. So I looked to the note 2014 and the iPad air. I used both side by side and researched every detail. I sell these things for a living. The note is very impressive but, for all it's stats and hardware features it still struggles with simple movements. You can point out is 3 gigs of ram and the very good snapdragon 800 quad core CPU. Then you have apples 1 gig of ram with the measly dual core a7 CPU. ????? Now for the real world facts and it pains me to say this because I love android, but the fact is the a7 in the iPad air with it's upgraded clock speed at 1.39 gigs has yet to be matched in any bench mark from another mobile processor including the quad core s 800 by snapdragon. And with the future in mind the 64 bit tech is hard to beat. Them to the 1 gig of ram vs the 3 gigs in the note. If you can't use all that horsepower why put it in there. The air is twice as snappy as the note with no lag what so every. The note on the other hand lags even on swiping through home screens. It all comes down to the operating system apple remains king. Android may be pretty and customizable but that all comes at a cost. That cost is performance. You can take a car with 500 horsepower and put it on a curvy bending road. All that horsepower doesn't mean a thing. The car with 200 horsepower will still win by going straight.So I bought the air and love it.

They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me.

I've had original iPad, iPad 3, and now the Air. Many people may say iPad is not worth the price for what it does, but in my case, it was worth every penny. I used iPad 3 and now the Air mostly for browsing the web, reading textbooks, and occasional gaming, and for these tasks iPad Air is perfect; not to mention, I've saved a couple of hundreds on textbooks already. Air is much lighter and faster than the other iPads I've had so far. Now, I can easily hold it longer while reading longer texts, and I can see the performance increase in web browsing and games.Mini vs. Air DilemmaI first got the new iPad Mini with Retina display, because the Apple sales person said it is identical to iPad Air in every aspect other than screen size. Of course it turned out to be wrong, since mini is a bit slower and has the display color accuracy issue. After a week, I went back and exchanged the mini for iPad Air. While mini is a wonderful tablet, I was keeping it much closer to my eyes that I liked to. Web browsing also suffered a lot on a smaller screen of the mini even with Retina. With iPad Air, everything is back to normal again, and I can browse the web more easily now.Wi-Fi vs. 4G CellularI have had the cellular version of iPad 3 and the original iPad. To be honest, I only enabled the service for a few months and disabled it afterwards. I find myself to be always near Wi-Fi networks, either at school or work, so I decided to get the Wi-Fi version this time. Another reason was that I can always turn on the Hot-Spot feature on my phone, and share the internet with iPad Air. Because of these points, it didn't make any sense to pay $130 more for the cellular version.Games and PerformanceI've tried a few games, including Dead Trigger 2, and the 3D performance is very good. The new A7 processor really shines here. I am sure new wave of 3D and 64-bits games will come to iPad pretty soon, and if you are into gaming, definitely go with larger than 16GB models. The web browsing performance has been increased as well, so you can browse the web more fluidly.ConclusionI am pretty happy with my purchase. The free iLife and iWork packages with the purchase of new iPad from Apple sealed the deal for me. It is much better than my previous iPad 3, and I definitely love the new reduced weight. The performance increase is also noticeable both in games and web browsing.

I am neither an apple/pc/android fanboy, I use the tool that gets the job done reliably. (Ever have a paper due and your computer breaks down?) I own a macbook, iphone, windows desktop, and had a Nexus 7 for a short time but wanted a tablet with a larger screen.So lets get down to it- initial impression was \"Wow!\" and I never realized how chunky or laggy the Nexus 7 was. The resolution, animations, user interface, and general build quality is superb in my opinion. It feels like a device \"that will get work done\". Unfortunately, the iPad out of the box feels like a digital storefront for the App store as opposed to something I can do school work on. Bluntly, the device is unnecessarily handicapped. For me to put my own videos on it, I have to use Handbrake and waste 3-4 hours to convert the movie to something the iPad can play. The Nexus 7 played almost any format out of the box. Using textbook PDFs is horrible, there are only a few quality apps that offer continuous scrolling. If your course requires mymathlabs, webassign, or one of those other edu-gimmicks to do homework, good luck, most of them require Flash which is unsupported. Then I went to use safari.. advertisements everywhere! Same with every free app, constant advertisements! Occasionally I have to download PDF to read for course work. Ain't happening in safari- there is no way to download and the page will refresh if you close the app. Good luck reading where there is no wifi.Then I jailbroke it, installed f.lux, adblockerNetworks, safari downloader, nitrous, retinapad, vplayer video player, and videopane. That took care of the blinding blue light at night time, killed off 90% of advertisements, I can download files now, iPhone only apps are now in HD, I can watch almost any format of video too. Now the device is useful!After that, I installed DocsToGo to read PDFs with continuous scrolling and to write papers. I also HIGHLY recommend Notes Plus if you intend on hand writing notes. Lastly, I would suggest getting the \"Papers\" app (no typo) to read PDFs with multiple columns.Overall, iPad has a lot of potential but is held back by Apples walled garden. After jailbreaking and eliminating the majority of the artificial handicaps, I feel OK with heading to school only with it and not worrying about it not being capable of doing something.

I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video.

The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer!

Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive).

Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3W2AOZWQH82BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, even for an Android fan.", "Author": "Xachary Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "RSJSN0GPTVMU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have historically been an Android person, However, this time I decided to give Apple a whirl.

You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Author": "T.

One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.

In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network.

Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality.

Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.

But not without some downfalls due to recent changes.", "Author": "Sean Cushman", "ReviewID": "RNGUUYGUJBQ80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright so I know if you are reading this then you already have your mind set on a new iPad and hey you know what? That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty.

Great to play games on, manage finances, edit photos, etc. all on a generously sized high resolution screen. I like that mine came with a screen protector. That was a plus. Make sure to buy a protective case and/or apple smart cover - as it completes the whole experience rather nicely. I got a handmade pouch/sleeve to carry it in at a really good price on Etsy, just search for ipad sleeve and there will be many different styles to choose from. Best tip I can give to the cellular device users is to go to Tmobile and pay the $10 fee for a SIM card that will give you 200MB of free LTE data for LIFE! Even though it's true that once you go over the limit, the speed is reduced to 2G, there are no overage charges. It's been great for really light data users such as myself as I only need it when not in the presence of a wifi connection (very rare).

It's a nice addition.  Also purchased the wireless keyboard to go along with it for longer e-mails and stuff like that.  It's easy to setup and has long battery life.

After a few days of using the iPad Air and iPad 3 I can tell that an upgrade would not be worth the hassle of putting my older iPad on ebay and making up the difference which would be around $300 I guess (I have the 16 GB version) . Actually, a lot of professional reviewers online recommend exactly this: don't upgrade if you already have either an iPad 3 or iPad 4.The difference in size and weight is (slightly) noticeable when you are picking the device or holding it in your hands. The thing is that I never just hold my iPad in my hands when using it (and I do use it a lot!). Most of its weight goes either to the desk when I am at my desk, or to my lap if I am in my chair, or to my chest if I am on my couch. Which means I am basically using my hand(s) to balance the iPad not to support it. In such situations extra 7 ounces is not a big deal at all.If you are using your iPad differently (for example, playing games a lot) then you might appreciate the iPad Air better. Also, if you just want to have the latest and the coolest iPad then of course that would be worth it too :)Seems like Apple is following the same pattern with both the iPad 2 and the iPad Air, mostly squeezing the same device in a smaller package. This is not good enough for me. I waited until the iPad 3 came out to upgrade my iPad 1 (yes, Retina display was totally worth it!) and I hope that the iPad 6 will be worth an upgrade. But I am not getting into the hassle of replacing my iPad just to get a little bit thinner/narrower and lighter.Making the decision to return the iPad Air got even easier when I realized that its screen has a noticeable yellow tint which makes my iPad 3 look a bit bluish which I like better.Good bye, iPad Air, and lets hope that Apple will be able to impress even the most conservative of us with the iPad 6 in October 2014!

It is lighter, thinner, narrower, faster and has stereo speakers. Its almost half a pound lighter which really makes a difference when holding the ipad in your hands for long periods of time. I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market. It beats any android or microsoft tabelt currently on the market in the 10 inch category. Also it has the most tablet apps.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "li Zhang", "ReviewID": "R3G06TOTR9LDBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's value for money.

I loved my ipad 2 had it for 2 years it never skipped a beat. But know that I have the ipad air it's in a whole new ball park I wouldn't even say that the ipad 2 is even close to the ipad air. Performance wise I do a lot of multi tasking and it doesn't even break a sweat. The picture is brilliant very clear and crisp. The size and structure are amazing light and beautiful very sharp. It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note. That being said I do own a galaxy s4 smart phone and I absolutely love it I just prefer my phone to have a bigger screen,and it has it's other perks as well. mainly the galaxy gear watch sealed the deal for me.
