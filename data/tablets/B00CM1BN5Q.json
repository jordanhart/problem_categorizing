{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mediocre tablet that could have been great", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "RQHP0SXDUB207", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This tablet is pretty good on paper. As much screen resolution as a normal 12-14\" laptop, a \"decent\" netbook processor, 8 hour battery life, and \"free\" Office 2013 (if you don't already own a copy already and want it, it makes the price of this tablet worthwhile). All the things that \"should\" make for a decent tablet, right? I've been stalking this tablet for months now, and preordered it the very hour it popped up on Amazon, and I finally got it on my doorstep this afternoon. What should have been a blissful after lunch experience suddenly became a headache.DISPLAY:Out-of-box Windows Setup uses the customized Acer \"green\" interface. It was at this point that it became clear that this tablet must sport a TN panel -- the green text looked almost checkered from bad flickering, and what is supposed to be a solid green background was a gradient due to the horrible viewing angles. It was almost black past the 50% point to the right. I had read other Acer tablets use an IPS panel, so I had great expectations. They were horrifically shattered. Not only was this not an IPS panel, but it's the worst TN panel I've owned in over a decade.Acer decided to orient the panel to the portrait experience with the Windows physical button on the bottom. This makes landscape usage of the device look horrid, and only acceptable-looking when cocking your head 10-20 degrees to the right of the screen. Windows desktop is hardly usable at 800px wide in portrait mode, so there is no winning that way either. Increasing to max brightness alleviates some of the viewing angle issue, but that's not always a satisfactory answer.Since your left and right eyes are technically viewing the panel from different angles, they each see different shades of colors for the same pixel due to poor viewing angles. This can give your brain a very disturbing sensation as it just doesn't look normal. You can reduce this issue by increasing the distance to your tablet (as per basic trigonometry, this reduces the viewing angle disparity between your left/right eyes) -- but good luck doing that with an 8\" screen and tiny UI elements.Limited viewing angles are one thing. Grainy text from flickering deep colors is yet another thing. This panel also suffers one last critical flaw: it uses a cheap grainy film below the digitizer. It's so pronounced on white web pages that my eyes get caught looking at the grains while scrolling instead of the text. I've seen some screen protectors make the screen rainbow and grainy, but not quite this bad.DISK:4KB: 4.8MB/s Write, 16.1MB/s Read64KB: 11.2MB/s Write, 64.3MB/s Read1MB: 34.0MB/s Write, 82.3MB/s ReadAnything higher than 1MB transfer size didn't improve the rate. This puts the internal flash storage slower than a typical 5400RPM drive for raw transfer, and seek times were mediocre on average. It's nothing to write home about, and almost all Windows-based tablets in this price range have similarly performing internal flash storage, so this wasn't surprising.WIFI:Weak signal (2-3 bars most of the time) ~10ft from the access point, 1 sheetrock wall in between. None of my other devices have signal drops that bad. File transfer speed from a local NAS from that distance was ~3MB/s.PERFORMANCE:With the Atom Z2760, I knew I was getting less power than my 2010 MacBook Air 11\". I read tons of reviews saying that it's vastly improved and performance is smooth. I won't argue that  a lot of Windows 8 \"Metro\" UI apps work sufficiently fast, as expected. A lot of it works faster than my Nexus 7 or my iPad Mini for similar functions, since the CPU is indeed faster than those. But the appeal of this tablet isn't to run watered-down RT-style apps. It's the ability to run legacy apps, like Office. So I timed some core functions:Boot: 31.3 secondsWord: 16.2 seconds first time, 7.1 seconds second time (cached)Excel: 7.2 seconds (Office framework must have been cached from Word)Visual Studio 2012 Express (WD): 13.2 secondsVisual Studio 2012 Express Web: Creating an MVC4 \"Internet\" Project: 58 seconds; First-time project \"Run\" to page load: 37 secondsNumerically, it's slightly faster than my 2007 Eee's. Compared to recent cheap laptops? Slow. Compared to my primary retina MacBook Pro 15? Dog slow. But that's not the metric by which I'm judging this tablet by, so I'm not going to dock any points for the relatively sluggish CPU. I already knew that before buying this tablet. I just wish that it was a bit faster than this, but what can you expect from this price point? Newer CPU generations have better performance, so we'll see how that improves things in the future, I guess.What DOES bother me, however, is the bluetooth performance. On 3 of my bluetooth keyboards, I can easily out-type how fast the tablet can keep up with the input. And when that happens, the bluetooth keyboards will all repeat characters liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike thiisssssssss. I've always wondered if it's my particular keyboards (2 Logitech ones, and an AmazonBasics one) or the host tablet, because I've had it do it on my Nexus and my iPad before, too -- just when the CPU is bogged down. Given how small the tablet is, it's rather hard to be too productive on a tiny on-screen keyboard. It's doable, but I still prefer my bluetooth keyboard.Edit: I just researched it, and apparently, using a Bluetooth mouse in conjunction with the keyboards will cause the repeating to happen, or get worse. I guess I'll have to go buy a micro-USB adapter for this.To wrap it up, this is still a decent tablet, if you must have portable device that can run all your desktop apps. It's slow, but it'll still get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. Patience not included. If your CPU requirements are on the low end, you could definitely get away with hooking up a keyboard+mouse + HDMI display, and make it a portable desktop that you can \"undock\" and take with you lightly. Just make sure you can tolerate bad quality displays, or your eyes will probably be hurting after prolonged use.My particular unit had a speaker issue - sounds like loose cabling or something, but even at 100%, I can only hear faint sounds, along with some serious fuzzy electronic noise. If I plug in headphones, it works perfectly, so I'm guessing it's just a speaker cabling/audio chipset issue. So quality control was really poor overall for this product, in my opinion.Edit: In the end, I couldn't tolerate the display giving me a headache, and the sound issue made for bad usability overall. It went back to Amazon, unfortunately. I wanted it to work out, but there were too many problems.Thanks for reading my review! I hope some of it was useful.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Windows Tablet once you update to 8.1", "Author": "David Bradshaw", "ReviewID": "R2JOXGY02S2QUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I have installed Windows 8.1 (went from Preview to full), it was a pain to upgrade [this is not the tablet's problem], it took forever to download and install and it lost numerous settings and apps once the update finally installed.  I got it installed and everything was working fine and the Start button started working and I have full use of snapping apps side by side.  Windows 8.1 added some really nice features so I recommend updating.  A strange thing is that Office was no longer activated after updating, I had to find the product key (Windows/Office that was in the box) and used it to reactive Office [chose use Product Key instead of account].  After that, Office seems happy.  I also had to disable some of the syncing features, since I started finding my laptop settings were showing up on this tablet and the tablet settings were showing up on my laptop, which was annoying.  I disabled the syncing settings option in the Settings [Start menu style settings] and did this to both machines to stop the settings from syncing.I like this tablet.  It is a good size where you can easily take it along with you and hold it in one hand comfortably.  It feels sturdy and solid and does not fill hollow or flimsy like some cheaper items.  Setup is easy with a few questions you have it setup.  I purchased the Protective Case from a local office store (I looked at the keyboard and it is expensive and makes it so much larger that I do not like it, I did get a BlueTooth keyboard for typing and already had a BlueTooth mouse that pairs easily and works well, however, I only use them when I know I will be sitting and can use it like a laptop).  I really like the protective case.  It is like a simple snap on around the edges (does not interfere with pulling in from the edges) and closes like a book, wraps around for holding like a tablet and also allows for it to stand upright at two different angles (depending on where you are using it).I set the device up and removed all the junk that Acer installed (this is the case with any Windows computer you spend the first few hours uninstalling the junk from the manufacture).  I was surprised to see a recovery disk in the packaging since you never see those anymore, but I guess due to storage space they could not have a partition.  Once I got the computer clean of the junkware it had 11 GB free (Windows takes up a lot of space!!!!).  Oddly enough I updated to Windows 8.1 Preview and after that I had around 14GB of space...  The storage space is very small and you will need more.  I use Dropbox (I would like to use Skydrive but it does not support Symbolic Links on Mac) and I used the Desktop version so I can have my files sync with the tablet (so they are on it even when I am not online, like in the Windows app version).  I also have a 32GB SD card that I used for Video, Music, Photos (I changed my User Folder settings to point all of these to the SD card; and my Dropbox's Document folder is set as the Documents folder for my user account).  I will note it is not recommended to have Dropbox use the Removable Media for the folder (it will not let you, but you could trick it using a Symlink) since if you were to remove the SD card Dropbox would think that all of those files have been deleted and would probably remove them from the Dropbox).This unit also included Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote) which can be activated by opening the Office Activation and choosing I have a Product Key and entering the Key on the card that was in the box.  After about 15 minutes Office was installed and the programs were in the Start Menu.  They all work nice and it brought over my look and feel from my Office 2013 Professional from my other computer.  Home/Student does not include Outlook (have not used since 2003), Access (not much use on a screen this size), and Publisher (also not much use on this size of screen).  The Office programs work great and saves some money verse buying them separately (they are the full not the annual subscription).The Windows interface is easy to use and when in the Start menu apps is super friendly to touch.  I have a stylus that I use (bought separately) which makes things a tad easier (it works great with your finger, but I just prefer the feel of a Stylus).  Many apps (like Office) take you to desktop mode and I find it pretty easy to use, I do not see much problem using stuff in the desktop mode.  The use is intuitive, you do have to tell it to bring up the keyboard (button on the task bar), but that is simple enough.  The benefit of having a full computer compensates for this in my opinion.When I first got it I tried to use the side by side full screen apps, but could not get them to snap by each other.  Some said this is not possible online due to screen size, however, I found that this feature is in Windows 8.1 (not out yet).  I went ahead and installed Windows 8.1 Preview (free update) which now lets me use side by side and it works great.  I can even side by side Internet Explorer windows to browse two web pages.  You can just drag apps to the right side and than resize using middle bar.  It is super easy and works well.  You can have video playing on one side and check email on the other or any combination.  So far every app I have tried works fine in this mode (Microsoft and high end apps seem to work even better in this mode, since they seem to be smart and change layout when in this to be more productive).  I highly recommend updating to Windows 8.1 Preview (and Windows 8.1 when it is out), it makes this tablet so much better and adds all the Windows features that you see on TV.  I have not had any issue and really love the update.  A few other changes include System Settings app having full power like Control Panel, and improvements to some system apps - the main thing is support for snapping apps side by side on smaller tablets.I have found some annoying things, the Mail app is OK, but not great!  It does not allow me to setup my Google Apps account as Exchange ActiveSync (it blocks with a message when I put in m.google.com as the server, however, I have a Google Apps for Education account which was not part of the end of support for ActiveSync, so it would work if the Mail app would let it go through instead of trying to be smart.  Second I use iCloud and the Mail app does not like syncing (Push works occasionally) the iCloud IMAP settings, it works sometimes than will not find new mail...  Calendar and Contacts will not Sync with iCloud since they only want to deal with Microsoft Services; some support for other clients should be added to support more users.Some more serious issues includes a Sound problem.  Sometimes the sound is great when streaming Slacker or other apps, but sometimes you can barely hear it.  For example listening to Pandora through Internet Explorer sounds like the volume in on 20 (even though it is all on full) and listening to Slacker radio sounds like it is on full blast.  I do not know why some apps and programs are so low sounding and some sound proper. I believe this is an issue with how some Windows apps are handing the drivers for tablets vs full (speculation).  Hopefully this will be fixed soon.  I will note that this does not seem to matter when using Headphones, only the built in speakers (which makes me question the driver issue theory...)The screen is not bad.  It has a nice resolution for a screen this size and is easy to read and and use.  However, it had this pixeled dot look on top of colors and images (like looking through a matted screen protector).  When you look close at the screen (especially white) you will notice these odd pixels that are rainbow colored throughout.  They are not that noticeable, but if you look at screens a lot like I do the smallest problem is noticeable.  It is not bad, but it is noticeable and I wanted to let you know.  The screen also does not have a wide viewing angle.  You do have to look at it straight on or just about 50 degrees either way before the colors start to look off and the glare it too much to see through.  I do not think this is a big problem since a tablet this size you will be looking at straight on.  And will have it no more than 2-3 feet away since the text would be too small to read.The screen's brightness is very good and it is auto bright (which is nice), however, the detector is on the left side and if you are holding your hand on the left side (when holding tablet sideways) you will notice when you move your hand that it will change brightness as your hand goes over it.  It should probably have a timeout or a second light detector at the top (so their is one top landscape and portrait to accommodate people holding on either side).  The screen is easy to see and the brightness is excellent.  I will note that it does have a bad glare so try to avoid having a bright light behind you or you will just see your silhouette on the screen.  Not a big problem, but in really heavy headlight you start to see yourself more than the screen...The app store for Windows is still pretty new and their are not as many apps as you would hope, but since you can use this as a full computer you can always install x86 apps or use web services in Chrome or Internet Explorer.  Their will probably be more apps in the future.  It would be a nice change if support for running Windows Phone apps came to Windows 8 since their is a nice market their, and I would not think it would be difficult since they both are Silverlight based and could run with a small change to the system.The device has a Micro USB and Micro HDMI port.  I have no use for these since I do not have an adapter.  They are cheap and I will get one in the future so I can plug in normal size USB devices and a converter for HDMI.  I think the HDMI would be useful for going to projectors or displays for larger screens, and I think the USB is good for data transfer and plugging in devices for quick use.  I wish they included a full USB and HDMI port for this (or at least an adapter) but I understand the desire to be thin and light over useful (that seems to be a trend in tech right now).  If you ever have to recover you will need to get a USB adapter to plug in a USB DVD drive to run the recovery disk.The battery is great and has a long life.  I cannot say how long since it usually never gets below 80% after a few hours of use, but from what I see it would last the whole day with no problem (depending on how process intensive the task is).I like how it handles locking itself.  I like the ability to use a PIN for a password (the picture is a neat idea, but a picture is too intuitive to what people would probably use, so it is not too secure).  I wish that BitLocker was included (only in Pro) since if the device was stolen you would not have to worry too much about the data on the drive, however, it is not...  I think that an encryption would be nice for Windows 8 tablets, and that would be a nice feature to add (although that is why they want you to go Pro), I looked into upgrading, but the Windows AnyTime upgrade said that I cannot; I have a license for Pro, but I am not sure if I can upgrade the tablet with that license since the license sticker that was included was for Windows 8 SmScrn Touch w/H&S; 2013, so I am not sure what that is (assuming something new for Small Screens with Touch) and if a  Pro upgrade can over that (or if I would lose Office...).  Not worth the risk just for BitLocker.In the end I really like this tablet.  It has a few shortcomings, but in all it is a great tablet.  In my opinion it is the best tablet choice for more productive users on a budget.  The full Windows 8 OS (32bit) is great for making this more than a tablet and more like a full computer.  The 8\" screen makes it easier to hold and carry when you do not want to bring the laptop and it is a great companion when in a meeting or class for presentations (I have an Epson projector and can use Epson's Network Projector for wireless projection from this tablet!)  The screen could be better, and the sound bug needs to be fixed.  I think you would be much happier if you upgrade to Windows 8.1 (preview for now and full when it comes out).  It adds many great features that are expected from Windows tablets.  I hope Microsoft makes its built in apps work better with other services in the future.If you want a tablet for more productive use than playing games than this is for you.  It works great and can run any Windows programs (32bit) or Windows 8 app.  Sometimes you do have to use Desktop mode, but it is not difficult and still works great!  I think the benefit of a full desktop experience with the overlay of the Windows tablet experience is great and gives more productivity than other tablets.  The inclusion of Office Home/Student 2013 is also great and makes this a great buy!  For a more productive on the go user I would recommend this or Surface Pro (although if on a budget this is the choice).I really like this and have learned a lot using it and find that I do like Windows 8 as a tablet (I have it in BootCamp on my Mac, but do not love it for Desktop, I find myself just getting out of the full screen Start and only using it for launching programs).  If you have any questions let me know and I will try to answer them.  And if you want a tablet that is productive and not just for games this is a great choice!!UPDATE:I have noticed a lot of people talking about WiFi. I have used this for a few days and have held it landscape and portrait (I am right handed so the left hand holds while the right hand uses) and have not had any problems. I will note that it does not support 5GHz, but my network broadcasts one channel for 2.4GHz and one for 5Ghz (only 2.4 is detected). I have held it streaming Netflix and Slacker and have not had it go out or anything.  The device has not lost the signal, I do not know if loses some coverage when holding it since most used do not show the taskbar or the wifi indicator in the Right Pull Out menu. I have not had an issue with WiFi, but if I do in the future I will let you know. The only thing I would complain on about holding it with left hand when in landscape mode is that the light sensor is their and it changes when my hand moves and than moves back (screen brightens and dims when moving near the camera area).", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Glen A. Bartram", "ReviewID": "RSFQ1SN5UPTPW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I've only had this tablet 2 days. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I'll post more as I come to know it better.The main thing this tablet had going for it currently is price. $280 is a decent deal for ANY tablet, and it will take a heck of a lot of negatives to overcome that. Still, it took me a week of puzzling the bad reviews to pull the trigger on this. My opinion... the bad reviews have perfectly valid points... and I kinda don't care. This tablet brings what I want to the table.So... bad screen... yeah, it's not great... not particularly good either, but it's actually perfectly acceptable. Resolution is actually slightly better than iPad Mini, and it's fine for watching a video on. Viewing angle... actually I didn't see a problem with the right side angle. Left side angle is really bad though. However, really, if you're sitting there watching your tablet at an angle... you're doing it wrong.Speed... No. This is basically a netbook in tablet form. Tablet optimized apps aren't fast, nor are they particularly slow. Anything designed for desktop... now THAT's gonna be slow, and that INCLUDES the free Microsoft Office applications. For me... I start opening it, and I get my coffee. It's not a deal killer, and the fact that Windows 8 apps WILL run is more a blessing than a curse in this case. Some of my key windows apps (Celtx, SketchUp) I am very happy to have available on this tablet, and willing to wait a few ticks to have them. Once they're running, the speed is acceptable.Windows 8... I'm not gonna retread all the negatives that have already been said... but I was surprised how intuitive I found the full Metro experience in tablet form. Left swiping to switch apps is a breeze. Down swipe to close an app... hands down better than Android AND iOS. Honestly... I think it's a gem. A flawed gem, but a gem nevertheless.Here's what did it for me... the split screen. I can open a document, switch to NetFlix, split the screen and stream video while working on a document. No other tablet, save for the Samsung Note series offers this feature, and even the Note will only split screen with certain apps (unless you root your device) And these tablets start $100 above the Iconia.There's more to say about this device, and more I've yet to discover. Unless some fatal flaw emerges, or the speed issues become unbearable, this is definitely a keeper, and may even grow to become my main tablet.Your mileage may vary...UPDATE:So... good news and bad news.... This has gone on to become my favorite tablet. Against all odds, the OS works well in a tablet form factor, and switching apps along with the split screen has made me more productive than on the iPad. There's several flaws, but the benefits and the low price have more than made up for it.Bad news... The pricing for this tablet has been all over the map. I first saw it for $299, bought it for $279, saw it briefly hit $250... and now it has inexplicably shot back up to $329. At that price, and with competing tablets on the horizon from Dell & others, I would advise waiting till these other devices hit and then compare again.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "The screen is poor, but the experience is good.", "Author": "Andy Dopieralski", "ReviewID": "R3LG9ANWRIZ9IH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First and foremost, yes...the screen on this is sub par. It appears to be a TFT with a glass capacitive digitizer over it. The viewing angles are not stellar and it's hard to view in bright settings. The picture is grainy (it feels like you're looking at a GIF image instead of a screen). BUT...the performance on this tablet is pretty awesome and it's a full Windows experience in an 8\" form factor. Also, after a time the screen grinds on you less and less. The initial impression is pretty awful, but after a bit of time with it you get used to it. For my use case, screen is a non-priority. I use this for doing work on the go and to play some casual games, none of which are graphics intensive. I have a Sufrace Pro for my big time graphic work, but the battery life and portability make the Acer my current driver for most of my stuff.Quick Review:Build Quality: ****Display: *1/2Ports: ***Portability: ****1/2Battery: ****Sound: ***Fr. Camera: ***1/2Re. Camera: ***A few things to consider if you pick this up - get rid of the Acer software immediately. It has an outdated set of extensions which slow down Office to a crawl. Don't bother with the 32GB model. There is almost no free space. Jump up to the 64. Also, check on Acer's website as an updated model is apparently coming out fairly soon which addresses the screen issue.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a very good tablet.", "Author": "Terry LeBlue", "ReviewID": "R1F54QIFYYUMP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 64gb version and added a 16gb sim card to keep important info for if it were to crash. I own a service company. I installed quickbooks pro 2012 on this tablet to keep and review customer info while on the road. I use it for web browsing and research also. I watch youtube videos on it. I am not a gamer. If I were a gamer I would buy a gaming computer. This tablet does way more than I could have expected. I bought an Ihome bluetooth mouse for 15 bucks. It works fine. I have no problems with the screen on mine, however, I did not change the default screen settings and I do not sit in front of a computer all day. I use this mostly for work and a little for browsing. I performed a speed test on the internet with a wireless connection of 3mbps and the computer speed was 2.6+-mbps. That is pretty good in my opinion. This tablet is running a true full version of windows 8. I have installed Classic start menu. It works fine. I paid a fair price for a tablet that suits my needs. I have only had it about a month. If you use the tablet all day it will likely last about 8 hours before you have to charge it. If you turn the screen off when you are not using it and only use it periodically it may be days before you need to charge it. That is all I can think of. I am not trying to persuade anybody to buy this tablet or not. I just think you should buy what suits you needs. This review is my experience and does not mean anybody else will see it the same way. You do have the option to bring it back to most stores if you are not satisfied.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Despite its shortcomings, this is now my go-to device", "Author": "Gabriel's Buddy", "ReviewID": "R31CBGH4G11AE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read several reviews that described this tablet as disappointing, primarily for the screen and processor speed, but also some wifi issues and storage space. These tempered my enthusiasm for the device and when I received it it was fairly clear that the screen was not the best screen to be had, but it certainly was usable and not the horror many had described. After using it for a while I must admit that I really like this tablet both for the form factor and the capabilities.We have a  Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 10.1\" 64GB Win 8 Pro Tablet with Stylus(367927U), an iPad (not retina), and a few Win 8 laptops. Since I've gotten this Acer it has become the device I pick up most often, by far. It is a wonderful size (just like the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini) and runs the full Windows ecosystem. The battery last long enough that I only charge it a few times a week. It is astounding that something so compact is not really a tablet but is, in fact, a fully capable portable computer.Good:- Form factor is easy to hold- Excellent screen size for a tablet- Runs the full windows ecosystem, including the included Microsoft Office suite.- Battery last a decent amount of time- Very easy to use- Allows for separate accounts (my wife and kids have their own accounts on the tablet that sync between the family desktop and this tablet)- The wider margin on the right gives you a solid place to hold the tablet.Bad:- The camera is awful. Both cameras are only 2.1 megapixels and show a great deal of noise in moderate to low light conditions. Outdoor pictures are OK.- There is only about 11 GB of free space on the drive. After installing six accounts and the MS Office suite, this is down to about 6. Apps are usually small, but some can be large. I recommend uninstalling the Encyclopedia Britanica that comes with it as well as any other apps you don't want. You can get 32 GB of storge with the SD card SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) for a reasonable price.- The screen is fine for viewing video and casual use. If you are particular about screens, you might not like this one, but I don't think it is as bad as many are saying. Now that I am using it casually rather than \"reviewing it\", I don't really notice it all that much unless I compare it side by side with another device.Also to note:- The USB port is a micro size, which is non standard. I had to get eForCity USB 2.0 A to Micro B Female / Male Adaptor to connect it to peripherals. There is room for a full sized port, on the outside at least.- It is charged with a round connector, not the micro USB we use for our phones, Kindle, and other tablets. This means yet another cable and wallwart in the drawer.- The headphone and charger jack look the same and are close together. I don't think there is risk of damage, but you have to look each time when plugging in.- I find myself hitting the off button accidentally if I hold it with my right hand.- I uninstalled the Norton products and most of the included Apps. Overall, the unwanted software was minimal.About Storage Space:This 32GB drive really only has about 29GB because of differences between how hardware and software people count bits. The default installation of windows takes up all but about 11GB of this. It is not uncommon for an app to be 1/3 or 1/2 of a GB and pictures/videos can eat up space, so one can use that space quickly. There are several ways this is ameliorated:- There is a slot for a 32GB microSDHC card. Unfortunately this shows up removable storage and Windows doesn't let you easily add folders on the drive to your libraries. However there are ways to do this that can be found quickly on the web. (you create an empty folder on the C: drive anywhere you like. Go into drive manager, find the option to assign a drive letter. But instead of assigning a drive letter, select the option to map the drive to the folder you created. The SD card then shows up as a folder on the C drive.)- Use of cloud storage. It comes with Acer's cloud products, which I uninstalled because the tablet also can use the soon-to-be-renamed SkyDrive from Microsoft. SkyDrive is well integrated into Windows 8 and office. Although it is just 7 GB, it is a handy way to make documents from a desktop or laptop available to you. Office is configured to save, by default, into the SkyDrive.- I have my music on a Win 8 desktop and, using the Microsoft Music App, I enabled cloud matching of my music. All the music that was matched on my desktop is available for streaming through the App on any Windows 8 device to which I am logged in.

There was no question in my mind. Plus its running full Windows 8.  There are so many advantages to having a pc in such a small form factor.  The acer tablet was noticeably heavier than the mini, but that was a given and not a deal breaker.  Unlike the my ipad mini, I could comfortably hold it in one hand and the added weight didn't really come into play because of the design of the tablet.  So why the 3-stars...the performance and sturdy design of the tablet was the only positive of this unit.  I returned it after one day of using it because the screen was so horrible.  The screen has an obvious \"grainy\" look to it which I can look past as a retina or HD display is not something that I must have.  BUT the viewing angles were absolutely horrible.  I set both tablets next to each other for the comparison and it was disappointing just how bad the screen on this tablet was to my ipad mini (and the mini has received its share of criticism for not being HD).

I also received a 128GB Surface Pro at the conference and I already own a 32GB Surface RT, so my comments may compare the W3 against these tablets. Additionally, I installed Windows 8.1 Preview on all 3 tablets, but this review is on the tablet, and not the OS.What do I like about this tablet?First and foremost, the size of the W3 makes it even more convenient to take with you to places. Add to that, the Atom processor lends itself to running 32-bit Windows 8 and having an 8 hour battery life, which makes the W3 a more powerful and more portable productivity tool over the Surface RT. Like the Surface tablets, a keyboard is absolutely necessary for any type of productivity, and the Acer Bluetooth keyboard accessory is highly recommended. If anything, you can stow the W3 in the backside of the keyboard and protect its display during travel -- that is a nice, thoughtful touch.What do I not like about this tablet?While the display is not as good as the Surface tablets, I'm more bothered by the weak WiFi connectivity; it's very obvious that the W3 was intended for use in portrait mode, especially when WiFi connectivity goes from 4+ bars in portrait to 1-2 bars in landscape.Due to the size and resolution of the display, the Windows Desktop becomes a chore to use effectively. Acer should have included a stylus as Microsoft includes a stylus with the Surface Pro. This tablet is definitely meant to live in the Start Screen.Last, but not least, I find the W3 to run a little hot -- the backside will feel very warm to touch after a while of usage.All-in-all, and I hate to say this, but I like this tablet more than my Surface RT; I would definitely consider this tablet if I was considering a Surface RT.

Others have been very generous with their pros and cons as relates to this device and Windows 8; read as many as you can. But... Windows 8 and an 8 inch tablet or convertible form factor is a great combination. Surfing and reading and working without a separate physical mouse, keyboard or monitor is a very different experience. Moreover, when put into the 8 inch form factor which you can hold in one hand; and maneuver between portrait, landscape and flexible zoom with the other..............this is a good start.You won't be playing high end games or running cpu-intensive software on this particular devise at the moment.  But; reading, viewing, listening, buying, selling, emailing....etc. etc. is much easier.  Be aware, that none of this is possible without a well-designed holder and some large pocket clothing; (the VSTN Multi-Angle Stand Slim-FIT Cover Case for ACER W3-810 and/or the Acer W3 TPU Rubber Shell Skin Cover Case and/or the Portable Fold-Up Stand for 7-10 Inch Tablet PCs and/or the Eagle Creek Pack-It Sac appear to be useful). I also had to determine how to connect to my local network. Wireless routers are less secure so I decided to spring for a Trendnet USB-to-Ethernet adapter and a Startech Micro USB Male to USB A Female adapter. And to complete the monitor or TV docking arrangement, I decided on the HFHF Micro HDMI Male to VGA Female Video Converter adapter, and a Connectland 4 Port USB Mini Hub (all are compatible with windows 8). In addition, I dusted off my wireless keyboard/touchpad; in order to make sure that the docked device could be controlled from a distance. And finally, I discovered that a virtual touchpad was useful in certain instances on the desktop as an excellent substitute when the hardware was not readily available. For under $300 in total, the risk seemed acceptable to me.Overall, this looks and feels like nearly infinite portability, or multi-tasking with multiple devises, i.e. a perfectly Wearable Desktop Computer/TV............. The only thing missing is a reasonably priced ($40 or less), stand-alone wireless MiFi alternative to replace my unlimited wired internet service. Nothing wrong with dreaming.........In the meantime, a secured wireless access point (Trendnet 637-AP) and Walmart's Just Barely On The Go But Better Than Dial-up MiFi will have to suffice.Update: The Windows 8.1 update is a big improvement and makes a good experience even better. In addition, the clean install option saves a lot of space on the hard drive by getting rid of all of the preinstalled Acer software. This is also where the docking arrangement comes in handy and allows this particular update to be made more quickly. With docking you also get a better view of what is going on during installation; and after installation, you can explore some of the new features in a more familiar monitor, mouse, keyboard and local network environment.

I called tech support about this, and they told me to not send it to them for repair as they could not fix what it was not doing. I am waiting to see if it will turn on later today. (I am using my old laptop to send this review). It is very frustrating to not be able to turn on my computer/tablet.

Here's a list of my pros and cons:Pro*Size - I had mixed feelings about it (always felt iffy about the in-between tablets) but it's actually pretty nice and portable. My 10\" ASUS is a bit too big to throw in my purse but this one works nicely if I want to play with it on a commute.OS - I'm an android/linux user all the way, but when it comes to this tablet, it's actually nice to have real Word and Excel, especially if I want to look at a file from work. I don't think it'll ever replace a computer, but again, for looking at something for work during my commute, making a small change, and sending it back in an email, it works.Cons*Screen - It's not bad... when looked at directly. Changing the angle even slightly really messes up the image.WiFi - When I hold it in landscape that the WiFi cuts in and out, and it's not just one magic spot or a port my finger closes, it happens all the time.Lack of regular USB port - The other ACER models I've seen had a regular USB port. In my mind, it justified their thickness. I feel like regular (not micro) USBs are still the most universal way we transfer files. It would have been a really nice feature here.Weight - It didn't feel as heavy as I thought, but it's almost the same weight as my ASUS 10\", and considering it's only 8\" but thicker, I would have preferred a lighter tablet.So all in all, not bad, but I think I'll stick with my laptop and ASUS Transformer Prime.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Full Windows 8 Experience on the go; Great value, especially if you can overcome the screen", "Author": "Kiyo M.", "ReviewID": "R3Y2MR6HDTHVX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the biggest complaints about this product is the screen. If you own an iPad or have been spoiled by retina/OLED displays, then you will be disappointed with the screen. Of course it is nowhere near as bright and sharp as those; however, I do also believe the complaints are definitely overblown and it's not horrible as everyone puts it out to be. There's some people who complained about the text being too fuzzy or not sharp; I've noticed when I received it, the resolution was low. Once Windows updated, having the resolution set to 1280x800, it looked much better. Yes, the screen viewing degree is not great, but it's not often you'll be using the tablet from the side. While it's no retina display, I do still get a sense of HD when playing HD videos.The touch keyboard is okay, but if you really want a full Windows 8-laptop/natural experience, then you'll definitely want an actual keyboard. I also purchased a Acer Bluetooth Keyboard (W3-810). Having a physical keyboard is much nicer, but it would have been nice if the tablet could actually be docked/locked into place and have it in different angles; it's basically just a simple bare stand, at a fixed angle, and if you move around a lot, it gets a bit annoying having to manually grab the tablet and keyboard together. It's nice to have shortcut functions on the keyboard, and it definitely gives the tablet a whole new life/better experience, just by combining with the keyboard. Being able to store the tablet on the back of the keyboard is a nice touch; however, it is made out of cheap plastic and the docking could have been thought out better.Having an actual mouse/cursor is also much nicer than using fingers on a full Windows. I wish the tablet had a regular full-size USB connection for connecting USB mouse dongles; however, the tablet only has a micro-USB port. I did purchase a micro-USB on-the-go cable and connected the Logitech Zone Touch Mouse T400 for Windows 8; it works and with the combination with the keyboard, it really turns the tablet into a real laptop experience.You really don't get much space left with this 32GB model with the Windows 8 OS and other installed things when you receive it. If you can, I would choose the model with more memory. However, I do appreciate they have a micro-SD card slot so you can have more memory.The left side (holding it in landscape position) of the tablet has the power button, micro USB slot and micro-HDMI port. the top side has the volume controls and micro-SD slot. The right side has the power connector and speakers.If you consider the size, the tablet is a bit on the heavy/bulky side.Pros:- Full Windows 8 Experience- Micro-SD slot for expanding more memory- Good battery lifeCons:- Screen (poor viewing angles/brightness; however, it's not as bad as most people make it out to be - Just don't expect iPad display)- Would be nice to have a full USB port.Now this definitely won't replace your computer.

Feel free to skip this review if you're a tablet expert.I've found the tablet fairly user-friendly and simple to figure out what is what. I like the fact that it is essentially a computer in tablet form with the feature of Windows 8, but also has the apps side too. The apps are easy to move, organize, or delete, and most can change be re-sized into either a square or rectangle. Speaking of the apps, the store leaves a lot to be desired and it's difficult searching for what you're looking for, if they even provide it. The screen isn't the clearest and I'm not sure if I have the updated one or not (I'd guess it's the older, worse screen), but it's fine for my usage. At a weight of about one pound, it's pretty hefty to use for long periods of time, unless it's resting on something, but otherwise it feels substantial and is relatively attractive.Even though it claims to be 32 GB, all but 2 GB is taken up by already installed programs and apps, though there is a slot for a micro SD card. Included is a cord to charge it and the tablet has ports for both HDMI and mini usb, headphone or speaker jack. I've used Bluetooth speakers with it and have had no troubles after figuring out I had to go the desktop first. The battery is good and while adjusting the screen's brightness would help it last longer, the lower settings are simply too dark for my eyes.Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to use the recovery disk Acer provides (whether it was the Acer or myself to blame, I can't be sure), which meant I needed to have on hand an external DVD drive, a micro USB adapter, and a hub (none of which I had. They also said to have a USB keyboard but it wasn't necessary). It seemed to have worked, but the disk didn't start like Acer said it would, which might have had to do with the DVD drive, and there were no instructions to go through and I couldn't find anything to start the recovery up, so I'll probably take it to a computer repair store to make sure everything is working properly.Overall, it's been a mostly pleasant experience, and besides the one major trouble I ran into, it's been a handy little device to have around.

They were out of stock at Office Max, so I bought mine from... where else? amazon.com.To be honest, I'm eagerly awaiting Toshiba's release of their Encore 8-incher in November. From everything I've read, it's going to be the small Windows 8 tablet everyone wants (except, initially, they'll only release a 32GB model stateside) -- and the Encore will come with Windows 8.1 installed and Skype-certified.  Until then, I try to have fun with my W3.I bought the W3 actually for both work and pleasure.  Work-wise, I use Word, Excel and Powerpoint a lot.  (I'm a public-servant educator.)  The fact that the W3 comes with free Office 2013 is just great.  Also, I love the fact it's so lightweight (and the Toshiba Encore will be just a hair lighter, even though it'll come with a top-notch screen, unlike the W3), and I can hold it in one hand while teaching.  The touch screen is sensitive enough to be a pleasure to use.  Pleasure-wise, I enjoy watching streaming videos via the built-in Video app, and I can install VLC Player to play everything.  This is, after all, a real Intel-equipped PC.Now, the screen is really as bad as most negative reviews have said.  In store, I didn't feel it was that bad, even though it was obviously too grainy.  But I thought I could handle it.  Now that I actually own one, I have to say the screen really disappoints.  Because the pixel density is high for such a small screen, the graininess really makes the overall experience less than satisfying.  Actually, watching video is not too bad as long as you don't tilt your ahead away from the center.  But working in Word and Excel can get tiring quickly.Luckily, you can hook this up to an external monitor via the included micro-HDMI port -- the same kind of port as the Surface RT.  I already got a few micro-HDMI cables.Another flaw is the WiFi function.  Either due to shoddy hardware or shoddy software driver (I have a Toshiba ultrabook that came with buggy Intel WiFi software that had to be updated later before WiFi would work properly -- apparently a lot of Intel's WiFi drivers have serious bugs), the W3 really has to be just a few feet away to connect and maintain the connection.  I use a WiFi repeater in my house, so it's not as much of a problem, but given my Nokia Lumia 920 phone can connect to my original AP across the street from my house, one can understand the poor quality of the Wifi on the W3.Yet another annoyance it the W3 comes with tons of crapware.  Out of the box, the 64GB model has 32.5GB available.  Of course, you can extend the memory with a microSD card.If you're looking for a small Windows 8 tablet, I highly recommend you wait for the Toshiba Encore, which is slated to release in November and should be available here on amazon.com as well as on Toshiba Direct and at Best Buy.  Its screen alone is worth the wait,  plus its MSRP is even lower than the 32GB W3's MSRP.  Of course, if you're like me and can't wait, try the W3 and maybe later we can all sell it on eBay, or give it to the kids to trash.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meh, but what do you expect for $380?", "Author": "J.

Why did Acer make their product so bad by pairing it with probably the worst TN screens available.  They shouldn't even make screens like this in the year 2013!With that being said the only thing that had going for it was the form-factor which makes me want to get an iPad mini once they include a retina display on it.

Considering that a copy of Windows 8 goes for $100 or more/lessAND it includes Office (that's at least $120) this thing is pretty cool. Truth be told the display isn't the absolute worst and its quite viewable indoors. Outdoors is another story though. It runs Photoshop and Dreamweaver very well and movies are watchable. Yes, the display could be better but it would raise the price point. Buy this for the versatility of Win8 and included Office. I suggest getting the keyboard too because it is very useful. I use mine hooked up to my NAS for storage and XBMC runs great while the tablet is connected to the TV. Use the Bluetooth keyboard to control XBMC from the sofa. Pretty neat. I take it out to the car and use it as a dash cam and music client using audio over Bluetooth. Bottom line, it works for me but it may not work for you. Try it out and see if you can live with the display and if that's not a deal breaker then buy it.UPDATEInstall Win 8.1 on this and enjoy a new experience on this machine! It is impressive to say the least. 9 hour battery life!!! Are you kidding me!?Windows multitasking on this machine is stellar. Being able to update my website via Flash and Dreamweaver is priceless to me. I even made a security camera program using Visual Basic! Its power and utility will surprise you.

I'm not as sensitive to screen issues as some reviewers are so didn't notice problems they did.  Not sure if there was a manufacturing defect but out of the box, it didn't fully charge even plugged in overnight.  I was starting to personalize Windows 8 for me when it died after taking a picture.  I couldn't get it to turn on or flicker.  Even looked for a place to stick in a paperclip (I'm old-fashioned) to restart it.  I didn't know about \"black screen of death\" on tablets till searching online.  I've owned several small Acer products (Acer One etc) and have been VERY happy with their reliability so this may be a fluke, but after going online to find out what I could do to resurrect my tablet I read reviews about the $75 keyboard and black screen of death on other tablets and other issues...so, when I took my Acer Iconia back to the store today, I left with an HP Envy (twice the cost, hopefully twice the reliability).  I haven't opened that box yet.

I was hoping this new 8\" version would have the same built quality...WRONG O!!.  The problem with Acer product is that it's a hit or miss and boy did Acer mess up on this one.  Fisher Price built quality and a horrible, horrible, horrible screen by today's standard. If Google can built a nice screen for a $199 tablet, why can't Acer.  They really blew it. It's going to be in the clearance aisle before you know it.  This tablet reminds me those cheap knock off tablet pre-android days.

If you need some entertainment, or enjoy watching someone suffer, keep reading.This tablet would be good if it were priced 90% off! Otherwise, FORGET IT!!! First, you don't get 32 gb. You get under 11 gigs! ....ok, let's start from the outside. The power button on the edge makes me nuts. I constantly am turning it off by accident. And with the lack of connectivity while in landscape position, you would think I'd learn my lesson, but I like lanscape and you shouldn't have to suffer for it. Also, the second it takes to rotate the screen (currently it is stuck onportrait mode for some reason), is annoying. Just when you think it's going to take long, it changes. The tablet is also slippery, so becareful not to drop it....or not. This really is like a practical joke. It is unresponsive, sometimes having to press an icon multiple times before anything happens. I'm kind of like the guy who gets a paper that saysturn over for something special and then you turn it over and it says turn over for something special. I am the idiot who keeps turning it over expecting a different result. I suspect the camera is filming this somewhere and people are getting a mighty good laugh out of it. \"Look, he's trying it again! What a moron. You are absolutley brilliant Mr. Pavlov.\"The charging hole and the earphone hole are on the bottom edge and we often confuse the two, very annoying. The tablet gets hot, while using and while charging, very annoying. You need to sign in to Acer cloud to use some stuff, download updates, nowI have8 gigs free....annoying....are you seeinga pattern evolving?I love sitting 15 feet from my wireless router, with no walls, and constantly dropping connections. Have I mentioned that I am getting annoyed?This is NOT an intuitive OS or tablet....not in the slightest. I guess if you are used to Windows 8 (my condolences) you won't hate it as much.I have to say that the viewing angle is not all that bad in a well lit room. I'm surprised, however, that they did not market it as a \"privacy\" screen, as the idiot writing this review would have probably bought right in. Btw, rotation is back.FYI, this comes with kindle, acer explorer, huluplus, 7digital, evernote, chacha, zinio, ebay, didlr, stumblupon, netflix, icookbook, skype, tunein, newsexpresso, socialjogger, acer crystal eye, spotify, etc.Ok, here is a comparison, the iPad mini is better in every way. The viewing screen is better and just about the same size. The mini is faster, connects better, is more intuitive and you don't have to buy 32 gig to get 8 gigs! Battery life is pretty much the same. I know, the ipad cannot accept an Sd card...oh wait, neither can the Acer. You can use a micro SD, and since you will probably need it, I'd get a 64 gig card....if you still insist on getting this....and if that's the case, I believe amazon sells whips and chains as well, this way you can beat beat yourself for not listening. I have done my best to talk you out of this....but if not, go to the apple store first and try out a mini.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CM1BN5Q"}}
