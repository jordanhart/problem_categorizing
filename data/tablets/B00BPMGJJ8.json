{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mini Laptop", "Author": "Skippitydoodah", "ReviewID": "RJH8O6AZQ2J2P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my mini laptop for less than a month; babied it, was very careful with it, allowed no one else to use it; only checked my emails on it and never downloaded so extra space was not taken up and it has already died on me.  Our last resort was to hit the reset button and that was done this morning and nothing!  So, I'm not a happy camper.  I don't have $105 to waste and now I see it's $115.00.  I recommended to a friend to buy this and I messaged her this morning to please not do so.  Now I am back to borrowing a computer and I'm not happy. I sub so I have limited income and thought \"wow, here's something I can afford\" but it was a waste of money and I don't have the funds to go purchase something else.  Also the battery only lasts for under an hour; I initially charged it 6 hrs as it said, actually overnight and it's never lasted longer than an hour so that's a down fall.  I don't recommend that you buy this; I'm not saying this to be mean, but rather to protect other buyers.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Use Goldengulf!!!", "Author": "Edward W. Sanders", "ReviewID": "R3AXNWVYCY8HWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my Android computer arrived, it had one minor issue. I e-mailed the seller and the problem was solved within a few hours. So far, the computer has been operating as it should. So, I would highly recommend using Goldengulf for you computer needs. Update as of October 16, 2013; I contacted Goldengulf about my daughter misplacing the power cord for the computer. Goldengulf immediately sent a power cord and didn't charge me for it. If I need anything they sell, I will choose them first. I am more than 100% satisfied with Goldengulf.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great little laptop", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R20ECIRAE5V7UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter loves it.

Also had to work from a small budget!  I decided to try this, and I'm glad I did!  I do a lot of word processing, and this netbook came with a word processing app pre-loaded, not just games, as on a couple of tablets I've had.  I have a ton of Kindle books, including several \"complete works\" collections:  download speed was impressive.  Works great on or offline, I love the optical mouse that was included, just a lot of bang for the buck all around.  If you're a gamer or spend a lot of time watching videos, I don't know how it might work for you:  for productivity, however, I don't see how it can be beat, for the money!", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "As Expected", "Author": "Kayleigh", "ReviewID": "R1P1JHF98P3V4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas and its done exactly what it said it does, its only used for playing games mainly and a few other things but considering it cost 120 euros I couldn't have got it at a better price.

Not only is it economical where I am concerned but it is excellent for him to take to the library, to tutoring and to school.
