Dawod \"Ash\"", "ReviewID": "R28TO301WPIGAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a techy, I enjoy working with technology and customizing them in simple ways to make them work for me. I'm also a musician, and I'm not usually at home for days at a time. I didn't want to carry my laptop everywhere because its where I do most of my musical project, and didn't want to risk anything happening to it. So I decided to get a tablet for when I'm moving around.After some research, I found a way to make this Coby Kyros MID7125 work for me. Here is what I did.I bought this tablet, which a neat little device, everything worked right out of the box. When I plug it into the computer, it brings up 2 things:-The internal memory of the Kyros-The SD memory (if you have a card installed)I was a little bummed that it doesn't charge while connected to the computer, but I did find out that if I turn it \"off\", it holds what ever charge it has until you turn it on the next time. I had charged it fully, turned it off, and didn't use it for over 2 days, and it had full charge.It picks up on the wireless network pretty good.Physical keyboard & case in oneThe second thing I did was buy the 7' case which has the built in USB keyboard, this made my life MUCH easier, because its easier for me to simply type on a physical keyboard, then on using the stylus on the screen.Here is a link to the case, which was \"Plug & Play\". The Kyros already comes with the proper adapter for it.[...]Android Market.Its true that this doesn't have the Android Market place, BUT I have found instructions on how to install the market place, and it worked like a charm.(Make sure you have an SD card to make this happen)Here is the youtube instructions, and the files you need are in the description of that video.[...]There is something I've noticed though, even after installing the market place, there were some apps that I couldn't find IN the market place, apps such as Evernote & Blogger. The reason I wanted Evernote (aside from it being a great app) is that it will allow me to actually type documents, ideas, & what not while I'm on the road, without needing to turn on the WiFi. & I will then have access to those notes later when I return home to my computer.The way around this is by looking for the \"apk\" files, so for example, I went on google and looked for \"Evernote.apk\", you simple save that file to your SD Card, and once you insert the card into your Kyros, use the build in program called \"APK Installer\", it will find the file, you simply click it to install, & voila.Another way (if your not near a computer): While on the tablet (assuming your connected to WiFi), you open up the browser, search for the \"apk\" file, download and install right then & there. I actually tried this and it worked.The CameraThis model (MID7125) has a front facing camera, which takes pictures & videos. So far I have not found away to share those pics & videos via the installed camera program. So now I'm on search to hopefully find an app that would allow me to do that on the Kyros.The quality is, ok. Nothing to write home about.So my advice is, if you are planning on taking this on the road, instead of your netbook or laptop, make sure to install all the applications you need before you hit the road. I'm mainly using it for entertainment (watching movies on my SD Card) & writing notes and blog posts when I have a chance.I don't for see it replacing my laptop, but it is a good alternative if your going away for a few days, want to stay connected, & don't want to take your laptop.I hope this has helped.Take care.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's okay for the price you pay", "Author": "okaybuys", "ReviewID": "R3VGIN3JTIMGL0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet [for 129.99 on black friday. As a teen it was a lot of money but still a good price compared to an IPAD. i finally got it (it shipped from ny to Washington) I was anxious to use it so i turned it on after charging and it worked for about twenty minutes before the screen went to lines almost like it was frozen.pretty much the pros: the resistive screen actually works pretty dang good, just have to get use to it, the getjar app that coby suggest to download for apps works wonderfully for facebook, skype, games, ect. It last for a good few hours and it does charge fast. It's a good price. If you don't want problems i suggest stepping up for an ipadpretty much the cons: randomly freezes and have to reset it constantly, no microphone and camera is crappy.So you spend $130 for it and you get what you pay. if you want no problems a thermal screen, and all the popular apps go with an ipad. but if you don't want to spend 500 for a tablet this is an okay buy. try shopping for something else", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Product in price", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R1PA2C3AMAO6GR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is good, but some issues which I noticed so far.The touch screen works better, if stylus is used.

They are def not top of the line, but you aren't paying top of the line either. The screen requires a stylus (or something pointy) and not your finger, which is good and bad.

Angry birds works, which is a big selling point. One problem I've noticed is sometimes it says the network is down and won't connect to the wireless, but if you simply restart the tablet it works again. You can download the nook app from the appslib, but not the android market, so you can attempt to get into the appslib (pain in the @$$) or you can just use the aldiko that comes with the tablet. It's pretty good on the responsive side, not too slow. The camera takes alright pictures, it's nice that the camera is in front, for video chatting, but I have not tried to video chat or download skype, so I can't tell you if it works/works well or not, sorry. We were constantly using them, trying to set them up, watching videos, and they lasted about 4-5 hrs on battery life.  I had originally gotten them $80 pandigital tablets from walmart and THOSE were FAIL. These tablets are GODLY in comparison.

Anything!", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R1UJIBKBR8G7E0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this item on 9/9/2011 from Amazon for developing software because it was cheap and ran a fairly new version of the Android OS. Not a good idea. Because the Original Android OS was modified by Coby, applications that run on other Android devices simply failed/crashed on this thing for no apparent reason. AKA not a good testing platform. In addition, the screen has a shiny blurry feeling to it that made my eyes hurt after an hour or so of continuous use. Finally, the Apps store is not the Google App Store/Market Place but a Coby Apps Store which means your selection is going to be limited. Otherwise, the device did as advertised.Now, this is why I would advise you to buy something else - Coby Customer Service & Tech support is Useless. Plain & Simple!Proof 1: I needed to reset it to the factory setting, I followed the directions on the site, but they were useless. Finally I called tech support. However, they could not help - Apparently, they did have info about the product because it was a newer model. After tinkering with it for a few hours, I figured it out on my own. Kudos!Proof 2: It worked for about a week then the all important volume button stopped working. I called Coby and got an authorization to return this item. In return they sent me a down grade/older model 7015. I called and was connected to a woman called Beverly on 10/25/2011 - She stated that it would be picked up from my house and the situation woult then be corrected. Two weeks later no one showed up. Hence, I called Coby again on 11/9/2011, got in touch with Deon who took my information and forwarded it to his spupervisor Tim and advised me to call back on the following day if I did not hear from him/Tim. Given that I did not hear from either of them on 11/10/2011, I called Coby again and got in touch with Beverly. She had no recollection of our previous conversation. She took my info and promised to forward it to her supervisor. Annoyed, I asked to speak with Tim who honestly had nothing useful to add except that I should call back on the following day as he needed to get in touch with the warehouse. On 11/11/2011 I called at 1:34PM and got Beverly again - after placing me on hold for an eternity, I was finally told that Tim is out to lunch and any update would come in from the warehouse on the following Monday. Should Have seen that one coming. At approximatley 4:30PM I called and was told by Paul that Tim had left for the day at 3PM. However, he would be happy to take my info and passed it on to Tim in an e-mail. Been there, done that, a waste of time. May I speak with someone else? Yes here is Dwayne; Tim's Boss. As usual, the sweet little man had nothing useful to add except that \"Updates will be available on Monday and you should call back then.\"Proof 3: Everyone in this company is passing the buck to the almighty halfwitted supervisor. No one is taking ownership for anything.Proof 4: There appears to be a complete break down in communication.Proof 5: You'll have a massive headache at the end of it all that will make you wish you had purchased this piece of junk from a company with better support & customer service or that you had taken the money and given it to your local shelter or the Republicans. Hence, the saga continues, resolution pending...Update 11/16/11Duane has not heard from the warehouse yet.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "kyros mid 7125", "Author": "cmith", "ReviewID": "R2P40C42H5OM4E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the 7125 for a christmas gift. I was delighted by the quality of the unit itself. It functined as is should, I was in heaven. Then .. THEN... it froze up on me after about 1 week. I was downloading some random app and the screen locked up. It's been stuck like since mid January. I've called Coby USA several times. When you call Coby you talk to a call center operator that says... somebody from Coby Tech Support will call and work with you to fix it. I've called 3 different times.. It's been a few weeks. Not a word or a solution from Coby. This appears at first glance to be a good deal but if you have any intention of actually USING your tablet ...save your money and get a name brand with real tech support. Regardless of what model youown... if your Coby tablet craps out...you're on your own with a nice new paper weight. Coby USA is a joke. Plain and simple.

Originalmente ordene el modelo MID7127-4G (que es la ultima version de COBY de Octubre 2011 que viene con pantalla capacitativa y mas rapida en la sensibilidad de la pantalla, NO del procesador, que es el misma en ambas), pero con el problemita de mi tarjeta y bla bla bla, Amazon escribio deciendo que se habian agotado. Las especificaciones entre las 7127 y la 7125 que finalmente compre, son exactamente iguales, pero la 7127 cuesta USD $ 169 y la 7125 USD $ 139. Pagar 30 dolares para solo tener un pelo mas de rapidez en la pantalla, no tiene sentido.Cuando las saque de sus cajas, lo primero que me impresiono es la excelente calidad de la tablet en si. El plastico de la carcaza esta perfectamente acabado! son hechas en China obviamente, pero en una fabrica (me imagino) que tiene un buen proceso de control de calidad. No tienen nada que envidiarle a las de otras marcas mejores, de verdad que si!. Las tablets vienen con Android 2.3, que es el mismo software que se le pone a los telefonos (incluso varias de las instrucciones en la tablet dicen: \"su telefono hara tal cosa\"), pero son super rapidas! igual que el acelerometro que identifica cuando esta en vertical u horizontal.Las configure y conecte al Wi-Fi en menos de 5 minutos (las dos y sin ninguna falla de configuraci\u00f3n o Software, bueno!), el navegador de internet tiene el Google pre-configurado como buscador y funciona super bien!. Automaticamente reconoce que estas navegando desde un equipo m\u00f3vil Android y reconfigura todas las paginas de internet al tama\u00f1o de 7\" de la pantalla. Un detallazo: estas tablets NO TRAEN ANDROID MARKET instalado de fabrica, para lograr que lo tengan, hay que investigar en Internet y dicho y hecho, hay hasta un procedimiento en You Tube para instal\u00e1rselo, pero si lo van a necesitar. Nuevamente, no creo que a mis hijos les interese eso, salvo que me pidan un juego que no puedan obtener o jugar en Internet.Por la pantalla no esperen algo tipo AMOLED . El color, el brillo y la resolucion no son las mejores (son LCD, no LED), pero considerando que pagaste $ 139 por una tablet que hace lo basico bastante bien (meterse por internet, leer el correo y medio ver un video de vez en cuando y/o escuchar musica, que es lo que a la final haran mis hijos) para que te vas a preocupar por tener una pantalla Full HD con 100 millones de colores y que se consuma la bateria en una hora. La sensibilidad al tacto no es perfecta, y a pesar que es resistiva (no capacitativa como las de las Samsung o los Apple) es bastante sensible y precisa. Trae un stylus (apuntador plastico), que hace la navegaci\u00f3n un paseo!, pero les advierto que no hace todos los gestos que tienen las Apple o las Samsung (por lo menos el reducir y aumentar la pantalla con los dedos, NO se puede hacer, al igual que rotar una foto con los dedos) pero vamos a estar claros: si mis hijos no se van a poner a hacer una presentaci\u00f3n en frente de un cliente o para el comit\u00e9 directivo de una empresa, para que quieren eso? =) Volvemos a lo mismo, quieres esas funciones? Tienes que comprarte algo mas caro y con mas capacidad.Tiene unas 10 aplicaciones ya instaladas (lector de libros electronicos, reproductor de musica y videos, You Tube, e-mail, webcam, etc) lo basico. No llegue a probarlos todos, pero el audio de las cornetas externas no se oye nada mal para ser una tablet econ\u00f3mica. A pesar de que trae 4 Gb de memoria interna (nuevamente, mas que suficiente para bajarles unas 500 canciones en MP3 a mis hijos o algunos videos) trae tambi\u00e9n una ranura para meterle hasta 16 Gb con una Micro SD, un puerto HDMI mini, conector para aud\u00edfono 3.5 mm, su puerto para cargador y un conector USB Mini (como el de los tel\u00e9fonos Motorola o Black Berry de los viejos). En la caja trae, un forro para la tablet, unos aud\u00edfonos, el cargador, el stylus un manual de instrucciones b\u00e1sico y una tarjeta con tel\u00e9fonos de tech support y un numero 800 en los EE UU para llamar cualquier cosa que se presente.En resumen y como dir\u00edan aqu\u00ed en Venezuela, estas tablets salieron con las 3 BBB: Buenas, Bonitas y Baratas!. =) de verdad si piensan comprarse una Tablet, salvo que quieran y tengan la mini fortuna que cuesta un iPad o una Galaxy Tab o de verdad quieran tener una pantalla hiper espectacular!, no tiene sentido hacerlo habiendo opciones como estas Coby KYROS, que hacen pr\u00e1cticamente lo mismo por 3 veces menos el precio.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "slow system", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3NGX8AJXJR3VE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Only worked one day.

He has an i-pod, but was looking for something with a bigger screen. He said there's not a big selection of games (compared to what he has available for his i-pod), but we used amazon's app store to add some games. It seems responsive to his touch and he hasn't complained about functionality at all. My son's a tech wizard, so he'll want something new in a few months, but it's held his interest so far.

In fact, I was only expecting it to work for a Japanese-English dictionary and maybe movies and some music.Boy was I wrong!!! I love my Coby Kyros sooo much and it works for so much more than just a dictionary!  I have had it for around 4 months now and I still can't believe how amazing it is! I use it every single day and really think this is one of the best deals I have ever gotten!!Here are some reasons I love my Kyros:*You can have moving desktop backgrounds*All the apps go on your desktop and are easy to organize*The system preferences are basic and os is very easy to use*The screen moves when you move the Kyros :D It's so cool*very sturdy, and comfortable to hold. The keyboard for typing is the perfect size (for me)...you can download different keyboards  though.*There are so many great apps...I often use my Kyros for:-searching the web, email, Facebook, youtube-watching anime (there is a program called droidanime + if you download flash you can watch all the anime online too!)-Japanese-English dictionaries-Chinese-English dictionaries-Japanese language learning programs (recently downloaded and purchased an app called ja sensei and its amazing...with the touch screen I can write the kanji [chinese characters] and the program tells me how my strokes are, how to improve, accuracy, and stuff...very impressive! :D)-games...so many games haha...obviously i love crazy birds and there is one called jewels i like a lot!-flashcards...notepads...sticky notes...music...books...Right now I have a moving night sky wallpaper and its sooo pretty...i just love to stare at it :) I love that before bed I can quickly check email, play a game, browse the web, or watch anime...and its so cozy. I just adore my coby kyros so much.I have a macbook air and my previous computer was a $2000 HP...so it's not like I am not used to good computers and that is why the Kyros seems so amazing to me. The Kyros is amazing to me because it is simply amazing!!!I definitely plan on continuing to purchase Coby Kyros in the future! It has been a long time since I have felt so attached to something. Sometimes I even sleep next to my Kyros. :)I highly recommend this amazing tablet!

I am thrilled with Amazon and the responsiveness and follow through.  I bought three Coby Kryos Mid 7025 Tablets for my children for Christmas.  For starters the tablets did not have access to the market.  It comes with a program called AppLibs that is supposed to be another market.  Only problem is that Applibs would never connect, even on a great wifi connection.  This was not a big deal as I quickly found the needed files, installed them on a SD card and installed the Google Market.  When you do this you get the old market since this is an older version of Android.  Doing more research I have not found an upgrade path for this device to new Android releases, and frankly I am not sure the CPU could handle it.  Biggest problem is that the devices freeze up when doing even simple stuff like listening to music or playing market games.  I have each device freeze up and lock down at least three times.  When it is not freezing up it is releasing error codes that make you do a force close.  The other big issue is the resistive touch screen.  You really have to push down hard and it's better to use a stylus or fingernail.  Using this type of screen it is easy to open applications mistakenly.  When you try to scroll throughout the screens random apps open, which is extremely frustrating.  My advice is to save your money, spend a few extra dollars and get a capacitive screen.  You may be saying, \"Well, surely it's Ok just for younger kids\".  Don't fool yourself, that is exactly what I said.  It's not, when they are constantly having issues and bringing it to you to fix you realize going cheap was not a great option.  Get the capacitive screen with the latest Android version.

I thank God that I didn't buy the Acer Iconia for $320.00. For under $140.00, the Coby Kyros will give you everything you're looking for -- but you will have to some work to bring it up to speed. I just received the tablet yesterday and immediately installed a 32GB microSD card to max out the external storage (you can't do that on an iPad, Kindle fire, or Blackberry Playbook), hooked it up to my wireless keyboard and mouse, and connected it to my television via its HDMI port (again, you can't do that on an iPad, or Kindle Fire).The device runs in a Cortex A8 1Ghz processor. It is single core. My 7125 is a resistive screen model, so it works best with a stylus (which it brings). If you strongly prefer fingers, get the model MID7127, which is about $20-$30 more, and has a capacitive touchscreen. The device comes with Android 2.3.3 installed, and a horrible little app store called \"Apps Lib\", from which you can get \"GetJar\". WHATEVER. Go online and you will quickly see that tablets of this design will install the Android Market, the Amazon market, the Amazon App store, the Kindle app, Flash 11, the Netflix app, and watch Youtube videos.The lack of a rear camera is not a deal breaker.

Their customer service and processing is awesome! I ordered this on a monday with free shipping and had it in my hands on wednesday! And they had one of the cheapest prices around. The tablet was for my 10 year old daughter and the only concern I had was durability. The mid 7125 doesn't feel like plastic junk and seems to be built with nice quality. Now it doesn't fly like my quad core laptop nor does it move like a galaxy tablet or ipad but it's about a fourth the cost and functions like it should. For a starter tablet I think it's the best on the market after searching all over for one with at least 512mb of ram , a 1ghz processor and a front facing camera. We got it mainly so she could read books and check her email which this thing does with ease. My mom has an old black & white kindle and the 7125 is way more enjoyable to read a book off of than that thing. The only thing that was kinda a pain is that resistive touch screen but I knew that before I bought it. If your use to using a stylus then this model will impress you.
