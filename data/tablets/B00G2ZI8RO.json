It comes in weighing a little over 1lb.I upgraded from the iPad 3 and you can defiantly feel the difference. When reading with the iPad 3, after a few minutes my arms would be tired of holding the iPad up. With the new iPad Air, that is not the case anymore. I can read for much longer now and my arms don't feel tired. The unit is also easier to hold (much thinner than previous versions of the iPad)It\u2019s built of high quality aluminum just like every other iPad is and constructed to last.PerformanceThe new iPad air is fast! It has an A7 processor in it which is defiantly an upgrade from the previous iPads. The Wi-Fi is even quicker to connect and I notice I can achieve more of my potential in bandwidth speed using this iPad. The new front facing camera makes video chatting much better and the M7 chip makes editing and slow motion shooting fun and a breeze.StorageI upgraded from a 16 GB iPad 3 to a 128 GB iPad Air. Why you ask? Well because I do a lot of traveling for work and Apple is notorious for sneaking in extra stuff on your hard drive that takes up space. My iPad 3 came with only 13.8 GB useable space and after a month I had 3 or 4 GB of \u201cother\u201d storage that no one could figure out how to remove or clear.I mentioned earlier I travel a lot for work so I enjoy watching movies on the plane rides. With my old iPad I never had room for all my movies I had to use a wireless hard drive  (Seagate Wireless Built In Streaming STCK1000100Just to watch my movies. Now with this new 128 GB hard drive I can fit tons of movies on it and I no longer need the old wireless hard drive. (One less thing to lose on travel)Final thought:For people who have an older iPad (like I did) then this is a no brainer buy this new iPad you won\u2019t be disappointed! It is much lighter than previous versions. Wayyy faster! And still sleek and built to last as every other iPad is. The new storage options give you the ability to carry more pictures, movies, books , games with you and the battery life is superb coming in at 10+hours. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It might be a little expensive, but if you buy smart you'll have this tablet for a long time with no problems.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco", "Author": "P.

By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out.

The specs are about the same as the New Ipad (iPad 3) and iPad 4. I would definitely get an iPad Air over an iPad Mini, even with the Retina Display, as what made the Mini desirable was the smaller weight and size. The Air is really light, more manageable for someone who uses it continuously.All in all, if you can afford it, it is a great gift, to yourself or seomone else (you really like :)).", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPad Review from an Android user!", "Author": "Jason Wang", "ReviewID": "R3MRBK7OU4EGHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased as a long time android user because I needed something for textbooks and the 4:3 aspect ratio works a lot better for text books than 16:9 (I tired the Nexus 10 for a week as well)..Here is my review after  a week:The first thing I noticed was how light and compact it was, coming from the Nexus 10 I was surprised how easy it was to hold with one hand (although you still wouldn't for long periods of time) and how compact it was for a 10in tablet. The tablet is as fast as anything out right now, to be honest I don't play games but in terms of everyday use everything was fine...but at the same time every iPad that I've used before felt fast as well, I have heard of some issues with tablet optimization for iOS7 but I haven't encountered any. The screen is bright and sharp, text is really easy to read vs a higher PPI tablet (nexus 10) I really couldnt tell a difference with the extra pixels. The color on the iPad is very good once again this is to be expected as Apple always makes high quality devices.The only Cons I can't think of is the speaker placement and feel of the glass (as mentioned in other reviews). The iPad has \"stereo speakers\" which are located on the bottom, I really wish they would have put one on each side instead of both on one side. Watching youtube or netflix in landscape is kind of weird since all the side comes from the right side, kind of defeats the purpose of stereo speakers imo since I never watch fullscreen videos in portrait mode. The nexus 7and 10  have  really good desigsn for speakers that I wish Apple would've adopted.The other con is the feel of the screen, to be honest it feels a bit cheap...compared to previous iPads and the nexus devices the feel of the screen on the iPad air is the worst. It feels like plastic and it just doesnt feel solid when you push down. I'm sure this is a sacrifice that Apple had to make in order to reduce the weight to me the benefits of having a lighter, smaller device outweigh the feel of the screen (something that I'll eventually get used to).Other notes: I haven't used the camera, sorry but I never use the camera on a tablet to take pictures but from what I hear from reviews it takes pretty much what you would expect from a camera on a tablet. I probably wouldn't upgrade if I had an iPad 3 or iPad 4 unless your someone who has to have the newest tech or is absolutely miserable with the weight.If you do want to purchase it you can get it for 479.99 + Tax, go to Walmart's website or you can have any other retailer price match it.All in all this is an excellent tablet besides the minor gripes...the only Android tablet I can see competing with the iPad is the Nexus 10 v2 if it ever comes out...and while I preferred the Nexus 10 for media viewing, real stereo speakers and OS, reading textbooks felt a little cramped and since I'm using this tablet primarily for \"school\" the 4:3 factor fit my needs better.So there it is proof that you can be a fan of both Android and iOS :)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Experience", "Author": "Dragember", "ReviewID": "R3RZ0F8IARVY1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first tablet was a Nexus 7, and while I enjoyed it immenseilly I was ultimately disappointed in how slow it eventually got (speedy at Christmas, snail slow come April despite factory reset and other attempts to speed it up. Bought my brother a new nexus 7 that summer only to discover its speed was on par with the Nexus I currently owned. Very bizarre). I was skeptical whether or not I would enjoy a tablet experience, so the Nexus 7 was none the less a great first tablet. It could do anything any other tablet could without putting a dent in your pocket.I decided to get the iPad Air this season, specifically the wifi 32gb space gray version.Never owned an iPad before, so I can't really tell you how the models compare,However some things I note, the screen is rather large (duh) which does make typing with the onscreen keyboard difficult. However the screen real estate and quality is stunning, and if typing is a huge issue for you there is the iPad mini and other tablets. That's the trade off, and this is always a choice you have to make between 10 inch vs. 7inch tablets, no matter what brand you're looking at.The glass does feel rather thin, and I am concerned about its durability. I have read that the screen is durable however, and this perception is due to the lightening of the device causing the screen to sound thinner. Supposedly I will be able to confirm this with a case, as the addition of the case will give the tapping of the screen a deeper sound. Apparently it all comes down to acoustics - though a specification on glass thickness versus previous models would be nice.The design of the tablet is exquisite, definitely some top of the line material choices. The tablet has a VERY sturdy feel.Lots of free apps come with this tablet, which all work excellently and efficiently. There is no hesitation between tasks, and the speed is phenomenal.Overall I noticed the quality of apps and how they work on the operating system is MUCH better with apple than it was with android. However, the apple App Store isn't very easy to navigate. Google store is much more user friendly.No widgets, makes customizabibility limited.Multitasking is an ease with this tablet due to gestures. I love how well the gestures work. You can swipe between apps.Battery lasts insanely long, mine averages 12 hours of use.Hasn't overheated (vague warmth can be felt), even with gameplay.Sound from speakers at bottom of iPad sound full. Other tablets I've played with have a tin-metal quality sound emit from them, as though the speakers strain to emit a hearable noise.All iPad Airs, according to Apple's website, come with a complimentary one year limited warranty.Cool front AND back microphones work together to cancel out noise when using skype and FaceTime. Sounds very clear and crisp, I recommend you check out some videos on it.Overall I would say an A+ tablet. I mainly listed some concerns and observations, but that aside this thing is amazing! I love and, it from what I've heard of previous models, I'll hopefully be using this tablet for years to come (number one selling point for me is that apple devices function excellently passed a year).Update December 3, 2013:I've noticed a bizarre memory leak that occurs whenever I watch videos using Apple's video app (love them digital copies). I was testing the video streaming and after I noticed entire GBs were gone! After shutting down the app and fiddling around I realized that the iPad stores memory it buffers and keeps it hostage. However, after going back to the app and quickly loading the same movie and exiting before it begins to buffer the memory reappears. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised that if you watched movies completely through your memory would be restored each time. Still this is a rather large flaw on Apple's part, and I'm not sure if it occurs with any of the other video streaming apps. I'll be sending them a message to see if they're working on a patch for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best tablet just got better", "Author": "G. Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R1M0P0IQSS4RK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the first iPad was released in the spring of 2010, it was accompanied by a cacophony of jokes about its name and its size. Three and a half years later, the release of the iPad Air, the fifth full-size tablet Apple has offer, has been much calmer. This is the fourth full-size iPad I have owned, beginning with the AT&T; 3G model which was released in May, 2010, about a month after the first WiFi only iPads arrived. Every one of my iPads has had an AT&T; cellular data.Until this model I have purchased the largest capacity solid state drive Apple has offered. This year there is a 128GB iPad, which costs about $100 more than my 64GB model. Here is the reason I did not select the higher capacity-iCloud. Data stored on iCloud is instantly available across multiple IOS and OSX devices. With all that storage (I buy 50GBs annually) why duplicate it on a hard disk?The iPad Air is incredibly light(about a pound) and has a slightly smaller external footprint than previous models. The retina display actually seems sharper, if such a thing is possible. It also holds a charge for even longer than before.Beyond the physical beauty of the iPad Air is its amazing utility. As a trial lawyer I can easily access the firm's network. This means that  every file and every document is instantly at my command. In just a few years time I have learned that I no longer need to drag loads of paper files and depositions with me to court.Over 400,000 apps are built exclusively for iPad, and well over a million iPhone apps run on my device as well. It is an incredibly powerful platform, well on its way to replacing laptops for all but the most labor intensive tasks. When I travel, I typically bring only my iPad-no laptop, no hard copy of a file.  I didn't really appreciate just how dependent I had become on the iPad until this June when a federal judge held that  I could bring  either a laptop or a tablet into the courthouse. I chose the iPad.My weapon of choice-the iPad. This is the one tablet to buy if you are serious about using a tablet.

Plus, the rounded edges on the back make this really comfortable to hold for long periods.I'm glad I went with Apple, because the quality is unbeatable. For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience.

I also have a motorola xoom and it doesn't even come close to the ease of use and just generally aesthetics of this ipad.  Its probably best that I break it down into pros and cons to give the most accurate picture I can of what I have found since I bought myself, my wife and my son all the new ipad Airs.--The Good--The business apps I use are all exactly what I hoped for.  I use Chrome for browser and it looks incredible.  When tablets came out, this is what I imagined browsing the internet should look like on a tablet.  The form factor is great, and the Air is as light as advertised.  Despite other's claims of durability issues, I have found it to be quite durable even with my minimal case.  Movies in correct format play flawlessy and my music sounds great.  Paired with some good headphones, long plane trips become tolerable in the worst of seats.  Facetiming with family is a breeze and the 'cool' factor is definitely still present.--The Bad--There are also some cons which I think takes the Air down a half star to a star.  First off the 16GB model which I purchased for my wife from a big box store after I purchased my 64GB from Amazon is simply not enough memory.  I know thats a choice etc but for those that are purchasing for the first time, do NOT buy the 16 GB model unless you plan on mostly using for browsing the internet.  Apps + music + movies will fill up your 16 (actually less after what IOS takes up) gigs very quickly.Second, they should have put a little more RAM in.  The browser occaisonally crashes and there is definitely some latency on scrolling for more content intensive pages.Lastly a few random complaints; the screen also seems dimmer than the ipad with retina (last generation), there is no additional storage, and there seems to be a growing number of junk apps/games.--The Ugly--I will preface this with this: only power users are likely to encounter the ugly.Synching with Apple TV is not as easy as advertised.  Sometimes the air icon shows up, sometimes it doesn't.You can play MKV files but it is painful.  You need a third party player, then you have to transfer movies via http (drag and drop doesn't work), and you will not see where that space went, should you forget about things you've transferred via that method.If you have a home media server and use a PC, itunes + network drives + adding files to the ipad reminds me of the days of the 2400 baud modem.  You wait, and you wait, and you wait.  Anything you really want to transfer, transfer it from your network drive to your pc, then add to library, then transfer to ipad.--Overall--I still prefer this to my android pad or any other tablets I have encountered. The pros outweigh the cons if you have the money to spend considering how much more these are than comperable android tablets.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifes Toy", "Author": "victor a. quaranta jr", "ReviewID": "RMRD11B7V8WY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife is very thrifty and seldom ask for anything.

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice hardware for the price! Lightweight, a joy to use", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R3K3EAML83WH3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Android products mainly, but I first delved into touch devices with the first generation iPod Touch so I am familiar with iOS to an extent. For the past few years I've used Android FroYo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, and now Jelly Bean. I also have a Kindle Fire HD. The iPad Air is my first iPad, and I chose to go with the iPad Air because it has a much higher resolution than the best Android Tablets, with a really slick dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a close second but is more expensive than the iPad Air which was on sale during a Black Thursday promotion. The Galaxy Tab 3 just doesn't even come close with the screen resolution.The iOS 7 interface is OK. I prefer Jelly Bean's interface. Although clean and simple, the iOS interface isn't intuitive. There are too many sub-menus interwoven in odd areas. To change language, I have to go into no less than 2 sub-menu layers. Siri is fine, but Google Now/Google Search was far more intelligent and effective. Siri's default US female voice is much more realistic and smoother, but Google Now's other voices along with IVONA rectify that situation fairly well.The battery life on the iPad Air is very good. After an hour or so, I'm still above 90%. The WiFi is fast, and the overall UI is smooth. The movie/graphics playback is super fast. I can watch Flash based movies/video within the Safari browser without any hiccups.Compared to my 7 inch Kindle Fire HD, I felt that the 9.7 inch (Air's display size) or 10 inch screen size is just right, but only because the iPad Air is extremely thin and lightweight. The 7 inch KFHD is large enough to be usable for reading magazines, but it is not a good use of space. I have to flick through 2 or 3 screens while the iPad Air will show the entire page (in a very legible font size) in one screen. The KFHD is also heavy, so hopefully the new KFHDX is thinner and lighter.I used to make fun of Apple for going with the Lightning connector, but after using it up close, I can understand why it is innovative. It is made out of a solid chunk of metal with contacts on both sides. There's no \"right\" way of plugging it in, unlike USB where I constantly flip it around trying to figure out which side is up. But I still feel micro-USB is the right way to go, due to its universal acceptance with devices. The included 12W power adapter can actually charge the iPad Air at up to 14W of power based on what I saw with my Kill-A-Watt.With respect to the hardware and design, the iPad Air is outstanding at this price point. Aside from the hardware, the bulk of the iPad Air and Apple experience centers around iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple software. This is an area where I feel Google far surpasses Apple. The Apple ID system is cumbersome and annoying to use. I had to login probably a dozen times during the registration process, and buying/installing free apps required me to enter my password each time. It didn't seem like all of Apple's programs were tightly integrated because I had to use my Apple ID each time I fired up the apps for the first time. Once everything was setup and installed, it seemed fine. That said, installing and running Google's apps on the iPad was significantly less painful. The first time I used my Google account for an app (I believe it was YouTube), all of the other Google Apps recognized me and started syncing. Google Now/Google Search also puts Siri to shame, albeit Siri seems more \"human\" with basic functions. For instance, asking about the weather, Siri actually told me (In Chinese and English) that the weather wasn't very good at 27F. Doing basic searches, Siri and Google Now are about equal, but Google Now seems more intelligent with some of the intermediate activities like unit conversions or advanced searches.I never liked iTunes in the past, and my opinion has not changed with ITunes 11. It is overly complex to use. With Google/Android, I can access Play with a browser and have new apps sent to my devices with the greatest of ease. Syncing calendar events, email, contacts, etc... is also far easier with just using a browser versus the iTunes program on my PC. The good news is that iTunes isn't too bad to use on the iPad. Running Zinio, Conde Naste magazine apps, and other apps was smooth and problem-free.For those that like to use their tablet for browsing or reading magazines, or watching videos, I'd highly recommend a 10 inch display (the Air is 9.7\" but falls in the range). My 7 inch Kindle Fire is fine to use, but it is frustrating to use for magazines due to the amount of panning that is needed. After using the iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy S3 feels claustrophobic with its 4.9\" display.Overall: 5/5 stars, the iPad Air is a well-designed device with great hardware especially with the Black Thursday/Friday promotions. However, Apple has a lot of catching up to do with respect to its software designs. I very much prefer Google's ecosystem as it is more \"cloud-based\" than what Apple is trying to do. Google's ecosystem feels almost seamlessly integrated while Apple's ecosystem felt more separated.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb", "Author": "kalip", "ReviewID": "RQPH5B045CWYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second iPad, I purchased an iPad 4 around a year ago.This iPad air is all I thought it would be and much more; it's muchthinner and the 64-bit A7 processor makes it faster it is also quite narrower although the screen sizeremains the same 9.7 inches.The retina display is  stunning and the battery life is great.

I need to be on the computer for 7-12 hours a day.I already own a MacAir, which I love, but as light as it is, it still weighs about 3 pounds ( still, I highly recommend and love my MacAir!).Anyway, I also have an ipad 3 and an Ipad mini, iphone etc., you get the idea. The reason I am mentioning this, is because I have a bad back and that is the only reason I have been updating devices. I am trying to find the \"perfect\" computer for my use. If I can help even one other person out there in my situation ( and save them a ton of money I had to spend <g>), I will be happy! :)First let me tell you a little about the Ipad Air...IT ROCKS!!Although the speed on the Air is much faster then my Ipad 3, whether syncing with iTunes, browsing the web or just getting emails, the speed was not the reason I upgraded. I am not a game player or a number cruncher so the speed of the ipad 3 was just fine for me.What did get my attention was the weight! I had already bought the new ipad mini, which is super cool and a lot of fun.I actually intend to keep it. However, as good as it's screen is, I cannot see me using it 10 hours a day. If I had 20 year old eyes, it might have beat out my Air! ;-)The a Ipad 3 was about 1.7 pounds. That may not seem like a lot, but for me it could not be a one handed device. I needed to put a case on it, making it 2 pound device. Compared to the Ipad Air, which is about 1 pound, that was almost a 50% reduction in weight! The reason the reduction is so much, is I do not feel I need a case with the Air. I have covered it with clear coat all over and that is it. I do not seeing it slipping out of my hands. However, when I travel, I will use a 5 oz cover or just a Smart Cover (3.5 oz).I know it can be dangerous, not using a case, but I am extremely careful and i bought the special Apple warranty. Besides, isn't the reason we spend so much on these because they weigh so little and are aesthetically pleasing?It is too beautiful to cover up. So far, no regrets at all, but I need to find something to lean the Air against while lying down.If my review helped you, please click \"helpful\" below.

This unit was purchased from another retailer as part of a bundle and offered flexible payments. I was looking at the Air laptop, but then heard iPad air was coming out.  Sadly it will be going back.  iPad air is thin, lightweight, perfect size screen.The color is super sharp.  Super fast typing and going from app to app,, when it wanted to work. Which meant I really couldn't tell you if they worked well or not.  I'd only had it for a day and the screen froze.  Could only go back to the home screen, then loose any work one might have done. Couldn't turn it off. Then, when I was getting ready to put it back in the box, amazingly it decided to work. The set-up wizard was super fast helping this technically challenged person set up and link  all her accounts.  I REALLY liked that it was a tablet and a small laptop as it came with an awesome keypad. So then I started downloading music and wanted to hear the small ball speaker that came in the bundle. The female plug in the air was not quite the right size. I couldn't get a snug fit, also tried with the ear buds and another speaker. And as I fidgeted with the plugs to get a secure connection to receive a signal, the song would stop playing and the volume on the screen kept going up and down. Is this supposed to happen???? As for the sound, I wasn't expecting much from such a thin tablet. The speakers were on the back side but I'm not sure if speakers could be placed in the front. But since the speaker plugs won't fit, what's the point? You'd need to buy some blue-tooth speakers to really hear better soundIt would be hard for me to compare the ipad air to other tablets as this would have been my first touch-screen device other than my android smart phone.I'd have to agree with previous reviews. I also feel this device was rushed on the market before X-mas. With the screen freezing and the plug being poorly made, is a good indication of frantically putting something together and getting it on the market for the holidays. I really hope that the next generation iPad air will be greatly improved as I really like apple products,and software, and was hoping this would be the first.Apple, I am disappointed.

The price and versatility of the Kindle were better than other options available.  I do not use my device as a media player, but that seemed to be a nice option.  However, my spouse insisted I look at the \"Apple iPad Air\" before I made any purchase.After looking at the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" and the \"Apple iPad Air\" side-by-side in the big electronics retailer, I had to admit it, he was right!

Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.  Tried calling Apple several times, but all they could offer was to do the restore.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why did I wait so long", "Author": "RUSH46", "ReviewID": "R3TO3MYT3N3189", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.

But not without some downfalls due to recent changes.", "Author": "Sean Cushman", "ReviewID": "RNGUUYGUJBQ80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alright so I know if you are reading this then you already have your mind set on a new iPad and hey you know what? That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty.

It also addressed certain niggling complaints I had with my earlier iPads. With regard to other devices I tried, the latest Kindle Fires were excellent (great displays - and the price was right) but not sufficiently versatile to meet all my needs. The LG 8.3 was another excellent Android tablet but it didn't seem like a truly finished product (couldn't, for instance, lock it in landscape mode - very frustrating when trying to use it while lying in bed). It also seemed a bit pricy for what it was at nearly the price of an iPad Mini Retina (a tablet I was seriously considering for its portability). For what it's worth, the only tablets I tried, or even wanted to try, were those with very high pixel density displays. Later I also ruled out the true 7 inch devices with their 22 square inch displays (the iPad Mini's is 30 square inches, the LG 8.3's is 31, while the iPad Air's is 45).

The total length of the lightning cable is approximately 3.25 feet. Being used to longer cables, I've accidentally yanked this thing a few times but that hasn't done anything to my iPad Air... yet. However, you can probably purchase a longer lightning cable online.Also, I found the rate that the iPad downloads apps is about 5x slower than even an iPhone 4. Apple support told me this is usually because newer devices have a lot more to do like connecting to iCloud for the first time, etc, but I don't buy it. I think it's just because iPad apps are a lot larger than iPhone so I don't expect this to change, but I'll update if it gets any faster. UPDATE: Yes, my iPad does download at fast speeds now after one day, so don't worry if you encounter the same issue at first!While these two points are on the negative side, keep in mind that my overall experience is easily still 5 stars.

Tha calculator is not located in the same menu as for an iPhone (the one when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen - I don't remember what it's called). This makes accessing the calculator, which I use a lot for work, very inconvenient.3. Many apps for the iPhone (Instagram, snapchat) have not been adapted for use on the ipad. This isn't necessarily an ipad issue, but definitely something to consider.Overall, it's a great product! I firmly believe that you get what you pay for.

I'll just mention two things that stand out for me, one positive and two negatives.First, the negatives: 1) The screen gets really dirty really easily. Apple says it's oleophobic, repels oils. I've found that to be untrue. My Kindle Fire HDX screen is MUCH better--it seems to be a harder, slicker surface, so fingerprints and such don't stick to the screen. Putting the Tech Armor screen protector on the iPad helps. 2) The app store is filled with a lot of junk, and there are so many apps there that it takes a lot of time to wade through to something that actually looks useful. Many of the apps are almost duplicates of each other. On the plus side, and the reason I got the iPad in the first place, there are some apps that are written only for the iPad.Second, the positive: this thing is a true battery miser. I can go a couple of days between charges, more if I'm not using it heavily. I haven't been able to test this, but I imagine it could play movies all through a long plane ride, whereas the Fire HDX would need an external battery for recharge.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "I-pad Air", "Author": "John Bohn", "ReviewID": "R1ECG8I901L13C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a former Nook tablet user that converted to the Apple I-Pad.

I had cracked my screen and it seemed as if it was slowing down over time, probably due to the updated operating systems putting more stress on the aging processor and memory.So, I saw a good deal on a used model appear on Amazon, and decided to go for it. For little over $500, after I traded in my older model, I had a brand-new, or close to it, iPad Air. The first thing you'll notice is the weight. It is at least half that of the previous models. The bezel thinner on the sides and the new thunderbolt port on the bottom. I also love the addition of stereo speakers, as I own one of the biggest recording studios on the East Coast and love to try out the music I produce on a multitude of sound systems. This allows me to hear what I've done in stereo, on a lower common denominator, so as to know what my music sounds like coming from the speakers of a system millions of people own.The next thing I noticed, is the screen seemed quite a bit brighter then my iPad 3. This could just be because of the aging screen tech under the glass, or some other factor. But it definitely helps for reading, even at half power, in darker and lighter situations that I have no control over. Next up, the speed at which everything operates. Not only loading software and apps, but in switching apps and multitasking. There is just a zip to everything now.The biggest thing I noticed, the Internet is 10 times as fast as it was in my prior model. I'm going to guess the MIMO has something to do with that, along with the two antennas. Giving a stronger signal, which in turn allows for the fastest Internet possible. I have 50 Mb Internet, and I now feel like I'm using every bit of it in doing something as simple as loading webpages or downloading videos, games and music. When I load a webpage, everything appears instantly, no more loading in of different aspects of that page, everything is just there. I think it is the first time, and Ive owned  hundreds of computers over the years, that I've noticed any webpage load so instantly.Games look every bit as good as they can, due to the increased processing power of the CPU and GPU. If Apple would only make a proprietary gamepad for the iPad, they would have a true contender for a great video game system on the market. Some of the games, especially those from Gameloft and EA, have every bit the quality that you see from any game on modern systems, bar a few effects here and there.Even music production can be done at high-quality, for the home or studio producer, with decent results. I've heard some songs recorded completely via the iPad, that you would've sworn were done in multi-million-dollar studios. They are that good. Which goes to show, great music is made by a great producer and not the equipment behind him.So, to sum things up:Positives:Great, bright, high resolution screenSmaller and lighterIncredible portable powerGreatly improved internet speedStereo speakers built inAwesome games and production softwareCheap accessories from third party vendorsNegative:Price, though I imagine we would sacrifice some quality at a lower price pointOverall, you will not find a better portable computer for the price. Anything Windows is going to have issues. Whether that be with drivers, malware, viruses or some or the other issue that goes along with owning a Windows machine. Sure, they are more powerful and will allow you a greater depth of software, but you make trade-offs with that power in size, weight and ease-of-use. So, if you have the means, definitely get the iPad Air. The upgrades are truly worth the extra cost over previous models.

Apple keeps getting so close, in some ways, yet so far away in others. Please let me explain.First, an iPad is overall a great piece of hardware. The iPad Air is lighter, thinner, and faster than all other tablet devices on the market. However, it does come with a few issues that leaves me hesitant to give more than a rating of 3 stars. Please let me explain.First off, Apple is notorious of fleecing every penny you have out of you. It isn't just the brand name or the product quality.For those that remember the days when buying a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES for short), what did you get in that box? You got the connector cable to the TV, you got not just one but two controllers, a light zapper gun (Duck Hunt anyone?), and up to three games that came included all in one box.What does Apple doe? Let's see. You have to buy a screen protector (separately) a protecting case (separately) connectors to a TV (separately) a stylus (separately), etc. etc. even if you get a good Black Friday deal somewhere, you can end up almost spending the same or more of a cost on a used car versus the cost of the iPad with all the extras you end up being required to buy on your own. You also get another additional $99.00 charge for a very limited (basically only a 1 time only use) AppleCare warranty plan.Also, there is the hardware. I know Apple is known to hold back a bit and choose stable hardware versus the latest greatest things out there. I get that. However, there are a number of areas Apple slacked on A LOT on the iPad Air.1. It still uses a USB 2.0 connection over a connection to your PC. Even if your PC has a USB 3.0 port, the iPad Air still only transfers data at USB 2.0 speed (a snail's pace by comparison).2. The battery in the iPad Air is actually half the size of the battery in the iPad 4. Despite claims of optimizations and so-on, Apple has still refused to spend some of the billions they earn each year on actual real research and development on a longer lasting battery with a much longer amount of juice. You shouldn't have to run to the nearest plug-in jack every few feet to recharge the thing. Likewise, am I the only one that realizes that solar charger calculators have existed since the 70's? If Apple would simply put a slightly larger sized battery inside the iPad, with a solar charger built into the case itself, no one would ever need to plug it in again to recharge it. As how very dated solar chargers are for small electronics, there is no excuse for not having it.3. The iPad was recently boosted in storage capacity from the former max 64GB to the current 128GB model. I do appreciate that. What I don't appreciate it just how many years the 64GB max storage model existed and how many years it took Apple to raise storage capacity. As fast as technology advances, we should have at least 512GB or even 1TB storage on an iPad. Consider that desktop PCs can have a 6 to 8 and soon to be 10TB storage capacity, a minor 512GB or 1 single TB of storage space should be no issue for Apple to provide, especially since Apple still offers no micro-SD slot for adding more storage capacity.Finally, I will say, I find it very inconsiderate, rude, and showing true colors on just how far Apple is in bed with Obama, the White House, the police state, and the National Security Agency (NSA). Just look up the Part 2 of Infect and Protect video by Jacob Appelbaum. About half-way through the video, he shows with official NSA slides that proves they have a 100% chance to be able to turn on any Apple device, i.e. iPad, IPhone, etc. They can turn on the microphone when you are not using it, they can also activate the camera to take photos of you, all with everyone around being left completely unaware. They have full access to your contact lists, including the complete addresses and phone numbers of all of your contacts, have access to all of your passwords, all of your email, all of your Google searches, and much more. Unfortunately, Apple decided to give in and join the PRISM program after Steve Jobs died. When that happened, any possible minor chance of any privacy, freedom, or liberty any owner of any Apple iDevice had, went right out the window. Could Apple have done their part to protect its customers? Yes, and very easily. The could have chosen to encrypt all user information and data stored at Apple and in the iCLoud. They could have been respectable and NOT give the FBI, CIA, NSA, or anyone else 100% universal backdoor access keys of their customer's devices. They could have added a completely free open-source plug-in offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called HTTPS-Everywhere into Safari on iDevices, preventing web traffic from being intercepted, by using a SSL connection everywhere, instead of use the very unsafe standard HTTP connection on the web. They could built into iOS a 2 form of authentication, instead of just a small 4 character password. They could have built access directly to the Tor network for full free anonymity. Apple did none of this, and it would have costed the very little in time and resources to implement. Until Apple grows up and starts fighting for the privacy, liberty, and freedom on their customers, I cannot in good faith suggest anyone buy an Apple Product again.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice increase in speed,", "Author": "Mike60", "ReviewID": "R1QHQO5QBVHQFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "light and fast, easy too hold, screen is very nice.

No problems with my wife's iPad2.  I've tried several sounds to announce an email, and when I tried the duck quack I can never change it or shut is off. It's so annoying I quit watching Duck Dynasty! Also, when an email arrives you have to scroll to the most recent, it doesn't do it automatically. The worst problem was ignoring my touches, even though the icon would highlight, indicating it recognized my touch. However, when I did the software update a few days ago the touch problem went away and always recognizes my touch.The biggest issue is once you build your life around one of these monsters it has you for the rest of your life. You cannot live with out it. Carrying mine to a hardware dealer 55 miles away to use a coupon that wouldn't print out saved me $70, as it was still on the screen at the check stand. If left on all night in the sleep mode it only uses about 1% of the battery charge.A couple days ago  I stumbled into an iPad chat and some guru suggested doing a \"reset\" to cure the locked on duck quack, that did the trick. I also saw I wasn't alone with this problem.  However the command said it wouldn't change any of  of your stored data, but I later found it deleted several critical, most used passwords, and I had to track down  my list.

This thing is so much easier to hold with one hand and feels much more manageable as a reading tablet. The screen is much clearer thanks to the Retina display (same resolution as the 4th gen iPad). I cannot comment on a previous poster's comment that the screen is not as bright, but the display is plenty bright for me when I need it to be.Typing on the tablet does feel a little different than before, but I do not think it feels like it's going to break. I actually prefer typing on the new one. It is difficult to explain, but I suggest trying it out in store if you are seriously concerned about the feel.Overall, I would definitely recommend this tablet (especially if you are tied to the iOS ecosystem).

Apple has continued improving and offering what they deem most important about these devices - usability, great display, wide range of inexpensive apps, durability, quality and lightness. They have not added features that some other tablets offer, but which may not be needed by everyone.ProsThe thing is zippy, looks great and works out of the box. Any questions I have or problems are quickly addressed by the Apple support community or the Genius Bar. There are a ton of apps, many free. IWorks and iLife are free, so I was up and running on Pages and iMovie in ten minutes at no cost. And it's LIGHT. I didn't think 0.4 lbs would be abig deal, but it is. For me, it crosses the threshold where sometimes I freak I left it behind because I can't feel it in my bag, and it's comfortable to hold continually.ConsApple didn't include a slipcover keyboard, but you can buy one in the Apple Store. It's a bit more expensive, but it's more durable, of higher quality, and retains more resell value than competitors. It doesn't have all those add-ons that one in one hundred users would use, which would make it weight as much as the surface or a garden brick.It's a five star device.

Those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things. And the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad Air was that it didn't have a fingerprint scanner and it didn't come in gold. The 80's called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back.Most of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not mention all the other advantages the Surface 2 has. And for the few reviews that do mention the other features the Surface 2 has, they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps. Really?I will use the Surface 2 as comparison because it will show how ridiculous the bias is regardless of capabilities.What the reviews usually leave out or down play.Surface 21. Full office software. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.2. Wide screen optimized for wide screen movies. When held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example, you get a a longer list so you don't scroll as much.3. Sd slot. Easy to download or upload data on the fly.4. 3.0 USB so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not have all your eggs in one basket. Or transfer files with anything that has a USB plug and also charge your phone. Ipad? No, unless you have the adapter and you can't charge your phone.5. Can print to almost every printer.6. Hdmi port7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.8. Built in two position kickstand.9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.11. Do a split screen on the tablet.12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.14. Drag and drop files.15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.Now these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.The ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.ipad Air1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.The ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.Now back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.The tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.The boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.I went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.The tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.With a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.As I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.The only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.And the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.If you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.If your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment.
