No problems with it so far. It is quicker than either of my son's Kindles, and comparable in speed to our laptops. I don't know a lot about resolution, but the picture is plenty clear for my purposes. I mostly do e-mail, facebook, and shop on it. No problems connecting to wifi. I didn't want to spend a lot, so I settled for the small screen size in order to get the speed. If I had it to do over, I would spend more and get a bigger screen.

Review", "ReviewID": "R1H490ZYD1GZTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "R7/16 GIG - LI-ION BATT. /// bad reviews are for 8 GIG model w/LI-POLY BATT.9/6/2013Very fast, Pretty happy for my first tablet. Audio is very good, the speaker hole is on the back but even if you cover it it's as thoe the sound comes from around the screen very clearly. video clear and sharp. Stalled shutting down once and had to use reset pin hole but NO OTHER OPERATING PROBLEMS. Draw backs; CHARGES THROUGH MICRO USB ONLY, so no key board or phone tether charging at the same time. (Booklet was for 8GB model and states LITHIUM-POLYMER BATT.), charge at least 10hrs. 2x then 7hrs. after that. I followed and have tested several ways. I get 2:35 hrs. down to 12% with WIFI ON / FULL BRIGHT / FULL VOL.  ---  and 2:56 hrs. WIFI OFF / 1/2 BRIGHT / 1/2 VOL., BATTERY HISTORY STATES ESTAMATED BATT. LIFE OF 4:30. It charges to 80% in 2:30 hrs. and to 100% by 3:00 hrs. WIFI on / full bright / screen on with game on but not but not played. Front and rear cameras are both center at top, that's good but 3MP is low quality so don't expect to use it as anything more then a novelty. At $105.00 its a nice unit but the short battery life and lack separate charging makes it more of a home toy then a work tool.UPDATE;9/15 5hrs. with WIFI music screen asleep, add screen on first 1hr. + reckless racing 2 last :30 min.  After 9dys. of charging for at least 10hrs. and then unplugging and using until drained down to 10%.For 10dys charge it for 10hrs. drain to 10%. music playing screen at 1/3 or off I REACHED 5:15hrs at 4%.TWO separate batt. saver prog. say battery is a LI-ION not LI-PLY - ??ALL YOU NEED  is an APP. KILLER and to keep your screen low and WIFI OFF as much as possible.BOO 1 STAR FOR NO SEPERATE CHARGE PORT BOOOOO!UPDATE;9/16 WILL use screen 1/3 to play and see if time drops back to 2:30mins.UPDATE; I'M FROM THE FURTHER,FURTHER FUTURE: Actually it's still 9/15 11:37pm.+ 3:00hrs to charge to 100%- 3:40hrs to drain to 10% playing RECKLESS RACER 2, SCREEN AT 1/3.. A few more tests to see if times hold.the times would be:10x10hr charge/drain to 10%- 2:35 100% bright- 2:56  66% bright- 3:45  33% bright- 4:20  33% WIFI OFF, 3 SHORTER MOVIES.- 5:15  0% bright-sleep+music.85% of the time on.? 6:00  0 screen-music only?GET an auto APP. killer, or close your APPS. instead of skipping to desk top.DONT get a BATTERY SAVER, Just DIMM the lights, KILL the APPS and turn off WIFI as much as possible.USE the internal GRAPH for BATT. charge/discharge records.P/S The BATT. has never been more then slightly temped once while charging.UPDATE 10/14/13 BATTERY DROPS VERY QUICKLY FROM 100 - 77%, as little as 20mn but can be extended to as much as 1:05hr with 1/3 bright, WIFI OFF, low process task like note taking - drawing n such. THEN holds on much better / progressively longer down to the 14% warning and the 2nd warning at 4%. charging gives a little beep once in a while. A very good sounding but cheaper set of Head phones with 2AAA batt powered noise canceling gave me a little hum while charging but a GOOD set of ear buds sound AWSOME and really make the movie watching an EXPERIANCE, the buds that came with it I threw out / l-side did not work, then fell apart.UPDATE 10/18/13 Question was asked -ALL APPS ARE ON MICRO-SD-CARD BUT SAYS MEMORY FULL, WHY IS THIS?- Open -settings- and tap -storage- , The first level of -internal storage- is for the operating system and down loads, next is the partitioned -nand flash- which is 13.70 of your 16gig internal memory. 3rd is -SD CARD- which in your case is the 8gig micro sd card, 4th is -USB STORAGE- should you want to use an EXTERNAL FLASH DRIVE... Now tap -APPS- to the right you will see -DOWNLOADED-, tap each APP you will see 4 option buttons, if the bottom left says -move to sd card- and is lit up- tap and move to sd card /which is actually the /internal nand flash/, wait until it changes to -move to tablet-, if it's not lit you can't move it, if you don't need or want it,, uninstall it,, tap back up arrow and tap the next APP, if your still FULL you have way,way,way too many APPS, APPS do not run off micro-sd-card/ it is for photo's video's and movies. APP KILLERS do not remove they just stop them from running and eating up battery power and processor time, Try -ADVANCED TASK MANAGER- icon is a -green robot with a red x on it/ it's free. turn off WIFI when ever possible to extend batt. //GOOD LUCK//Question; What kind of charger? : A 2' micro usb to usb that plugs in to the wall adaptor, car or computer.

I have used tablets which have belonged to other people, but I never thought I needed one myself. Within the same week, both my desktop and my laptop died (power supply and hard drive failure, respectively) so I bought a tablet while I was waiting on my dead electronics to be repaired (both were still under warranty thankfully!). I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would be relegated to a shelf most of the time once I had my PC and laptop back up and running, so I read through many reviews of tablets on Amazon, NewEgg, and TigerDirect, and decided to purchase this one. It was a complete mistake.Out of the box it was perfectly fine; I had no problems with anything. The wifi connected everywhere I tried it, the Play Store worked fine, apps installed and updated fine, the only problem is that it had to be constantly restarted to keep everything running fine. I would open Chrome and then watch a show on Netflix and then open the Kindle app and read a while and then watch a video on YouTube and by the time I got to YouTube, it was so boggy that I had to restart to get it running smoothly again. You guys ever use a PC that's so old and decrepit and the video card is such a piece of junk that when you close a window sometimes you still see parts of the window left on the desktop for a couple of minutes before the icons come back? That's what this tablet was like. The screen is pretty unresponsive too; trying to use the Facebook app was torture. You'd just have to keep poking around until the screen finally let you open the thing you were trying to open. I guess I could have gotten a stylus, but that doesn't change that fact that the touch screen is more of a you-have-to-jab-it-firmly-a-couple-of-times screen.I probably still would have kept this junky tablet anyway just to take to my second job because for all its problems, I still liked having a tablet, except that one night (about a week after I had gotten it) while I was watching a video I downloaded, a yellowish dotted line appeared down the screen and never went away. It was a line of dead pixels. I contacted Amazon immediately and was sent a how-to-return email within 5 hours. I sent it back the next day, and a day after they received it, my money was refunded to my debit card. Hardware fails and we all know it's unpredictable, but even if this tablet hadn't gotten the line of dead pixels I still couldn't in good conscience rate this tablet at any more than 2 stars, even when it was in perfect working order, new out of the box. Amazon gets 5 stars for their amazing service, but this tablet only gets 2 stars.I do have a recommendation to make: when I got the money refunded, I decided to buy the tablet I was going to buy in the first place--the Asus MeMo HD 7. It's got 16 GB internal, with up to 64 GB external (microSD or SDHC), a 1.2 GhZ quad core processor, a 1.2 MP front facing camera, a 5.0 MP rear facing camera, and 1 gig RAM. The video and sound quality are AMAZING, and it doesn't get bogged down. It's Jellybean 4.2, which still isn't the most current version (we're up to 4.3 now) but I LOVE it. It is as responsive the the touch as an iPad or Galaxy Tab 3, and the best part is that it's being sold on Amazon for 149.99. Seriously, if you can't spare an extra $45 right now, wait until you can and buy the MeMo.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disapointed in this tablet", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3J36Q9Q9SAZ47", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed in this tablet.

We had this tablet for a short 3 months. Plugged it in to charge one evening and it was working fine. Turn it on the next morning and the screen is white, nothing. Contacted tablet express and all they had to say was that it was not returnable because their return policy had expired. I didn't even want a return, I just wanted them to send a new tablet that worked. Before the tablet quit, it worked great...had beautiful color, plenty of space and was all around a good purchase. But, a product is only as good as the company you buy it from and TABLET EXPRESS has the worst customer service I have EVER experienced. I had to throw this tablet away, it was useless. Save your money and buy from a reputable company that will stand behind their product for more than 3 months! I also have a Motorola Droid Xyboard 10.1 tablet and it has a manufacturers warranty of 1 year...I know you read a lot of good and bad reviews, please don't buy this tablet, don't waste your money on something that doesn't last longer than 3 months! I plan to write a blog and get the word out all over the internet about how bad this company is. What ever happened to the customer is always right? 3 months people, 3 months!!!I have had my motorola tablet for a year and half. Maybe it was just a fluke that the tablet quit. That's fine. But this company will do NOTHING about it, absolutely nothing!I have purchased so many items from Amazon and I have never written a review, good or bad.

Instead I returned it and paid full price for a second dragon touch. I highly recommend it for younger users as it's so user friendly, but I've also borrowed it a few times and was able to do anything I needed without issue.**Edited notes: The charger on this item is a custom style that got wobbly and wouldn't charge. While a new charger wasn't too expensive, the new A7 model takes a standard charger that can be found at any store for a few dollars. I'd recommend buying the newer style for that reason.**", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Somebody That You Used To Know", "ReviewID": "RRO37TBBR7AVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far my tablet works like a charm.

If you don't like it return it and spend more than twice the money on the cheapest Galaxy.
