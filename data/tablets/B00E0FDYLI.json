{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price it's fantastic", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "RMZ27FDT5QQET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I've been putting off a new tablet purchase for quite awhile. I've been suffering with an Acer Iconia Tab A100 for awhile now, and while it was nice when it came out it simply doesn't cut it anymore. But I am cheap. A year ago, had someone said that I would be able to get a tablet with a quad core 1.2 GHz processor, 16GB internal storage, Cameras, GPS, and micro SD slot with a gorgeous 1280x800 IPS screen, and that it would be running Android 4.2.1 Jellybean - all for $150 - I wouldn't have believed them. I had known for awhile that at some point prices would come down enough and hardware and software would catch up, and was waiting for the right moment. It came today.Most of the reviews I've read on this tablet have essentially said that it's a solid tablet functionally, but that its construction is weak and it feels cheap. Honestly, I don't see it. While it doesn't have the same ultra-solid feel that the high-end (expensive) tablets have, it doesn't in the least feel cheap to me at all. The back panel, while plastic, doesn't feel flimsy to me. The screen looks and feels high end to me. There's alot made about the newer resolutions like the new Nexus 7's 1920x1200 display, but my eyes can't really tell the difference in most situations. I will say that if you are planning on using this outside on a sunny day, forget about it - it's almost impossible to see the screen under direct sunlight. But indoors it is great, and it has great viewing angles as well. Some reviews complained about the button placement but it doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Some reviews also made a big deal about the back panel extruding slightly past the top screen panel, but I don't feel it's uncomfortable or in the least bit bad looking. The tablet is fairly light and thin, certainly not a burden to hold in one hand for extended periods.The tab comes with Jellybean 4.2.1 and has a build update that will likely launch as soon as you power on and sign in. Engadget reports that it will get a 4.3 upgrade in the \"near future\". The OS is thankfully pretty vanilla, with only a few unobtrusive bloatware apps thrown in. Asus has a skin that IMHO is barely detectable; it's there if you want to use it but you can pretty much ignore it if you want to. This is a fairly lean implementation of Android and I for one appreciate that.Performance seems to be very good so far in my limited testing. I've seen very little lag or stutter, definitely nothing that I find annoying. The screen is very responsive and looks great. The browser (Chrome, I am a Chrome user, and it pays off to be able to sync across devices) seems to run surprisingly fast. I did try a few games on it including Order and Chaos, Shadowgun, Dungeon Hunter 4, Anomaly HD, and Modern Combat 3; all played nearly flawlessly with only the occasional slight stutter, barely noticeable. I'd say this is a perfectly capable gaming tablet, even if not the highest-end, it plays everything I've thrown at it so far. I did experience some slightly long loading times with the games but that doesn't really bother me; waiting an extra 5 seconds to play a level is not a big deal to me. ETA: I just downloaded and played N.O.V.A. 3 on the tab and was surprised at how well it did. I had read that it was nearly unplayable on the MeMo, that is not true. It DID take a very long time to load the first level (a little over 2 minutes), but once loaded it played pretty well. I could notice a little stutter here and there but it's definitely playable. If it'll play that then it'll play anything I am likely to throw at it.Battery life is quite good. With normal usage I can easily go all day long without having to plug it in, and still have some juice left over at the end of the day. I just got done playing Dungeon Hunter 4 for about 4.5 hours and saw battery life was still at 47%. That is pretty amazing. The battery also recharges very quickly, in my experience about 4-5 hours from a dead battery.The camera is adequate. It's not bad, just nothing to write home about. It works, but it's not a reason to buy this tablet. Same goes with the forward facing camera - it works, but it's nothing special. If you want a great camera you should probably be looking at camera reviews, not tablet reviews.I can confirm that the tablet does have its own standalone GPS and does not require a wireless connection to function (although Google Maps and Earth do). Turning off wifi and turning on GPS, I was unable to get a lock indoors, but at my house that has always been a problem (something in the walls or roof); as soon as I walk outside on the balcony GPS Status app tells me I've locked to 7 satellites, not bad. With an offline mapping app like Mapdroyd this will work great as a GPS unit in your vehicle.The wifi seems to run very fast. I ran a couple of Speedtest trials on it and consistently got over 22-24 mbps speeds, which for my network is very fast, far better than my other devices.I am finding the floating apps feature to be pretty useful. I can open up a calendar, calculator, video player, internet browser, and a few other \"mini-apps\" in a window with the touch of a button without exiting what I am doing. Very convenient for a quick check on something, great for multitasking.I recently bought the Hisense Sero 7 Pro for my son for gaming, and while that is a great device for the money this one feels more solid, and more smooth in operation. Also, the extra internal storage is going to be tremendously important. I trust Asus to have better support for the MeMo Pad HD 7 than Hisense, as well. I would say that if you are really into gaming but don't need a bunch of games on your tablet at once then go with the Hisense, but for everyone else the MeMo is superior. The 8GB internal storage on the Hisense really is limiting.I thought about going with the new Nexus 7, but two things broke it for me: 1) cost (obviously, paying less is better), and 2) the new Nexus 7 STILL doesn't have a microSD card slot. I have a large collection of music and offline movie files and don't like having to constantly load and unload stuff, so a microSD card slot is a requirement for me. I need that internal storage for apps, and I want an external card for everything else. Maybe the next Nexus 7...I had wanted a black tablet, but the closest they have is blue. It's a very dark blue and in most light appears black. I got a black TransCover (very nice cover, BTW - makes it look and feel like a premium tablet, worth the money IMHO) for it and it looks for all intents and purposes like a black tablet now, which makes me happy.My initial impressions are overwhelmingly positive. The more I use the tablet the more amazed I am that something at this price point can be so capable. Generally the old axiom that you get what you pay for is true, but in this case you're getting nearly everything you are going to get with a premium high-end tablet in a slightly downgraded package for ALOT less money. This one gets 5 stars from me not because it is the best tablet out there but because it is a solid tablet AND it's the best value out there in terms of capabilities versus price that you are likely to find. For the price I don't think it has any real competition.ETA: 09/04/13 - today I tried to play NOVA 3 multiplayer over Wifi. It didn't work. I think I've found the tab's limit. My son's Hisense would load fine, but my MeMo was unable to join without losing the connection... It'll play solo - though it takes a long time to load - but it won't do multiplayer. I am, of course, trying to push it to the extreme; NOVA 3 is currently a benchmark game for Android. The Hisense is definitely a better gaming tablet. But it still suffers from small storage and lack of support. It took an hour to load NOVA 3 on the Hisense and I had to remove half of my son's games just to get it on there. Again, the 8GB storage on the Hisense really is limiting.So, if you are looking for a powerful gaming tablet, this is not it. It will do everything short of powerful gaming very well, though. I have absolutely no complaints beyond the fact that it won't do networked play for the most graphically intensive Android game out right now... :)ETA: 10/03/13 - Today a firmware update was pushed out by Asus which fixes issues people were having with Netflix among other things. It always ran fine on mine but apparently some people were having problems with it. But this is one of the reasons I went with this over the Hisense or other tablets; I trust Asus to support the device. It has apparently been listening to users' issues and is responding. The fact that the tab already got a firmware update so soon after launch to address issues is a very good sign for support in the future.I am still very happy with mine.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Successive problems mean I have to reduce my rating.", "Author": "M.

Weeks went by and I heard nothing. When I called Asus they told me that had not received the tablet... even though they had provided a trackable FedEx return shipping label. So I went to the shipping dropoff point and got the confirmed delivery information and sent it back to Asus. A few days later the 3rd refurb replacement showed up. Finally they shipped one that did not have the NVRAM Warning error. The tablet still has the poor touch sensitivity that I mention in my review. My advice? Get a Nexus 7 if you want an Android Tablet or get an iPad.UPDATE: 06 Feb, 2014: I've received the second replacement under warranty. Once again when I started up the tablet for the first time, it did not go through the typical first time startup walkthrough. This means that it was a refurb and had not had a factory reset. And again as soon as I went to the Wi-Fi menu, there was a \"NVRAM Warning: Err=0x10\" in the list and this could not be deleted. Every time I try to \"forget\" the network the error immediately reappears. Once again I'll be contacting Asus for another return. I will also mention that the Asus website is terrible to navigate for support and unless you are using Windows Internet Explorer, it is basically an unworkable website. I have reduced my rating further. Asus has completely dropped the ball on this. Quality Control is poor. Communication is poor. The website is poor. 3 strikes and you're out Asus. It's sad because the MemoPad HD 7 has a lot going for it but it's like throwing dice... you might get one that works, maybe not.UPDATE: 22 JAN, 2014: A couple of weeks ago, I went to use my MemoPad and the battery was dead. I attempted to charge it as usual but this time it would not charge. I tired different cables, different charges and nothing worked. It simply would not accept a charge. I returned it to Asus under warranty. It took 3 weeks to receive the replacement (a refurb I assume) and it immediately had a problem. The problem was that when I turned it on, it had already been set up. In other words, a factory reset had not been done because I was not walked through the normal setup procedure. But more troubling was that when I went to Settings>WiFi to connect to my network, I saw an available network in the list called \"NVRAM Warning: Err=0x10\". It appeared as an available network but could not be deleted. When I tried to \"forget\" the network, it would immediately reappear. So I did a factory reset myself in the hopes that the warning would go away, It did not. I'll be having to return this again to Asus and obviously my opinion of Asus has suffered as a result of this.I have reduced my rating to 3 stars/Your mileage may vary---UPDATE: 1/2/2014 - Some bad news. My MemoPad refuses to charge now. Suddenly, I plugged the MicroUSB cable to the MemoPad for charging yesterday and nothing happened. I checked the plug and it was fine but I tried two other cables just to ensure it wasn't a flaky cable. It wasn't. Also checked it with several different AC chargers and on my laptop. NO dice. It won't charge. I then tried a hard reset by holding the power button for 1 minute, connecting USB to power and repeating the procedure. Nothing. My MemoPad is on it's way back to ASUS for warranty repair. I'll leave my rating intact for the time being. I may have to lower it depending on the outcome. I realize that some defects occur so I will give the benefit of the doubt for now.--UPDATE: 10/19/2013 - It is possible to install Flash on this. But you must use Firefox beta browser or the Boat browser. After you install either or both browsers, go to Android settings and set security to allow downloads from unknown sources. Then Google \"Adobe Flash Archives Android\" and choose the Adobe site result which should be the top result. Go to that site and scroll down the page to Android 4 versions and download the latest version. Once it downloads, install it. if you have Boat installed change browser settings to check that flash is enabled. You should now be good to go.. Change security settings back to the way they were if you want to to continue protecting yourself from downloading from unknown sources.---I've been very happy with my Nexus 7. However the Nexus 7 lacked a few important features that the Asus MemoPad HD7 has, such as a MicroSD slot for additional storage and a 5MP rear-facing camera. Asus managed to add those important features, and increase the resolution of the screen while pricing this quite a bit below the cost of the Nexus 7. Of course the newer Nexus 7 now has a rear-facing camera but still no MicroSD slot for easily adding storage.Asus did have to cut some corners but the corners that were cut may not mean much to most people. Perhaps the most significant missing feature is NFC. The case material is not quite as substantial as  the Nexus 7 case. It's a bit more slippery and somewhat more plasticy feeling. Also there is definitely something different about the display surface itself... it feels more like plastic than glass. I don't know what it is, but it's not as easy to slide your finger over the Asus MemoPad display as it is on the Nexus 7. Using a stylus largely eliminates that issue and also eliminates fingerprints on the screen.Setup of the MemoPad was easy. I fully charged mine overnight before even turning it on. When I did turn it on, it walked me through the setup process. Only took a couple minutes if that. I added my email accounts, and Google account information and I was up and running in no time.The Asus table includes what some would consider bloatware. It's not pure Android like the Nexus 7. Asus has created a skin over Android that makes certain things a look and operate a little differently, though not necessarily bad, when compared to pure Android. Play Store is installed so it's easy to install new apps.I have noticed that the screen does not seem to be quite as responsive to taps as the Nexus 7. I am frequently having to tap a button a second time to get the desired action to happen. Maybe it has more to do with the material that the top of the display is made from (plastic or glass?) but I'm not sure. I also will comment on the case a bit more and mention that the bottom half of the case is not completely flush with the top half of the case. It actually has a lip around the edges that just feels a little unnecessary to me. It's a little uncomfortable to hold and if you never held a Nexus 7, maybe you wouldn't even notice.Battery life is great... up to 10 hours. The rear-facing 5MP camera is very nice and I think it takes great pictures. The included camera app gives you some great control over brightness, camera resolution and camera effects and filters that we've all become familiar with due to the proliferation of smartphone camera apps (fill light, highlights, saturation, shadows, tint, warmth, vintage, nostalgia, LOMO, grayscale, negative, sepia, vampire, under the sea, night vision goggles). You also can easily change video resolution (1080p, 720p, 480p, CIF and QCIF) and use video effects (like vintage, nostalgia, LOMO, grayscale, negative). I really like the camera app and the control it lets you have.The quality of the built-in speakers may surprise you. It was much better than I was expecting. I have installed iHeartRadio, Pandora and listening to streaming radio/music is fantastic. I have not run into any apps yet that will not run well on the Asus MEMOpad HD.

In fact, just 2 weeks before getting this one I purchased the brand new Nexus 7 2013!  So when this arrived at my door listing specs that sounded like my brand new tablet that I spent $230 on and boasting the same screen and manufacturer, I naturally wanted to hate it!  I mean, who does it think it is, coming around here acting all cool with it's $150 price tag.  Thinking that just because it's cheaper people will love it!  I felt like it was taunting me because I spent so much more for my new tablet...Then I tried it out...If I ignore the extra apps that Asus includes with this, and if I didn't pick it up (it is slightly heavier and thicker), I would swear it was the same tablet that I just spent $230 for...........But who can ignore the extra apps?I haven't tried them all, but I loaded a video and opened the video app, expecting it to give the usual slow loading and then it goes full screen.  Boy was I in for a surprise!Not only did the video load in no time flat (and we're talking about a full length movie converted from avi format using Handbrake, so not exactly designed to run smoothly on a tablet), but it opened in a small box, which stayed right on top of my other app......Wait, did android just multitask???????????The one thing that I love about my Palm devices is multitasking, and even the Palm only shows one app at a time.  Here I can watch a movie while I surf the net, play a game, or [shudder] work on a project!  And then when I am ready, I can hit the full screen button and watch full size on the HD screen.Okay, I am taking up the entire review and then some talking about video, but you don't understand how rare this is.  NO TABLET MADE BY ANY COMPANY ANYWHERE ELSE CAN DO WHAT THIS TABLET DOES!!!  I've been saying that Android beats IOS for years, and with good reason (better hardware, better software, cheaper, more upgradable, more configurable, more apps, and all by a magnitude of dozens of times (except the hardware, that one is by a small margin)).  But here we have a tablet with true multitasking capabilities, albeit only for video over other apps.  This changes everything we know about computers!!!!!That being said, I've been asking for this feature for years, and it wasn't really a big stretch or anything.  And the S4 came close to doing this by letting you quickly switch between two running apps (which, I grant you, is multitasking).  But nothing has ever done this!!!If you are deciding between this tablet and an IOS device, hit yourself over the head, you might start to think straight again!If you are deciding between this and a random android tablet, look at the specs, you'll see what I mean.If you are deciding between this and the new 2013 Nexus 7, read my review over and over again until you see why there is no comparison!And if you are deciding whether to spend the extra money on this versus a cheaper android tablet, trust me on this one, GET THIS TABLET!!!If you are reading this and comparing with anything on the market today (or expected within the near future, I'm in IT and I keep up on these things), BUY THIS TABLET!!!Okay, I'll settle down now, I've given my speech, and I feel better for having done my small part to encourage other manufacturers to INCLUDE THIS BASIC SOUNDING FEATURE WHICH I ASKED FOR ON MY NON-SMART PHONE IN THE MID-90s, BUT WHICH NO ONE ACTUALLY LISTENED TO ME ABOUT UNTIL AUGUST OF 2013!!!Thank you for listening to me rant!", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's all about balance - 80/20 rule", "Author": "California Person", "ReviewID": "R37D8BJ1PQRGRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only users who may truly complain about the device are gamers, those who need massive computing power (power users), or those who are more concerned about impressing others with their cliquish device (Apple buyers?) instead of the utility of the device.For the rest of us, the 80%, it is what we need.  I own an Asus TF700T 10.1 tablet, so I reviewed the 7\" tablet knowing what my larger, performance oriented tablet can do.The screen resolution is very good.  Other devices around the same price have lower resolution screens.  I had been looking for a 7\" tablet for around $150.00, or less, but none had a decent screen.  The screen on this tablet is clear, the pixels are small enough that letters do not look \"blocky\", and images are smooth.  The movies I streamed from my Flixster App  looked good.  One negative:  the screen does not have automatic brightness.It is powerful enough for everyday use and I rarely noticed a \"power\" lag; however, I am not a gamer.  The only \"lag\" occurred when rotating the device.  The screen sometimes lags when changing from landscape to portrait, but even then, it wasn't consistent and jarring.  The apps all run well, including photo editing apps such as Paper Camera and Pixlr-o-Matic.Battery life seems great so far.  The processer and screen probably help extend the battery life.  Generally, as the power of the processor increases, so does the amount of power it consumes.  The processor in this device may not be the most powerful, but it is energy efficient with minimal loss of use for most users.  Screens really suck power.  As screen resolution and pixel density increases, power usage increases.  The screen is good and could be a bit better, but the tradeoff would be shorter battery life.The most noticeable difference is build materials.  The tablet is entirely plastic, which is not a bad thing per se.  Plastic is less expensive and usually lighter.  Since I keep the device in a tablet cover, whether the material is metal or plastic is irrelevant.  (Table Cover: IVSO\u00ae ASUS MeMO Pad HD 7 7-Inch Slim-BOOK PU Leather Stand Cover)One nice surprise: when I close my tablet cover, the screen automatically sleeps and it automatically awakens when I open the cover. One unfortunate surprise: due to the placement of the power button and sound rocker button (on the top right side, slightly under the device), they are somewhat difficult to use when in the tablet cover.The cameras/video are OK, not great, and will do in a pinch.  There is no flash.  There is a front and back facing camera.  I enjoy photography, so I never really understood the need for a good camera on these devices. Wi-Fi only - no 3g/4g.What really drove my decision to purchase this Asus over similar devices was the MicroSD slot.  I like the idea of swapping MicroSD cards.  I can keep movies, photos, documents, etc... on MicroSD cards and swap them in and out as needed.  There is no limit on memory.I would purchase this product again.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine Tablet--great value", "Author": "Wayfinder", "ReviewID": "R2FTUAI1UP7S36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a 7\" tablet and on a limited budget, I'd go with this. At (currently) 150 bucks, it's about twice as expensive as the cheap single-processor Zeepads (which are decent themselves, but slow), and about 50 less than the Samsung Tab 3.  I am a fan of both systems and by no means anti-Samsung... great system.  But I figure the best way to discuss the Asus is to directly compare it with a known factor-- the quality Samsung Tab 3.Comparing to the Tab 3, which would be its most direct competitor:Asus 16 gigs Samsung 8 gigs.Asus quad core Samsung duo core.Asus Android 4.2 Samsung Android 4.1.2.Asus screen 1280 x 800 Samsung 1024 x 600 (both screens are excellent, but Asus has considerably higher resolution)Asus rear cam 5 mp Samsung 3 mpBoth forward cams 1.3 mpBoth have a battery life of approximately 10 hours-- quite good all in all. Much longer on basic music playing.Asus minimal \"bloatware\". Samsung tons of bloatware.Samsung CAN be used as a remote control, whereas Asus can't.  Samsung is kind of unique in this.Asus stereo speakers-- if having two speakers side by side can be called \"stereo\".Both weigh about the same.  They're very light and easy to handle.Regarding the Asus itself.  I had an \"issue\" in screen touch.  It can range anywhere from extremely sensitive to non-responsive.  I would have to believe this is more an aspect of Android than the Asus, as I've seen this on other quality systems lately.  People with dry fingertips will have difficulty using the device and will probably need to resort to finger-covers or a stylus; this is quite common and not limited to the Asus.  A stylus is reported to end this problem.I find the camera app very powerful (it can take panoramic shots) but rather non-intuitive and complex compared to other camera ware.  On the other hand, the results are excellent, even in low-light conditions (there is no flash).Some people have complained about the \"plastic back\" and \"cheap feel\" of the unit.  I find neither particularly unpleasant and would remind potential purchasers they are not paying 350 bucks for this unit so don't expect a Porche body on a Volkswagen Bug.  I think it looks and feels just fine.  I opted for white, but it also comes in dark blue, hot pink and lime green.  (I was really tempted on the green, but settled for white in the end as it's not as distracting and looks more professional.)As far as the response, ease of use, quality, performance-- all I can say is QUAD CORE, 1 gig DDR3 ram core,16 gigs flash, plus microSD card up to 32 gigs.  Far more than most people need.I give it 4 stars because of the touch (which may be Android's fault) and only that.  I give it 5 stars on \"best buy on the market for a QUALITY tablet\".  If someone is trying to decide whether to buy an 80 dollar Zeepad or invest more and get one of these-- get one of these.

W.", "ReviewID": "RTG99F2Z50NWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Usually I wait for products to be out for a while to have plenty of user reviews before I buy.  In this case, I actually pre-ordered this tablet.  Why?  I've had the 10\" Asus MemoPad, really liked it, but it was a gift to the father-in-law.  Also, 10\" was a bit big for travel and to put in the pocket, so 7\" was more desirable.Here are my first impressions with this tablet:1. Setup - simple.  WIFI connected with no problems.  Email setup, including connecting to Exchange server from work, was easy.  Calendar, contacts, etc. all sync'd with no problems.  Date & Time? Just enter your time zone and let the system sync for you.2. System update - downloaded system update to 4.2.2 (almost 60 MB file) in less than 1 minute.  (fast internet connection with DOCSIS 3.0 modem helps!)Why update?  Improve stability -- one immediate improvement was Netflix.  At first, Netflix will load but will not play videos.  After the system update, Netflix works flawlessly.  Wireless connection to my router also seems to be more stable.  Definitely recommend that perform the system update immediately.3. Screen - sharp!  Videos look excellent.  Touchscreen is very responsive both to key presses and screen swipe.  The high resolution really shows, and the upgraded processor keeps up with the demands of the high res screen easily.4. Youtube - super fast response, beautiful video.  When holding the tablet in portrait orientation, you will see the video at the top and suggestions at the bottom.  Turn it sideways (landscape) and the video fills up the screen.  HD videos are very sharp.5. Productivity - As mentioned under setup, email setup (including work email) was simple.  Dropbox install was fast and immediately I was able to access both personal and work files in my Dropbox folder.  OneNote download/install was fast, and notes from my laptop were sync'd easily.6. Social - Skype setup was easy.  I use Skype for both work and personal communications.  Having this in a 7\" portable device is a huge plus.7. Portability - This tablet (without a cover) fits easily in the front pockets of my dress pants, though its profile is easily visible.  It fits just as easily in the pockets of your cargo pants.  This is great for going out and not having to carry too many gadgets in your hand.8. Flexibility - MicroSD slot is one of the reasons I bought this.  Traveling with kids, it's so vital to be able to load videos on MicroSD cards for long road trips.  Disappointed though that there micro USB does not double as an HDMI output (using adapter of course)...my HTC One phone can do that!9. Last but not least, for those interested in gaming...downloaded Gun Bro, (which is so graphic intensive that it causes the 1st generation iPad to crash...note that's the iOS version) and it plays with smooth graphics / scrolling.  Should work just as well for any game you throw at it.With all the pros, and considering that it's almost the same price as many ebook readers out there, this tablet can do so much more.  Forget the cheap knock-off brands.  Compared to the major brands, this tablet is fast, has MicroSD, and is much cheaper.

But this isn't the best performer. The new Nexus 7 (2013) holds that honor (I own one of those too; I got it for the superb 1080p screen; I got the Memo Pad HD 7 for the Micro SD slot).This Memo Pad HD 7 is actually zippier downloading web pages because the WiFi implementation is so good - it's not one of the newer \"dual band\" chips, but online tests and my own experience confirm that the WiFi downloads are blazingly fast (if you have a good ISP and a good router, of course! I have ComCast and an Apple hockey-puck router).There is very little \"stutter\" or \"hesitation\" in any of the operations. Often I am surprised how zippy the operations (swiping a page, opening an app) are. I'm pretty careful, though, about not bogging down the tablet with too many open apps at the same time. I hit the right hand button to open the page showing running apps, and swipe away the ones I don't want.I'm also tidy about what IM/telephone apps I have running at the same time. The Asus apps, for the most part, don't \"run in the background,\" so they aren't a problem, but if you have Talkatone or GrooveIP for free phone calls (via your free Google Voice account, which you set up using your mobile phone to confirm you have a \"real\" number), they tend to want to run in the background to receive and make calls, so choose one but not both; if you have friends overseas, you may have to add or choose from Viber, Line, WhatsApp (the three most popular) rather than installing all three and having all three compete in the background for resources (although I'll give Viber credit for claiming it has a light touch on resources). Then there is Skype, which likes to run in the background. And FaceBook Messenger, which is always active (you can also get apps from within the actual, main FaceBook app, which CAN be swiped away to unload it, but FB Messenger isn't as sparing on resources as FB itself - if you don't use Messenger, you have to manually load the FB app to check for messages).So I recommend that you take it easy loading apps at first to see what apps start to slow down the device. You are going to need FB for sure (right?). And probably the Kindle app for reading books. I uploaded my music collection to Amazon for free, so I install the Amazon MP3 player. I can't get Amazon videos, yet, since Amazon is favoring its own tablet for videos. So that means I have to use Netflix, which runs great. Kindle and Netflix can be swiped out of memory so they are no problem.Asus includes their own mail client, but honestly I feel safer with the official GMail app. If you use Yahoo or Hotmail you will need to check to see if they have their own app, or use the Asus client; I'd probably trust the Asus client over another third party client, but you will have to research this one yourself, just remember that the big companies like Google, Yahoo, and Hotmail can devote a lot of resources to security and updates, so try to stick with them.The included browser is the now probably woefully out of date stock, open source Android browser, the blue ball icon, and while some people say it's pretty fast and slick, once again I prefer the Google branded product, Chrome, in Beta (regular Chrome might be included already; to download Beta, I had to open a browser and Google it, since for some reason a search in the Play Store directly didn't turn it up; YMMV).My device announced it had downloaded and was ready to install 4.2.2 (vs. the 4.2.1 that came with it) so I authorized it to install and reboot. Surprisingly, after the reboot, the Settings page told me I was still on 4.2.1 but when I rechecked several times over the next few days to see if I could re-download the update and re-install, I just kept getting messages that I was up to date, so I assume the update got installed but a glitch kept the update number in settings from updating itself. Oh well. The service rep at Asus told me that 4.3 should be out soon anyway. And the tablet seems to run fine, unlike my Nexus 7 (2013) which had to be sent back due to frequent random rebooting (which the Asus service rep told me is now an identified hardware problem and not software related). The number of affected Nexus units seems small, and the 3 (!) older gen Nexus 7 tablets I owned were all rock solidThe screen seems slightly better than the old Nexus 7 because it is brighter, though reviewers say the old Nexus 7 was slightly more accurate (and of course it's not as nice as the New Nexus 7), which is to say it's not the best on the block but it's good and is definitely sharper than my wife's iPad Mini, though the Mini seems to have more vibrant colors (the colors on the Memo Pad are still vibrant, the Mini is just slightly better). I think they increased the brightness on this Memo Pad 7 and I have no problems with it. BUT you need to go into the Asus Power Saving settings and turn off the reduced brightness that kicks in for certain apps - until I did that, my Kindle screen dimmed to about 60% and I couldn't figure out why or override the dimming in the generic brightness setting tab in the Settings panel. Yep, the Power Saver \"secretly\" overrides your brightness setting.Speaker volume is better than my old Nexus 7, but no different from the new Nexus 7 (what a surprise - Asus makes both). However, the new Nexus 7 has dual speakers located on opposite ends of the tablet. The Memo Pad's speakers are both on the bottom edge, side by side, so the stereo effect is lost. Music quality from plug in earphones is high, I can't hear any difference from my Apples devices although Apple is renowned for audio quality, and reviewers note that some phone companies and tablets have lower grade audio converters or amps.So all in all a great tablet at a killer price. The rear camera is fine for taking pix of stuff to upload to FB etc. The front camera is 1.2 MP, which is funny because the front camera on the iPhone 4s was actually only VGA level, so this cheap tablet can theoretically take better selfies, and do better video calls, than a pretty top of the line Apple phone. (The new 5c is 1.2 MP as is the 5s, and the iPad Mini, 3, and 4 have all been 1.2 MP for selfies). Asus claims on its website that the front camera is autofocus but I believe that is an error. The rear is certainly autofocus.What I like least about the Memo Pad is Asus's insistence on making the stock Google Android experience \"better.\" I decided for the sake of unbiased reviewing (LOL) I would give the Asus implementation of \"extras\" a spin and after a while decided I definitely could not live with their pull-down notifications/settings menu, so I reverted to Android stock in the settings tab. Other stuff isn't as easy to delete or revert, but fortunately it doesn't get in the way. You may, or may not, like the extra menus and the extra home-row key. But at least the don't get in the way. There are some annoying apps that Asus pre-loaded, and unfortunately they cannot be uninstalled. They don't seem to run in the back ground and actually the Memo Pad had more free memory (11gb after initial booting) than I had expected, so apart from being annoying they don't seem to actually hurt anything and I suppose they help pay for the tablet. I just wiped them off the home screens, and ignore them in the screen with total apps listings. Probably the worst thing about them is they will delay the release of 4.3, since all the cr*p Asus adds have to be vetted to run properly on any version update, which slows down the vetting process (and may stop it altogether if an app doesn't spend the money to update, but its contractual terms with Asus forbid removing it). But we have been promised 4.3 and quite frankly from 4.1 up the OS has been pretty slick, for any game-changing upgrades we may just have to wait for a new tablet and give this one away.Unlike my last foray into budget tablets - a Hisense Sero LT from WalMart - this one is not a pokey turtle with a low rez screen. What it is, by way of closest explanation, is a much cheaper version of last year's Nexus 7, with two big bonuses thrown in: that rear camera; and the Micro SD slot. I have a lot of instructional DVD's that I ripped to electronic format, and downloaded them to a 64gb SanDisk card, along with about 39 gb of music for listening to on flights. I can see parents downloading movies for their kids on drives, where wifi isn't available. Although MOST of my stuff is on the web and MOST of the time I have wifi, I think the SD card slot is a great feature. To use a 64gb card in it, you need to reformat the card to FAT 32 from its stock exFAT file format. Then the device will recognize the card. Do not insert your card while your tablet is on or asleep; actually do a power off, insert it, and it will recognize the card and your content when you restart. If you put the card in while asleep, on my device the tablet kept un-mounting the card, until I did a reboot.I hope this helps. If you have any questions I will try to answer them. I wanted black so had to buy locally to get one.BTW pursuant to Asus on 9/20/13, Android version is currently 4.2.1 not 4.2.2, although many reviewers are reporting it as 4.2.2.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "(4.25 stars) Not perfect, but still more than worth the price", "Author": "faeriemyst", "ReviewID": "R3IYHLOWDLG7VX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far the ASUS MeMOPad HD 7\" has been a terrific tablet to use for a variety of reasons. These will be spelled out via pros and cons, partially because I'm too lazy to compose paragraphs, but mostly because I find those the easiest to find out what I'd like to know in reviews.Pros:- Easy set-up, though I did have a little trouble with wi-fi, but that might have more to do with my provider.- Great screen resolution - pretty much anything shown (images, videos, sites, whatever) is crisp and clear.- Lightweight and slim, so it won't cause much strain in wrists or arms if held for a decent amount of time.- There are a ton of features for every kind of user: casual, gaming, social, business, etc. There are even separate displays that can be modified to fit your needs.- Features five scrolling \"pages\" that can be filled with apps, and believe me, that holds a lot since the app icons are generally small. The default/home setting is right in the middle (or page three, if you'd rather).- Has both front and back cameras, which took better pictures than I thought they would.- Plenty of apps and widgets, both free and pay, in Google's app store.- On the bottom of the screen are the options: go back, go home, and switch apps (a.k.a. recent apps), so they are easily accessible at all times.- Excellent value!- Battery life has been true to ASUS' claims and lasts throughout the day (or longer) with intermittent use. At 16%, a notification shows to recharge the battery.- The tablet has a decent amount of storage space already available.- Has a slot for a micro SD card, though I'm not sure mine works right (or is working at all), it constantly keeps removing it and I can't be positive it's even using it. So that's a con as well.- The sound quality is good and it features an audio port.- Nice variety of color choices. I generally like brighter colors, but the navy blue has a nice, sedate feel to it that I like.- Can be used with a computer.- Works with Bluetooth easily.- If swiped from top to bottom, a menu-display-option thingie (obviously I'm a techie) comes down for easy access to the most used items, such as screen brightness, turning on/off wireless, Bluetooth, silent mode, auto rotate, etc., a link to settings, and will show the latest updates and notices the tablet needs or has finished.Cons:- Occasionally I've had glitches where the screen would go wonky and I'd have to turn it off, but they've been few and far between.- See micro SD problem above.- The USB cord for charging is shorter than I'd like, so makes using it while charging a pain so I don't usually do it.- On the save wavelength, I think the micro usb port has sunk in because the cord doesn't stay in very well and is easily pulled out with little movement. It wasn't that way when I first started using the tablet. It's also located on the top (if you want the ASUS print to be right-side up, as I do) which seems like a dumb choice to me and makes it more difficult to use.- Switching apps isn't the smoothest, and while fairly easy, isn't the best way I've switched apps on a tablet (my favorite is swiping left to right to get to another app, so I sometimes forget which device I'm using and end up trying it on the ASUS with no results. :P). Added to that, when I'm using a browser (usually Firefox), I constantly hit that icon to switch tabs. What can I say? I ain't the brightest. ;D- I've now got a disturbing addiction to Sims Freeplay.So overall, while I have some cons about the ASUS, they're mostly minor and I've been pretty darned happy with the tablet. This should be ideal for most people, especially those who generally use it for the basics: to check email, browse around, listen to music, play games, and stuff like that, which is the category I fall into.

The exchange experiences(the cross-ship) is FIVE (5) Stars. I push a button for replacement and Amazon ship me the replacement unit right the way. I got the new unit in two days.

This product can do multitasking, open several apps and switch between apps. The graphic quality in HD is excellent. The Google Search is excellent with voice recognition. I am playing FIFA 14 on it and it is pretty smooth and went well.I used the bluetooth to transfer files between my laptop and Memo pad. The file manager is user friendly.On the down side, the speaker quality is good not great. The file download is a bit slow. I downloaded a 2GB app and it took a while.

For a lower cost tablet this is not a huge surprise. But Given how crowded 2.4 gig is these days, for things that are very dependent on wi-fi, its a bit of a let down. And many sights incorrectly report this as having 5 mhz support. Unless I am missing something it does NOT have the antenna for that support.2) Micro-SD slot.  I Have been able to get a 64 gig card to work (sandisk sdxc 64 gig ultra).  The problem is these cards are formatted with ExFAT. You need to find a program that can format it to FAT32.  Once I did that, it worked fine.  Many programs available for windows to do the format  if you google it.  I think for 32 gig cards you can do it in windows 7 but for 64 gig cards you need another program to give you the fat32 option.The word on the street is that the memory read/write speed is poor. So I dunno about running apps from the card--but for media I think it should be ok.3) I do not see any auto brightness settings, so be prepared to mess with the brightness as needed for environment and to preserve battery.4) NO NFC and no wireless charging.  Oh well.I think for the price its an excellent value.  Although I am wondering about the utility of a 7 inch vs a 10 inch. Its all about screen size vs ease of carrying it around.  But as phones get bigger, I wonder--this is not that much bigger than my 5 inch samsung galaxy s4. But at least while traveling its another 7 to 10 hours of watching media.So far I got my 64 gig card in it, and using it to sync a lot of movies for remote/off line watching when traveling.  We'll see how it goes!I hope its upgraded to 4.3 soon since that provides TRIM support, which should prevent these tablets from getting slower and slower over time.

BTW if you did not already know, ASUS are the manufacturer behind the highly successful Google branded product namely Nexus 7.ASUS did try before to make a `budget' tablet for the masses before with ME172v but were unsuccessful, but with this new revision based on ARM A7 Quad core CPU from Mediatek (MTK8125) It is a `no brainer' after testing this Memo PAD ME173x and finding out that it is remarkably similar performing tablet to original Nexus 7 with fraction of the cost. Granted the new NEXUS 7 is still better in most other aspects but for the price I think this product from ASUS is still a very good deal.One of the many cost factors for manufacturers are the total build quality, type of CPU used, Screen quality, battery capacity etc; While ASUS did make some compromises over all build quality by employing all plastic case & in selecting Mediatek's 'MTK8125' Quad core ARM-A7 CPU versus other expensive CPUs, but this CPU can easily compete with Nvidia Tegra 3 which was used in original Nexus 7.In real life tests, the 28 nm manufacturing process of the Mediatek SoC MTK8125 pays off, the battery life is amazing for a budget tablet like this employing a slower CPU which itself compensates for most other shortfalls one might nitpick in a tablet like this. BTW, the tablet has enough CPU power for most common tasks one might want for casual gaming & running productivity apps and never really felt any slowness whatsoever even with highly conservative battery plans.The Wireless LAN & Bluetooth are adequately enough for most needs. In fact, The Wireless LAN performance is pretty darn good. It connects fast to my router at home and maintains very good link speeds. Browsing the internet with built-In browser was fast & very responsive. I am impressed by the overall performance of the Wi-Fi interface.The Micro-SD slot is a dream come true. If the missing MicroSD card slot prevented you from buying the ASUS manufactured original Google Nexus 7 earlier, now you can get that with MeMo Pad ME173x. The availability of Micro-SD card slot greatly enhances the productivity of the tablet. You can store thousands of MP3 songs & good amount of videos, Movies and make this a highly portable useful tablet to have. I have tried with 32GB MicroSD card and it works great with Amazon MP3 application. You can also use Google Play Music app if you want.All the currently available games & apps work just fine on this tablet. You can get apps from Google Play store as well as Amazon App store and it has the best of both ecosystems. You can even install Adobe Flash by side loading it and watch videos that requires flash player. YouTube video looks great & works flawlessly without any streaming issues.PROS[+] MTK8125 Quad core CPU which actually consumes less power thus providing more battery life[+] MicroSD card slot which greatly enhances the capability of the tablet[+] Wi-Fi interface is fast to connect to hotspots & maintains good link speeds[+] Less weight (only about 300 grams) makes it very comfortable in hands[+] Gorgeous 7-inch IPS screen displays with vibrant color and brightness even at odd angles[+] Main 5MP camera is decent enough for casual photography[+] Tablet runs cool even when playing games with high details frame rates[+] Includes Power Adapter and USB cable for charging unlike most other manufacturersCONS[-] The screen has tendency to attract finger prints that is hard to get off.[-] With more demanding apps 1GB RAM can be issue in certain cases[-] Main camera video can be choppy at times; the front camera is somewhat fuzzy.[-] ASUS launcher app has tendency to force close at random especially in landscape mode.Bottom-line:--------------This is by far the best performing low cost tablet on the market today. There are no serious flaws to report, the truth is that it is a less expensive Nexus 7 with less CPU power, but for most casual tablet use and gaming it did not have any problems whatsoever. The battery life is amazing & availability of MicroSD card slot makes up for most of the other shortfalls one might nitpick in a budget tablet.Highly recommended for budget conscious buyers - Very good deal!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice preforming tablet with mid-level technical features for a Value Packed Price!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3N1WSFWW8KBJH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the ASUS Memo Pad HD7 for 2-3 days and have been putting it to the test.

I am a big movie and music buff, and the fact that I can change micro SD cards and with a little help of VLC media player, I can watch any movie I want! In some reviews, many people say that the plastic back feels cheap and there is a slight lip, meaning the back overhangs a little bit. While yes, the lip is there it is by no means uncomfortable. The fact that the back is made of plastic is handy, I say this because it cuts down on weight and definitely helps with wifi connectivity. I pick up wifi better than the iPad!. To the screen, it is HD and very beautiful, I will say that with a stylus, it can be kinda tricky to open apps and what not, there have been times I have had to double tap, but using your fingers is not an issue. I love the fact that with this tablet I can write notes, have all of my textbooks and books for pleasure, I have my Bible, movies, music, facebook, weather and email updates with me everywhere I go! This little powerhouse has many apps pre-installed and can be uninstalled and new added. You cannot ignore the 10hr battery life either, I was playing and testing how the batter works, and watching movies it lasted 8 hrs and would have gone longer but I charged it at 30%. This also comes with many widgets that are very helpful, I love that I can operate my Bing search engine directly from my home page, I can watch a movie and float multiple search engines and the audio/video screen without interrupting the video.

No, this tablet is not going to solve world hunger or create world peace, but I would argue it is the best Android tablet available currently.Pros:Amazing display - it may not have the over-the-top pixel count of some tablets, but I can't see the pixels on this, so why pay for more.  Plus, the IPS technology means that viewing angles are almost limitless - the angle distorts the image before the colors fade.Great battery life - I occasionally play a simple game that on all my other devices devours the battery.  Not so on this one.  After about a week of use (charging about every other day), I am yet to run low on the battery life, even after using it heavily on Saturday while watching football!Perfect size - I like the 7\" tablets and this fits the bill!Good weight - it is really light and easy to hold.  May not be the lightest 7\" tablet on the market, but as long as I don't get tired using it, it doesn't need to be lighter.Good looks - I like the contrast of the white back on the tablet - looks classy to meIncludes a stand - OK, it is a cheap injection molded plastic stand that probably won't last.  But is was included in the box and it works, so I will use it as long as I can!Has all the sensors you need - includes all the necessary sensors and connection modes, so there isn't anything that I want to do but can't.  OK, it doesn't have cellular service, but I don't really need that anyway, so I am happy to not have to pay for the hardware.The price on this table is so low that the value proposition cannot be beaten!Neutral IssuesThe back case appears to overlap the front case slightly.  If you hold it one-handed with your hand squeezing the edges, you can feel a plastic ridge that eventually starts to feel uncomfortable.  But I have already figured out how to adjust the way I hold the tablet.The version of Android installed is not the most current, but it certainly gets the job done.  The ASUS skin is light enough to not be bothersome.  It is worth replacing the keyboard, however.Negative issuesThe worst thing I can think of is that the speaker is on the back of the tablet, so the sound projects away from the user.  However, this is true of lots of tablets.  Also, the volume on the MeMOPad HD is loud enough to overcome the issue.The power/micro-USB connection is on the top of the tablet.  If you are trying to use it while plugged in, it may be easier to hold upside down depending on where your power outlet is.So, only a couple of negatives that aren't really negatives.

Short of the \"pure\" Nexus, this is hands-down my favorite third-party version of Android.The tablet itself feels really great. For the price, it's very solid, with no creaking pieces, and a really sharp display.

Even though this looks like a basic charger, it comes in two pieces. The charger is actually made up of a micro USB cable and the part you plug into the wall.  This allows you to charge your memo pad tablet or supply power to it as you're working with it.  Because this is a micro USB port, it also allows you to transfer data from your computer to your memo pad or from your memo pad back to your computer.  You need to remember that your tablet will only charge from the computer when it is in sleep mode.  So you have to remember to turn it off, if that is the way you prefer to charge it.  I charged overnight. Holds 10 hour charge, and reading e-mails and Amazon and other routine stuff, mine got 10 hours before lag set in.EASY SET UP: It gave the prompts and took less than 10 minutes.REMEMBER ADD VIRUS PROTECTION: I choose the Avast for mobile devices and it recognized the tablet immediately. I downloaded the free Avast, and went on to choose the free avast storage back up so that I can have  my photos for backed up for free.EMAIL SYNC: I synced it to my gmail and hotmail accounts and choose auto sign in so I just click on icon and up they pop. You can also add the message, which I did for a ding when a new email comes in. I also have the app on the top page to show the amount of new emails.  27 mails: ( then pic of letter ) an under \" go to in box\".

It has built in mic also,  so if you want to do face to face video call on this tablet computer like with skype you can.

I was sucked in by the low prices, such as the one that was listed by Microcenter the Apzen A700 tablet for only $39.99, well you get what you paid for. Even though the Tablet, had a 1.2 GHz processor, 1024 x 768  Display, and a MicroSD slot and Android 4.1, it's performance was far under par for anything but checking email and some \"casual\" web browsing, playing low quality MP3's. For anything else like stream video, youtube, High Quality MP3's, you will be watching the spinning circle for hours. So I decided to invest into a real tablet, so where around $200.00. So I started here [...] I looked at all the tablets, compare prices and narrowed down the list to about 3 Tablets. So off to Fry's I went.Now at Fry's I looked and played with the 3 Models I had chosen, The Samsung Galaxy tab 3 7', The Nexus 7, Acer Iconia 7.9. After talking to the Sale Agent (another mistake), I was persuaded to go with the Galaxy Tab 3. So off I went to give my daughter her new Tablet, so that we could set it up. Well again you get what you paid for. The Galaxy is a very good looking Tablet, but as far as performance that is a totally different story. The first issue was the Wifi, could not get it connect to my home network. It went into a loop and never came back. Research on the internet and found this was a common problem. There were 2 fixes. 1. Root the Tablet and then access the system folder and delete the DHCP_xxx file or 2. Get Root Explorer and have it access the file and delete it., I choose number 2, and that work the first time, but anytime you switch WifI it does it again and you have to delete the file again, that is because it saves the last (DHCP) assigned by the Router DHCP Server and tries to reuse the last used IP address when connected back to the same SSID, if the address is not available it goes into a loop and never connects. With that said the performance suffered greatly. When streaming video (Netflix, HBO GO, MAX GO, YouTube) it was choppy, and constantly said network connection error. So the Galaxy Tab 3 went back to Fry's, so I got the second best choice, The Nexus 7. Now off to see what this one will do, but before leaving the Fry's parking lot I decided to check on the web about the Tablet I just bought, to make sure there were not any gotcha's with this model, well guess what there was, the Nexus 7 does not have a microSD slot, and my daughter has tons of mixes on different microSD cards, to include movies and the sort. Well thank GOD, I checked, it was fairly easy to return because I never opened the box and I just bought it 20 minutes ago. So now it is the last on the list the Acer Iconia 7.9, guess what Fry's is out of Stock on that model. So now what? The closet match that was in the price range was the Asus MeMo Pad HD 7, and it was on sale regularly $149.00, but on sale for $129.00, I had a credit of $317 from the Nexus (a difference of $125, I save).Okay the review...Got the tablet home, was apprehensive about this, never really look at the Asus, I thought they were motherboard manufactures for the most part. Opened the box and powered it on.The SetupThis was the easiest setup I have gone through, easy, fast and in 2 minute your on the Home Screen. The speed was amazing. Fast and no lag.The WiFiIt connected to my Wifi with no issues, preformed a speed test and my Download speed was 40MBPS and my upload was 37MBPS (I have Comcast Bussiness class 50M/50M).The GPSFound my location within minutes, I also notice that you do not have to have the WiFi on to use the GPS a plus in my book, and it include Google Maps and Navigation. 2 item The Galaxy Tab 3 did not have.The PerformanceLaunch Play store and it was so fast that it update all my apps before I could find in MYAPPS, the Netflix and the HBO Go, and the MAX Go Application. (one note MAX Go is not supported on this device), But Netflix launched within second and I was streaming the Avengers without a hiccup . HBO go loaded slowly the first time but after that it take a few second and the clarity of the screen was very impressive. Application pop, they are so fast that I often click on the next screen because I am so used to the lag that I anticipate the next step, well I need to break that habit with this tablet. Web Browsing, YouTube (and Flash can be Supported go to adobe achieve and download Adobe Flash for ICS 4.xx), there was no wait on loading. And then it happened, while watching YouTube I click on the menu bar and the video was now in a window, I could drag it to any part of the screen and the video was still playing without losing sync or even being choppy. I could now browse other item even other website while still watching the video. I am impressed.... I cannot comment on the performance with games, my daughter (okay I went back and bought another one for myself, hey 2 for the price of just 1 Nexus 7, wouldn't you?)  Really just play movies, streams video, edits pictures and chats with her friends. She did say that the Front facing camera is kind of washed out at times but with Skype it was perfect, and video chatting was flawless.OverallThis is a fantastic product, a product that I would have never thought of looking at because I thought it was and off brand, was I ever so wrong. This is a Quad Core 1.2 GHZ and it has its own on board GPU with 1 GB ram. Internal Memory is 16GB (the Galaxy Tab 3 7 was only 8GB and it was $50 more), it has a 1280 by 800 (Galaxy was 1024 by 600) the Camera were about the same spec, the Asus does not have the IR Blaster but my daughter or me for that fact are not going to use this as a remote to my entertainment system, I have the Harmony One and I am not changing that for nothing. I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with this Tablet. I keep throwing things at it and it keep chewing them up and spitting them out. I have yet to bring it to its knees.ConclusionLet's be honest everyone has an opinion. And opinion and perception can differ greatly when talking about likes and dislikes. But hear me and the others that have made almost exactly the same comments about The Asus MeMo Pad HD 7 (ME173x), it's price to performance is stellar, it's display is top line, it feature are impressive. What else can I say just go and look at it, take it for a test run in the store, bring a microSD, loaded with the hardest to play movies and put it in the tablet and play it, then tell me if all of us who rave about this Tablet are wrong....", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING VALUE - do yourself a favor and buy this tablet.", "Author": "Sally \"Sally\"", "ReviewID": "R3V9ATLL17G9A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put about six days into researching tablets and ended up buying a 64gig Blackberry Playbook.

After reviewing the specs thoroughly, and re-discovering that it had everything I wanted, and no other tablet from any other manufacturer had this combination of features at this price, I purchased one.I am not going to list the specs because you can see them in the product listing, but I will say this - I have zero buyer's remorse; after I took shipment back in September 'til now, it's been a true life love affair.I love how I can have all my emails come in through the one client, and it gives me access to everything I need to do with my social media outreach for business.The long battery life is stellar and the product is super fast.In the reviews I saw before I purchased, the only negative I saw people mention was the placement of the power and volume buttons. I admit it's a tiny bit unusual and a wee bit awkward, but I am willing to overlook that to get this fully loaded product for an incredible price.The unit has worked perfectly since the day I got it and I look forward to using it for a very long time. Because of my extensive research prior to purchase, and my daily use since buying it, I have been in a position to recommend it to anyone and everyone in the market for a tablet.Buy it - you will never regret it. 10/10 Asus - you have a new fan.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good device for an excellent price", "Author": "Vyshtia", "ReviewID": "R32QQ7IOD6RYV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owning an iPad and an iPad Mini, this device was a little hard to get used to at first.  The quality is not up to par when compared to an iPad, but the price is so much more affordable and it can do so much, that the quality really is good enough.  It really makes me wonder why the iPad costs so much when something like this can do just about everything it can do at such a more affordable price.  The size of this unit is slightly smaller than an iPad Mini.  It's very light, fits well in the hand, very good quality, does not feel or look cheap.  I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone on a budget.  It can do everything I would want a small tablet to do.  It's fast, the screen/colors are beautiful, it handles games well.

I knew I couldn't spend that amount again and to be honest, I was rather \"underwhelmed\" with the iPad. Maybe I'm just not \"techie\" enough. LOL I purchased a 10 inch Acer tablet from Woot! 2 months ago. It died within 2 weeks so I was nervous to say the last about trying again. But I had been watching this Asus HD 7 tablet for a while now, watching and reading reviews from C-net and other places and it seemed a brilliant buy for the price.Web pages are a little harder to read on a 7 inch tablet than a 10 inch but the text is clear and crisp and the display is just beautiful. I love all the pre=loaded aps and if you don't like them they are easy to remove. The battery life is awesome, even when using the camera and video recorder which I have a lot. I know a lot of people say that this camera is just \"ok\" but I really think it takes an awesome picture, even in lower lights. With no flash it doesn't do well in really low light though. In daylight, outside, pics are just beautiful. There are lots of tweaks that come with the tablet as well, to change photo settings etc. The video recorder is also great. My family is involved in Dog Obedience competition and we wanted something to record training sessions as well as at shows. This will work perfectly.Sound is great, picture on screen is great, plays you tube videos. Comes with a Kindle Books app which is great because I can download ebooks from my local library for free in Kindle format.All in all I'd give this 4.5 out of 5 stars. Why not 5? Well the case is plastic instead of the metal like my iPad and the glass is not gorilla glass and it does smudge; however it makes for a lighter tablet than the iPad. but I bought a nice PU leather cover for it tht came with a stylus (it was like 12 bucks here on Amazon) and the nice thing is when you close the cover the tablet hibernates; open the cover and it wakes up.

Wakefield", "ReviewID": "R1EEGY42JE46G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after using this tablet for a month:I continue to be very pleased with it. At the new price of $129, it is a fantastic value. As I expected, battery life has stabilized. I get better overnight results if I turn off Wifi (even though I have the power-saving mode that is supposed to turn it off when sleeping). Others have complained about button and USB port placement; for me, these are not issues. I rather like the fact that I can hold the tablet in one hand without worrying about accidentally pressing a button. As for USB port on the top, if you don't like it, just turn the unit upside down; the screen will adjust automatically.One minor concern has surfaced. Occasionally after carrying the unit in my pocket (suit jacket or slacks), I have noticed what appears to be a little moisture in the screen. It appears as a dime-sized spot that gradually diminishes and then disappears. This does not seem to affect the screen from functioning, but does make me a bit concerned. If it continues, I will check with Asus to see if there is a simple fix.Original review:I bought this tablet to replace an aging Nook Color that I had set up as a full Android 2.3 tablet. After researching the options, the choice for me came down to the new Nexus 7 32 GB ($269), the Samsung Galaxy 3 Tab 7\" 8 GB ($199), or this Asus MeMOPad HD 7 16 GB ($149). Everything I read suggested that the Nexus is the best tablet in terms of performance and screen ... and I love the Samsung Galaxy phone that I have ... but when I compared these three tablets in the store and via on-line reviews, I couldn't see that either the Nexus or the Samsung was going to be significantly better for my needs--certainly not enough to justify the extra cost.The fact that the new Nexus 7 lacks a Micro-SD port is a major consideration for me; even the 32 GB model would be a step backwards in total storage from my current Nook, and the less expensive 16 GB would be completely inadequate. In addition, the new Nexus 7 is quite a bit bulkier (longer) than the MeMOPad, which would be inconvenient for me, since I usually carry my tablet in my inside suit jacket pocket. (The MeMOPad fits very nicely.)The Samsung is a nice tablet, but after looking at a number of on-line reviews, including side-by-side reviews between the Samsung and the MeMOPad, I concluded that these two tablets are very similar in performance and screen--a conclusion borne out by my own side-by-side comparisons--so I opted to save the money and go with the Asus.After using the Asus MeMOPad for several days, I am quite pleased with my decision. Its performance is a huge step up from my old Nook, plus it has all the bells and whistles that I had wished for -- GPS, Bluetooth, and front and rear cameras. Movies play well (I use the MX Movie Player app rather than the built-in app so that I can play .AVI files), and streaming from Amazon Instant Videos is very smooth (unlike my old Nook). (Note that I added Adobe Flash, following instructions widely available on-line; I use the default browser to view flash-based videos.)Thus far, every app that I have installed has worked flawlessly. The one exception is Titanium Backup, which requires root access. I may investigate rooting the tablet down the road--I have already seen that there are various instructions on-line--but for now I don't see a compelling need. Some reviews suggested this is not the best tablet for the most demanding games, but it certainly handles the few games I play (mostly Temple Run and Angry Birds).I am still getting a sense of the battery life. I would say that so far it is acceptable, especially in terms of active use, but it has seemed to discharge a little faster than I would have expected when in sleep mode. My recollection is that it usually takes a while for a tablet to \"settle down\" as far as the battery cycle, and I have just barely begun to explore the various power-saving options that are available.To me the build quality seems very good. I have not noticed any squeaky or loose plastic. The texture of the case is pleasant to hold, and as noted above, the size is perfect for slipping into an inside pocket in a suit jacket. One important note is that the unit is essentially exactly the same size as the original Nexus 7; therefore, widely (and inexpensively) available accessories for the Nexus 7 may work well with this unit. For example, I bought a bluetooth mini-keyboard designed to function as a snap-on cover for the original Nexus 7; it works perfectly with the MeMOPad (both in terms of connecting and in terms of snapping on). One word of caution: full covers for the original Nexus 7 will lack a cut-out for the rear camera, and the micro-usb port for charging and transfer is on the top rather than on the bottom. Neither of these issues affect the mini-keyboard, since it only attaches over the screen.Bottom line is that this unit appears to me to be the best bang-for-the-buck available for a 7\" tablet.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth the risk", "Author": "kkalasa", "ReviewID": "R2GI5UGM9CVPF6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had two of these devices fail on me.

You'd think that'd mean it would skimp on features and quality, but the MeMO Pad 7 certainly does not.Setup is quick and easy; turn it on, go through the usual input of your Google account, update the software and you're up and running. The MeMO Pad runs a skinned version of Android, but it's not as bad as some of the skinned versions I've run into. However, if you're looking for pure Android, you won't find it here. On the upside, some of the Asus apps (for sound and color registration, for example) are actually useful, so that's nice.Construction is fine. It's lighter than many tablets, which some may say feels cheap, but I like the weight reduction. Fit and finish is just great, buttons push well and feel solid, and it feels good in my hand.I'm not in love with the surface of the screen though. It's a fingerprint magnet, is actually flexible, and feels like plastic, not glass. When I clean it, I flexes noticeably in the center, making contact with the panel beneath and sticking there for a moment. Other issues with the screen: it's not nearly as slippery as the surface on other tablets or any of my phones, and the touch isn't quite as responsive as some, occasionally requiring more than one touch to register.The display, though, is lovely. Great color and angle of viewing, as well as excellent brightness. On the downside, there's no way to set it to auto-brightness, which is a drag for me - I don't like having to change it depending on viewing conditions. On the other hand, my Kindle HD 8.9 has an auto-brightness feature that simply doesn't work, so there's that.Speed is excellent on most apps, though I was lagging like crazy using the NY Times app this morning - that may be an app issue, I don't know. YouTube works great though, and video in general looks quite nice. Social apps and mail work a treat, as does outlook.com.The built in web browser is excellent with one issue (I'll get to that in a minute). It's fast and works on just about every site I've hit, and it actually reflows (YAY!) text when you zoom in and out - something that WAY too few browsers do right. The problem with it is this: the FIRST time you run it, you'll notice it immediately logs you into your Google account. One assumes it is now tracking every click and cookie, and there does NOT appear to be a way to log it OUT of Google. And it's not obvious it's done that unless you notice it when you first run it. I'm not a big fan of that sort of behavior, sorry.WiFi reception has been very good but not phenomenal, in the upper middle pack of devices I've tested. However, the connections have been solid and the MeMO Pad has never dropped off of my router. WiFi is also extremely fast; large files send and receive quickly and I've never found myself tapping my foot in impatience.The built-in camera is a pleasant surprise: it takes really fine pictures and decent video. It includes a full compliment of features and the filters anyone that's ever used Instagram is familiar with. A nice plus: Asus provides a group of nice filters on the video side as well as the still camera side.A huge plus: it's expandable. Rather than trying to get you drop extra cash on a device with more built-in memory, you can use an SD card to expand memory. This is just such a standard feature I'm amazed that the market lets certain companies get away with excluding it.Here'e the thing I'm most impressed with: I have a Kindle HD 8.9, a 17\" laptop, a 15\" laptop, a desktop and a Samsung GS3 to choose from when I want to check mail, hit YouTube, bid on an Ebay item, research stuff, or shop online. And unless I'm sitting at my desk, this little 7\" tablet is the one thing I reach for more than any other; that's high praise indeed.It's fast and light, does exactly what I need, and the battery lasts a good long time. I'm not a fan of the screen surface, but the rest of the package is so good (and expandable) that it's still going to cop a 5-star rating from me. In my opinion, it's the best value in tablets on the market right now, and hits the sweet spot of power, size, battery life and weight.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE little tablet.", "Author": "K.

This tablet was too good to be true, and I'm almost certain that ASUS knew this prior to launch.  The specs blow away anything at it's pricepoint and it provided approximately three months of great ownership.I bought this tablet to replace a 5+ year old laptop that was failing.  I had never owned a Tablet before, but had previous good experiences with ASUS products.  I was so excited about the MeMOPad for the first two months of ownership that I nearly convinced a few friends to buy one (I'm glad I didn't).I own a Samsung Galaxy S2 and the wife has a Galaxy S3, so I'm familiar with the Android platform.  I was thrilled with the speed of the processor, the quality of display, the battery life, etc.  I used the tablet primarily for browsing the internet (Amazon, Gmail, etc.), but it was also fairly capably of handling games (even those that are graphically intensive).I bought this Tablet in late November.  It functioned very well for the first two months, but began occasionally failing to power on.  The first time it failed to power on, I thought the battery had just died.  I plugged it up and attempted to power it back on, but it didn't give any indication that it was charging.  I thought it was strange, so I left it plugged up for a while.  The next time I attempted to power it on, it came right back on.  I thought nothing else about and everything seemed fine again.A month passes and the issue reoccurs a few times.  The second time it happened, I started thinking about what might have killed the battery (nothing came to mind).  I plugged it up to charge and it gave me the battery charging indication.  The third time, nothing seemed to help.  I couldn't get it to indicate that it was charging and it refused to power on.  I eventually opened up the casing (I had planned on removing/replacing the battery), but the battery doesn't remove (it's attached to the board).  I closed the case back up, and strangely enough, it powered back on.At this point, I started reading the 1-star reviews and it seems to be a VERY common issue with the MeMOPAd.  I have removed the case two more times successfully to power it back on (may be a problem with the actual power button), but it's still \"asleep\" from the most recent failure.  I'm not sure what causes this tablet to fail, but it's a legit problem.  ASUS may have discovered the issue too close to the holiday shopping season to retool/resolve this problem.  They probably believed that lowering the price point would be enough to move these defective units.  I'm sure that I could send mine back to ASUS and have them ship me a \"refurb\" unit that was returned by another sucker (owner).If you need a good throw-away Tablet that functions for about three months, this maybe exactly what you're looking for.  If you want your electronics to last more than a season, spend your money on something better.  As for me, this will be the last ASUS product that I purchase.

I'm not an Android fan at all (I went through four Android phones before finally getting an iPhone), and I'm still not an Android fan, but this tablet is worth the price and let me tell you why.It's great for reading magazines. And that's what I wanted to do on it.  Also, if you want to watch any videos, they are crisp and clear. Gorgeous visuals.So, I got what I paid for and I'm satisfied.Now here's what you need to know about Android: the battery life is terrible. Do yourself a favour and charge the device every day, or else one day you will try to turn it on and it will have gone black, meaning you have to recharge it for many hours before it clicks into gear and you can use it.Don't expect great email service. Even though the tablet connects beautifully to wi-fi, my email accounts were not syncing, so I ended up deleting them from the tablet. So there's a glitch you may want to consider.However, while I wait for the opportune time to buy a full-size iPad, this little tablet is just fine for the purposes for which I bought it, and the price simply cannot be beat, so thank you Asus for putting tablets within reach of all who want one.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best tablet for the price", "Author": "S.

I find it just superb, and far better than the screen that I am using to write this review. The excellent screen is what pushed me to give 5 stars rather than 4.As to other hardware on the unit, the GPS works better than a TomTom unit I had.The MeMOPAD HD 7 also seems to have plenty enough processor and memory; I haven't noticed any screen/app lag at all.With respect to storage, 16 gigabytes is a generous amount of storage space and having the ability to add more via microsd is a real win for this device.I have tried Miracast on the unit, and it seems to work fine for mirroring essentially static screens. I have not tried to stream video via Miracast yet.The speakers seem to be adequate, which is enough for me given the device has such a small footprint.As to Bluetooth, using a Perixx PERIBOARD-805L keyboard via Bluetooth seems to work well enough.The WiFi seems to work fine.As to software, well, it seems to be more of a mixed bag. I have seen a few crashes from the user interface; also, some of the system software doesn't seem to notice touch as well as I would like (I think the issue is the software in question since with other software the touch seems to work perfectly.)Software I am willing to give at least a temporary pass since both system software and apps can be updated and I am willing to give Asus time to get new releases out.Overall, I am very happy with the device.

After reading many reviews of how tablets with non-HD screens might be unsatisfactory, I waited for the Nexus 7 HD to come out. Just before it was released, this ASUS was announced, and that it would cost $80 less. Studying its features I found it would do everything I needed, whereas the Nexus would do more, but features I don't need. The $149 price for this was therefore much more palatable than $229 for the Nexus. (Despite that, I almost sprung for the iPad Mini, but it is too large and is in need of an update.) My only complaint is the lack of a comprehensive manual. It comes with a very small, several page printed one, but it's just to get you started turning it on. I had to do a search for a \"real\" one, and found one on the ASUS site. Though it is 106 pages, it is still not comprehensive in the way the one for my iPhone 5 is.

Reedy", "ReviewID": "RGNE8KWFIF513", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this tablet for about two weeks now, and I'm still torn about what I think about it. I love the fact that it cost me $150. That was great. It is also FAR superior to my 1st generation Kindle Fire that I have now passed down to my 3 year-old. All in all I'm happy that after less than two years I've gotten many more features and better performance out of a tablet that cost me 25% less than my previous one did. However . . .I don't feel like this has the build quality it should. I haven't had a lot of experience with Android devices outside of my Kindle, so I can't quite say that it's a lot buggier than other devices out there, but it is certainly buggier than I expected. Here are a few examples:1) One reason I bought this over the new Nexus 7 was because of the SD card slot. I put a 32GB card in, because I plan on using the camera a lot for both photos and videos. The problem I am having is that every time the device goes to sleep it has to re-detect the card in the slot and it doesn't always do it. At least 5% of the time it doesn't notice the card is there, so when you go to take photos the device yells at you because it doesn't have anywhere to store the photos. The only way to fix it is to pop the card out and reinsert it. The last time I tried that the card \"popped\" 2-3 feet into the air. Needless to say the photo op was gone.2) Probably four times in the past couple of weeks the device has refused to wake from sleep. At first I was worried that something had shorted and I was going to have to send the device back. The device seemed completely dead. Then I tried simply holding the power button and it did, eventually, reboot.3) The last straw before writing this review came because I have started using bluetooth headphones with the device. They've been working fine, until just now. I tried reconnecting headphones and it didn't work. So I turned off the bluetooth connection and tried to turn it back on. Nothing I could do would let me turn the bluetooth setting back on. It was as if it wasn't detecting the blutooth module on the device. Eventually I restarted the device and it is working fine again.4) Finally, and I don't know if this is a Google issue or an ASUS issue, but there are a number of apps in the Play store that state that they are incompatible with the device, though I can't think of any reason why that should be. A few examples include the new Microsoft Office 365 for Android app, the Starbucks app, and the mobile banking app for Citibank. They all say that they should work on Android 4.0 and later. I would say it has only been about 5% of them, but enough to be annoying.(UPDATE: I'll agree that #4 is probably a developer issue, not an ASUS issue. I don't know if this is the problem, but all of the apps I've found that are listed as incompatible have permissions settings that require access to dial the device's phone. I wonder if the Play Store assumes that a phone is necessary for the app to function.)In addition to these issues I have to agree that the build quality isn't spectacular. What I seem to notice most is that the quality of the glass doesn't seem to match the quality of the Gorilla Glass that Amazon used on their Kindles. It doesn't seem as stiff and it seems to attract and hold oil worse than the Kindle did.I feel somewhat guilty giving the device a 3 star review, but I can't quite bring myself to give it 4 stars. I'll hold onto it rather than return it because I am a fault tolerant person. If you are as well, then this might be a good deal for you. The price is certainly excellent. But if you are not fault tolerant, and especially if you don't think you will need extra storage, I'd probably recommend trying to find something more stable.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "CUSTOM ROM AVAILABLE!!!!

Memopad HD hands down.", "Author": "rob", "ReviewID": "R249H6KYFVDLK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review title may seem kind of silly, given that Asus actually makes both the new Nexus 7 and the Memopad HD, competing with each other in the same market segment. There's also no disputing that the Nexus 7 is better equipped in terms of hardware.The \"dealbreaker\" for me is not in terms of price, although it's pretty hard for the average Joe to ignore that 35% premium for the 16GB N7 over the 16GB Memopad HD. No, it's this simple: the Memopad has a microSD slot. The Nexus 7, by design (and Google's insistence), does not.Listen, Google, if I wanted to pay more for willfully-less usability, I'd be an Apple person. Go on all you want about The Cloud. You know as well as I do that transferring several gigs of data to a mobile device is a couple minutes of my time using cheap external flash memory vs. a few hours minimum via the ballyhooed cloud. And there's stuff I don't necessarily *want* going through someone else's servers. The \"OTG option\" doesn't matter when you don't include the relevant cables in the box, and I don't want a USB dongle getting in my way on a portable device. So: no microSD slot, no purchase. It's that simple. I won't be buying any Nexus-line product until Google stops pretending this isn't a necessary feature and/or trying to trump up their margins Apple-style by selling two or three different models of non-expandable hardware.In other areas: is the N7's higher-res screen better than the Memopad's? Yeah, sure, it's very nice. The Memopad HD's 1280 7\" screen still looks fantastic. Yes, you can tell a slight difference comparing side by side. But bring the Memopad home and you won't care any more.The N7 is a faster piece of hardware on paper, too. But the Memopad HD is very snappy and responsive, probably the fastest-feeling Android device I've personally had to date. I thought my Galaxy S3 was pretty impressive, but the Memopad bests it at least in terms of \"immediate response\" feel.The size / feel of the Memopad HD in your hands is absolutely perfect, and the 7\" screen is surprisingly usable even with the large-format PDF books and articles I read a lot on my tablet. I was worried I'd have to keep my 10\" TF101 for reading those; no more. (This all said, I don't mind or have a problem making out somewhat-small-but-sharp type.) Battery life on the Memopad is really great so far, and I have seen some pro press that suggests its battery may actually best the new N7's.Headphone jack and USB / charge port are on the same side, and Asus has wisely placed the power and volume rocker keys right together on the adjacent facet. This is the way it should be for usability's sake, and you'd be surprised how very, very many tablets (including Asus' past designs) get this wrong.I do not personally feel the device \"feels cheap\" at all, but the first unit I got *did* have a sort of disturbing creakiness to it in handling, the kind that I normally associate with laptops *after* I've beaten them to death in a couple years of use (just before you start seeing stress fractures). I brought it back, and the second unit I got did not exhibit this problem out of box. I would recommend slapping a case on this soon as you can, but I'd recommend that for pretty much *any* tablet. At least, unlike the iPad, you don't need to worry about the backside aluminum scratching in the first few hours of responsible ownership.The one main complaint I have about the Asus, and I don't know yet if it's even a real complaint, is that the manual makes a big deal of not leaving it perma-connected to the charger and only using their charger. The charging circuit *should* be smart enough to let me leave the thing plugged in for a week at a time without any trouble if I want. Again, this may just be some kind of weirdly-motivated instructional hyperbole on Asus' part and/or may be something you can safely ignore. I don't know yet, but personally I'll wait for other Memopad users to \"do what comes (more) naturally\" to find out.The Memopad HD is pretty much *the* 7\" tablet sweet spot for value and performance as of this writing. It is definitely the snappy, stable, eminently usable, well-sub-$200 7\" Android tablet I've been waiting for literally for years (and frankly expected much earlier).One last note: I was surprised to find that, unlike my last few Android devices, Flash wasn't working out of box. It turns out this is an Adobe-giving-up-on-mobile issue, not an Asus-build issue. Not the best news in the world, since so many of the sites I routinely visit are *still* addicted to Flash.

That said I can get about 3-4 days of use before it needs charged.  That's not my gripe.My gripe is that if you aren't careful and it goes beyond a certain charge (Always when not in use it seems) than you've reached some point of no return where it will not take a charge.  After searching the web on how others deal with this very common problem I found the best action was to crack the plastic case off the back..which you can do with your fingernails...and unplug the battery connector for about 5 seconds.  Then plug it back in, snap the case back on and it will then accept a charge.I have a hard time believing Asus did not know about this problem.

She was previously using my Nexus 7 1st gen. Needless to say the tablets are so similar in size and construction, it was a flawless transition.The build quality of the Asus isn't up to par with the nexus 7 2012, simply because of the plastic backing that gets scratched very easily. With that said, comparing the screen quality of this tablet to that of the nexus is like night and day. Surprisingly the Asus just appears a lot more vibrant and sharper. Maybe its just my nexus, but I think the responsiveness is much better as well.This tablet isn't the fastest thing out there, as you would probably expect. But with one gig of memory and a 1.2ghz dual core processor it isn't too bad. It scores somewhere in the region of 13k on antutu, so youre looking at a galaxy S3 level of performance. Some apps to happen to slow it to a complete crawl sometimes however.Since the tablet is built on the mediatek architecture you're not going to get a lot of custom ROM support for it. I did however manage to find one that gives you some kit Kat goodies and some much needed stability improvements.We did experience the problem a lot of reviewers complained about: the tablet drains the battery and then will not turn back on. While I don't think you should have to go through this kind of thing with any product, this kind of thing happens, I guess. I contacted asus and opened up an RMA because it happened only 40 days after purchase, so amazon wouldn't let me send it back. But then I decided I'd try to fix it on my own.I popped the back cover off, removed the battery connector from the main board and shorted the terminals, kind of like a \"clear CMOS\" procedure on computers. Needless to say, I plugged it back in and connected the charger, and everything was good to go again! The problem hasn't happened since, and we've had it for about 3 months now.Overall if you're on a tight budget I would recommend this tablet without hesitation. The price is awesome, the screen is really good, the front and rear cameras are surprisingly better than my iPad mini retina's own, and its great value for the money. If you can manage to throw on about $80 more however, I would recommend the nexus 2013.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "This tablet does support 64GB microSD cards with the latest Android 4.2.2 update.", "Author": "Drad", "ReviewID": "R30VVD3R2MUXNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those of you who need or want a lot of extra storage, hopefully that helps. I've had this tablet for a few days and so far it's the best price/performance value on the market. I use it primarily as a media player and occasional web browser. I also have a first generation 32GB Nexus 7, but I really wanted the expandable storage. The Nexus is a bit faster and the build quality is better, but the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 is a full hundred dollars less than what I paid for the Nexus a year ago; I can accept a few compromises in this case. The Memo does everything I need and the slightly weaker CPU isn't an issue for my purposes. The screen resolution is the same 1280 x 800 as the 2012 Nexus 7, which seems to be better than most tablets in this price range. The screen's very responsive. Apps and pages load quickly with only the occasional and very minimal lag. 1080/720p HD video plays just fine with MX Player. Streaming depends on your connection. Heavy 3D gamers may want to look elsewhere. I don't game much, but I suspect most Android games will run fine on this. Sound quality is excellent (for a tablet) due to stereo speakers instead of mono. I can't comment on the camera, since I don't use it. Clean Master (Google Play, free) will keep the tablet running quickly and smoothly if it starts to slow down. There are some comments that the device feels cheap. I suppose that's true if you're coming from a tablet in a higher price range. In my opinion, the build quality is good for a tablet at this price.Overall, I feel that the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 is an excellent value for the money. It's exceeded my expectations at a very reasonable price.

So far this MeMO has worked great.  We've done some video chat via Google Hangout.  Camera quality seems good.  Play store is great.  Plenty of content.  Touch screen seems fairly responsive.  I do notice on some light gaming apps (Temple Run) there is some screen lag/ jitter.  I use the 'Task Manager' widget to stop/kill background apps and I installed and use Clean Master.

Adobe Flash - 'NOT SUPPORTED ON THIS DEVICE' as quoted on Adobe web page when trying to download Flash.

Got mine on Amazon for $129 + Free shipping!!!", "Author": "hesty24", "ReviewID": "R2SCYC6NCFBBP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these for my children, but would not mind one bit owning one to use.  In fact, if I was allowed to use it for a week, and then the Nexus 7 2013, I would probably end up buying the MeMOPad.These are neat little tablets.  I already own and operate a Nexus 7 FHD (2013) 2nd generation, so this is what I am comparing it to.  I will say that this tablet holds its own next to the N7 2013, but is probably a bit better than the N7 1st generation.  This is because of the 5MP rear camera, and the fact that you can up the storage with a MicroSD card 32GB + 16GB on board memory.I do like the camera options on the MeMOPad a whole lot more than the N7 2013.  There are far more options with the MeMOPad than the N7 for all you picture takers out there.  The display is adequate and rivals that of most other non-N7 2013 tablets.  The speaker is loud and has no distortion at max volume, although one speaker at the bottom rear of the device, it is more than adequate.  I am using a Bobj Rugged case for the tablet.  I highly recommend that case (although it is way over priced at $21) for all those who are less than careful with your geek stuff.  Read my review on the Bobj case for more info.  Aside from the hardware differences on the tablet, the software differences are way different than the N7.  The N7 rocks a clean Android system that is upgradeable to 4.4 at this moment (not the best in the world with a lot of incompatible app issues right now, but functional).  The MeMOPad is upgradeable to Android version 4.2.2, and sports a vast plethora of ASUS apps (but they are all very nice).  I just wish that the N7 had them.  The lay out between the two take a little bit getting use to if you primarily use one device.  The screens and app opening and closing are very snappy.  The load time differences for some simple gaming apps is about 7-8 seconds longer (Hungry Shark Evolution).  Not that big of a deal to me.They MeMOPad does have a nice inclusive battery optimizing app, that is very simple to operate that states that it helps prolong the battery life.  I have charged the MeMOPad about 3 days ago, and left the WiFi on, installed some apps, rearranged the desktop screens, screen brightness remains at about 70%, and had my kids play some of their education games it for about 1.5 hours, and the tablet still has 81% of the battery left!  Additionally, I am not sure what the button is called, but there is a 4th button next to the \"go back button\", \"home button\", and the \"Recently used apps\" buttion.  It is very nice, and appears to have nice little handy apps associated with it i.e. calculator, audio wizard, video player, unit converter, countdown timer, stop watch, compass, web browser, calender, and email.  It appears to be modifiable, and just adds one more spot for quick app access (wish the N7 had it).  A missing option on the MeMOPad is that ASUS and/or Android didn't include a auto adjust screen brightness option.  I usually use this option on my N7 for battery conservation, but so far, I have not seen that the MeMO needs it.Pros:  Made by ASUS, Memory card expandable, very inexpensive, great speaker, rear and front facing camera with excellent software, Android OS, awesome little included ASUS apps, Extra shortcut button at the bottom of the screen.  Mini USB charging port on the top and off centered (very out of the way of your hands when holding tablet landscape and charging).  Magnetic activated on/off switch on all supporting covers/cases (I hear you have to turn this feature on in setttings.)Cons:  1GB of RAM, Screen resolution 1280x1080, no screen brightness auto adjustmentBottom line:  If you are in the market for a 7\" tablet, or something of that size and are on a limited budget, I would definitely recommend this one!  It is a budget tablet, but there is nothing cheap about it.  Don't waste your money on those cheap tablets that no one has ever heard of (Prestige, Dragon Touch, Chromo, Prontotec).  Those tablets are cheap for a reason. . . . they are CHEAP!!!  You will definitely regret it if you buy one of those as I have heard many people state.

It is my first tablet and I bought it to learn first hand the pros and cons of Android tablets vs  laptops.  I use it for monitoring and  responding to email, storing photos to show friends and family, querying the  internet, reading periodicals, novels and technical books, and news related videos.  The ASUS tablet does amazingly well given its size and processing power for email, internet queries, novels, and periodicals. The screen is bright, colors very good, and even the smallest fonts are readable.  The tablet comes with a number of very useful apps for email, internet queries, books and novels, maps, and GPS.  Although the email apps are focused on Google mail I found it easy to add my Hotmail account and have been able to use the core functions of Hotmail.  The Google search voice interface works extremely well.  I receive e versions of Newsweek, US News and Report, PC World,etc by email.  Most of the time I am able to read articles and watch news videos. However, there are times when the screen is so clobbered with advertisements it is difficult to see the text when the ads overlap the borders .  I have not yet purchased any apps specifically designed for displaying media on an Android tablet, but the included apps are generally doing a very good job.  I have experienced a number of problems with the screen freezing and having to back out of a query or e-periodical.  However, so far the system has not crashed and Chrome on the ASUS seems to stumble less than Explorer  on my desktop.  I am convinced that almost all of the these problems are the result of the advertisements overloading the processors, use of conflicting protocols, and in the case of Explorer on my desktop computer, conflicts resulting from my high security settings.  I always use  cases to protect both my ASUS tablet and Kindle ereader, was surprised to find out that when cased they are essentially the same size, and plans are to take both when on travel.  The apps included with the ASUS can work in conjunction with the GPS, and unlike my Garmin  can provide  true alternate routes.  This feature can only be used for planning because it requires Wi-Fi connectivity.  When not totally discharged, the ASUS recharges in several hours and battery life seems to be around 8 to 10 hours, depending on use.

This twist is so slight it's hard to notice UNLESS you have an SD card because it becomes unmounted and remounts over and over while handling the device. Sometimes it unmounts  just by holding the wrong way, yes it twist just the slightest. Also why have a device that supports OTG but not enable it (had to root to use)?

It's also pretty quick, thanks in part to good mid range hardware as well as a light UI.  I don't really play games but the following played well: Plants vs. Zombies, Gun Bros 2 and Dungeon Hunter 4.  Fit and finish isn't bad, the back plate feels a bit flimsy, but once in a case it's a moot point.  Music sounds good, videos look good, the internal speakers are good enough.

But with so many different electronics out there these days, it can be a difficult decision. Tablets have came a long way since the Palm Pilots and the Iphone 6 years ago. But everyone has been on the Apple Ipad bandwagon since it came out 3 years ago. But with all of that, many might want to feel they are not wasting their money on one company, or just one product either. But with tablets it is very hard to find, not just in speed, but in battery life as well. ASUS has just gone into the tablet game awhile ago, and they have definitely a lot to prove with every other computer company as well. Well, there have been so many tablets on the market, but they have fell shy, not just in price, but productivity. Well, ASUS has tried their latest to the test, and it fairly does the job well.The ASUS MeMoPad HD 7 is definitely one of those tablets worth checking out not just in battery life, but also in playback and speed to get online as well. It has good wi-fi connections to get online, without the hassle of getting into a 3G network, good media playback and noble speed. What I do like about it is that it is very simple and easy to understand after a little time, and not longer unlike other tablets. I also like the fact that on this one you have a storage space for your external memory with a micro SD card expansion slot. This I like, because you can get more with a fraction of what you would pay for the Ipad. You can store as much as a 32 GB Micro SD Card, and it works nicely. What I did have a bit of a tough time with it though was trying to get online, but after awhile I found it quite easy. It also has good bluetooth connections as well, so you can use a wireless device flawlessly with it, from headphones to a computer keyboard. What I do wish for is that it would have better voice recognition, it has just as much of a lackluster connection as is with Apple's Suri voice recognition.  But at the end of the day, it works out mostly well for its money.All in all, if you really are looking for a tablet for yourself, I definitely suggest you give the ASUS MeMoPad a try. It definitely is a nice alternative to tablets that are more popular from the Barnes & Noble's Nook to the Apple Ipad and Ipad Mini. You really get nearly everything you want in a tablet or a smartphone, without the hassle in price. This is definitely a tablet I like from the speed and the connectivity, to a better value for your games, and communicating with others on the go. This is a nice device, and I suggest you give this one a shot.Price: BSetup: B+Convience: A-Battery Life: BOverall: B 1/2+", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet!", "Author": "rnd402", "ReviewID": "R1RX36XB3XDJ72", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tablet for a week now and it is working super.

Had to ship it to TX to the Asus service center where they replaced the battery. It took almost 2 weeks for the repair and then they shipped it back to me via FedEx with signature required.  As I work full time during business hours I was unable to be home to sign for the package.  FedEx told me to ask Asus to change that requirement and Asus refused to help. I was lucky enough to have an ex-husband close to the FedEx station an hour away, and he was able to get the tablet, but it delayed getting the tablet back for my son for another week. It was torture for my 8-year old to be without his favorite toy for almost a month.  Then the second tablet quit working in April! Same problem. I paid another $15 to ship it to Asus. This time the screen got cracked in shipping (?? I had it wrapped good in bubble wrap and newspaper!) and they sent me an email a week later saying I needed to pay $161 for a new LCD screen. I replied saying I wasn't going to be able to pay that when it was more than the tablet was worth, and I waited to hear back. No reply for week. So I emailed again, did 3 live online \"chats\" with Asus and was just told to email again to ask if the tablet could be fixed without fixing the screen each time. Finally on May 23 (a full month from when they received the tablet) I heard back via email from Asus saying they would not fix the tablet without fixing the screen first. I replied saying to please ship it back to me to my workplace so I could sign for it there.  I received a generic email on 5/27 saying they would reply within 48 hours and have not heard anything since then.  My next move is to spend part of my 1 hour of time after my sons go to bed calling Asus to see if they will send back my son's tablet. I will have to find someone else to fix the screen before I have to ship it back to Asus if I want it to work again.  I have already had to purchase a new tablet (a Kindle Fire) so that my boys would each have a tablet to play with.  This has been the worst experience I've ever had with a product.

I contacted customer service, and they couldn't proceed with the RMA because their return system is dead, meaning that I will have to bug them and waste my time again later.

I do not even know what has been done with my tablet since there is no feedback documentation included with the return package.

They are nice, friendly, supportive and interested in the issues but they then dispense useless advice. After an hour+ wasted on the phone several times, they could not resolve any of the issues.

White for one, Pink for the other.Had originally purchased the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 but didn't realize they only had 8GB ROM, lesser screen quality, and older processor.The Asus is perfect, long battery life, nice screen, and runs great. It is a little laggy scrolling in the App drawer, but it is a huge upgrade over the Lenovo A2100 from just Dec 2012.There was an immediate updated to JellyBean 4.2.2 not sure of the enhancements as ASUS has its own skin. There are some Apps that come preloaded from ASUS, have tested them so cannot comment.It does have a Parental lock that can be setup and then monitored via web browser to set and change device time allowances. But it has to be activated each time the tablet is turned on, so not very efficient.Since they are for my girls , I haven't played with them too much outside of initial setup. As an e-reader/video streaming device it is great. Kids games it works great too.The only device I would have gotten over this would have been the LG GPad 8.3 or Kindle Fire HD(X).

Compared to how much I paid for my Archos 7 three years ago... well, let's not compare because there is no point.Anyway, here is the short list of Pros and ConsPro:a) the tablet has not crashed even once. I use it every day to read books, watch videos, write emails, browse the web, run some simple utilities, install games and such, but nothing extra-fancyb) with the Wi-Fi constantly on, the battery life is quite impressive. I recharge it once a week (depends on how much I use it, but I am saying on average).c) speed is very good. Much much faster than my old Archos but that goes without saying. Faster than Galaxy Tab 2, that's for sure.d) I found very nice and inexpensive case and accessories for it (tablet kit by Birugear with screen protectors, case, travel chargers etc)e) display is good (not Retina-great quality but very good for my purposes). Unlike some other older displays, the viewing angle is pretty widef) had no problem working with microSD cards, no problems with connecting to my PC to transfer dataCons:a) as I said the screen is OK, not great. Decent... not sure if that can be listed as a con but wthb) some areas of the screen (corners) seem to be slightly less sensitive to the touch than others... not by much but still.c) power and volume buttons are located a bit awkwardly, it  takes a while to start properly pushing them. The other side of the coin (positive side) is that you will never push them by accident (at least not when it is in the Birugear case)OVERALL: for 110 bucks it is an amazing bargain.

While a decent tablet at the time, it had the all the desired features but lacked that \"brilliant screen\"This tablet has it ALL except a mini HDMI. It is basically a Nexus (Asus makes Nexus) BUT with a Micro SD slot (a very desirable feature) at great price. Its screen is \"brilliant\" enough for the average user. The OS is close to Vanilla Android. What Asus does change is good.Besides the hardware,  Asus includes some App's that are REALLY USEFUL and User Friendly, even compared to some comparable apps one can get on the store. Two notable apps are  their \"To-Do\" list (VERY WELL thought out and easy to use) and  SuperNote Lite. SuperNote is an app where one can make separate notebooks and take notes via writing with ones finger (or stylus), typing or voice via the voice key on the keyboard. One can also \"draw\" in multiple colors and SEND notebook pages via email or other options to others.It also comes with a decent app for organizing and reading your epub (and other format) books once you learn how easy it is to get free books from sites like FeedBooks etc.  I like book readers that have that \"real page turning\" feature and this does.I almost forgot, it has a great \"File Manager\" as well !They have some mini \"floating apps\" which help one multi-task. I especially like the floating mail and video play apps (which can be expanded if and when desired). Very Cool..Includes keyboard that can be set up with \"Swipe\" functionality  (another desirable feature) and it has good battery life.You REALLY get a \"bang for your buck\" at this point in time with this model, the features and included apps.If you are in the market for a 7\" Android, stop looking, shop for the best price, buy and start using using your time enjoying and being productive.. !", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice overall product", "Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "RCC4NXBF59C87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does not support Adobe flash.

I can access my music directly from the card using the \"Play Music\" app and the sound is pretty good, especially in \"movie mode\".The screen is bright and crisp and while I sometimes have to tap it more than once, it is generally responsive. Many online reviewers have complained about the quality and feel of the Memo Pad, but it's really not that bad. I would not even have notice the slight overlap of the back cover if it had not specifically been pointed out to me.Another common complaint is that the power button and volume rocker is in an awkward spot towards the back of the tablet. Actually, when holding the device in your left hand in the portrait position, the volume rocker is positioned perfectly to be reached with the fingers of your left hand, thus leaving your right hand free.

It washes out a little easier at different angles and has an appreciable gap on the side. So it is a lower quality display but for the price it is not that bad. On the inside we have a ASUS quad core A7 1gb of ram. The performance seems snappy with Android 4.1. There are quick launch apps on the home screen with different options to launch Google now or Gmail.  So for the price 129-149 is hard to complain, it performs above that price class.

At first was a bit hesitant because I'd never used Android OS before, but with $150-$200+ difference between this and a IPad 3/4, decided to give this a try, especially after reading overwhelming positive reviews both here and on tech sites.Got it last week, my impressions so far is, for the price it's a excellent tablet.  It doesn't have some of the high end functions that more expensive tablets have, like mini HDMI or camera flash, but small grips on the whole.  And the housing seems to be a bit less durable than other tablets (IPad), but easily fixed with a nice protective case/cover.  Also the Google Play store isn't as robust in offerings as the Apple AppStore at the moment, but quickly catching up.It's got a nice, easy to use operating system (especially after it updated OS version), tablet screen itself is nice (not quite as sharp as with the Retina IPads or higher end tablets, but still quite nice) and responsive (i'm sure in no small reason of the x4 cores), screen itself seems to be quite responsive to finger tapping and dragging. Memory and slowdowns don't seem to be a problem, and even though it only has 16 gigs of storage memory onboard, it's easily enough fixed with a 32 gig micro sd card ($20-25 here on Amazon) and have read that you can use even higher sized micro SD cards, once formatted properly.So far it's done quite well, main uses are for Facebook, light web usage, picture album and some games here and there.  Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a cheaper/starter tablet without sacrificing performance and build.

Fonts are 'sharp' and colors are very vibrant. Screen angle is good. HD videos will look very nice on it. Asus included an app called \"Splendid\" which allows you to control the hue, saturation and temperature of the display, a very nice touch.Build:The device is light and easy to hold with one hand for a prolonged period, good for reading on bed. It's probably not a durable tablet and the screen is not made of Gorilla glass so buying a case and screen protector to avoid scratches is a must.Usage:This tablet is ideal for web browsing, ebook, video chat, and especially watching videos and streaming. The processor should be adequate for all these tasks with few stutters. However, it's highly recommended to speed up the device by installing a third party launcher and disabling built-in apps you don't need. It's GPS actually gets good signal and can get a location fix in a short time so it could be ideal for offline maps. With support of microSD card you can load in a lot of media. It will struggle for realistic 3D games. It was very choppy with Asphalt 7, but general popular games like Temple Run, etc is no problem.I can't confirm the battery life, but the general consensus seems that the MediaTek processor in this tablet is energy efficient which warrant Asus's claim of 10hours battery life. This may coincide with the device staying cool. It does get warm on the top half of the tablet for intensive tasks, but not too uncomfortable.Comparing to the Nexus 7: Comparing to the original (2012) Nexus 7, this MemoPad have a better screen, slightly better speaker I think, rear camera, microSD slot, longer battery life, but somewhat lower performance. However, if you can spend more money, the newer generation Nexus 7 is going to be a much better choice since its at least twice faster and have a rear camera as well. However, Nexus devices never gets microSD slot which can be a minus, this is the primary reason why the person I bought this tablet for wanted it instead of the Nexus 7.A nice bonus, they included a cheap tablet stand in the box.Update: It seems the 4.2.1 firmware of this device it experienced incompatibility issues with a few games, but only a tiny few so I wouldn't be worried. The games that crashed when I tried to run are Fruit Ninja, Let's Golf 3 and Flow. Most other popular games work without problems.

I can drop a 16GB or 32GB card in there and turn it into a movie machine or a downloading node, then easily transfer the data to my computer without messing about with the terrible MTP mode. CPU power, RAM & general performance are all adequate for the types of apps that you'll be running on a 7-inch tablet. I've been playing full 3D games like Carmageddon and GTA: Vice City at 1280x720 with absolutely no performance problems. The display is fantastic with no color distortion at odd angles.Minor nits: Lack of any vibration was a surprise; I guess after using Android on phones for so long, I just expect it. Also, the speakers could be better. ASUS makes a big deal out of the audio quality, but it's just marketing. It's the same flat, tinny, no-stereo-separation speaker you'd get with any tablet.

They did opine that the Android OS update to 4.2.2 might improve slow performance and it sure did IF the performance was slow to begin with (which I contend it was NOT).This tab is not slow, does not lag, is not hard to hold (get a case like everyone does), is not a lackluster design (is actually a Nexus clone) and does have above average sound (in both controls and quality).The OS update was performed with ease and if you are a new owner, do this update as soon as the battery has received its first full charge.This IS INDEED a great tab for the bucks and I am not sure why CNET was so harsh, and IMO, off base.I have since added a 32GB Class 10 Micro SD card, a nifty case, and a screen protector.And I stick by my guns.This tab rocks.UPDATE  11.30.2013Still pleases and amazes.

As far as I am concerned, it's perfect for my needs.  I read on it, I play a couple of word games, watch an occasional movie, play Xfinity's On-Demand tv programs, check Facebook, Twitter and email, and visit an occasional website.  This tablet is responsive, quick, and has very good battery life.  Of course, I cannot predict what may or may not happen to it down the road, but I have had a couple of netbooks in the past that had to be shipped back to the manufacturers for repair, meaning, any device can act-up at any time.My feeling about this device vs. cost, even if it quit after 2yrs or so, I would feel I've gotten my money's worth.  I paid $149, and I honestly do not feel that's an exorbitant amount for a couple of years use from a basic tablet.  High-end and high-price, IMO, doesn't mean the device won't crash and burn.  My son just had to pay $20 to ship back an expensive Smartphone device that went completely dead just past the year's warranty, and has no idea what it's going to cost to fix it.Getting back on track, for my needs, as mentioned above, this tablet is perfect.  Fingers crossed that it will give me a couple of years of flawless use.***Adding a comment - If I am not mistaken, I remember seeing that Amazon suspended the sale of this device for a short time some months back.  I can't remember the exact wording Amazon used, but I think it had to do with the device having an issue that Amazon was addressing before putting it back on the website for sale.  That being said, I am wondering, when I see that some are reporting battery issues, this was the reason. Maybe there was a batch of devices that had faulty batteries, or some other related issue.  Any device, from any manufacturer, can have issues, I think we can all agree on that. Actually, that goes for anything, even automobiles. We just always hope we get a \"good\" product, without defects, that will wind up being fixed one way or the other.  I really do enjoy having this tablet.

We now are sending out the second tablet we purchased. The keypad function suddenly stopped working. These tablets are well taken care of. They are screen and tablet protected completely and my sons are monitored in their usage of them. I am beside myself that both of these tablets after only four months of usage needed to be serviced already. That is absurd. I have a feeling this will be happening again. I'm happy that the company is willing to fix the issue, but to have to pay to ship to them, then my sons losing all of their info and games and such, it's just quite a pain to deal with this. Why can't they just work properly? I find it hard to believe that these are solid, well built tablets when in purchasing two of them, I've already needed them BOTH serviced after such a short period of use. I'm staring to believe they are junk tablets. Yea, the price wasn't $300 but we did pay $129 for each tablet and for a family on a budget, that isn't cheap to us! I expected more out of these and am feeling let down by the whole brand itself. Such a bummer. :/My advice is that if you have ANY issue that cannot be resolved, contact the company through a live chat. They will work with you on what is the problem and will need all of your info on the tablet itself. They then create an RMA for you to fill out and send with the tablet to Texas for servicing. You have to pay the shipping, but they pay for it on the way back to you. Anyway, good luck to those that own this! Another two cents...if you're considering these tablets...don't!Bought two of these for Christmas as a gift to each of my sons, who at the time were 6 and 7. One of them suddenly stopped working recently and we contacted the company directly, in which we live chatted with someone on the issue. After trouble shooting some things, we realized we weren't getting anywhere and the company then sent us a form through an email so we could pack up the tablet and send it to them so it could be checked and fixed if possible. Within two weeks we got the tablet back, just like new. We lost everything as far as what was downloaded game wise (as that's all they play on their tablets) but we expected that and it was not a problem whatsoever as all the games were just free downloads. We had to pay nothing (except shipping TO them, which I was fine with because we just wanted the problem resolved) and had the tablet back so fast that it was just a very simple process overall. With that, I am very satisfied. The company came through on that retrospect fully.The only issue I have is that they never said what the problem was directly, and that is something I would have liked to have known. I don't understand why that is, but I think they could have least told us what was wrong and possibly why. But we got it back fixed and I'm happy with that. So far, so good. We'll see how these hold up in the future. At least I know I can turn to the company for help when needed as they did come through the first time around. I fully back up going through them if you didn't purchase a warranty through Amazon, and especially if you are after the time frame through Amazon as well. Do not go through what's listed in your booklets...I had to google the company and choose United States to get with someone here. They are located in Texas.

My daughters tablet would not charge nor come on. I opened the case which was very easy using a plastic triangle shaped tool that looks kinda like a guitar pick. I checked the battery voltage which was 3.1v. Too low to start charging. I disconnected it and reconnected it a few times and got it charging again. I gave it back to her with a full battery. The same problem happened again. I took her cable and connected it to my sons tablet over night. His tablet then would not turn on. Opened it up and battery was at 3.2v. Anyway, after testing everything I found the cable to be faulty and caused the battery to drain. Google \"micro usb cable drain/wake problem\". I purchased a mediabridge charge cable and all is well again. The only way I found to get the tablet to wake again was to disconnect the battery. Luckily it only takes 30 seconds to open the case.

The 16GB of internal memory is 11GBs of usable memory,which is very fine for me since I use a 64GB microSD card with the tablet,plan to upgrade to a 128GB microSD too in the future for it. The screen is a finger print magnet,but a good screen protector does the trick to help with this,and a microfiber cloth too. The battery lasts for about 12 hours on wifi and with videos,I've played a few high resolution games on the tablet till it died,and I can confirm it'll last a long time. I use the tablet for viewing 720P movies and videos using a MX player app,plays majority of the videos I throw onto it very well. I also use it to play wifi games too. Note that in order to get the full 12 hours of wifi and videos from it,the screen must be on the lowest setting.Prior to owning this tablet,I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0,which was a fine tablet while I used it,but this one is a great upgrade with the better CPU,memory and screen. This memopad may not have a high scratch resistant screen like the Tab did,but it does its job well.I just hope that I don't run into any of the similar issues that others have had with theirs dying in a few months.

(I am NOT a technologically savvy person.) Being the owner of a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, as well as having messed around with my friend's tablets from other brands, is the only credibility I have when I say that this tablet is amazing. For a prices that is less expensive than a Galaxy, I get great camera shots (Galaxy disappointed me with this when I first owned one) with what is apparently 5 MP (although the front-facing camera is only 1.5 MP), and the speed of this tablet is impressive. Also, I do not have to worry much about the battery life. Those who own a Galaxy will know that at some point throughout an eight-hour day a worry will sink in about whether or not to plug in our tablet. This (Asus) tablet actually makes me feel secure not only about not plugging in the battery, but about not having to wait long for it to recharge once it does require to be plugged-in to an outlet. Wow. The battery (again, not a technologically savvy person) charges quickly and lasts probably more than the 10 hours noted on the product description. I am noticing that I can go on and on about this product, so I will only say this: buy it. It made me happy and will likely make others like me happy as well. (Note: I was worried about reviews concerning glitches on this device. After a week of ownership, I think I know what that is about. It is not that this device has glitches, but that it is very rigid in the way its features function. For example, I have noticed that I have to reopen my setting app if I choose to unpair a device through a bluetooth connection. However, for the price and great features that come with that price, one can easily adapt to this extra step in the process.)Thanks Asus!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "ananthalakshmi", "ReviewID": "R2XYBCDYPJET2D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good for through price I guessGiving lite troubleStill getting good in a whileI am OK with the product.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Extremely satisfied", "Author": "JON E SHORT", "ReviewID": "R7YOGEDYO422Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this tablet for our 6 year old daughter.

Hopeful Asus will make available and release updates to Android 4.4.2 soon.  An entry level tablet can leave you wanting more and a premium price of $400 will make you poor but this tablet is respectable for all but the super power user.  It's 16GB memory is fairly large but if you need more it can be expanded with a SD memory card for massive music or pictures storage.

I was getting tablets for my 9yo twins, so I was looking at price, durability, and something that they could grow with. I didn't want to by some child specific built tablet which some were even higher priced than the ASUS or the cheaper ones that didn't get very good reviews. In my weeks of research it became evident that the best bang for the buck for this size entry level tablet was between this and the Nexus 7. Both have their pros and cons but they are pretty close in comparison. Everything will tell you the Nexus 7(newer model) is best but it will cost you more too. They said the new ASUS MEMO HD was closely designed to the previous Nexus 7. For me it was not worth the price difference since this was going to be for my kids first tablets. These also had the sd card expansion the Nexus does not. We have had these for about a month and they are used non-stop by my boys. If you are used to using and android based smart phones you will have a easy learning curve in setting up and using these tablets. It runs fast. We have had no issues with internet or running games. My boys run Netflix constantly and there has been no lag. This also has a front and rear camera with decent quality. I set them up with Skype accounts so they can video chat with the grandparents anytime they want. Looked good on our end and my parents said the picture on their end was good too. I find myself grabbing their tablets a lot to use vs. my laptop or cell phone now. I think the viewer angles are good. The only \"con\" I can see as noted by others is this unit does show finger prints easily. But that is only a issue depending on how the light hits it and come on, how hard is it to just wipe it off. They do sell screen protectors for this that helps with this issue, but honestly ours is in a case and I always tell the boys to wash there hands before they use them. Battery life is really good. My boys can use them almost non-stop playing games, streaming movies, internet, etc. and it would be at 20-30% battery life. This has parent control features but I have not set them up. This is a good entry level tablet and perfect size for portability. Will fit in your purse with a case easily ladies. We bought the Procase ASUS MeMO Pad HD Protective case here on Amazon which fit perfect and are very durable( Also come with free stylus). If you been looking at this tablet or want a good entry level tablet this is it. I honestly don't know why anyone would need to spend 300+ for a tablet. If your one of those people who can do everything from their phone but just would like to have a bigger screen to look at then this is your answer.

When I read the specs on this tablet, it seemed almost too good to be true.I recieved the tablet as a present, and here are my impressions.The tablet is very well built.  It has a nice heft to it, but is not too heavy.  The only complaint I have with the tablet is the screen.  It is a hard plastic rather than the \"GorillaGlass\" that I have seen some of the more expensive tablets advertising.  However, I have not had any issues with the screen.The sensitivity of the screen is excellent, although it doesn't seem to like styluses nearly as much as it likes fingers.  I also purchased a Cross Tech2 pen/stylus combo, and the stylus functionality is hit/miss probably 30% of the time.  This happens with a Targus stylus as well, so I don't think it is limited to the Cross pen.The tablet is POWERFUL.  I was shocked to find a tablet with a quad-core processor, 16gb of built in memory, AND a microSD card slot for under $250.  I was even happier to find one for under $150!  I have tried quite a few games on this tablet, and although I am not truly a tablet gamer (I stick to slot games and the occasional Candy Crush Saga), it has performed admirably.  I am however, working on my tablet on a very regular basis (daily).  The tablet is unbelievably nice to carry to jobsites.I had no troubles updating this tablet, although I purchased a white one for my wife, and she encountered an issue with a firmware update that improved the performance of NetFlix.  She is not too worried about it, as she does not watch netflix on the device.  Installation of apps, including the Amazon Appstore was painless.I have installed a 32gb microSD card, and have loaded several digital movies onto the system.  Playback is gorgeous in HD, although the sound only comes from one side when one is holding the tablet in a landscape orientation.  My suggestion, get a nice set of earbuds.All in all, an insanely featured tablet for an unbelievable price.

In fact, it works flawlessly and quite fast up to now.The camera works fine and can take average to good quality pictures in daylight or fully lit environment.Power and volume buttons are activated with right amount of pressure.I had the impression that a 7-inch tablet would be too small for me, but it just doesn't feel that way when holding and using it.The Asus apps are actually very useful.I've already installed like 20 apps and they all work perfectly without any issues.Cons:Glossy back is prone to smudgeSome lags when swiping through screens and screen rotationsCamera could be betterI don't know if this will be the case in the future, but I wish it gets updated to android 4.3I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a tablet for this price range.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good quality midrange tablet", "Author": "Busy mom", "ReviewID": "R1XB0ZA6Y5J5SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No troubles so far with this tablet.

Before they were carrying around one of my old laptops (15.6\" screen, icore3, 5.5lbs of weight). I analysed what they used it for and decided to buy them a tablet rather than another laptop. Any serious computer work they can do at very well equipped workstations. This tablet was the perfect solution. Ever since they haven't used the Laotop anymore! As to compare it to other tablets: In our country the Asus is not available and we had envious requests of friends and tablet owners (owning Samsung, and others owning some cheap low end brands which at the end cost the same or even more) to get an Asus for them!

The last one I got was a Ployer Momo7 which was a nice tablet but it had a ton of fine scratches all over the screen even though it was supposed to be new.After that experience I wanted a tablet coming from a US distributer with a brand name so Asus fit the bill especially since they make the Nexus also.This is basically the original 16GB Nexus only with a micro SD slot that can take a 32GB card. The wifi picks up neighbors that my laptop does not. The screen is beautiful and I have watched movies from Netflix and HBO.The only thing that seems off is that the headphones do not get as loud as I would expect when I try to make it loud it comes with a pop up saying something about loud volume damaging your ears. It might be auto limiting the sound output from the headphones. I haven't figured that out yet. This tablet has a ton of features. I find new things constantly, some that I have not seen in the manual which is not as good as it could be but better than the China tablets I previously bought.What is also nice is that I didn't have to change the default language to English and get rid of a bunch of Chinese apps. I had to root the Chinese tablets to do this. I didn't have to do that with this ASUS. I would buy this again and through the same seller.

It wouldn't respond. This was the second week of January.So, the following day I began my search for the correct customer service phone number to call, not nearly as easy as it should be. Finally I found the number and began wading through the warranty mire. To begin with this process is long and drawn out and be sure to have the original box that the unit came in with you, you will need that. After completing the questioning and plugging the tablet into the charger as asked, I was asked to hold the \"on\" button in at which time the charging icon began to show up intermittently. I was told to let the unit charge for 30 minutes and see what happens. I requested and received a warranty or incident number, thinking I wouldn't have to jump through all of the hoops again. About 10:00 pm it finally had a full charge and worked normally another few days, then failed again.We charged it overnight, nothing. Another call, this is when I found that the previous incident number apparently meant nothing because I had to repeat all of the information again, asked to perform all of the same trouble shooting tasks, again. Now, in my mind to me with a product like this when it is determined that the customer isn't doing something stupid and there is something wrong with the tablet the company should issue a call tag have the unit picked up and as soon as they receive it ship a new one to the customer and sold the repaired on as a refurbished tablet. This isn't what happened. We had to ship the tablet to the repair center to be repaired. Today we learned, because my wife was vigilant that the customer service representative we talked to had managed to misspell or address, which is staggering because to my recollection I gave them our address no fewer than three times, carefully spelling it each time.The tablet worked fine while it worked, which is why I gave it two stars. The failure of the unit after only two weeks and then the abysmal customer service makes me waiver on the two stars leaning toward lowering it to one.I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

The outside is a bit cheap feeling, but the internal features are great. I own a Surface RT, Surface Pro and an iPad 2. I was considering getting an iPad mini to replace the iPad 2, but after using this device, I'm not sure that is necessary. I wanted something smaller and lighter that still allowed me to browse, view videos, get email, compose small documents, get directions, view eBooks and Skype. This device seems to have the bases covered. Not to say the device does not have flaws. Read the pros and cons below for details. But for the price ($130) this device gets 4 stars from me.Pros:I like the size, weight, screen resolution and battery life of this tablet. It plays Netflix videos well. I can use this all day before needing a recharge. And it runs in idle mode for days without a recharge.The viewing angle is very good.I like the access to system setting and notifications with a swipe down from the top.The floating apps are also nice.After I received the 4.2.2 Android update, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I can now add multiple user accounts to the tablet, each with his/her own password and personalizations.Cons:My biggest complaint is the power button. It is too small and hard to find.I am not a fan of the Android file system.The keyboard does not provide great feedback that a key has been pressed. The key changes from dark to blue when you press it. It would be much better if the key got bigger for a moment.The compass app does not seem to work and there appears to be no way to calibrate it.The rear camera that sticks out on the back prevents you from laying the tablet flat on a table, which makes it difficult to type or tap on it without the tablet jiggling or moving.Windows 8.1 has several nice gestures for switching, killing and getting at app features that Android 4.2 is missing.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a piece of garbage !!!", "Author": "Kevin Yang", "ReviewID": "R2KF1S818EO4HK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a piece of garbage !!!After charging for 8 hours, 1st time boot up OK.Updated system as instructed by ASUS software.2nd time boot up OK.Headset also works, but the internal speaker is active at the same time.Why would I want to annoy my partner while I have the headset in my ears?That is so dumb !!!After I remove the headset, the power button fail to launch the shutdown popup window.I tried various options, including holding the power button for 8 seconds to 20 seconds.Nothing works, the screen simply goes on and off, but Android is still active.After about 30 minutes of frustrating attempts, the shutdown popup window eventually shows up.I shutdown Android and leave the tablet on the computer desk.About 6 hours later, I couldn't power up the tablet.  Even the Asus logon is not showing.Again, I tried holding the power buttons for 2 seconds, 8 seconds, 30 seconds, whatever ...Nothing works.The screen remains dark and it won't even flash like the previous successful boot up sequence I have observed.There is no indicator lights can be found anywhere.Initially, I thought 6 hours of sleeping ( even though it was power off ) probably have drained the battery.So I use the USB cable ( provided by Asus ) to recharge the tablet.Amazingly, the screen display the battery logo and it goes to fully charged within 10 seconds.So the darn tablet is not discharged in the fist place.Well, now I need help to return this tablet.Anyone has good suggestions?", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't bother...on my 2nd one in just over a month", "Author": "J.

Otherwise it's a pain in the ass and I strongly suggest a purchase of a Samsung or something.  BTW...this was for my 8 yr old son.  Even put a screen protector on it and put it in a case.

We bought this tablet SPECIFICALLY for use between my wife and my two preschool children. Other Android 4.2 devices have a multi-user setting. I cannot find it on this one, it is NOT listed under the \"Settings:Device\" menu like the others.This is ridiculous.At a glance (Day 1), the tablet is very fast, seems to be plenty refined and feels good in the hand. No complaints about the build or quality so far, but I will not rate this any higher than 3 stars until they fix this lack of multi-user function, or until I find it buried somewhere in the settings menu in a place that no other device seems to have it.[EDIT]Despite attempting to get the pad to do software updates to get to using Android 4.2.2 yesterday (and being told every time that I was up to date), it decided to update today to 4.2.2. This DOES give me the multi-user function, but it's very buggy.On my secondary  user account, apps often seem to freeze unless you switch from one app to the other using the floating app key. If you momentarily leave an app, and return, it will be running fine again and complete whatever command you gave it that froze it. Doesnt' always happen, and doesn't happen on every app.Either way, at least the multi-user function is working.I have had no other issues with the tablet, and for now I will consider these to be minor bugs that will be worked out.MARCH 2014So far this tablet has been pretty good, but we've simply abandoned the multi-user setting now.

This is $130 very well spent! Sure it has a few flaws, but so does every other 7\" tablet out there. I am very pleased with the video quality, and have been loading mp4 movies on to the 32GB SD card I bought with the Memopad HD 7.  This unit compares almost exactly with the first version of the Nexus 7: Quad Core processor, etc, but it has something that even the new Nexus and old or new Samsung's are still lacking: an SD card slot to increase how much media you can carry with you.  The Asus Apps that come with the unit are actually useful, and the packaging is top notch.  I would suggest a clear screen protector: you finger slides across the screen much easier with one, but, skip the \"matt\" finish screensavers for this unit. Has the chops to be visible outdoors, and I have not had a problem with this unit connecting to my WiFi network, either at home, or on the move ( sorry, no cell radio available for this unit).  You can have a lot of fun with this, believe me!  Its compact enough, you can use it as a remote ( with the proper apps from the Play Store of course).  My grand kids ( 5 and 12) love them!  They are kind of jaded too: they both have 14\" Laptops! It has gone down a bit in price since I bought mine...so take advantage!

Also I'm not happy the price of the tablet dropped to $129 from the $149 I payed. We shall see. Until then, 1 star stands.UPDATE Dec21-13: It took 3 weeks to be shipped back to me. A little long IMO and a now has a scratch on the display.Hmmn!After putting it to the teswt, it's performance has increased tremendously. Battery life is now on par with the reviews.

What does that mean? It means that my super cool $10 keyboard with case that I bought from Amazon ( and works great on the older version), does not function at all on this newer version! Cannot plug in keyboard, and cannot read flash drive...rendering what should have been an AWESOME $150 stand alone computing device almost useless for me (and many grownups)...great tab for the kids for gaming and vids, but without external keyboard, this cannot replace my laptop on the go....bummer.UPDATE 10/23/13:  I've resolved the battery drain issue by installing an app killer/battery checker, and this seems to be helping...also making sure to close ALL the floating apps if I know I will leave the unit sleeping a while...also found reference somewhere that the unit hardware CAN support USB OTG, but programmers have not released software fix yet...hopefully that will happen...in general, I'm pleased with the tablet after the initial disappointment.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "From Victory To Defeat", "Author": "Signetring54 \"Signetring54\"", "ReviewID": "R35BZCHA5GWHHW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really started out loving this tablet. My initial reaction to using it was quite impressive, but then things started to hiccup. On some applications, like Candy Crush, the touch response feature has become quite unbearable. Pressing hard and multiple times with a stylus brings no response. It does this only intermittently, but frustrating none-the-less. I have tried loading music with the micro USB cable from my laptop with Windows 7 on to a brand new 32 GB Class 10 micro SD card, but the device could not recognize the files to play them after inserting it into the on board memory card slot. Something about a wrong format. I also tried loading the music files directly into the internal storage drive, but again could not get the Google music player or one of the top rated music player apps to either read or play them. Today, the unit stopped recognizing my AT&T; U-verse wireless internet connection stating that the signal is not strong enough. Powered unit off and back on with no success getting the wireless antennae to work on the unit. I then tried contacting ASUS for support using their live chat function, but the service is only available M-F during normal business hours. Humph! I've read most of the reviews here, but have not been able to find anyone who has mentioned the transferring music files problem. The Micro SD card also unmounted two or three times for no apparent reason while still being seated in the units on board slot. What's that all about? This is my first tablet experience and I wanted it to be frustration free. It's not going to happen with this unit. I will try to contact ASUS support on Monday to see if there is a fix for these problems.Update: Had to do a complete factory reset to get wireless working again. Humph! Have to start over from scratch now an reload all apps. Need to start over from the beginning on Candy Crush. Bummer! Does anyone know if the Memo Pad requires a special format to install music from a Windows 7 laptop using the Synchronization Function from the media player device? I just used this same function to install music to my new Moto X Phone that also uses the Android operating system with out any hiccups. I'm still on the fence about returning this unit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We'll see if ASUS support will be able to help with the music play problem on Monday.Update: I've just learned from another reviewer that the Asus Memo Tablet will only accept MP3 downloads. What does this mean to the rest of us? Any CD's that you have ripped to your computer using Microsoft Media Player will not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What? It is a format problem! How come I read all the reviews about this tablet on Amazon and a host of other sites that never mentioned this? I know rhetorical question, but OMG you mean my several hundred dollar library of CD's have now become obsolete! Then how come I was just able to transfer all these files on to my new Moto X Andriod 4.2.2 Smart Phone and play them with out any difficulties! This is absolute nonsense for Asus to have done this, maybe in conjunction with Google, and maybe to try and pry more money out of your wallet. Come on guys these are not eight track or cassette tapes!!!! If I had known this in advance, I would have looked elsewhere for a tablet.
