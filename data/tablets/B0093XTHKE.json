{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just got it, no Google Play, but Netflix can be installed. UPDATE Included!", "Author": "Lara", "ReviewID": "R1THXOUWHW2GVG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just got it today, so I am giving it a 4 star (sadly last update Jan 2013, I had to reduce 2 stars from my review) and will update this review as I use it.  Here goes...I was eye balling the new Ipad (yeah, I am all things Mac), but honestly could not justify the $500+ (already have a macbook air that I can slip in my bag) for simply needing a tablet that can stream Netflix and perhaps some kids apps. My daughter loves watching Curious George, hence I needed a reasonable tablet that can keep her busy while visiting my workshop.I got this after reading the reviews for Coby Kyros MID7015  Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - Black - so I knew many had said no Netflix (because there is no Google Play for this little guy), but I took a gamble (after reading that some people found a way around the no Google Play issue) and ordered the new version (MID7036-4) anyhow.Connecting to wireless was a breeze, the MID7036-4 comes with an app called GetJar, which will allow you to download many of the apps I was looking for, such as Netflix. However I went ahead and downloaded 1mobile (dot) com and downloaded Netflix, Angry Birds with ease. I used GetJar to download some puzzles and kids educational apps for my daughter.Netflix has been working without any issues and so did the Angry Birds (ahem, for me!). I have to admit, I was sure it was heading right back, but there is a way around no Google Play.Wanted to do a quick review for people in my shoes, looking for a compact tablet that was reasonable and was for Netflix etc...Please note that this is not an Ipad (or similar high end tablet) equivalent as far as resolution goes, but it is perfect for my needs. resolution is good enough, the touch screen is very reactive and functions great, the size is just right and has fit my Kindle Touch cover with ease.I will post more as I use it. Hope this helps :)Small Update / Nov 2nd, 20121. The battery life is about 2-3 hours while using Netflix.2. Connects to 2.4G but not to 5G band on my router.3. Connects to my Macbook Air and allows me to drag and drop music, photos with ease.Update / Nov 20th, 20121. Connects to my Windows (Sony laptop + other desktop) and I can drag movies and photos with ease.2. Can download Kindle reader from 1mobile(dot)com and read my kindle books (attaching images on the product for you all).3. GetJar app that this comes w does not have a lot of the apps I can get from Amazon or 1mobile4. Can add the tablet to my Amazon account and use the Kindle Fire apps.5. Can set parental control w/ the Android Parental Control app.Update / Nov 24th 20121. Installed Amazon Appstore, nice addition to my Imobile app store.2. Email set up: Was a breeze, I clicked email icon and entered my gmail address and followed the screen instructions. Email synced and works great.3. Downloaded Youtube app from Imobile (looked for it under the Amazon Appstore, but could not find it). Installed Youtube and it works great.4. Can open PDF files w/ Adobe Reader that is already installed in this tablet. There is also Office Suite in this tablet.Next up, testing the battery life for Kindle books :)Update / January 4, 2013 (Down 2 stars!)1. Kindle book battery life time is about 3 hours.2. The power jack (dc input) socket on the tablet is fragile, awkward and flimsy at best. It needs a light hand to plug the power adaptor (in order to charge). If you allow your youngster they may break this when pushing the power adaptor in. Knowing what I know about this tablet's flimsy power jack socket, I'd not be able to suggest this tablet whole heartedly (unless you have buyers protection w/ your credit card, like I did, and can get an easy refund incase yours breaks under 90 days).COBY, how could you skimp on the power jack socket?  Not cool at all! :/", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seems like a good budget tablet value", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R3O7X4TKVCO35B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewer, I had been considering the earlier model of this device, but due to the small price difference, it made sense to go or the latest model with the capacitive screen.  The unit comes nicely packaged with a printed manual, a slip case, a micro fiber cleaning cloth (small), a USB cable, AC charger, the tablet, and and some other cards, offers, and info.  All in all, a good quality box and package making for a nice first impression.I charged the battery and then turned on the tablet.  It booted up quickly and I set up my wifi connection with no problems at all.  Pretty much like any Android tablet.  There are a few basic apps installed (music, video, email, gallery (pics/vid, YouTube, etc.) and the GetJar app market.  You can read all about this under the 7015 (Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - Black)reviews, so I won't repeat it here.  As others mention, you can use the 1mobile, Amazon or other app stores, and you can also download app packages to your PC and transfer them to the 7036 and run them to install.  (I will update once I've had more time to install and test additional apps.)If you used any of the larger automobile GPS units, this device will look very familiar.  The screen quality is similar, but fine for this price point.  Viewing angles are acceptable, contrast and black levels are not as good as pricier models, but are acceptable for this price.  One plus is that this unit has a USB port (for pc-tablet data transfers) and a micro SD card slot.  Many cheaper tablets do not. The screen flips to the proper orientation quickly as needed and as expected.  I like having the physical (back) button on the right side (in normal landscape mode).  You also have the usual touch screen functions, of course, but this sits right under your thumb and is very convenient.The 7036-4 has 4 GB internal flash, 512 MB RAM and a decent 1 GHz processor.  The screen is not as good as those on higher priced tablets, but it is acceptable.  800x600 would have been better, but 800x480 is good enough for video/photos. Text suffers though. The touch screen works fine and is very responsive.  The case is plastic and the unit is fairly light weight, but the quality seems fine for the asking price.There is no camera in this model (the 7048 includes one for only a few dollars more), however, the thing I really miss is bluetooth.  Bluetooth allows the easy connection of external speakers and wireless headphones.  You can buy Bluetooth adapters that can plug into the headphone jack, but this is not nearly as convenient, especially since the headphone jack is, unfortunately, located on the bottom, right corner of the unit.  Not sure what they were thinking, but it is not a very convenient location, in my opinion.  (Well, it's OK if you use this primarily holding it in your hands, but if you put it on a stand as I often do, it's a minor problem.)The Android 4 ICS OS installed is pretty much vanilla which is fine with me.  I felt right at home (I have several other Android devices.)  I have both smaller and larger units, this medium size unit is a good size for portable video viewing.  The sound is OK, it's mono (only one speaker), but quality is good enough, though most people will probably use headphones.  No GPS, but wifi location works as expected.Summary:*** So far, this device is meeting my goal of a smaller, more portable Android tablet.  My Thrive is way better, but it's also bigger and heavier.  So for \"grab and go\" trips around town, this is a better choice.  Plus if I drop or loose it, less pain than if it were my much more expensive Thrive (which I love, a super tablet). ***-- 800x480 Screen quality is OK for the price (not great, but acceptable).  Videos look pretty good, but text pixels are readily visible (see update below*).  Viewing angles acceptable.  Black levels adequate. Average quality, but good enough for this price.-- Performance is snappy overall.-- Build quality seems OK for the price point.-- Android OS is great.  No proprietary \"tweaks\" that I noticed.-- Nicely packaged with slip case, cleaning cloth, USB Cable, charger, etc.-- Has a USB port and a micro SD card slot (often missing in cheaper tablets)-- Painless setup right out of box.  Booted up and worked fine.-- No camera, no GPS, no Bluetooth (alas!)-- Videos played fine and looked good.  YouTube HD vids work fine.  SD Netflix played fine.-- Mono speaker, but good enough in a pinch.  Headphone jack available, of course, and stereo sound quality was fine when I plugged in my external stereo speaker.-- Lightweight, portable, feels solid enough.-- Excellent value for what you get - good bang for the buck.(*Text: I went into settings and changed the text size from \"normal\" to \"large\" which greatly improved the quality.  Not that much bigger, really, but better size for this resolution and looks much \"smoother\" to me.)Update:  I was able to install 1Mobile market (Update: I replaced this with Amazon App store which works better, for me anyway) and then apps like Pandora, Google Maps, App2SD, and so forth.Based on my usage so far, it appears battery life will be between 4-6 hours.  Best guess is 5 1/2.  Will update once I can confirm.  (Confirmed that I am getting roughly 5 hours of battery life, more or less, depending on use. Can get 6-7 hours or more with light use, turn screen/wifi off while playing music, but 5-6 hours seems reasonable.  Will be less if streaming video full time, of course.  Lara in her review indicates 2-3 hours.)Update:  Was able to install Amazon App store and installed Netflix which works fine.  Amazon app store seems a bit better and more reliable than 1mobile.  Both work.  To use Amazon you must have an Amazon account and register your device (email).  You get an email with the apk which you can then install easily.  The email has step by step instructions.  Works much better for me than 1mobile.I've had a few minor issues with the touch screen, but mostly me getting used to it.  Have to go a bit slower and more carefully than on my Thrive.  Size difference of course.  Have installed a bunch more apps from Amazon store and they have all worked fine, no problems at all.Update 11-19-2012: This has actually dropped in price recently.  Mine is still working great and I am very happy with it.  An even better value now.Update 2013 Mar 07 -- still working fine and no complaints.  This is my \"backup\" tablet -- but I often grab it first for trips where I don't want to risk my \"good\" more expensive tablet and it always gets the job done.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is inexpensive...", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "RXN0J487CAJUE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, for what it costs, it's just barely tolerable.  I bought it to test developing with Android.  For that purpose, as a lowest common denominator device, it works fairly admirably.  On the other hand, this is nearly the bare bones minimum you need to do Netflix / surf the web / play games etc.  This thing is just barely fast enough to play Netflix SD.  For light web, book reading and email, it would serve pretty well given the price.  I plan on buying one for my Mom, and maybe as a treat for one of my kids if they do well in school.  But it's certainly no Nexus 7 or iPad.  But hey, it is cheap as all get out, and it works, so that's pretty hard to argue with.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet for the money", "Author": "Rebecca L. Murray", "ReviewID": "R236OGYAM5TOLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice tablet for the money. There is an error in the product description. It says the Coby Kryos has a USB2 port. It does not; it has a micro USB port and comes with a male/male micro to USB2 cable. If you plan to use it with a keyboard case, I would recommend you buy  a male micro USB to female USB2 adapter when you buy the tablet. There are two ways to get that adapter: by purchasing a whole adapter kit from BestBuy for about $15 and end up with a bunch of adapters you may not need, or order it on-line. They typically only run you about $3 if you go the on-line ordering route.Pros:* Intuitive to use. If you've ever used a modern smart phone, even one that is not an Android, you will have no learning curve.* Decent built-in speaker. I have a Kindle Fire and the speaker on this little $90 tablet is noticeably better.* nice, responsive touch screen; not too picky but didn't require multiple touches to get it to respond to a finger swipe, either.* Ran most of my Kindle Fire apps just fine so I didn't have to re-buy many.* Nice selection of free apps available on the native app center.* Accepted the 32 gig micro SD card I scavenged out of my old Palm Centro just fine.* Docked right up to my main computer just fine and transferred file just fine. Downloaded Office Pro quickly and opened the Office docs I transferred to it just fine.* Light weight so using the on-screen keybord was actually pretty comfortable, unlike the heavier 7\" tablets I've used.* Pretty good speed at web surfing and handled You Tube, Hotmail, and Face Book just fine.Cons:* I really wish it had a USB2 adapter.* Didn't really match the pictures displayed exactly.* It's not as fast as my Kindle Fire, so if you are looking for high-end performance, you might be disappointed.* Picture quality leaves a bit to be desired but is ok for most uses. If you primarily want to watch movies on it, you might be disappointed.Conclusion:I didn't want yet another gadget but I needed access to Office while my big computer renders 3D animated scenes. Quite frankly, if the Kindle Fire could be docked with an external keyboard, I would not have bought this one. That being said, it's a pretty decent little machine for the money. It's not an iPad, but then again, it didn't cost nearly as much as an iPad, either. If you want a basic tablet PC that won't break the bank, this one is a good choice.

Finding it on Amazon for only $3 more, I quickly snatched it up!First of all, I knew that with buying a cheap tablet that I was going to get a \"cheap\" tablet, but I do have to say that this tablet turned out way better than I expected. Of course, it doesn't come with the Google Play Store by default, but if you're tech savvy enough you can work your way around this (like I did). The resolution is a little watered down, but it still looks good for a 7\" screen. The touch part is quite responsive and I've yet to have any real issues with the touch screen. It's a snappy, good-looking tablet for $83. The sound is a little lacking as well, having only a single speaker on the device. But for me, this is not a problem as I rarely ever use my tablet without headphones.My only real complaint I have with this tablet is the battery life. I use my devices pretty regularly, and heavily, so my experience might be different from yours. But the life I've gotten out of it so far is around 4 hours, and that's with heavy gaming, web surfing and the screen brightness set to max.All in all, if you're looking for a tablet to play with and try out but don't want to fork out some serious cash, I'd say definitely get this one.

Ellis", "ReviewID": "RL5CLZX489YPL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Full disclosure: I'm a Kindle Fire (1st Gen) owner who lost track of one of his compact-sized MP3 players.  In wanting to purchase a new MP3 player with the potential for upgraded storage (via MicroSD) I stumbled across this little jewel on Amazon.  It now serves as an MP3 player (32GB MicroSD holds plenty of music) and general-use tablet for the house.  By adding the Amazon App Market (Amazon has instructions for this on their site), I've been able to download my Kindle titles as well, for when my girlfriend would like to read them or when the Fire's charge is low and I don't want to be tethered to a short cord.  For the price, I'd say this was well-worth the purchase.  A few caveats:\u25d8 The screen is nowhere near the quality of the first-gen Kindle Fire, much less its newer iterations.  Viewing at a slight angle seems reminiscent of first-generation plasma/projection TV's, where one has to be directly in front of the screen and center-level to see absolutely everything.  The resolution is much lower than any current $200-range tablet offering, but let's be honest...you won't buy this for watching HD movies/television programming, and even so, you still can use it for this purpose...just don't expect to be blown away by the low-quality images.  On the bright side (pun not originally intended), you can adjust the brightness output to make the screen more visible.  The \"touch\" functionality is not top-notch...it is a bit rough-around-the-edges, if I'm honest...but for what you can do with this tablet, it's a small sacrifice.\u25d8 Sound quality from the built-in speaker is \"OK\" at best, but much better if you plug in some external speakers.\u25d8 Battery life is decent...if I only use this for playing music and the occasional web-browsing, a charge can last most of the day.  I imagine you can run this battery down in under three hours if you watch videos continuously.Bottom Line: For the price, this is a great little tablet.  Perhaps if you're looking to get a tablet for a young person and you don't want to drop $200-$400 on a \"mainstream\" tablet, this will not only provide the basic functionality, but will a little extra work (installing the Amazon App Market, for example) it can grow with that person as time progresses.  Otherwise it makes a great around-the-house reader/media player/web browser.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Three Replacements for the Same Issue!", "Author": "Charity Alejos", "ReviewID": "R14NIN4RPCRD7L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my son for Christmas.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a tablet for my 5-year-old, and I knew I didn't need it to have a lot of capabilities, so I thought this was a good product for both of us.  Within 3 weeks of receiving the product, the prong where the power cord plugs into the tablet broke, preventing us from being able to charge the tablet.  Amazon returns are such a snap, so we were pleased to simply return it, and we had a new one within a couple of days.  After three more weeks or so...the SAME thing happened!  I was mystified!  I had read this same issue that others had had, before I purchased it...but I had thought...maybe they just had a bit of bad luck.  Sadly...no.  So, for a second time, I returned the tablet, and a new one was quickly shipped by Amazon.  This one lasted almost two months...but today...SAME THING HAPPENED!!  Ugh!  So, I am finally returning this product for a refund.  I will gladly pay the extra $100 to get a product that lasts more than 30 days.  Oh...and did I mention that this tablet does not support Google Play.  1 Mobile (a free program you can download) does work.  And there are lots of free games that you can use.  But, disturbingly...today...my son tells me...\"I was looking up games to download, and something gross came up.  It was something going into something.\"  I quickly grabbed the tablet from him...and sure enough...there is a picture of a male body part, entering a female body part!  I was mortified.

Just wanted a basic tablet for him to play free Android apps and enjoy having a device of his own instead of using our smartphones. I assumed any economy Android tablet could perform the task, just wouldn't have the processor speed, RAM and storage of a more expensive tablet.  I was WRONG.I assumed I would be able to choose between using Coby's GetJar or downloading apps for Google Play store and Amazon Appstore.  Just as my Android phone came with GooglePlay and I was able to add the Amazon appstore.  I was wrong.  No access to GooglePlay, and while Amazon appstore worked the first time, now it only has a search bar that won't function and a blank screen. I know I can try re-installing and fiddle with it more, but I can't help feeling I shouldn't have to. Calling this an Android device should mean I can use its browser to go to any website (Google Play, Amazon, etc.) and download the app for their Android compatible app store.Add to that the resistive touch screen. I understand its a different technology and has the same learning curve of getting used to its functionality as the capacitive touchscreen on most other touch devices.  But that's just it, every other device I own is capacitive, and that's what we're used to.  On this screen you have to push HARD, and your finger does not slide as smoothly across the surface as it does on a capacitive screen. When web browsing for app stores this device doesn't work with, if I drag my finger to scroll and don't push hard enough, it clicks links instead of scrolling, making web-browsing a hassle.  Plus the corners have almost very low sensitivity.  Want to push that tiny \"X\" in the corner to close the ad in free app games? Good luck!Should I have ordered the capacitive version of this tablet? On one hand I wish I had, on the other, I have to admit that would only solve half the problem, better touch function, but still sub-par Android access.Overall I really wanted to like this tablet, I didn't expect much to begin with, just the basic function of a 7 year old playing Angry Birds, DrawSomething,etc.  I didn't think that would be pushing the abilities of this device, but GetJar doesn't have DrawSomething or half of the other apps my son likes to play on my phone, so apparently I do want more than this device can provide. Sure I can google how to hack it, and I have, but I hesitate to tamper with the system files because again I shouldn't have to do that just to get Android access on an Android device!To be fair, I should add that I ordered myself a Kindle Fire(Standard Def 8gb, not HD) the same day as this Coby Kyros. I knew it would be superior, just not to this extreme. Even if I do keep fiddling and decide to gift this, I think there are good odds my son would be happier sharing a Kindle Fire with me than having this tablet to himself.  Would he be happy using this despite the issues or just frustrated and dissapointed?

They've had possession of the defective unit for 11 1/2 weeks. Guess what? I bought a competitor's product as a replacement - don't know what I'll do with whatever COBY sends me - if they ever send me anything. The original unit supposedly came with a 1 year warranty - I asked if I would be prorated for the amount of time it's in their facility. That was a joke - \"OF COURSE NOT\"! They said they'd probably send a newer version, perhaps a 9\" tablet as a replacement. Problem is, I don't want a larger tablet. And, a replacement would most likely be a 'refurbished' unit. Guess what? Those only have a 90 day warranty. So, I'll get something I don't want (maybe) and lose 5 months of warranty in the process. THANKS COBY!!!!!!!!!!Original post May 6, 2013I opted for this item through a credit card rewards program in December 2012 as a tool to use while traveling to access internet and email. It worked fine for about 4 months, and then it would no longer achieve an internet connection. Initially, COBY's technical support response was fine, but they could not resolve the issue, and told me to return it under warranty. That's where their service ended.  The unit has been in their warranty repair center for a month, and they still don't have it logged into their system as having been received for repair. I spent 3 days calling their customer service at 800-727-3592 and never got through. First I got a recording telling me that all service representatives were busy and was disconnected. Later, I got the same message and was put on hold. 30 minutes later, I gave up.  Today when I called, all I got was a busy signal. I finally did manage to locate another # 877-302-2629 and spoke to a representative who told me that there was no record in their system yet, so I should call back next week, and it might show up then.

Apparently the internal part of the DC charger (the little silver stem that goes into the cord) had dislodged itself and fallen back into the case.  I can now hear it rattling around in there.  Since the micro-usb cord can only be used for transferring files and will not charge that way, the tablet is now completely non-operational.

This tablet is a piece of crap. I bought two of these for two nephews as Christmas presents. The boys loved them while they lasted (except for GetJar, the app program that came loaded on the tablets). One of the tablets lasted until March, the other until June - so I guess they lasted longer than some of the reviewers' tablets on this site. But three months and six months is not much of an endorsement for this type of product. The problem in both cases was the charging port, which came loose inside, and now the tablets can't be charged. I returned the first one on June 3 along with a money order for $15, my receipt, peripherals and original packaging. I have yet to receive a replacement tablet or even acknowledgement of receipt, despite emails to the company. As one reviewer reported, it is impossible to speak to anyone from the company because the customer support line refers you to their website and doesn't give the option of talking to a representative or leaving a message. I just returned the other one and used certified mail in order to at least have someone's name as a reference when checking up on this. Given all the problems that so many people have had, I am contemplating filing a complaint with the Ohio attorney general. I'm also wondering if the company is getting ready to go out of business because of their crummy product and bad customer service. Maybe that is why you can't talk to an actual human being at the company customer service number.

So I called today. It's now Week 5 and I was told that they didn't have a status update because \"the woman that updates the computer with the repairs is precepting someone this week and the updates are behind.\" The return instructions stated \"Please be advised; the process can be expected to take from 4-6 weeks total. Take note of the date that your package arrives in Savannah; 4 weeks from that date is the earliest date to start calling to get the return tracking number for the package coming back to you.\" So I guess I'll call next week....week 6.

The touch screen seems to have problems registering input near the edges.There is a reset hole in the back of the device. You must use a very narrow point (I use a safety pin) to press a button on board inside of the device through the hole. This will reset the device in case of system freeze.

I figured it's so inexpensive, why not give it a try?  Like many reviewers pointed out, the unit does not come with Google Play installed.  Yes-annoying.  But fortunately, some tech-smart folks have figured out a way to address tis (which makes sense given that you'd expect at this price point, many people will actually purchase this).  The link is below.  The instructions are super easy.  I got it working in one shot.  Now my kid is really happy.[...](if the link gets lobotomized by Amazon, the website is www+androidtablets+net - change the +'s to .'s and search for \"50425-root-gapps-telechips\")OK - just to confirm, this tablet is on the slower side.  It takes longer to install apps and it takes longer to launch apps.  But once launched, the apps run fine.  Note that this does NOT have a camera (zero, no front, no back).  It does NOT have GPS.  The video isn't the brightest, but the resolution is good enough (800x480).  The audio is LOUD (probably not the best quality, but it is definitely loud).  It does have a microphone so things like voice dictation into Google search will work.In summary, this is definitely a good intro/starter device, well worth the $$ I spent on it!.Good luck!UPDATE: As I now see on other reviews, the power port is indeed flimsy and touchy.  At first, the cord had to be plugged in in a specific way to charge, but then ultimately, the port just fell into the case.  I sent it in for warranty repairs along with the $15 money order.

The tablet has no camera, no GPS, no compass (it does auto-rotate, though). It does not come with the GooglePlay store either. Overall, this tablet is not in the same category quality-wise as the original Kindle Fire, Nook Color, or Nook Tablet. Not to mention the latest releases of the aforementioned devices.On the good side, this tablet has WiFi and connected to my home network in seconds. I was surprised that the tablet does load websites pretty quickly. In fact, web sites on this tablet are loaded much faster than on the original Kindle Fire and Nook tablet. Android applications can be sideloaded to the tablet. For example, you can download an APK and install it right there. I found the tablet to be responsive. This tablet was faster in every test I performed compared to the Kindle Fire first generation that I own. I had no problems sideloading several applications and they all worked well with good response. I don't know if GooglePlay can be installed on this tablet. I have not tried but I imagine that with enough effort it can be done. The Amazon app store can be installed fairly easy.Would I recommend this tablet? I don't know. Probably not. Depends at what price you are going to purchase it. I got it for $70 shipped and I feel that's probably the absolute maximum it is worth spending on it. In my case, I bought it for testing and development and the tablet fits that purpose well. For most people, though, I am inclined to recommend to just spend an extra $30 or $40 on some other tablet and not this one.

Experiments like, How long does it take for someone to go from complete peace of mind to absolute desctruction mode. Wouldn't take long with this little beauty I guarantee you. Be extra careful if you have a heart condition.  Anyway, I think you get my point....

However, ONE star fits the product much better. The ability to buy my 3 year old a tablet in which he could play angry birds, and that it cost as much as a Leapster Explorer sounded great. When I received the product I was feeling pretty good right until I turned it on...1. The body of the tablet, made of plastic, had a few rough edges, not from damage but from a poor mold from the factory.2. The screen was fine and pretty accurate, but the processing capability ends at running the clock widget.3. The software store has a very limited selection and lacks many apps. I wished to download some for my 3 year old (readily available from Google Play Store for my Iconia a500 tablet), but was unable to find them.4. When I managed to download Angry Birds, the tablet crashed and required a reset. It took 3 download attempts to finally have it install. Once I could start the app, it was very choppy.Even my 3 year old has enough technology capabilities that I quickly knew he wouldn't use it as he would get just as frustrated as I was. Within 10 minutes of opening the box I decided to return BOTH of the tablets and had no intention of testing the unopened one.I do NOT recommend this product.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do you enjoy 'tweeking' - because this one needs it", "Author": "fpearman", "ReviewID": "RBU5PUW977DQ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A tablet \u2013 like a computer \u2013 can be used for a dedicated or multiple application(s).

I wanted an iPad but I would have had to save up for about a year to afford one.  I took my chance with the Coby tablet because I read a lot of great reviews.  I had the tablet for about 6 months.  I didn't use it for the first 4 months because I couldn't set up my email on it, it didn't have my favorite apps, and I couldn't log into my school account information.  I really only got it for those reasons.  However, I finally realized I should just let the kids I babysit play with it instead of have it go to waste.  I found some great games that I loved and started realizing the benefits of the tablet.  I loved the tablet so much I bought one for my mom for Christmas and she was so excited!  Then, a week later, two of the games that I loved just stopped working one day.  About a month ago, not a single app would open up.  Then the tablet kept turning off.  A couple of days later it just wouldn't turn on anymore.  My mom's Coby crashed days after mine and hers was only about a month old.  I feel so bad for buying it for my mom.  She is really disappointed.  I should have taken the money I wasted on my Coby and put it towards an iPad.  I'm done with cheap tablets!  Maybe I can afford an iPad by the end of the year :(  I would give this product 0 stars if possible!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the money", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "R32JUF28F8MENV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet for a kid learning to use technology.  Remember - you are paying well under a hundred bucks for it!Good grief people - it's obvious that you can't access Google Play.  GetJar has quite a few app's and if you are smart enough you can get the Amazon App Store installed and get darn near everything you need via Amazon.  It's real difficult to get the Amazon App Store.  You go to GetJar, search for \"Amazon\" and you will be rewarded with several app's sponsored by Amazon. Don't forget to click the \"download\" button too. You also need a microSDHC card.  They are about $25.  Move all the app's you can from the tablet to the memory card and you won't run out of space.  Again, for under a hundred bucks, 3 hours of battery life isn't bad.  I'm not sure if people are expecting iPad quality but this is really a decent starter tablet for kids, or if you aren't sure if you need or want a tablet - this is a great one to start with.  This is a great deal for the $.The only issue I have with it is that it occasionally loses connection to my wireless network.  It comes back in a few seconds but it is irritating when it happens.

I was scared of buying it at first cos it might come with a defect, but then I think it is a very good investment I made. The price is great. But beware that, if you buy it with the leather case keyboard, the keyboard does not connect directly to the tablet cos the tablet lacks a USB port. You will have to buy a separate $1 port (which was included in the combo)to properly connect both.
