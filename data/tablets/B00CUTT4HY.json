But there were a lot of glitches. Not all my content got delivered, I couldn't delete from device, I had Japanese Kanji on my keyboard etc.... Frustrated, I put the Kindle & myself to bed. In the morning, I couldn't find the mayday button, couldn't get the Kindle to recognize my internet connection (which it had the night before)etc. Having purchased the 1st generation of each Kindle device made, I was ticked. Finally, was able to connect, through the \"help\" tab in Settings (which is not as easy to find as in older Kindle Fire) But, lo & behold, I got connected fairly quickly to Heather, a live Mayday tech. She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed. She had me \"update\" the system. And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered. During the update, the Kindle had disconnected from Mayday Heather, but when I tried Mayday again, I got Heather again( :-) )  and this time with video feed. She was very easy going, calm, relaxed and very skillful, & not in a hurry to disconnect. A very unexpected bonus to the new device.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loved the HDX but had to choose another tablet UPDATED", "Author": "Chris E Nordyke", "ReviewID": "RYYOJCB8SSM0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATED 5/28/14 ON BOTTOM OF REVIEW:I LOVE this tablet, and I really wanted it to be my choice.  Sadly, it was not to be.  I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.  Here are the HDX's pros & con's and a footnote of why I ultimately chose another one.PROS ~AMAZING picture quality.  Color conformity was the best of any of the tablets in the running.  The Nexus 7 was a very close second but the HDX's black level added more depth.  Interestingly, you lose some of that brilliance if you go up from the 7 to the 8.9.Sound was the best of all tested models.  Excellent volume, base and clarity.The on/off & volume buttons take a little getting used to, but the dimensions and solid feeling of the device help you get used to their unusual placement.  I appreciated the non-slick, rubbery feel of the HDX's covering.The Mayday feature is a great addition, and I think other companies should follow suit.  I saved myself a lot of time just by asking them a 20 second question that might have taken me 10 minutes to find searching the web.The front camera was the hands down best out of the tested competition.  It looked like a regular camera picture.  Actually, if you could figure out how to maneuver it, good camera shots could be taken with the front camera.Connectivity to everything Amazon based was, of course,  excellent.The Silk browser works smoothly, but I missed features of other browsers.The sale price is 229 for a 32gb model was great.CONS ~The blue/purple \"frame\" around every white screen is not acceptable, should not have to be \"worked around\" and is definitely NOT normal, no matter how much Amazon wants you to think it is...I really do love Amazon, but I couldn't shake this Orwellian feeling that Amazon was Big Brother & the Mayday button was put there to spy on us. :-)  Seriously though, they lack flexibility and are \"android based\" but not a fully functional android.  Picture a bird with some feathers clipped so they can't fly.If I fully understood what it meant to have NO access to Google play store, I would have considered more carefully.  It's not like comparing apples to oranges.  Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.  Yes, they are trying to improve their app library, but they have a LONG way to go.  On a side note, I found it frustrating to not be able to use the same apps as my friends & family.Although the readability initially seems great (esp if you go to black with white writing to ignore the purple frame), you don't want to compare it with the HDX 8.9.  Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked \"dirty\" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).  I kept checking the 7's settings to make certain it wasn't on sepia.IN A NUTSHELL ~I wanted to choose the HDX, loved the movie experience on it, albeit at 7 inches.  It felt wonderful to hold & performed almost seamlessly.  But I could not overcome the flaws in our relationship.I want to read books on a crisp white screen with no blue/purple border.I want access to ALL things android, apps, browsers, features, not just \"Amazon android\".I finally settled on a very close second with the Nexus 7.  I'm still getting used to the feel of it but a case makes it feel sturdier. I did, however, have no trouble getting used to having all those endless apps available to me again.Hope you all find joy this season in your tablet search!UPDATE 5/28/14Well, I returned the Kindle and kept the Nexus. After awhile I missed the Kindle so much that I bought another one on a huge sale day. I LOVE my Kindle, accept it's limitations and do the unavailable android things I need to do on my phone.The Nexus became the teenagers tablet. It never felt \"good\" in my hands. After 6 months it died. Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept. But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet. No updates either. I had to hunt it down online to find out that it's status was \"still in repair\".If it were MY tablet and not my teens, I'd be going nuts. ;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy with it, especially for the price", "Author": "MichaelB", "ReviewID": "R2Y0383TNKPC18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was debating between Ipad mini and this HDX 7. My home computer is a Mac and my music, contacts and calendar are all on the Mac. I read by eBooks on Kindle touch and like to watch Amazon prime movies. So I am sort of in two worlds. At the end of the day I opted to give this a try based upon price (I got the 15% off price when Amazon had the FAA thank you special). So what do I think, well if you are used to Mac products it is hard to beat their ease of use and how you just plug it in and all your stuff automatically synchs up. The Kindle fire took me a bit to organize and set up although it was nice that all of my books came over from my Touch to the HDX, although they are placed in the Cloud and you have to download the ones you want on your device. Also any books you set up yourself go to your documents tab and not the books tab. I dealt with calendar problem by exporting Ical into Google calendar which does automatically import to the HDX calendar. I was sort of annoyed that you had to buy basic applications that come with an Ipad such as clock and notepad. Since there are several options for these you have to hunt around, read reviews etc. Also - \"free aps\" all come with ads, which is sort of annoying so I would recommend you consider getting the \"upgraded versions\" to avoid ads. Several people have complained about the light blue border on the reader - I noticed it but got quickly used to it and it does not bother me. Watching movies works for me - the 7\" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane. Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.

My fault for not fully understanding its limitations But...", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1EMZBVAQM3X7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/11/14 Update:Having had the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" for a couple of months now, my experience with this device has me convinced that there are much better options available a within the same price range.I'll go over some of the ground that I wrote in my full review below, but feel those things that I do go over are important considerations in determining whether or not the Kindle will work for you so I'll be going over the most important points here as well.First off the display.While the display looks great in general, I am a little disappointed with the brightness of the display when outdoors. I do not have another tab to use as a reference to compare it with other right now, but when comparing my cellphone (which is at least as bright as the Kindle) it seems to me they could have done something to improve the lighting for outdoors. The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video. When I have used it to watch movies or TV provided using Netflix or my Prime Membership, I've found that video sometimes lags. The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device. I have 3 computers at home and a Blue Ray player that all stream Prime Instant video, and none of the other devices have similar issues. Let me rephrase that comment. I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has. Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective. Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices. This means the Kindle will not stream other media from sources. For instance I have an account with Google where I have about 130 Gigs of music stored. My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats. Though it is a competitor of Amazons Google Play does not block or redirect when you try to access media stored elsewhere. Amazon on the other hand has blocked or diverted most other devices using the Android UI or Android variant from accessing Prime Instant Video. I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked. Yes I can access Netflix, and YouTube. There are some sites where the Kindle will either lock up, or be redirected somewhere else. BTW YouTube streams pretty well, but not as smoothly as my 2 year old Droid does though.So four month over all opinion of the Kindle, is that it that if you want a semi-flexible E-Reader this might be a good choice for you. In my case I've found the Kindle to be too limited and it's fallen short of my expectations, and that's even comparing it to my cellphone. The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised. It does play some games well, but it has more limitations than implied (the 32GB or larger versions might be able to handle graphics better but...) It will stream Amazons Prime or Netflix Video pretty well, but music outside of Amazons services is a problem. The fact that Amazon begins charging to store music on their site after a certain point seems ridiculous, and they do drop music that you've purchased from their site unless you purchase more space. I feel that Amazon charging to store music that you've bought from them is greedy, but especially since other sites (sites like Google Play) allow free uploading and storage huge amounts of personal music and media.5/11/14...When I decided to purchase the Kindle HDX. I had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while I was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks. And seeing the current price and purchasing options available the Kindle HDX seemed to be an easy choice to me.  Even with my thinking I understood the tablets limitations.The things that attracted me to the Kindle HDX tab, were the processor, it's 4 G LTE compatibility with Verizon, and the fact that I am an Amazon Prime member. I had read that Amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership I was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet. But that was a mistake on my part. I was thinking I would be able to access the movies that I purchased online with Amazons instant video, and expected to be able to access the 128 gigs of music I have stored on Google Play\", but Google Play media will not load on my Kindle HDX. Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.  There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations). But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing. So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there. Personally I feel the additional $25 is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindle and considering my Prime membership, and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music Amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont.Here are the things I like about the current Kindle HDX Verizon compatible version.1. The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2. The variables in personal settings, make the device easy to personalize.3. The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1. The fact that the device does not support storage expansion. It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2. The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3. The Lack of even a mini USB port. Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family? Only if they were a member of Amazons Prime services and fully understood its limitations, including storage and the area support of their carrier.So over all, for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with Wi-Fi and who have good 4 G coverage the Kindle would probably be an OK purchase. But only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet. Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage. 16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10). Then tablet not supporting SanDisk memory expansion (which seems contrived to me), leaves the user too dependent on Amazons premium services for my tastes.(Update 4/14/14) The packet blocking used to keep people tied to Amazons Media Content (or at least their Music App) needs to be removed. In my review above, I mentioned that I have had issues accessing my music stored on My Google Play Music site. But at that time I wasn't sure that this was my being impatient, not waiting for the site to load completely even though I did wait for five minutes, or if it was Amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services. More recently I found that when trying to access my music on the Google site I was redirected to  the \" My Books Recommendations\". I believe the Kindle site offers better deals, and has a wider selection than Googles offerings, but Googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution (320 Kbps vs. the 190-240 Kbps at Amazon). More over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites (that are either free or that do not charge what Amazon does for their \"Premium Cloud Services\").As someone else has mentioned in their review of the Kindle. Amazon has included adds on the Kindle HDX that are not present on other tablets (even basic inexpensive Android tablets do not have invasive adds). If I pay Amazon another fee I understand I can have those adds removed. But all of these fees really add up, and it seems to me that since I've already paid for this device, these additional fee's, and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal. Who Gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature!At this point I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for. The idea of an e-reader with expanded abilities is one thing, but to advertise the Kindle HDX as a tablet able to compete with an I-Pad, and then throw things like site redirection, packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish I had purchased anything other than this device.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Oh dear sweet baby Jesus...I'm in love!", "Author": "HotMessPrincess", "ReviewID": "RGGLLVVS9K0E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can I just say that I love this new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (64 gig) so much that I'd make out with it if I wasn't persnickety about getting drool on the glass?Where to start...First, I should confess my sins. Last May, I abandoned my first generation Kindle Fire for a brief affair with an Asus Google Nexus tablet. Sure, it was good looking and seemed to work just fine but in the end it left me feeling empty and cold...and feeling guilty for cheating on Amazon just because there's no Microsoft OneNote app available for Kindle. Four months of very little Amazon love had me begging to come back - and when the HDX was announced, I found my chance and grabbed one. I'll learn to love the Evernote app instead of OneNote, but please never separate me from Amazon again. \u00a2\u00beThe display is breathtakingly sharp and beautiful. It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was. Hubby caught me staring at it with my yap wide open, a frozen expression of awe on my face. (I think he might have been a little too happy to find me speechless.)The sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device. I really didn't think there would be much difference between the Google 7 tablet mentioned above and the Kindle Fire HDX but there is a HUGE difference. I'm so glad. This little bad boy puts all other tablets to shame. When the sound started playing out the speakers I flipped it over and started looking for them...I have no idea why or what I expected to find, but the amazing quality of sound blew me away. It was almost surround sound-ish, if you know what I mean.The Fire works the same as I remember with my first one. There's a carousel containing your most recently viewed content and a favorites section below. I wish there was a way to store my content in categories like the old Kindle Keyboard. I miss being able to put all my reference books together, all my fiction together, and so on - but I'm told that there's a software update coming in mid-November that will allow us to do just that. Again...I love you, Amazon!I bought the Fire with ads on it, which isn't like it sounds at all. There are no pop ups in the middle of what you're reading/doing/watching. The screensaver provides suggestions is all. That's it. And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already. I actually like it...because I might miss something otherwise. It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always. Amazon is truly a customer friendly company and I will never stray again. I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers. This is the best purchase I've made all year.

It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right. It's the best tablet to consume Amazon content (along with the larger 8.9\" Fire HDX tablet) and one of the two best 7\" tablets for the price (along with the Google Nexus 7).At the end of the review, I compare the HDX to two other tablets you might be considering, which are the newest version of the Kindle Fire HD and newest version of the Google Nexus 7.If you own the previous version of the Fire HD and are thinking of upgrading, the two main differences are the HDX eliminated the HDMI port and added the ability the download some Prime movies and TV shows. If you are happy with your Fire HD, unless you really need to download movies and TV shows, I don't think there are enough improvements in the HDX to warrant buying it.The Fire HDX is primarily designed to use content from Amazon, like videos and books. If you have a Prime membership, you also have access to all the free Prime videos, many of which you can now download, instead of only streaming them.  However, Amazon's app selection is weak. So make sure you check that the apps you want are available from Amazon before buying this tablet.SETUP - Some people have complained about having difficulty setting up some of the older Kindle tablets. For me, the setup of the Fire HDX was quick and easy. It only took a minute or two to get going, then I entered in my Amazon account information and I was good to go. No problems at all.SIZE AND WEIGHT AND HOLDABILITY - At 7.3\" x 5.0\" x .35\", it's one of the smallest 7\" tablets.  At only 10.7 ounces, it's light enough to hold for extended periods of time. The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen. The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7\" tablet I've tried.  I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness. So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used. The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black. I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back. I would prefer them in the front. In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough. The sound quality is decent, but nothing special.WI-FI STRENGTH - The Fire HDX has two Wi-Fi antennas which are supposed to give it better Wi-Fi connectivity than most other devices that have only one antenna. I walked around my house with the HDX, the Nexus 7, and two cell phones and the HDX usually had one more bar of signal strength than the other three devices did.When close to my router, all the devices were able to load websites at about the same speed. When I was much farther away from the router, the HDX had a slight speed advantage.ON/OFF BUTTON - The On/Off button is on the back of the tablet on the left side. It's located pretty close to where I put my hand when I'm holding the tablet.  I have already accidentally turned the tablet off three times. Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.  I think that having the On/Off button on either the front or the side, like most tablets do, would have been much better.Some tablets and smart phones have an On/Off button that needs to be held down for 1 or 2 seconds in order to turn off. Not this tablet. Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side. That didn't bother me as much, because I don't need to change the volume that often. And even if I hit it accidentally and make the volume go up or down, that is a lot less annoying than accidentally hitting the On/Off switch and turning the tablet off in the middle of reading a book or watching a movie.DOWNLOAD AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS - AWESOME!In my opinion, this is the best thing that Amazon has added to their new HDX and HD tablets. In the past, if you wanted to download a movie or TV show, you had to buy it. But now you can download some Prime movies and TV shows and watch them when you aren't connected to the internet. They stay on your tablet for 30 days, at which point Amazon deletes them whether or not you've watched them. (If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be aware that Amazon has not secured the download rights to all Prime movies. In fact, only about 30% of the Prime movies I wanted to download were downloadable. But there are still plenty to choose from. Also, quite a few TV shows that are a few years old can be downloaded for free.The internet at my house is somewhat flaky, always seeming to cut out for a minute or two right at the most exciting part of a movie. Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download. That way, I never have to worry about the streaming being interrupted. So I don't find the new ability to download Prime videos only useful on the road. I will be using it at home as well.EASE OF USE - I think that Kindles are the easiest tablets to use.  The top row on the home screen has options like \"Books\"  \"Music\"  \"Videos\"  and \"Web.\"  Even if you've never used a tablet before, as long as you can read, you can figure it out.Amazon is making a big deal about their new Mayday customer service that will bring a live person onto the screen of your Kindle HDX to teach you where things are and how to use the tablet. It's an interesting idea, but I don't think most people will need it. This tablet is pretty easy to figure out by yourself.BLUETOOTH - The HDX has Bluetooth and it works fine. I don't know what else to say about it.SPECIAL OFFERS - If you are worried that \"special offers\" means you are consistently bombarded with ads, don't worry. An ad only appears one time when you turn the tablet on.  As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads. (Hopefully Amazon doesn't change this down the road and start bombarding me with ads.)PARENTAL CONTROLS - There are a few different ways parents can restrict their kids' use, like limiting them to a certain amount of time, or restricting certain categories, like video games for example.APPS - On a Kindle, apps should be spelled \"oops.\" As in \"Oops, there aren't very many of them.\" Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think \"10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty.\" Well, that depends.  Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle. If you thought it would be available, but after buying the HDX you find out it isn't, you probably won't be too happy.So double check Amazon's app selection before buying this tablet.OTHER DOWNSIDES - The HDMI port that existed in the previous Kindle HD no longer exists.  (I say \"previous\" because the current Kindle HD also doesn't have an HDMI port.)  The HDMI port was useful to show videos from your tablet on your TV. Instead of using an HDMI cable, the Fire HDX now has the ability to mirror your tablet screen to Miracast enabled TVs and devices. I don't have Miracast anything, so that isn't helping me. Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it. Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video. I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33 GB) of storage per hour. So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download. Once again, this is a just a rough estimate, because other standard definition videos may take up a little more or a little less MB per hour.FIRE HDX vs FIRE HD  (THE NEW HD, NOT THE OLD HD)The HDX is a fraction of an inch smaller and 1.5 ounces lighter than the HD. The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800). With movies and books I couldn't tell the difference. Both tablets looked equally great. The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet. Trying to squeeze all, or most, of a web page into a 7\" screen makes the text pretty small, and the HDX did a better job than the HD of making small text very crisp and easy to read. Although I must say that the HD was still pretty good.The HDX has a camera and microphone and the HD doesn't. Even if you don't plan on taking photos or videos, the lack of a camera and mic means you can't do any kind of internet calling, like Skype, for example.The HDX has the new \"Mayday\" feature which lets you contact Amazon customer service right from the screen of your tablet. The HD doesn't have this.The HDX has a faster processor. I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.  The HDX is probably better than the HD for playing video games. However, since I'm not into video games, that's something I didn't try on either tablet.The HDX comes in either WiFi or WiFi/4G versions, while the HD only has a WiFi version.Some people think that only the HDX has the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos, but actually both tablets can do that.FIRE HDX vs GOOGLE NEXUS 7  (THE NEW 2013 VERSION)The hardware is similar. Same screen resolution (1920 x 1200), about the same weight, and both have a camera and a mic.The Nexus 7 is taller and narrower than the HDX, which makes the Nexus 7 slightly easier to hold in one hand. (By \"one hand\" I mean with your thumb on one side and your 4 fingers on the other side.)The Fire HDX has a faster processor, but I didn't notice a difference in speed when actually using the tablets. The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera. The Nexus 7 has GPS and the Fire HDX doesn't.But I think that the most important differences are what you can do with it.The main features that the Fire HDX has that the Nexus 7 doesn't - The HDX has the Mayday customer support feature and the ability to download Amazon Prime Videos.The main feature that the Nexus 7 has that the Fire HDX doesn't - The Nexus 7 has all the apps in the Google Play store, as well as GPS.So you'll have to decide what's more important to you. Amazon Prime Videos in general and the ability to download them in particular?  Or the ability to use every Android app that exists as well as GPS?CONCLUSIONThe Fire HDX is a very good tablet. It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right. All its missing is GPS, a camera on the back, and about 1 million Android apps.Why did I buy the Fire HDX? Well, I already have a very nice Android phone, which has a camera on the back and GPS. I always have my phone with me, so if I need to use GPS or an app, I do that on my phone. I don't need GPS or a bunch of apps on my tablet.I bought the Fire HDX because it's better than my phone for watching videos, reading books, and browsing the internet. Throw in the fact that I can now download lots of Prime movies and TV shows, and I'm happy with this tablet.But before buying this tablet, or any Kindle tablet for that matter, you should make sure that the apps you need are available on the Kindle. There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use. The other major Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tablets and the Google Nexus 7, have all those apps, while Kindles only have a fraction of them.If you want a high-quality tablet for watching videos, playing music, reading books and magazines, and going online, this tablet will work fine. But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazon has outdone themselves!", "Author": "wanda", "ReviewID": "RBJ4GF80COQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third KF - I had the first and second versions of the non HD Fire.This new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is simply amazing. I'm going to give my first impressions of this great device and will probably add to this review in the coming weeks.First off, please do your research before you buy a tablet of any kind. If you like Apple products, by all means, fork over the extra $100 plus and get an iPad mini. If you don't like a device, don't waste time trashing it just because it's not your preference. If you are looking for a blazing fast, easy to use, easy to fall in love with device - look no further than the Kindle Fire HDX  :-)I purchased this as an upgrade to my gen 2 Kindle Fire mainly because I wanted to use Bluetooth speakers. Once I started reading about all of other upgrades, I couldn't wait to pre order this one. Here are a few of the improvements I have noticed so far.It's sooo much lighter than the older KF! I have some issues with my grip, thumb dexterity etc and this new Kindle is so much easier to carry and hold while reading. My new Kindle has 4x the storage and is about 4 ounces lighter - it may not seem like much difference, but it is!The web browser is greatly improved over older Silk versions. I had sideloaded Dolphin on my older KF, just because it worked so much better than Silk. I still put Dolphin on this one, but don't use it nearly as much - mainly for those sites that rely on Flash.HDX display is awesome!! I thought my older KF had a great display but this new one is so gorgeous. I never had an original HD Kindle, so I can't compare that, but X must be better, right?? :-)  I like the Houzz app and the pictures are so clear, you feel like you could walk into the rooms. I enjoy watching older TV shows on my Kindle and even those old black and white programs look better on this screen.Reading is such a pleasure on this device. The lighter weight and sharp display are great for books. I read about 5 books a week, both print and digital, and I think I will be reading more on my Kindle than before. I started to time the download speed for a book, but it was so quick I didn't have time to start my stopwatch. It was a shorter book (about 200 pages), but talk about fast!The quad core processor is very, very fast. I don't have the fastest home wi-fi and my other devices sometimes get hung up while trying to download or play videos. The KF HDX has had no problem at all. I have streamed Netflix, Amazon Video and used the Watch ABC app with no trouble at all. I have the wi fi hotspot feature on my  phone and this Kindle connected fine and was still fast on that connection.This device responds so quickly, it's scary.The camera is nice, but I don't really use it much. I did take a picture of my cat and it looked great :-). If you Skype or video chat, I am certain that it will meet your needs.I read one reviewer's statement that they miss having GPS on the new KF. I very rarely used it on my older KF and don't miss it on this one at all. I have Google Maps and Navigation on my phone if I need directions. I figure we get tracked enough already, so no biggie for me.The speakers are great, of course. I'm not a big music critic and generally an AM/FM radio is enough for me. My husband is a big music lover and he gave his approval to the sound, so I know they must be good :-).  I use a bluetooth speaker when I watch movies or TV, but even without a speaker you won't have any trouble with the sound on here.Amazon Appstore vs Google Play - some people have very strong feelings about the app choice on Amazon and I do have a couple of apps that I sideloaded (Dolphin and Olive Tree Bible). I have an Android phone so I know that Google may have more choice than Amazon, but I don't think it's a deal breaker. It's very easy to sideload apps, just search online. I prefer Amazon even on my phone. Again, it's a matter of doing your research and making an informed decision.I am very pleased with my new Kindle. You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Purchase, Fully Recommend", "Author": "I Shop Too Much", "ReviewID": "R2QJ79PRC99V0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first glance the Kindle Fire HDX is everything I had wanted, not to say that it still is not what I wanted...mostly.The Kindle Fire HDX earns a stable 4/5 stars, if it were out of ten however; it'd be a clear 7/10.*Device & Apps*The device itself is fantastic, the speed of the Linux OS mixed with the 2.2 GHz quad-processor really does make this the fastest 7\" tablet I've seen, there is no doubt about it.  In the weeks I've had the tablet, the speed has been great, for the device.Now to caveat that, the apps are where this tablet falls short.  I would say a good 30% of the time, an app will just crash and need to have the process stopped in Apps Manager and then restarted.  Furthermore, the apps store when compared to Apple/Play Store supplied with an iPad or Google tablet are very lacking.  Half the apps I've had in the past I cannot even find, or they have yet to be updated for the Kindle store.*Display & Sound*The screen is literally crystal clear, and with its true HD 1080p (1920x1200 323ppi) display the HD movies I watch are actually HD and look fantastic.The sound system with virtual 5.1 surround sound I will say isn't all it is chalked up to be.  The volume controls are rather annoying to be completely honest.  One click up or down is a drastic change in volume, the sort to where one click is too loud and then the next is too quiet.  I use my Klipsch headphones with my Kindle, so for me this isn't an issue.  I did feel like it should be mentioned to potential buyers though.*Build & Battery*I love the design of the Kindle Fire HDX, the buttons being placed on the back make it very smooth looking.  I have accidentally hit the sleep button once or twice, but this isn't a design flaw to me, so merits no penalty.The battery life I'd say is the biggest hitter in this review.  Amazon boasts an impressive 11 hour mixed use (could mean a lot of things) and 17 hours while only reading.  I cannot attest to the honesty of the ladder boast, because I haven't ONLY used my tablet for 17 hours of reading and not without charging every couple days.  The former however, I can say that 11 hours is a stretch.  Maybe \"mixed use\" means reading a book and watching a film on a long international flight with no internet connection?  I could see 11 hours for that, possibly.  I consider \"mixed use\" to mean, use of the internet, and while running apps and music.  With this I can say I've had my tablet die from between 5-8 hours, very far from 11.  I've come to the point where an extra battery pack is likely to be a early next year purchase.*NOTES*Amazon \"Mayday\" service is brilliant; I had to use it three times in the first week.  Every call was answered within 15 seconds (as they boast) and the technicians were helpful enough with taking over the tablet and doing the work for me.  I'm sure as with all customer service, they start with reading off a script, but in the end they fixed my issues and I was very satisfied with the help and automatic availability of a technician.I do not have the \"blue edge\" or \"yellow tones\" so many other reviewers have stated.  So I am not sure if this was fixed with a model update or I just got lucky.  Either way it doesn't exist, so I can't complain.*Price & Recommendation*The price is more than realistic for this device, and better yet, worth the investment.Whether you're looking to get your first tablet, or looking to get an upgrade, this is likely for you.  I am happy with the new Kindle Fire HDX and besides the apps malfunctions and seemingly shortened battery life, it was a good purchase.The Kindle Fire HDX is a firm \"yes\" from this reviewer and my final recommendation would be not to read too many low reviews, because most the time they are by angry people that expect perfection out of the box.  If you get a malfunctioning device, return it and get a new one.  Just because the one was bad, DOES NOT mean that the tablet itself isn't worth getting.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now Great For Web Browsing!

Each of them has been good for videos, books, and music.  And this device does better than ever before in each of those categories:  the screen is sharper, the unit is lighter, and the battery lasts longer.But what is really impressive to me is how much the web browsing experience has improved.  I became frustrated with previous Kindle Fire models when trying to browse.  This version fixes that.  The web performance is quite good, even with multiple tabs open to non-mobile-optimized pages.I also really like the new \"mirror your screen\" functionality.  I have used this component to interface with a non-Miracast TV that has an open HDMI port:  NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display AdapterIt works as advertised (which means really, really well).  Does not seem to drop any frames, even when watching a high-def movie, or when playing games.Finally, the Mayday feature is very slick.  I used this feature to ask an agent which Miracast-HDMI interface to get.  They said on the Mayday call that any of them would work, and they don't have a specific recommendation.  If I have any future questions about the device, I will not hesitate to use the Mayday feature.All in all, it is amazing to me that you can buy a quad core, high def, touch screen tablet like this for $229.

I opine Amazon's OS for the Kindle Fire HDX barely scratches the surface of the underlying Android Jelly-Bean possibilities (and I purchased the 64GB version to get around the lack of expandability, and plan to keep app installing minimal for this). So, here I am clarifying that my high rating centers around how well this device is serving my intended purposes as a 7-inch Amazon-app-in-tablet-form (heheh).I could tell from reading Amazon's product description that far from all the Amazon Prime videos would be available for download (due to licensing)--still, I imagined I'd likely find enough to entertain overnight during necessarily increasingly frequent visits to shut-in tech-phobic relatives. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a greater number and variety of downloadable vids than I had expected.So far, I am relieved to read most of the negative reviews concern the number of downloads available (versus other folks' expectations and/or needs) and/or complain about the blue/purple haze/glow around the display edge--that my eyes saw instead as a faint yellowish page background within a brighter border. The tinge isn't distracting to me, but I can imagine others being bothered--one person's OK is another's annoyance.The wall adapter and usb-to-micro-usb cord that came with mine work OK now, but the coating on the cord feels stiff, like it might get brittle and crack off sooner or later (I hope later, if it must), so I'll wait and see. Another adapter and cord (bought from an AT&T; Store) that I use for an older android tablet works fine with this, of course.So far, wifi connecting and re-connecting have worked trouble-free on my device. The Netflix app has worked OK for me, too, but I didn't plan on using this for that service (much).The Mayday \"buton\" brought help almost instantly, but I realized after a few moments of chat I was seeking and not finding a feature included with Paperwhite, not this (oops). Anyway, I hereby report I tried Mayday and it worked--as advertised, a friendly talking face appeared quickly in the lower right and even demonstrated jotting on the screen to point out stuff.HMMM: When the tablet is in the magnetic case and I have the creased case-cover folded back flat behind the screen, the display will very occasionally turn off suddenly, I've noticed, especially when I'm shifting my grip awkwardly or changing the orientation back and forth indecisively--but moving the cover again slightly or tapping the power button brings the (special offer) lock-screen back...and so it goes...a weirdness.UPDATE: The seemingly random occasional display shutoff/sleeping (despite setting the display to stay on an hour) appears to happen ONLY when I hold the side AND then happen to cover over (with my thumb) a spot next to the camera. Since I quit doing that, it stopped going dark suddenly and unpredictably (before the shutoff period was up)...So...still weird, but whatever.HMMM, again: I've locked the thing up twice, so far, probably by switching rapidly among menus/apps/this&that; impatiently while learning what's where: once it restarted (maybe rebooted?) spontaneously and once I restarted it (not rebooted). This hasn't happened again, since I've calmed down--I suspect that app interactions, electronic \"traffic jamming\" and Android-quirkiness unavoidably multi-cause this freezing/shutting-down every now and then. If it were happening often, I would suppose I'd received a defective unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, because it's happened only twice, thus far. At least once/day I do turn this off, on purpose, BTW, because I've discovered my other Androids function better ongoingly when I do.Mainly I bought this to serve as a mini-entertainment center, to combine with noise-cancelling headphones and help me down-out loud voices and blaring noises within wifi-deprived venues I must visit more and more for who knows how long. My smartphone can provide wifi for my ultrabook for shorter periods (to minimize too-expensive wireless data use) when it turns out I need Internet access though a larger screen during these jaunts.UPDATE--MAYBE WORTH MENTIONING--because it could annoy some folks seriously: Menus and settings are super-sparse compared to my other (closer to stock) Android devices. Also, the back arrow doesn't take me to the app I was just using--I must go home first. Maybe there are compatible apps to fill in the blanks (switching between apps or customizing more settings)--but I haven't looked for any yet because I am finding the simplicity refreshing, so far.Anyway, I may revise or add on later, but just now I can report I'm pretty pleased overall. I don't feel like subtracting a star for anything I've mentioned so far--which all seems to me (based on experience and research) rather typical for tablets, usb cords and wall adapters in general, but which I realize could be deal-breakers for others with different needs, purposes and standards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work.

Your mileage may vary, but be extremely careful if you need to side-load anything to your Kindle using the Android Transfer App.* There is currently no way to easily download all of your music from the Amazon Cloud, which led me to the previous bullet point- - - - - - -The biggest issue I have observed is bringing your music from your Amazon cloud down to the device.  It is a slow process.  This led me to attempt side-loading, but the support for side-loading is subpar.  I have not had a good experience in downloading my music, nor with using Google's Android Transfer App.  Amazon should step-up their support in these aspects.Overall, this tablet meets my needs and I enjoy using it.  The sound is superb, which makes it a great music device once your music is actually on the device.  The cloud streaming is also excellent.  If you will always have access to wifi, then you may have no need of downloading your music and media.You cannot find a better value in a tablet than a Kindle Fire.

I also have a paperwhite and the outgoing HD (also 7\"). I loved the old HD, but it had one fatal flaw: the inability to highlight across pages. Other than that problem it was beautiful to hold, if a little heavy; good to look at if there isn't back light. Many have complained about the near invisibility of the on/off switch and volume knobs on the outgoing model. I say, \"true, but at least they're out of the way.\"  In the new model you run into them much more frequently, it's not terrible, but more of an issue than on the outgoing model.So how about the other elements I mentioned. First, the hdx fixes the problem of highlighting across pages--as does the new hd. The text quality is improved with higher dpi, and that helps with readability. However the new sharp angles, and more critically the dramatically embossed amazon on the back makes actually holding the the thing unpleasant, the old hd was smooth across the back.The blue fringe problem is an issue. It's less of a problem as you increase brightness, but at low brightness level it does impinge on the text.Weirdnesses: the usb and phone ports are at odd angles to the body that makes using them awkward.(Edit: Whatever problem Amazon was having with Adobe Reader now is fixed: This paragraph no longer is true) PDF handling. The default pdf reader remains useless for academic work. On the old Kindle HD you could load for free the Adobe Reader which was a very high quality app. On the new HDX the situation is harder. You need to (1) side load Adobe Reader and--this is new--(2) launch Adobe Reader through ES File Explorer! The machine refuses to create an icon on home/carousel. You can run it, but not easily.It's slightly lighter than the old HD, but still not as good as the paperwhite; the screen is just as reflective as the old model; so if you work in bright lights, you'll still want to get an e-paper reader rather than this.Finally, compared to the HD and the paperwhite this is just unstable. I had 2 crashes (leading to a reboot) from the kindle reader (just changing pages!). I'm hoping the soon-to-be release helps with this.I appreciate many of the features of the new machine, but Amazon giveth and taketh away.

This is a silly answer as it disrupts the experience so badly and makes reading on the device nearly impossible. This is the same type of shenanigans Amazon pulled with the Paperwhite. An obvious defect becomes something they intended. Don't believe it. I have never seen a tablet (or almost any other device) where you can see the backlight around the edges.

The buttons are placed on the back of the Kindle HDX and more often than not I have to rotate the tablet a couple of times to locate the power button.Another thing I just cannot get over is the Special Offers version 16 GB model. Everytime I turn on the device an Advertisement for some random Amazon product greets me. I find this a bit annoying. As a huge advocate of online privacy, I do not like this type of marketing scheme especially for the price of $230. The Nexus 7 (2013) costs exactly $230 without ads or added bloatware. I have actually seen deeper holiday discounts on the Nexus 7 (2013) than the Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased my Nexus 7 last week at Staples for $180. Similar discounts are available with a quick search of DealNews.com or Slickdeals.com.The Amazon App Store is lacking many products that a college student like I use on a day to day basis. For example: Skydrive, Black Board Learn, Gmail, Youtube, Falcon Pro (Twitter client), and Outlook 360. (This is not Amazon's fault its up to developers)Comparing the Accessories for both tablets. Amazon seems to have a monopoly on the cases because I was not able to find cheap cases for the Kindle Fire HDX. Ebay and Amazon have excellent hard ergonomic covers for the Nexus 7 for less than $10. Amazon is selling a case for its Fire HDX for $50. The cheapest case I could find for it was $20 from Belkin and that product did not really protect it.In closing the Kindle Fire HDX is not worth the price of $230. The one thing is has going for it is the actual Kindle side of it. I read Mockingjay on it and enjoyed holding the device in my hand. It is light enough that your hand never gets tired of holding it. I will return this item and exchange for a lower version of the Kindle family that is strictly for reading.In comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 (2013) default reading apps, i was able to read ebooks easier on the Kindle Fire but PDF's were much easier to read on the Nexus 7 which now uses QuickOffice as an out of the box reader. The QuickOffice app had more settings to adjust large PDF files and customize the text color and background. I was amazed the Kindle Fire did not have these options available. As any college student will tell you, professors are out of their minds and assign scholarly articles from JSTOR or Google Scholar that are 30 to 50 pages in length. Quick Office is better suited to handle the articles with a few adjustments and minimum annoyance.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great while it lasted....:-( Hopefully will be reunited soon?", "Author": "forney", "ReviewID": "R2V6LZB4JHSCLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I caved in with the 15% recently given off and decided to upgrade my first generation kindle fire.First impression...WOW, this blew the first generation away by far.  Lighter, nicer feeling, gorgeous screen, fast web experience, no more problems switching between portrait and landscape AND MY FAVORITE being available to download prime content directly on fire. Sometimes, when time permits, at my Job it can be pretty mundane, fixing pdf links etc in abobe; So I can now just downloaded comedy central stand up right on my fire (FREE WITH PRIME) and im pretty much LOL'ing all over the place...(I think my co-workers think I am mental :-))......this is seriously fun and a nice lunch break activity (Try Nova, its awesome)with the downloadable vids.Sadly after two beautiful days my fire at 50% died and wont turn back on....contacted customer service and it was confirmed I got a lemon. After a 40 min conversation with amazon, they are sending me a new fire with 2 day shipping.  A little disappointed about them not expediting it with one day...I mean I was seriously like a little kid at Christmas playing with it non-stop, it was/is a great improved experience when comparing to my 1st gen.  Hopefully my second tablet will be free of any quality issues.  I understand ALL electronics, even apple products, have lemons so I will update this review upon further review.  I am just sad at this inconvenience and was wishing for 1 day shipping or a credit to the app store....I mean this is why im a prime member after all (hehe :-))On a last note I got the 64GB fire and Im glad I did.  Downloading HD content takes up ALOT of space OK a 48min episode of Intervention takes up a little over 3GB.  Thankfully there's multiple downloading options that could make the great HD 3GB video into a fine 720 experience making this same file at around 1GB.My advise...  1) Wait for another promotion Christmas is around  the bend and I would be surprised if they don't offer  another 15% day.  2) Splurge on the highest storage that you will need (compared to apples storage upgrade cost 599 for a 64GB mini Ipad when after tax mine was 278 with the 15% discount ($356 difference including sales tax)  3) If you have rewards with a Credit card use them (makes me feel better when making purchases like these with \"free money\"  4) Pretty much accept the fact that for the next week or two after you receive your kindle (If its not a dud) your mind will be blown and you will have no life other than with your new fireThat's all for now....and that's my 2 cents...if your on the fence try it...with amazon prime its AMAZINGoh and I forgot #5)...If you cant stop drinking the apple juice why bother buying the hxd and then posting a 1 star review because its not an ipad...its meant to be a media device and really excels at this...seriously if you fit into this category Stop it, its annoying and that's being really kind at bestHave fun, be kind and enjoy life :-)", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet, Not So Great An E-Reader", "Author": "Makeever \"mackeever\"", "ReviewID": "R15B5Y73FOZHTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In comparing this to my 2012 Kindle Fire HD: it's a much faster and better tablet, but I was disappointed in the e-reader.

This is the first time that I have been unhappy with my purchase.I traded in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 in order to \"upgrade\" to this model only to learn that the key feature that made me love the Kindle Fire so much has been removed by Amazon. Previously, you had the option to enable text to speech within just about any Kindle Book. It was quite convenient to click on the \"play\" button while in a book and hear the device read to you as your eyes move down the page. Quite an immersive experience! To take it a step further, you had the option to purchase the professionally narrated audio book (if available for the title) and take the experience to a whole 'nother level. Now, the only option is to purchase the audiobook to enjoy the same functionality. In the interest of full disclosure, with the HDX, you have the ability to turn on text to speech from the system settings, but then the Kindle reads EVERYTHING that displays on any screen, meaning websites, menu settings, etc. That is extremely annoying!One other thing that really bothered me was the screen issue that many are reporting. The entire edge of the screen was brighter than the rest making for a distracting reading experience when in a book.I ended up returning the HDX and buying another HD 8.9.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "don't buy it", "Author": "Ian Eppard", "ReviewID": "R3HGXQS0IC3YZ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The commercial says all this stuff about how it's better than the iPad air.

Faster, smoother and better than earlier versions", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "RALWCKMXLE1DZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Each generation of the Kindle Fire 7\" tablet gets better than the previous iteration, and this one is no exception. It is not revolutionary, the way that the 1st generation Kindle Fire was when it was introduced in September 2011, but it's a great example of good product evolution.Picked up the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" during one of the December promotions after seeing the 'Try Risk Free' sidebars on the product page. Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:\u25c6 Likes:+ Excellent 7\" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10\u00bd ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences\u25c6 On the Fence:\u00b1 Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to\u25c6 Dislikes:- None encountered\u25c6 Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7\" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10\u00bd ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.\u25c6 In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.\u25c6 Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.\u25c6 Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.\u25c6 Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.\u25c6 Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW \u25aa 12/31/2013", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service Experience of My Life", "Author": "Jeffrey hubbard", "ReviewID": "R3DY6GOGW9WK5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After spending the extra money on 2 day shipping and being assured by the customer service rep that the product will arrive in two days I ordered the product... flash forward to five days later the product finally arrived, but that is where my real troubles began. The kindle refused to turn on when I hit the power button so I held the power button nothing. I tapped the power button a couple times not response I held it again, so on and so forth for about 5 minutes until it sprang to life and relief flooded across my body. This relief was short lived through because only 10 minutes into having the product on after going through all of the initial set up the screen went blank. I called up kindle support and was transferred around about 3 times before I found someone remotely competent. They went through some steps and determined that my brand new out of the box Kindle was broken already! they said they were going to express ship the product. When the shipping information appeared on my account it said that it would be shipped in 4 business days, I don't know about you but 4 days is about double what should be considered express shipping. But I patiently waited, on the 4th day when it hadn't arrived I called the shipping company and they explained the estimate was wrong and it will be taking 5 business days to receive the product which just added to my excitement. When the product finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it turned on much more easily. Well pleasantly surprised until I tried to register my device. When I tried it would not let me register it, yet again I wade neck deep into the sea of incompetence that is Amazon customer service to find out that because they do not know how to properly ship a product and it took longer than 2 days to be received they went out and on their own reported it lost or stolen which is essence bricked my kindle. the process of reversing the problem took over an hour and was the worst hassle on the phone I have ever had.

So a little background on me, I work internationally and bought three KF HDX 7\" for my three daughters.  One of the main reasons I got them the tablets is so that they can Skype with me while I am out of the country.After an hour of troubleshooting with the tech rep (which was probably the fastest response I have ever gotten from technical support), we were able to get Skype going in the parental section of the tablets.  However the plan for me is that the kids will never be in that section of the tablet.  I have subscribed to the Kindle FreeTime App and this is the only additional app that I have added to this section.Another two hours with another tech rep, and I am still not able to use Skype while in the FreeTime mode.  Currently the problem is being escalated up to another level of tech support.  This very issue is common on all three Kindles that are sitting in front of me.Other than this one issue, I would have to give the tablet a clear 5 star as it is as described by Amazon.  And with tech support like they are offering, the other tablet manufacturers had better watch and learn.Edit:  Got a call from Amazon Customer care and it seem that their engineers are aware that Skype is one of the Apps that conflicts with the settings of the FreeTime environment and as such causes the App to crash.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

Wertz \"Imautobot\"", "ReviewID": "R1EQCALRS6SF8F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really really wanted to like this Kindle.  I bought it as a upgrade from a 2012 Google Nexus 7.  This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by my other Android devices.If Kindle allows Google apps to be able to be installed through a front-door option, I would gladly revisit the Kindle hardware, it is still a nice piece of equipment.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "BW", "ReviewID": "R3RNX9T9Q4CDCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded to the HDX from the HD.

I read on my device a lot and it is very noticeable (and I feel quite distracting) in both the black-on-white and brown-on-sepia settings.  On my device the bleed is noticeable all the way around and is wider on the long sides (measures about 1/4 of an inch) but thinner (about 1/8 of an inch) on the short sides.  I used the Mayday button (which is a really nifty feature, by the way) and was told that this was normal and that there was nothing I could do about it.  I find this pretty disappointing, but it isn't a deal-breaker for me - I'm not going to reject it and return it for a refund due to the blue haze issue (though if they manage to come up with some sort of update that would fix/improve it, I'd be the first to get that update!).That said, I'd still recommend this tablet to people - particularly if they use it more for non-reading activities.

I am well pleased with the new device. The graphics are amazing whether watching Prime or You Tube videos as well as viewing web sites or playing games. The new processor is extremely snappy and executes loading and running apps very fast. I have no issue with the blue haze issue on the edge of the display. I understand the reasons for the blue LED use and accept Amazons explanation. It is a non issue, really. I read quite a bit on the Kindle HDX on a plain white screen then a sepia screen and was not distracted. Again, it is on the very edges where no text appears. It is nonexistent on videos, dark backgrounds, etc. I did try the Mayday function with a question and it was promptly answered and frankly, this is a really progressive implementation of customer service/tech support. Very nice job Amazon. The curated appstore is obviously not as complete as Google Play but has anything important and then some. I do not feel the need to sideload apps whatsoever. The essentials are more than covered and then some. For the record I also own the Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen and think these are two great devices. I'm fully invested in the Amazon ecosystem with books, MP3's, apps and videos and like having a dedicated device. The Nexus 7 can do all the same things by running Amazon Apps except there is no App for Amazon Instant Video. The IOS (ipad, iphone) has such an app, but not android. All told I have the best of both worlds and didn't break the bank to do so. If you are on the fence I don't think you can lose either way. The biggest differences are No Google Play on the Fire HDX, and no Amazon Instant Video on the Nexus 7. Faster quad core processor on the Fire HDX and brighter screen on the Nexus 7. There is a sense of community with Amazon that is really an intangible and keeps me loyal to this company. Not to mention the great shopping experience with Prime, although this has nothing to do with the tablet. You'll like the Kindle Fire HDX. It is a fast and responsive device.After using the Fire HDX for a week I am discovering that there is a compatibility issue with certain apps that I used on my Kindle Fire HD but will not run on the Fire HDX. Two apps in particular, Tune in Radio and Optimum TV app cannot run on the HDX. I am awaiting an update of the app or the HDX to remedy this. Hopefully this is a temporary situation.

I have until the 22nd of November to return it for a refund, and if nothing goes wrong I won't be coming back to subtract stars.  The reason for my weariness is because I had to send the first on back due to issues and here they are:  1st everyone else and their Grandma was complaining about the blue or purple haze around the edge of the white page when you're reading.  I noticed that on mine as well but honestly it's not that noticeable and not distracting at least to me.  There are varying opinions even among the techs at amazon I spoke with as to whether this is intended or a flaw.  2nd while I was reading, the page would blank out for a second or two once in a long while.  That I didn't like.  3d Another issue was the fact that certain parts of my screen where sluggish to respond to touch.  That tore it and I had to exchange it.  I spoke with tech support through the mayday function, but all I got was a picture and no video like they said.There was an update that would not download, and I had the device for 2 days.  All that time the update bar never moved.One thing that surprised me was the cheap packaging the first kindle arrived in.  It came in a cushioned mailing envelope and the kindle was sliding around inside.  I thought that was kind of a cheesy way to ship a $300.00 device, and I was happy to see that yesterday when my new one arrived it came in a very well cushioned sturdy box which I appreciated a lot more than the cheesy cushioned envelope the first one came in.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the issues I was having were due to the kindle being banged around by ups personnel playing football with it.  As usual Amazon was very cooperative and they rushed me another one in a couple of days.  I received the new one yesterday, and I still see the blue haze around the page, but like I said that doesn't bother me.  I usually read with the black backdrop and white letters in any case.  Everything else on this one is running smoothly so far, but it's on probation.  I'm giving it 5 stars because so far everything on it works like it's supposed to.  I used the mayday function on it a couple of times and it only took a few seconds for a live video of the tech to pop up on my screen which I found pretty cool and very helpful.  So far I find it to be a 5 star device, but like I said, I'm going to give it a month and see if I have to come back and change my review or not.  I'm hoping not because I really like it, and hope it stays like it is.  The high definition is amazing, and so far the only thing I haven't tried is the Skype function due to the fact that I don't feel like blowing more money on something I really don't need because you have to purchase time with them like you would with a cell phone company.  Something to consider maybe in the future.  I opted for the one with the ads but they don't bother me in the least, and you only see them when you are turning your device on.  I also have the one with the 64 gbs which is a definite improvement over my first generation kindle which this one is replacing.Overall I think it's a great device, and I've checked out ipads, and I'm glad I've got this instead of one of the overpriced super hyped ipads.  You're on probation kindle HDX until the 22nd of November!  Ok, here it is November 7th, and I've had my new kindle now for a while and I just thought I'd come back and add something I don't like about it.  I thought of subtracting a star because of these two reasons, but the good outweigh the bad (at least in my opinion) and here are the two reasons why I almost subtracted a star:First there is no light indicating when your kindle is fully charged.  You have to turn your kindle on to see if it's finished charging.  Why get rid of the light indicator?  Did it really take up that much space?Second: Why are the speakers in the back and not in the front?  It sounds a hell of a lot better when you turn your kindle backwards and listen to it.  Then you can't see the video.  Come on Amazon!  You've made a killer device and it could have been a lot better by adding a charge indicator light and moving the speakers to where they should be!

Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine.

The 2.2 quad core processor really shows its power in this tablet as webpages load lightning fast and he apps like candy crush are smooth with no lag whatsoever. You also have access to all of your cloud content such as your Amazon prime music and your Amazon prime video library. The speakers on this unit is something I must talk about they are the best I have ever seen on any tablet ever. Even though this is a 7 inch tablet the speakers sound like those found on 10 inch or higher tablet they are exceptional and have yet to be beat. Others have commented on a blue haze around the borders of white pages it is a little noticeable but it is nothing to be worried about as it is very faint and easily overlooked.

Over a series of lost Mayday sessions (lost connection), phone conversations, clearing device in multiple ways (then reconfiguring), rebooting router and shutting down all other connections to phones, tablets and laptops....nothing changed.  The final answer I was given was that the router we have does not have the capacity to supply enough bandwidth to support the Kindle's browser.  Not sure I believe it, but I will go back to a brand I know my router can support.Too bad.  I was impressed with the interface, video quality and options for apps and downloads.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R27WLATCO02ZHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went to a local electronics to buy the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and was \"talked into\" a Samsung 16GB Galaxy Tab 3 8\" tablet. I took it home, started set up and started downloading the apps I wanted from Google Play. Being an iPod owner, Apple had spoiled me to its user-friendly interface. I own a PC, so I didn't think it would be such a hassle, but BOY was I wrong. After an hour, I still had less than 10 apps downloaded , and the speed of the downloads was a snail's pace, along with YouTube and Netflix buffering every 10 seconds. I was sick with my purchase and took it back the next day to get what I wanted in the first place... the Kindle! I'll try to compare it to my brief experience with the Galaxy and my 4+ years with the iPod Touch 4.1.  Speed.  Kindle rivals the iPod. It's 2.2GHz quad-core processor is a speed king. The Galaxy Tab 3 only has a 1.5GHz dual core. You wouldn't think those little numbers would make such a difference, but they do.2.  Ease of Use. Another way the Kindle is similar to the iPod.  The UI for the Kindle is less cluttered and complicated than the Galaxy (and other Android devices I've seen in the stores). I realize the Kindle runs essentially on an Android platform, but Amazon made it as smooth and user-friendly as possible.(As a side note... the Samsung reps inside the store pushed the Galaxy 3 Tab with the following features that the Kindle does NOT have... rear 5MP camera, microSD expandable storage, multi/split window screen accessibility, and screen-mirroring--which would require a $70 device to control your TV with your device. All I can say is that those amazing features don't mean squat if the user experience with the interface is lousy.)3. Size and Feel. The Kindle HDX has a 7\" screen, It's about the same weight as the 8\" Galaxy I originally bought, but the difference is the FEEL.  The beveled edges and thicker casing make it ergonomically-friendly without feeling too bulky. The back has an almost \"rubberized\" feel, so it doesn't slip around in your hands. Here, it outshines the iPod/iPad and the Galaxy, whose backs are slick (metal or plastic), and both are VERY thin.  I found it difficult to hold the 8\" Galaxy in bed comfortably to read, no matter whether it was oriented for landscape or portrait.4. App Availability and Store Navigation.  Here, the iPad would win. Apple is known for its amazing apps, and Android seems to \"catch up\" at best. Not all the apps in the regular Android (now Google Play) Store are available in Kindle's App Store (which are actually Android apps), but the most popular ones are there. I have read about people \"sideloading\" missing apps into their Kindles from other third-party sites, though. If there were an app that I just couldn't live without, it would be worth a try. Kindle's App Store is very easy to navigate. It reminds me a lot of Apple's.  I will say that I like how there is a video preview of many apps in the Google App Store. But sadly, with the Galaxy, I could never get the preview to work.5. Screen Resolution. The Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad with retina display would be pretty close in comparison. The Kindle's colors are vivid, crisp, and sharp. And while some people would argue that the human eye can only process so much, I can say that my 30-something-year-old eyes which need glasses can notice a sizable difference between the Kindle and the Galaxy. The Galaxy's color was nice, but the resolution was not as good, and even my poor eyes could tell.  I can see the \"blue lines\" many people complain about in the new Kindle Fire HDX, but I only notice it on books with white pages (sepia color or night mode is fine), and it is not distracting to me at all. It's not a deal-breaker, and it only seems to show up on the edges.6. Price. The Kindle is the clear winner here. I purchased mine on sale for $199, and the 8\" Galaxy Tab3 was $269. A more comparable 7-inch, 8GB Galaxy was $139, but all the other specs were sub-par (especially the resolution and processor speed). The iPad Mini with retina display is closer in spec comparison, but totes a $399 price (the regular, non-retina iPad Mini is $299).Above all, remember this: If you go to an electronics store, beware of reps from companies inside the store. The Samsung guys were all over the tablet section of my local store like hounds pushing their products. I should have been smarter from the beginning and gone with a clear winner rather than something I knew little about. If you want a tortoise-slow, buggy tablet that will frustrate you in the first day with its failure to load apps or stream videos in a reasonable time frame, try a Samsung or similar Android device. If you want a winner with a smooth interface and a great price point, go with the Kindle. If your money grows on trees and is no object, by all means, buy the iPad Mini. For now, the Kindle is my choice, and I am so glad I returned the overpriced Samsung I tolerated for less than a day.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much for so little!", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "R3OJUKKVEKI95B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a powerful tablet, just the right size to carry around with you without being too bulky.

I am absolutely in love with my new kindle fire hdx.Google Play issue:The main complaint for people is that being an android device, it doesn't have access to google play. Ridiculous right? Well, those people are kind of wrong. You can download them at 1mobile as apks and install them, but make sure that you change the settings to allow the apps(apks) to be installed from a non-amazon source. I installed so many apps from the google store available on 1mobile. You can even google them for apks and install them and they will work because this kindle is running on android. For example, i downloaded and ran dropbox without a problem. You can even sideload or root the device for the actual google play store.Speed:Apps open up quickly and the screen also rotates to landscape almost instantaneously. This baby is extremely fast due to the 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, with Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Although sometimes, the app store does lag. Amazon probably needs to improve that aspect. The Silk browser is pretty amazing. Comparable to google chrome I would say.

The HD screen provides a beautiful canvas to watch movies on netflix, play games, read manga, go on social media. When i played with the kindle in the store, the screen was just breathtaking.

Worst thing is when I re-downloaded all my apps I lost all my scores that were on my old kinde. Like Scrabble is at zero.  Angry Birds is like I never played ever. Amazon said they can't do anything about that.  I also paid for the Eagle in Angry Birds Rio and that is also not transferrable.  Again, not a big deal.  I set it to charge at 1:30 at 60% and it is at 100% 2 hours later.  I miss the colored on/off button showing the charging (green and orange).  You have to turn the unit on to see how much charging is there.  When I used the camera zooming disturbs the pixels so I am not excited about that but I am not a big picture taker with cell phones or tablets anyway.  Plus the 7\" only has a front camera anyway.One thing that is a gripe is that each time they come out with a new kindle you have to purchase a new cover because they (I think on purpose) reposition things so they do not line up with your present cover.  Keeps the people that make covers in business I suppose.  At least the charger for the old Kindle fits the new Kindle so I have an extra to keep in my suitcase.All in all, I am very pleased.

I've had it for a tad over 4 months now, and it's awesome.  I love bragging about the Specs, since they are inarguably the best specs available on a tablet of this size, and this price range.  It feels great to know you have the best.  Sometimes, I wish I had the Play Store, but most popular apps are available on Amazon's app store, so most of the time, I don't really miss it.  It's extremely easy to sideload apps that aren't available on the app store anyway. I love the Free App per Day program on the app store, where they offer a different (normally paid) app for free, every single day.  Sometimes it's stuff you won't really use, but every once in a while there are jewels that you can't pass up.  I've only used MayDay a couple of times, but those times I've used it, it's been awesome, and Amazon Customer service never seizes to disappoint me.  The only issue that I've had (and the one that I mistakenly requested a replacement unit for), is that when the battery gets under 30%, the screen tends to flicker just slightly, almost like a CRT screen.  After describing this to a mayday agent (before I realized it only happened on low battery), they kindly sent me through to customer service to get a replacement unit.

I'm writing this on my wife's account, and it's really her Fire, but I'm hearing the input she has and it's nothing but praise.Truthfully, if we didn't have some specific things we do with the tablet, we might have gone with another brand; probably a Nexus 7. It turns out, though, that our needs are very specific and they have a lot to do with doing business with Amazon. Here's our list of deal breaker priorities:1. She wants to simply browse the internet while she's sitting and watching TV. Does the Fire come with the best browser? Probably not, but it comes with a very credible one. I looked into it and found that I could install Chrome if she wanted, but she's very happy with Amazon's silk. No need to change browsers.2.She checks her email using her Fire when we're on the road. I usually hog the laptop so she uses the Fire to check email. I bought the fire having no idea that the newer versions have Bluetooth. I checked the Bluetooth against an old Bluetooth mouse and it seems to work great. Now we're considering buying a Bluetooth keyboard for her to use on the road just to use for returning more detailed emails and maybe some minor editing of some of our writing too. This wasn't on the \"deal breaker\" list, or even on the list at all, but it turns out to be a nice bonus.3. Finally, and this is the primary deal breaker because the above two items could be accomplished by any number of tablets. We have a reasonable investment in digital media purchased from Amazon. We really like the way Amazon has things set up with their Unbox program for PCs and so on. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't provide a player for their movies and TV shows on iPad or even other other Android tablets. So for viewing movies and TV shows from Amazon, especially off line like we like to do when we're away from the internet, it's either a Microsoft Surface (using Windows 8 and the Amazon Unbox player) or a Fire. The Surface looks promising, but it's kind of expensive when we have such a small and specific list of needs.I've found that Amazon seems to consistently  sell their media for a bit cheaper than most other sources. I like (trust) their cloud storage, and already have a sizable investment in their products. Given all these factors, it was looking like the new 7\" Fire HDX was a good choice.We have an old 1st generation Fire that she was using for all the above. The Silk browser was pretty quirky and pretty slow but sort of worked. In our home in Angel fire, New Mexico, where we have only satellite internet and really slow latency (long ping times), the Fire was almost unusable.The new Fire is like night and day. It's leaps and bounds better than the old one, and the old one was a good buy when we got it. My wife is pleased as punch with the new Fire for our needs, which admittedly are very specific. We believe there's no reason to spend more money for stuff we don't need and we should buy our products tailored to fit our specific needs. Given that we each have Kindle Paperwhite readers, hundreds of books plus lots of TV shows and movies, and that we've never had a bad experience with Amazon, we're comfortable adding another Fire to our inventory of readers. It's just a great fit for us.As for the old Fire, it's now mine. I don't use it for browsing or email, or even for watching movies although it worked pretty good for that. What I do is send documents over to read offline, usually technical reading I get on the internet related to Photoshop, Wordpress, and a few other topics. I then send those pages and documents over to the Fire to read off line. The Fire - even the old one - is a great tablet for reading documents that are read indoors and have color illustrations, like Photoshop tutorials and so on.So for us, it couldn't have been a better choiceDonald Finkhiddenmesa.com", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "WiFi Connectivity", "Author": "John Oldenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2D4NDXAQYOGTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I do not own this particular unit.

I didn't want to spend $500 on a table when in a year or two they will make a new version and your will be outdated.  The screen is so nice and beautiful when watching movie and tv on hd.  It look just as good or even better than my hd tv at home.  The apps load very fast like almost instant to just a few second.  Surfing the web is also fast as well when your shopping online and I do like it that it is so light that I can hold it in one hand so your hand won't get tired quickly.The pro:- super fast (on WiFi) (must be even faster on 4G)- graphic is excellent (good for movie and games)- very light which you can hold longer without tired your handThe con:- only has front camera- no memory slot (if you need more memory, buy the 32GB or 64GB which is like $40 or $80 more) (which I think it pricy compare to buying a memory card)- there is not a lot of good apps compare to iTunes and google play. (I was hoping to find a better GPS app)Overall, I am very happy with my kindle fire hdx.  I got the 32GB with special offer.  By the way, some people paid $15 just to remove the ad.  To me, the ad is not in my way at all.  It only there when the screen is lock due to inactivity, but after you unlock the screen, it will not be there any more.

I opened a magazine and could read it without expanding the text which I couldn't do with the original Fire. I also found the sound quality excellent. The browser is very fast. I've viewed videos and had no problem with dropped WiFi connections; this was a problem with the Original Fire.While I still prefer my PW for reading, since the HDX is a new toy, I've been reading on it all week and found the reading experience enjoyable. In regard to the blue haze, I'm not sure I would have noticed it if I hadn't read about it. I can see it when I read an ebook and am looking for it. However, it doesn't bother me at all.My husband, who has an iPad, is very impressed with my HDX.  This is a great little tablet at a great price.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Happy Medium", "Author": "J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZF0QJKD88D1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 11/2/2013:  My family has been thoroughly enjoying our Kindle Fire HDX.  We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.  Overall, this is a great tablet with a seamlessly enjoyable user experience.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great media and reading device", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2YZWS556VG4V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using an iPad received as a gift a few years ago, I was sold on a multi-use device...I gave my Nook Color to my father and hooked him on ereading! Then out came the iPad mini...just way too much for a perfect size. I literally carry my reader with me everywhere. So I began looking for a smaller device that was more economical. As I had hundreds of Kindle books versus Nook books, I chose the Kindle Fire HD. It works great and will be going to my daughter now...why did I get the new version? I liked that I could download from Amazon Prime...It is a little thinner and just a tad wider so it doesn't fit into a Kindle Fire HD case...odd...but that's okay.I did not have any issues with booting it up and receiving my media onto the device. I didn't even notice the blue haze around the edges...had to look for it after reading the reviews...seriously, folks are upset about that? I have never used the Paperwhite version so perhaps if I had I might have noticed it more.It is a little lighter in weight which is easier on my hands. Part of that I am sure is because the case is also slightly smaller.My only complaint, such as it is, the same as many others, I would like to see Amazon integrate with Google Play more. There are some fun apps I would like to have, such as themes for my background. That is a minor concern, just one of those nice-to-have options.

Something not addressed is the lack of HDMI and the inclusion of Miracast.I like it the HDX. What I don't like that there is no micro- HDMI so I took off 1 star for this. I really liked being able to plug into any screen to watch movies, etc. Now we have Miracast which is unproven and seemingly being forced on us by Amazon. There's not alot of options and if I want my TV's to work I need to buy at least 3 adapters.My question is specific to the Miracast function. Has anyone used a dongle to use the Miracast function? If so what product did you use? Amazon support not to helpful as the Indian call center does not even know the differences between the HD and HDX. I finally got to speak to someone in the U.S. and they sent me to this page http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201370390 where they recommend the Netgear option.Updated 10/25/13I officially miss my micro HDMI. I set up the aforementioned NetGear which does what it says and was the recommended product by Amazon. Good (not excellent) overall picture quality when watching videos, but there is some lag especially when you have to transmit to the Netgear and download simultaneously. This may be better if you took 30 minutes to download a movie 1st, but i have yet to test this. This current hardware spec running through micro HDMI would have been outstanding in my opinion. Miracast is OK, and I'm sure future tech releases will solve latency issues.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace. Who knows if my next will be any better - I hope so.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "Dawn R.

I originally bought my kindle so that I could play my amazon instant videos on the go without having to lug my xbox or laptop around.  I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

You can actually feel the the buttons for the volume and to turn it off which is fantastic compared to the HD. I actually painted dots on the HD to be able to tell where the buttons were and what they were for. With the HDX you feel 2 buttons on one side and one on the other side to turn it off. The Graphic's are better on the HDX but unless you have the HDX and the HD side by side you may not notice. HDX is thinner and lighter then the HD and that is noticeable. Now for the con's I have found so far..I have found for certain music my HD has better sound and volume, other music it is reversed.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faster, brighter, lighter, better!", "Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

I have Amazon Prime and if your sole purpose for owning a tablet is to watch movies and shop online at Amazon, then THIS is the tablet for you.  iPad Mini and the Nexus don't compare to this Kindle for these purpose.However, there are downsides that became dealbreakers for me which led me to make the decision to return it.Dealbreaker #1:  The web experience is very sloppy.  It's not as smooth as the iPad Mini.Dealbreaker #2:  The camera quality sucks.  When using Skype, the picture quality is dark and very grainy. And, there's only one camera.Dealbreaker #3:  Your home movies do play on it.  But there is no easy way to rewind or fast forward smoothly.

I've also wanted to upgrade my Kindle Touch, which seemed very slow to me, response-wise. With iPad being pricey the kindle seemed like a natural choice. I considered getting the paperwhite, but thought a little extra would get me a lot more. I underestimated myself.As an e-reader this kindle does what you expect and more. I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great.

When Kindle Fire came out he bought one of those. Loved it. Bought my daughter the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas when they came out (she's not in the home so I don't count hers as being in our home). My husband then bought the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". He watches videos on it all of the time. Amazon had a special around Super Bowl time so I bought the Kindle Fire HDX with 4G. Love it. It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down. This doesn't bother me because my iPhone and laptops have frozen also. There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation. I would really love to have Adobe Flash because some sites only use Flash for their videos, and one of those sites I pay $$ yearly to watch videos (yoga) but can't on the HDX, but I can on the Kindle Fire HD. I think that it is not Amazon's fault that Flash is not available on the Kindle, it has something to do with Adobe.When I took my new Kindle to Verizon they told me that the Kindle doesn't have 4G. Had to explain that it did. So then the guy tried to connect it - and it worked. He was VERY excited. He was telling all the other associates that Kindle has a 4G tablet. None of them knew. One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great. I've never used another brand, but I have watched others use theirs and I really don't see much difference, except maybe for the apps. And right now I have the apps I use.There is one negative to this device. It doesn't like to charge on any chargers/cables except the \"Kindle\" brand. It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "good tablet, enjoy reading on it, but always room for improvement", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R3PIYIOQB0BC3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so excited to order this tablet. I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it.

I was unsure, wondering if the reported flaws were consistant throughout it's lifespan. But I will say now that I've had a chance to play around with it, it really is an incredible piece of technology, especially for people who are new to tablets and want to get their feet wet.As the case with the Kindle Fire HD, the HDX has a forked variation of android. This means that they are slower to update and their choice of apps will be limited. But this doesn't really mean that it's a terrible downside, especially since you have more access to amazon features, something that most android tablets do not provide enough of. The user interface itself is fairly easy to navigate, but limited in customization due to it's OS being heavily modified by amazon. As mentioned previously, if you are new to tablets, you can't go wrong with the HDX, in either of it's models. If you aren't used to technology in general, then this tablet will be perfect for you. It teaches you how to operate the tablet, which swipes do what and so forth. If that doesn't convince you, then the new mayday might do the job. When you press this button, you can communicate with a member of amazon's technical support team who can temporarily take control of your tablet to show you how to get from point a to point b. The difference between stock android and the modified android OS (aka Fire OS 3.0 as amazon calls it) are obvious, starting with the carousel. The carousel itself is a tray of apps and media that you use or prefer to use the most. Though I do love it, my only complaint is that I wish I could modify what gets added to it, so I could have more control over it. Below the carousel are your installed apps, which I absolutely adore, especially since stock android forces you into multi-home screen configuration (which I hate).The choice of apps may be few, but the selection of media is massive to say the least. If you live in north america, then you may know from experience that some videos, books, and music simply aren't available in the google play store. I have to be honest though, I never really did care much for google play's selection of apps, so having a limited selection really isn't that bad. Amazon offers a free app of the day though, so whatever app that is offered for free may vary from a free to paid variation. So downloading it will mean that you will have that app forever if you snag it. So the answer to the question \"what do you get out of the amazon ecosystem?\" is this, their entire cache of media, which is nearly perfect. Some movies and episodes might only be available for rent, but that is still more then what you get with google play. Let's be honest here, when you are buying a tablet, you aren't buying it for what isn't available in another person, but what is available to you. With amazon's x-ray, any x-ray enabled song gives you access to it's lyrics. X-Ray enabled movies and television episodes give you access to which actors play what and things of that sort, allowing you to find out who that one actor is through the help of IMDB. Books give you access to characters and which parts of the story they might show up in and so on. Keep inmind that while HD, HDX and paperwhite owners will find themselves enjoying x-ray, non-amazon tablets do not have this feature. If you have prime, then you will find yourself with the option to download prime-enabled movies and episodes. Having access to prime's library really is something to write home about, especially if you can't stand netflix. I have yet to fully test out the prime-enabled features, but I can safely say that prime owners will LOVE the HDX. The downside to this is that you can only download a handful of their videos (in my experience). But never the less, instant video is still a worthwhile feature to consider for prime members.If you have access to children of any sort (be they through babysitting or your own grandchildren), then freetime will be the answer to some of your problems. You can grant them special limited access to the tablet, which can be very helpful I'd imagine. But considering that I don't have kids nor do I babysit, I wouldn't know. So this is strictly up to you in how you prefer freetime. Playing a song, reading an e-book, or watching a movie is what the HDX is designed for. It offers incredible HD-quality graphics and stunning audio to make your experiences enjoyable. With specifications that are equal to what the nexus 7 offers and considering that there is a 64gb varient (which I own), it is the perfect media-consumption tablet to bring with you on vacation.If you use the internet frequently enough, then you will have nothing to fear! The HDX has a decent email client and web browser (aka silk). Silk is comparable to the stock android browser and should you not want to use the various side-loaded youtube apps, you can still access youtube via Silk and the quality does not suffer in the slightest. The email client does what any email client should and sticks to it, checking and deleting emails. Though I will admit there is a lack of \"select all emails\" option, but this hardly matters to me. Being able to check my email is all I prefer. The calender (or day planner if you prefer) is simple and to the point, proving that not every feature has to come with forty or fifty functions.If you choose not to pay that extra 30.00 to remove special features, you are treated to a lockscreen with ads. I understand that should you pay to remove the ads, you are treated to a handful of features. But having ads on my kindle is nice, since it gives me access to new sales and I like to save money if I can help it.In the end, if you like stock android and long for it's customizability, then don't get an HDX. An HDX is for one group of people, fans of the amazon ecosystem, people who are aware of it not being similar to a stock android tablet and are fine with it. This tablet does well at what it was designed for, media consumption. Which honestly, is something that I prefer to be honest. I have a nexus 7 here and it didn't offer HALF of the functions that are found on an HDX. There is no having to pay over 20.00 to fix the problems present in stock android and thanks to mirror cast, you can use your HDX to stream movies to any mirror cast-enabled device.

I have an older 32GB Fire HD, and the reading light has none of this blue/purple tinge. Before ordering this unit, I contacted customer service and was told that the problem existed only on a small number of units, and that I could replace the unit if the problem occurred. When I received the unit, the problem was very apparent, and I have decided to simply return the unit and order the newer Kindle Fire HD 7\", which uses white light LED. I would have preferred to replace it with my older generation Kindle Fire HD 7\", a more enhanced unit, but Amazon no longer sells that model. Since first writing this review I have received the newer Kindle Fire HD 16gb, and there is no blue haze on the unit. I do not miss the camera, microphone, and auto adjust brightness features.

I only mention this because a lot of people don't know they can read Kindle books on their laptop or desktop computer or Android or other devices. ___My favorite feature of the Kindle is the ability to get online and check on stuff such as email, facebook, Google+, various websites and even read USA Today if you want to check on the leading stories.Its size and portability give it an edge over a laptop.  So much easier and handier to carry.Its screen size give it an edge over a smart phone.  Everything is easier to see plus you can enlarge the view by dragging diagonally outwards on the screen.The reason I got the 4G LTE version is that I spend a lot of time where Wi Fi isn't available.  You need the ability to get online when you are out in the field and not at a wi-fi hotspot.-- My personal recommendation is to go with Verizon.  When it comes to 4G  I have found ATT just doesn't cut it in a lot of places. I found this out years ago when I made the mistake of getting a laptop modem that plugged into the USB outlet on the side of my computer.  I had been very happy with a Verizon 3G but thought I would upgrade to an ATT 4G.The ATT laptop modem was very slow...  almost as slow as dial up when it was out in rural areas.  It did OK hooked up to a Wi-Fi hotspot but wasn't worth much when it came to using the ATT wireless network.  Checking reviews after I bought the modem showed others had the same problem.I hope this review might help you if you have been thinking about upgrading your Kindle or getting your first one.

You have little or no control over the information they can access on your kindle or amazon.  It seems to me that Amazon does not value the privacy of our personal information. Some Apps even make you agree to allow them to share PERSONAL INFORMATION with other advertisers and \"partners\" before allowing you to install.  If you don\u2019t agree, you cannot install.  The Facebook Application terms that are levied by amazon/Facebook are egregious, so I won\u2019t install that app.The Special offers are not so special...Basically they hold your screen saver hostage with advertisements and movie promos.  If you want to remove them, it will cost you a fee.  (I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.

I haven't found those too annoying - I just swipe past them, but still it's worth it to me to not deal with them.  I'd say this is a must if you're a Prime member as well.

The Kindle is an INCREDIBLE tool for readers - and for those who may be averse to picking up a paperback. I honestly never thought of myself as an avid novel reader, but this gadget has totally changed that and I look forward to the breaks where I get to read. My only problem now is finding more great books to read! (For the record I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed these books on my kindle: Night Film (Marisha Pessl), World War Z (Max Brooks), Zone One (Colson Whitehead). I also read an advance copy of my sister's book, which I had read before but enjoyed even more on second reading on the kindle (another excellent tool -- your kindle can convert a PDF into a Kindle doc! So Cool! All you need to do is email the PDF to your kindle email with the word \"CONVERT\" in the subject, and voila! It shows up in your \"Docs\" as a Kindle-version of the PDF which is much easier read and navigated than a PDF). So, in short WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS THING NOW!***I was a little hesitant buying this having been a tried and true Apple fan. First though, I should explain that you REALLY want to buy this without the special offers. It's a little more money, but if you DON'T pay the extra, you see ads on the home screen every time you open up the device. So yeah, pay the extra to get rid of thes ads.As for the device itself, it is FAST. Like, the fastest operating system of anything in our house including my MacBook Pro, iPad or any of our iPhones. I LOVE reading on it too. The screen doesn't make your eyes ache like the iPad, and the text is really easy and clear to read. It is also super duper light weight.The only downside I've seen so far is there is no integration with Chromecast, which would be awesome.Overall though, really impressed with this little device, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond. Also typing was wonky.Most of the navigation worries seem to be a thing of the past.* It's nice and loud.Here is what bothers me a little :* Charging port is horrible. It goes in on an upward angle. Does not feel or look stable.Makes me wonder WHY is it designed like that.* Battery life is less than the previous model(2012 Kindle fire HD) Does not last long on standby.* I wish the power button and the volume were NOT located on the back of the HDX.

She then said hold on.Her screen went from a live shot of her to a graphic of a pair of headphones.Then another voice started talking to me.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

Harbour", "ReviewID": "R1DFMDLJ5LLNGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About fifteen years ago I had a Dell Inspiron that caught on fire and melted. Yes, I was one of those with the bad battery. I received such poor customer service that I went out and replaced the Dell with the Apple PowerBook, their main competitor at the time. And, I never looked back. I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps. And Apple made millions off of the apps. Then came the followers with cheap, poorly made tablets to try and compete and each got smacked down in the process.So here I am with a first generation iPad, yes you read that right \u2014 first gen, and I\u2019m looking to upgrade. I\u2019m thinking the new iPad mini because I want a smaller form factor for flights. It\u2019s before Christmas and I\u2019m in BJ\u2019s. The Christmas lights are blinking and everything is warm and bright. I spy an Amazon Kindle Fire on sale for $99. That\u2019s interesting I think and I move along with the tasks at hand. The thought sticks in my mind and I start investigating the Kindle line. I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member. I take a hard look at how I use the iPad. Email, check. Browse the web, check. Watch some movies, check. But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

Firstly I will address the many issues people tend to have with this device and comment on my personal situation.Wifi - Setting up Wifi at first was a little shotty as my router had to be reset a couple of times to allow it to access the kindle. At random times it seems like it drops wifi but this happens infrequently and isnt all that annoying unless it is during a video.Blue Tint - This is noticeable on my device on white screens but perhaps I wouldnt have even seen it hadnt I read so many reviews on it. It really doesnt bother me all that much and I turn the kindle to dark view when reading anyways. Unless yours is really bad I think this is just people nitpicking.Battery - So far it has been pretty strong. I watched a lot of media on this device and I have seen it last anywhere from 7-12 hours. I have noticed it depends on strength of wifi and screen brightness mostly. I watched 4 episodes of Justified last night and it only dropped about 25-30%.App Store - This is one of those things that people can research pretty indepthly before purchasing the device, so why people complain about it is beyond me. They are missing some key apps outside of google play store but many of them can be sideloaded using 1mobilemarket or an equivalent. I have noticed the apps through amazon are generally a version or two behind but its not a deal breaker.I understand you cant do this on an ipad either, but I wish you could rename apps. I hate when I download an app from Amazon and it has a weird name and throws it off alphabetically when I am looking for it.Now for the positives:Screen - The picture on this device is immaculate. Watching media is very crisp and enjoyable even on the 7\" device. The colors are accruate.Speakers - The speakers are very good on this device, much better than expected. It is perfect for watching on your lap, table or bed. They dont get too loud but I have never, as of yet, needed to watch something with them a full capactiy.Media - One of the key selling points is the ability to download videos to the device for offline viewing. I have noticed that the xfinity app allows you to do the same thing that Amazon has promised w this device. There are not many great movies to download and people are upset w this through Amazon Prime Video, however the list of tv shows is exceptional. They have a lot where you can either view/download the videos to the device. Amazon prime is strongly suggested if you were to purchase this device.Reading - Reading is a delight on this device. Very crisp and sharp and I love that you can download overdrive and rent books via your library. The Amazon Kindle Lending library is very weak and if you are considering this as a reason to buy then forget it all together.Overall I am very impressed with this device and at $229 ($179 on cyber monday) it is definitley worth a buy. It is more of a media consumption device then a tablet so to speak. I notice that when I am using it I seem to run out of things to do on it, unlike an iphone/ipad but still I think it is a great device for the budget conscious buyer.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift for my wife - she won't put it down", "Author": "J.

My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either.

To tell the truth, I have been meaning to buy a similar reading device with tablet capabilities and couldn\u2019t figure out whether to buy the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HDX or the Sony Experia Z Ultra. Of course it\u2019s a matter of money. I am not made of the green stuff and even a $300 expense is big enough for me to think three times before buying something first in order to try it out. I read all the reviews, all the personal experiences put out by people, but still, it isn\u2019t the same as having the thing at home to play around with.This way works the best \u2013 they sent the 32GB version that I had chosen in less than 3 days.From the moment I got the package in my hands, I was in love. It is simply great \u2013 it does (almost) everything an IPAD does at a fraction of the cost.First, the cons \u2013 as I am sure there\u2019s ample information on the pros.1. The camera is ONLY on the front \u2013 there is no camera behind the screen. Makes skyping and taking pictures just a tad harder. Not a dealbreaker though, given all the other great stuff this little tablet does.2.  The page turning is by swipes only. When you are tucked in a cozy comforter on a cold night, you sometimes wish for right/left buttons \u2013 again, a minor annoyance.3. The weight \u2013 it\u2019s a tad heavier than the Sony Experia Z Ultra. But honestly, if losing weight means spending $400 extra, I can do without it!4. The included charger is really slow \u2013 I spent the extra money for the power charger. Only I didn\u2019t spend $19.99 on Amazon \u2013 I got it on eBay (new) from China, for $5.22, free shipping. Still waiting on it, but its guaranteed to arrive in a couple of days.  Works for me!5. I am an Amazon Prime buff \u2013 in fact Prime content is the prime reason why I chose the Kindle. It works great \u2013 only your \u2018watchlist\u2019 shows perhaps a quarter of what you have saved. If there is a way to see the entire watchlist, I haven\u2019t discovered it (yet).6. The carousel is annoying. It pops up unbidden whenever the Kindle\u2019s turned on. I don\u2019t need to display exactly what books and movies I have purchased and would have preferred if there was a way to discreetly tuck them away only to be brought out when I wish.7. Browsing emails on yahoo can sometime be frustrating \u2013 scrolling is immensely difficult as the tablet, to me, seems too sensitive \u2013 whether I use a stylus or my fingers, it tends to pop open the email instead of allowing me to scroll thru the list.8. Downloading movies is not too cool \u2013 takes too long and if the Kindle powers off, there you go. Lost the portion that you had already downloaded and need to restart.That\u2019s the lot of semi-bad news, if you can call it that. To me, it\u2019s all stuff I can live with, nothing major. Here\u2019s the positive stuff:1. It is GREAT to watch a movie or a show on. The picture (we have a high-speed broadband Wi-Fi) is crystal clear; there is NO dithering or wait time as the video caches. It\u2019s like watching your own personal wrap around widescreen. You might think the size would be too small, but when you do watch it, the screen\u2019s placed close enough to your face comfortably and it actually seems like a much larger screen. Like I said, GREAT definition and clarity.2. The sound\u2019s amazing \u2013 clear, sharp and realistic. Even without headphones, it\u2019s powerful enough to give true surround effect and loud enough to make my wife complain. With headphones, you don\u2019t disturb anyone and the immersion is complete. BTW I bought JLabs Jbud J5 ear buds with this after doing some R&D; (read my review if you wish \u2013 I even bought an extra pair for the wife) and it\u2019s a perfect match right off the top. Tailor made for the Kindle Fire HDX.3. Reading books is easy, except that a couple of left/right/page turning buttons wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The light levels\u2019s just right and if a white page glares at you, voila, make the screen black, the letters white! Bunch of choices in terms of fonts (publisher\u2019s font included) and one can size them up or down as required.4. Browsing \u2013 the silk browser is really great. Fast, no nonsense stuff.5. People talk about the \u2018offers\u2019 as annoying \u2013 I find it extremely entertaining. Not just are the products good (no TV infomercials here) but also the entire ad experience is VERY unobtrusive. Flick it off whenever you wish and go back using the tab.6. Navigating the Kindle is great (except perhaps the carousel feature which I didn\u2019t like). Downloading documents and files, pictures etc is really fast, movies, not so much as explained in \u2018Cons\u2019.7. Best part is its portability. The 7\u201d is slightly too big to slip into the back pocket of my jeans and a jacket pocket is required. However if you do sort out the carrying issue, it\u2019s great to have along and works everywhere there\u2019s Wi-Fi.8. I took the Boingo Wi-Fi on the go service and so far haven\u2019t had too much trouble with it. Of course it\u2019s not as fast as it\u2019s touted to be and there is a tendency to hook you to the nearest network instead of the dedicated Boingo network, but hey, whatever works. I am not that finicky. It takes a bit of time to get hooked, but once it does, it\u2019s a strong link and stays hooked unless you move a few blocks.9. The case and paraphernalia. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend spending $50-60 on the recommended sleeves and cases. I bought the Fintie faux leather package and for $20 approx, got a nice collection of stylus, sleeve, extra USB cable and some other small stuff. Works even better if you just buy the Fintie case for about $9.99. You definitely need a bigger case to stuff all those bits and pieces though \u2013 the charger, USB, stylus, headphones etc. I also bought a screen protector and a TPU Gel soft skin cover to be used in parallel with my Fintie case as added protection. It\u2019s a tighter fit, but works perfectly.All in all, it\u2019s a GREAT purchase and I am loving it. Will be happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

I can't speak for the new Retina mini iPad but I've been told the Kindle Fire HDX still looks better.The top reasons for purchasing the Kindle HDX was to read books, get news, send email, text from Google account (which it does), watch short movies (90 minutes or less by streaming or from my Cloud), and listen to my music (all in Cloud).In addition, I've turned my Kindle Fire HDX into my alarm clock/sleep timer to ocean waves, my event calender, sole source for Skyping, and main internet searching device.

I watched a couple of episodes of Alpha House and it was the easiest thing in the world to go to videos and select.  It was instantly there for me to watch and enjoy.  The sound was fantastic and I only had the volume at 1/2 which was plenty loud.  I decided to go with the 30 day free trial of amazon prime and I'll be keeping that since I love the instant streaming and selection.  I also have a paperwhite kindle and was reading a book (Sycamore Row) and went and checked it out on the kindle fire and it was perfectly synced with no problems and no effort on my part.  I also loaded Words with Friends which I was playing on my mini ipad and that synced up with ease.  I couldn't resist the mayday button and I had a question which was responded to and answered by a very pleasant gal quickly.  That's enough to make me love it more since I hate voice mail and pushing a zillion buttons to get to customer service.  I've downloaded some music and everything I already had loaded in the cloud was available for me to snatch and use.  I'm so happy with my purchase and think it's worth every penny I spent on it.

I've been using mine for a little over a week. It is a great replacement for my old Kindle Fire. I've read in the Kindle Forum that some people have had a problem with 'blue fringe' on the screen edges.  I noticed it when I first started using it but I don't notice it anymore unless I specifically look for it. Typically I read books with black background and white text. I have an iPad 3 with Retina display, too, that I am also happy with but for reading I definitely prefer the Kindle.Pros:01. It is very light and thin.02. Awesome display. The display is very crisp. It's very easy to read books, magazines and movies look as good as they do on my HD TV.03. The home page and Carousel are much improved. The home page area below the Carousel took a little getting used to but I like it now.04. The new options in the App Store, Book Store, Music Store, etc.05. Much easier to add items, such as books or apps, to wish lists.06. Silk Browser. Didn't like it on my old Kindle Fire but it's much improved on the Fire HDX, imho.07. I like the book recommendations displayed under the books in the Carousel. They aren't obtrusive.08. The new Shop tab.09. The (new) native calendar app.10. The improved native email and contacts apps which can be synched with my Google account.11. Mayday! I've used it a couple of times and it is easy and convenient.12. The physical volume rocker control.13. The charging port is much tighter than on my previous Kindle Fire.14. Being able to display the battery percentage with out an app.15. The camera is pretty cool. Don't see myself using it much, if at all, but it's cool that it's there.Cons:01. Even with a cover it is sometimes difficult to hold for long periods of time. I have arthritis in both hands so that may only be a problem for me.02. It is occasionally glitchy. I've had to do a hard reboot a couple of times. Hopefully today's update will take care of that.03. The Amazon App store. I realize this isn't a 'con' of the Kindle Fire HDX but wanted to add that in my review. The Google Play Store (for my phone) and ITunes (for my iPad) have much more to offer.If I think of, or encounter, any other cons I will add them to my review.My Kindle received the latest update today and it added some cool upgrades. The new lock screen is nicer now that it displays the number of unread emails, battery percentage, date and time and new wallpaper. The GoodReads integration is really useful and the ability to create Collections....at last! Smart look up is cool...not earth shattering cool but cool nonetheless. The alarm is nice although I don't know that I'll use it. Second screen is a nice function (assuming it works) but I don't have a Samsung TV or PS3. The print function is a really cool, convenient function although as of yet it doesn't work with my Canon printer. The Canon app is crap. 1 Tap Archive might not be something that I'll use but I suppose it could be useful. The Amazon Cloud Drive is very, very useful. It's an easy, convenient way to move photos and documents from computer to Kindle and mobile phone to Kindle.I received the original Kindle as a Christmas gift one year and the original Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift the following year and was very happy with both of them.

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.  Of course there's a reason it's priced that low...talk about a \"fire\" sale!  :)", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Software issues", "Author": "Sarah Nickels", "ReviewID": "R3HDX7T69CF6D4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought 2 Kindle Fire HDX's as Christmas gifts for my 11yr old and 9yr old.

I still returned the free-trial 8.9-inch one but decided to purchase the 7-inch version, because the former was still a bit too large for my need (recall I have the bigger iPad and iPad2).The 8.9-inch version of this Kindle (the one that I free-tried) doesn't have the bluish borders, the 7-inch version does. I read about this issue while waiting for the delivery my 7-inch version while still using the 8.9-inch version and became concerned. But guess what, it turns out that the borders do not bother me at all. No big deal! I can read each of my e-books just fine.

So I had high hopes that the HDX would fit the bill as a nice, lighter-weight 7-inch device with iPad-like qualities.  I have to say, it really surpassed my expectations!  The display is gorgeous and the Silk browser is about a million light-years away from the original Fire.  The size and weight are perfect (don't underestimate the importance of the lighter weight if you're considering an iPad).  I've had no issues whatsoever with a flickering screen, WiFi connectivity etc that other users mentioned...my experience has been fantastic.As an Apple aficionado, I would still give my iPad a slight edge over the Fire, but only because of the availability of apps and the seamless syncing of all my stuff through iTunes with my iPhone and my Mac desktop.

The HDX beats the more expensive Acer hands down in every way. The screen is beautiful, with awesome color and clarity, the processor is fast, and the battery life is very good. The sound from the stereo speakers is better than any of the previous tablets I've had, with great separation.

The \"special offers\" feature that keeps the price low is very unobtrusive and hasn't bothered me at all.

When given the choice between this and the Paperwhite, I chose this one due to the ability to use as a regular tablet when I'm not reading.Pros:- The picture is absolutely stunning, especially when watching tv/movies. The picture is vibrant, clear, and sharp.- It's faster than I thought it would be, including powering up and down. Much better than the third gen Kindles.- I'm able to play games like Candy Crush Saga and Wheel of Fortune without any issues.- Can access Netflix, Hulu +, and other tv apps!Cons:-The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped when playing games but it's still better than playing them on my tiny smartphone.- The weight of the Kindle, while lighter than previous generations can feel heavy after using it for a while. This isn't a huge \"con\" since there are those tablet pillows I can buy to alleviate the need for me to hold it while I watch shows or read.- Every now and then, especially when the brightness is turned all the way up, the screen vibrates which can cause dizziness. It only lasts for a moment at a time but it can get annoying when it does it more than once an hour. When I have the screen dimmed it doesn't appear to have that vibration problem.Overall, this is a fabulous buy, especially for those of us who were able to get a holiday deal on it. Even full price, it's worth it. The Nook was looking good simply because it has access to Google Play and Chrome whereas the Kindle only uses their own proprietary shop (Amazon App Store). But after reading reviews from experts and consumers it seems the Kindle is still the better tablet. Besides, the way Barnes and Noble is heading, they may not be around long enough to support the new Nooks into the future. At least Amazon seems strong and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon so the Kindle will be supported for years to come.I highly recommend this for anyone older than 10 years old.

You can also change the text background in your books for example. you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away. However, I received my kindle today and its already being shipped back.

Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things.

The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.  The email client is business friendly out of the box...you can immediately set up email for Microsoft Exchange without having to get a third party application.  Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.  I'm very excited to see how Amazon is going to take advantage of the Miracast technology built into the tablet.  I expect to see several adapters shortly that will allow you to use the Miracast functionality to \"throw\" your Kindle screen on to your TV so that you can use the TV to watch movies that are running on your Kindle.  Miracast has to take the place of the missing HDMI out port that was included in the last Kindle Fire tablet.  All in all, this tablet is a noticeable step up from the last generation.  It is a fully functional tablet, and with the \"side loading\" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.  I was very impressed by how quickly I was connected to a technical support agent, and how helpful the agent was in answering my question.  If you have any fear of using a tablet, the Mayday function is a welcome addition.  If you're buying the tablet for a technophobe, Mayday will be a great help to them if they have questions or problems.  This function is a quantum leap forward in customer service.

Instead of placing the USB port on the bottom of the HDX (like it is on the HD) it is placed at the top left side which helps when using the carrying case. The HDX is also thinner and lighter than the Fire and HD which make handling easier. The user interface is an improvement also because one now have \"home\" and \"carousel\". Now one can remove an item from the carousel but it still will show up on the bottom of the screen in the \"home\" section.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars. I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks deciding whether I'll become accustomed enough to the blue border to no longer notice it (this is already happening to some extent).", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot borrow audible books from your public library with this kindle.

After an hour of being shuffled, disconnected and otherwisw aggravated with \"customer service\" I was told that the app writers would have to change their app to make it compatible.  Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.  It does not take a genius to figure out why  the new hdx was made incompatible.  Shame on you for effectively eliminating many peoples ability to obtain audible content.

FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a secure device", "Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.  It would be nice to see Amazon step up security and regard for customer's privacy on their portable devices.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "anaconda", "ReviewID": "R2YNLEQJNKHA4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I was gonna like this...

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.  I have an original iPad and an 8.9 Fire HD from last year.  I never thought I'd be want the smaller size, but this is perfect.  I no longer play games on my phone, b/c this thing is easy enough to carry around I take it everywhere.  In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice tablet but still room for improvement", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.

The screen resolution also was subpar compared to modern standards.Fast forward to today and I've dove head-first back into the tablet world with the 7\" Kindle Fire HDX.  All of my complaints stated above are no longer apparent with the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is light, narrow (can easily grip with one hand, although not as narrow as the Nexus 7), and whip-fast.  Screen resolution is as crisp as they come.My biggest complains are that (1) the ads are semi-annoying, and (2) the whole \"user experience\" appears to revolve around the consumer buying a bunch of stuff from Amazon.  With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

But I knew from past experience that this is not how Amazon usually operates, so I didn't give up. When I ordered the tablet and accessories I was promised promotional credits plus amazon coins plus bonus credits for some of the app purchases. Half of the credits promised did not show up in my account, and when I tried to use the credits I had, additional credits were deducted that should not have been. After many calls to Amazon, it was finally discovered that a computer glitch was the cause of the problem and it was corrected. My first tablet was difficult to use and some of the menu options were missing and I didn't know it. The online help files did not include descriptions of problems that can occur with a defective tablet so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong.

It took me 3 days to reload 246 books and 65 apps into the new tablet........it would be helpful if there were a \"select all\" option in the cloud but there isn't and if the downloading is not monitored it stops after a short time. I now have a Kindle Fire HDX that works as it should and no longer regret my purchase! This tablet works extremely well and the graphics quality is amazing!

In this one I know the percentage and the number of pages I have to go based on my reading speed. Given that, I also like the Skype ability, the way the web and Facebook behave (much like on my computer) and it is fast. I had an occasion to use the Mayday button. It took less than 15 seconds for them to answer and the support person I talked to was very helpful.What would make me like it more? The charge access is a little (not a lot) hard to plug into. It is set at an angle, not straight in. Per the Mayday person (no that is not why I called) this is to keep people from damaging it.  The charge does not last as long as my previous Kindle so I have to charge it more often. I wish I could have my I-tune library  accessible from the HDX. Maybe I can some way.

I bought it primarily as a color reader. I have a Kindle Paperwhite that is about a year old. It was giving me some problems frequently freezing up, even after updating the software, though it would always restart successfully. Also, I use Kindle book loans and they can only be read on Kindle devices so the Kindle Cloud Reader apps for my laptop and smartphone can't be used. And, I knew from reading on my laptop that a color reader is desirable in some situations.The Kindle Fire is so much more than a reader. I was not looking for a full-function tablet, but the Kindle Fire has much more functionality than I expected. I brought in my email account, contacts and calendar, which is very convenient. The Silk browser quickly connects with the few sites that I use most: Amazon, NOAA weather, my public library, a couple of news accounts, for example. I still use my laptop for most web browsing and research but I think I could do more on the Kindle Fire if I wanted to. I've also downloaded a few games, which offer a nice bread from reading. While I don't normally watch Amazon Prime videos on my Fire, I did try it out. It loaded quickly, the picture was sharp, and the sound good.It works well for a reader, though the screen is a bit more reflective than the monochrome Kindles. It's very quick at loading books, page turning, and finding word definitions. A nice feature for word definitions is that it uses the source that it determines is most helpful - sometimes a dictionary and sometimes Wikipedia. Moving around in a book is very convenient thanks to a navigation menu that slides out from the left side of the screen.The battery life is good but playing games in particular will drain it. When reading a book I switch between my FIre and my Paperwhite to recharge the other and the syncing usually works well.In choosing between the HD and the HDX, I looked at both. The HD has a slower processor and that's very noticeable. The HDX screen image is clearer and sharper. For me there was no question that the HDX was worth the additional cost.The case and screen are very smooth, which I like. However, I was concerned that they could be scratched or otherwise damaged, even though I'm careful with my devices. I bought the rooCase slim shell origami case for it and am very pleased with it. It fits well, adds very little weight or bulk.I recommend the Kindle Fire HDX for reading and so much more.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "cb5020", "ReviewID": "R2M9RHRHYB9EJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE Amazon!....I ordered my Kindle one day, got it the next day, talk about fast, you just can't beat it!...every product I've bought from Amazon it's self has been excellent.....I have NO complaints about the company what so ever!...My Husband has Alzheimer's I got him one and down loaded a lot of games and he plays with it all the time, its been real good for him, it gives him something to do that he enjoys so very much, he is like a kid in a candy store.AND I LOVE my new Kindle that came today, the pictures are amazing, can't say enough about it.

If you own a smart phone, you will adapt quickly, but if you are a standard lap top user, this think will make you want to pull your hair out and requires some practice.The worst thing about it is that it is set up to sell you stuff on Amazon, so instead of guiding you to free services like Hulu unpaid, it takes you to services you have to pay for and won't let you access the free ones unless you are really persistent and crafty about it.It is really easy to hit the wrong button and be convince to download or buy something you don't want.Other than that, the video quality is fantastic, the screen, though small is easy to read and can be enlarged without compromising things too much and this think has better stereo than my boom box and gets really good battery life.The camera is not very good. It takes decent pix, but only forward facing, so you cannot see what you are taking a picture of unless you are doing a selfie!I like the thing and it has good speed and connection and quality audio and video, but the touch screen type is awkward and slow and the learning curve pretty steep even for someone who has used computers for years, but in a limited capacity it is a fun thing to have and well worth the purchase.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the product, but...", "Author": "Kathleen L.

First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it. I can't say this enough: It's very minimal! If no one mentioned it, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there. The other things that the Kindle is great at completely overshadow this.The app store has plenty, and it's only getting more. With a little research you can get whatever Android app you want. For example, I like Chrome for web browsing, and I was able get the app on my Kindle in a couple of minutes.Being a Prime member, and able to download prime instant content is awesome.

I wanted to try out the Kindle since I've read so many reviews that mentioned that it was a perfect tablet for anyone who had a Prime membership.The tablet itself is pretty comfortable to hold. Some other reviews mentioned the ill placed power and volume rocker on the back of the tablet, but I found it intuitive after a few minutes of use.The screen is where the tablet really shines. HD movies looked, and the speakers were some of the loudest I found on a sub 8 inch tablet.The OS is quick and responsive, but the whole carousel layout feels a bit cumbersome, but it's merely a minor gripe.I think the only major flaw I found on this tablet was the lack of micro SD expansion. I purchased the 16 GB, and I was immediately bothered to realize that I only had around 10 GB of actual storage to use. 16 GB's of minimum storage should have been removed a long time ago. With HD streaming being the preeminent way of enjoying movies, it should have come as no surprise that most 1080p movies were going to be larger than the 10 GB that remained. I don't see why they couldn't add a small slot for an expansion. This is where the HDX falls to the Samsung Note 8.0.Other than that, it's a nice little tablet... I do have a little buyer's remorse.

The size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference (the HDX7 is slightly larger and about 8 ounces heavier).  I can hold the the HDX7 in my left hand quite comfortably--just not quite as comfortably as the Paperwhite.  Moreover, the text of the Paperwhite \"seems\" to wear longer on older, tired eyes (especially after reading the hype on behalf of e-ink text) than that of the HDX--at least during extended stretches of continuous reading.Still, there are moments when my eyes crave color, images and videos beyond which the Paperwhite can deliver.  The television set, cable, and ROKU box are my wife's, and I'm no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an iPod screen--all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the HDX.  It offers the freedom and privacy of an iPod but with video footage that offers a welcome size-advantage compared to the iPod screen.For traveling purposes, I'm good with the Paperwhite and an iPod--both pocket-sized and answering to my reading, listening  and occasional viewing needs.  The speakers of the HDX may be stereo but they're far from full-frequencied, perhaps only slightly better than those of a new iPod Touch.  So I'd recommend earphones when using either an iPod or the HDX as a music player--or, if your partner won't complain, a good adjunct speaker (with a supple, light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivty than dicey Bluetooth technology offers).I frankly can't \"see\" an iPod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera (I'm one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated \"point and shoot\" camera).  But the price point of the HDX makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses.  I've met people who no longer use any sort of computer, doing all of their Facebooking, e-mail and banking with a mere tablet (usually an Apple iPad or Mini).  My sense is that the HDX would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes--Apple's tablet has the refined processor, continually upgraded OS, and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of ditching their laptops.  Aside from the added cost of the Apple tablet (twice as much as the HDX), I'm simply not excited about tablets in general.  The affordability of the HDX, which has now got several years of refinement behind it, makes it the preferred choice in my case.In conclusion, I've got to rate the Paperwhite #1 for my particular uses as well as for Amazon's scoring a game-changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first Apple iPod in 2002 and the Macbook Air in 2008 (though it was not accepted by the general public until Apple's decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in 2010).  Not only is the Paperwhite small, versatile, fast-loading, and beautifully back-lit (no more fumbling around and experimenting with various clip-on lights), but there's no subscription charge for long-distance connectivity to Amazon.  And I find it reassuring that Amazon includes an official, no-charge, on-line \"User's Manual,\"  for printing out on a Mac computer. With the HDX, on the other hand, there appears to be no single authoritative and \"free\" User's Guide.  Instead, your choices for instructions are unlimited--and I would advise against proceeding intuitively, especially if you plan to make use of Amazon's uniquely integrated film commentary, thanks largely to Bezos heady and timely purchase of the popular IMDB reference source.

The \"blue led\" and purple/blue/violet bleeding on the edges of the screen caused, at least for me personally, eye-strain and distraction (I wear 1.5-1.75 power readers).  I compared this side-by-side to a 7-inch Kindle HD and original Fire and these, as e-readers, were far superior.  When I contacted customer support I was told the blue led was intentional and that if I ordered a replacement it would still have the purple-blue edge.  If \"intentional\" use of a blue led means this wasn't thoroughly tested as an e-reader and is actually a major design flaw, then mission accomplished.  Since ~75%+ of my Kindle use is as a reader (25% video, email, apps), I returned this and am using my \"antiquated\" Kindle Fire.  I am hopeful the next generation will provide a spectrally pleasing balance of reading, web surfing, and video.  As technology, whether using at home or traveling, as an 80s teen and an avid SciFi/Fantasy reader I never thought I would see this. Considering this observation, a violet-colored edge and blue led affecting a white reading background is a minor complication, but does negatively affect the here and now of usage as an e-reader.The 7\" HDX does have amazing video pixel density and sound.  Much, much better than the 1st gen Fire and a readily observable improvement over the 7\" HD.  The speed of the HDX is fast compared to it's predecessors and Mayday, which I used for the purple-blue edge, far exceeded my expectations.  I never tested the camera before returning. I have found a very strong WIFI receiver with all generations of Kindle -- superior to my iPhone.  If you're not using the 7\" HDX as an e-reader, the value and quality is a comparably remarkable value.  If you plan to do a lot of reading, well, just don't go HDX; stick with the HD or original Fire or Paperwhite.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3IRCF2HQWWYKF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I'm pretty happy with the Kindle Fire.

I looked at the various types of Kindles. First I wanted a system that I could read in dark bedroom. Second, To get comparable internal memory to the newest tablet devices(32 GB), Third, the ability to change font & background color. Fourth, to be able to use the device on the internet. I got all of these features with the features with the Fire HDX.Given, I have an Amazon card which at the time provided $40 rebate on the HDX. I would have spent it for extra 16 GB anyway. The device has a three tier color format for color of font/background. I like the brown font on a light tan background which does not have the typical white background glare.  The HDX is perfect for a dark room.The SILK internet browser provides easy access to e-mail or wherever you want to go on the internet; Don't expect a Windows/Android type internet functional capacity but SILK is very good for things one would want to check before bedtime or any other time. The 7\" display is perfect for reading & mimics the normal size of a paperback; the size of words is easily adjustable to your personal choice or increasing to the size of hardback letters or bigger.The HDX is the first tablet I have owned that displayed perfectly at 50% setting(major reduction in battery charge drain) vs typical 90% to 100%. The HDX does not need to be charged till after 8 or 9 nights of 2-hour reading sessions. I turned off the WI-FI(10 second task) unless I need it for a book download or to go on the Web which greatly reduces the draining of the battery charge. I was a hardcore Hard Back reading but I love the HDX & have found myself putting off reading previously purchased books. The HDX has revolutionized my reading & I read 100% more now. I keep my Kindle in a zipped sleeve when charging or not in use. The sleeve also protects Kindle from the elements, display scarring & dropping. I highly recommend a similiar Kindle HDX to anyone who wants Kindle & internet access in the same device.  Somewhat of an answer to questions about  'archiving', 'collection', 'cloud', 'how to tell if a book is downloaded', 'remove from device' & 'remove a book, magazine, etc completely removing a item from your Kindle', etc.Put a note at start & end of the book to indicate you have read it when the carousel is on screen & you actually in the book. Press one to two seconds the book on carousel & move the book to 'Add to Collection'. Add a new folder in 'Collection' titled 'read' or 'red' or what ever title you want, check this folder to move the book you have finished to that folder by checking the folder & then save. Then press 'Remove from Device' which also pops up in the menu where you press the book for a second or two. That moved the book from being downloaded to your Kindle & into the 'CLOUD', the book title is still on your Kindle by being in your Amazon 'Cloud' but not using up your Kindle memory up. You can click on books & click 'Cloud' at the top middle beside 'Device' & re-download the book at any time. Removing the book from device is basically archiving the book. It is available but not using any Kindle memory.You can completely remove the book, magazine, etc by going to the Amazon home page, click 'Your Account' & click 'Manage your Content & Devices'. All your items are listed there & on the right of a item(book, etc) click the 'Actions' tab there. Select the option to 'Delete from library' & click yes to confirm 'permanently deleting the title'. This function also works in the Kindle app on a non-Kindle device.All this can also be done directly while in the Kindle mode but I am not going into the techniques. I assume there are kindle books that describe all things & more or probably in a kindle user manual/guide . Since I am using a Kindle HDX, some of this may not be available to basic kindle; if needed, check the Kindle help home or forum.Books that are downloaded & in the 'Cloud', have a small checked mark in bottom center of the the book to indicate the book has been downloaded. So all books shown in the Carousel or in Device that have a symbol like @ if you have downloaded it & then removed it from device. Some books in the carousel & device have the mark & have a X% in right top indicating % read, so that combo indicates it is downloaded.  \"Don't beat me up, just free info.

The HDX does its primary role, that of consuming Amazon prime media (I'm a Prime member) very well.  It's screen is sharp and the color rendering is very good so reading books and watching movies you rent, buy or get free as an Amazon prime member is a very good experience.

Yes, yes I know you can root the HDX and access Google Play, but if you're going to go to all that trouble why not just buy an equally affordable and very more capable Nexus 7 running stock Android?Finally, I have to say the stability of the Fire OS based on archaic the Android Jelly Bean version the HDX uses is bug ridden and ineptly designed and almost forces you to root it just so you can install an updated Android OS and dump the pitiful carrousel launcher for something far better.So, if you can live within the HDX's limited role of consuming Amazon media I think you will be happy, but the moment you try to go beyond that I think you'll envy anyone with an iPad mini or Nexus 7.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Australian (international version) lacking", "Author": "Vinny", "ReviewID": "R16X1M58ZS7AM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are expecting the Mayday button: Prime: Movies: Share your screen: print functionality (for now) to name a few for Kindles bought through the .au Amazon store then you won't get them.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.  This time around I also purchased an Otterbox case, so I hope to not have another review to write anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "KINDLE rocks.

The Dolby sound quality from the speakers is phenomenal for so small a device, but the volume level doesn't go very high and at its top volume it is only what I would consider as being barely satisfactory.  If there is any background noise at all you will have problems hearing it unless you are using earphones or a headset.  My biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is the location of the on/off button and the volume control. Both of these controls are under the sloped edge of the pad and if you have a leather cover for your Kindle Fire you pretty much have to remove it from the cover to access these controls.  I think the unit would be better if the control switches were on the edge like they had with the old B&W; 7\" Kindle with the keyboard.  I'm finding that to get a nice leather cover like want I am having to have one custom made.  One other item that I think would make the Kindle Fire HDX better would be a USB port that allows you to use a Flashdrive with it.  This would allow you to access movies and documents from an external source without having to use a computer to transfer them via a cable.  I have a lot of movies on DVD's that I wanted to view on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" when I travel, I was able to find a program to convert them to MP4 format, but I discovered that when stored in the \"myflix\" folder on the Kindle I need to use the PHOTO selection on the Kindle to find them and not the movie selection, this is rather confusing especially since no instructions came with the Kindle.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.

I have had all the generations of Fires and I still have the original that the kids use to this day.  I upgraded to the first generation Kindle Fire HD7 and loved it.  All of the Fires have some flaws, that is to be expected.  BUT and heres the BIG BUT.  The fire, first and foremost is supposed to be for reading.  If it does not do this one simple thing well then why have it?  The blue ring literally hurt my eyes, to the point that I had to set on on dark mode to read.  Why have a Reader that hurts to read?  Every one that I have ever seen reviewed had this same issue. I figured that \"they\" were all being picky.  No sir, it was horrible.  I couldnt watch movies either because on any screen that was white, there was that blue tint.  In the end I returned it and am now using the first gen HD7.  I am thankful for Amazons return policy and the great customer service, but am appalled that they thought this was a good product.

Both through the Amazon Prime option and through the Netflix app. I haven't had any problems with the internet connection. The picture is fantastic. Battery life is great (I can watch like 8 hours at least of video without worrying about charging). I see none of the blue color or whatever that some people say they have. I do play some Angry Birds on it sometimes, and that's great, too. Much better than playing on an iPod, anyway. I wouldn't really want to read on it due to the brightness of the screen (that's why I have a Kindle Touch for reading). I don't really do audiobooks on it either (I have an iPod for that), but it's nice to know I have the option and that it synchs right in with my Audible account. I've used the web browsing a bit, and that's been fine, but it's not a major feature for me.Basically, I wanted it for video watching, and it's been great for that.

I love it! It is much lighter weight ,a feature I was looking for,and the playback is amazing. The buffering during movies I've rented is minimal. The picture on a couple rentals was not the greatest, but then again on others was crystal clear. I use my kindle in the same manner I use my iPad. It searches the net very well, e mail great, music playback nice. Keyboard responds well to touch. Lastly I had to use the Mayday button for an issue on the keyboard. I somehow split it into 2 sections making half the board to the left the other half to the right, leaving a gap in the middle of the screen. I touched mayday and viola!  A screen appeared with a live feed from a tech ! He was courteous knowledgeable and marked my keyboard with a blue arrow showing me exactly where to go to fix the keyboard display. It was awesome.  It took maybe 3 minutes. Great addition. I have one gripe though. I' m not seeing my amazon account in its entirety on the kindle, nor is the order experience the same as it is from an iPad or PC. And I feel the amazon prime account has changed. From the kindle I couldn't find much in the way of prime movies. I was directed to other apps such as Netflix . Is Amazon getting out of the \"movie business\"? Experience with the book rental was similar . Not complaining really just saying.i love amazon! No one can beat them for their speed and accuracy in shipping. I got my new Kindle in less than 24 hours of placing the order. Overall I would buy thus as a gift over an iPad.

I find very useful the text-to-speech to listen to the technical books I have to read as I do other tasks, like during morning ablutions.  I like the placement of the on/off switch, and the volume up/down switches, but the power connection being on an angle threw me.  I thought something inside got bent, but that I found out was by design.  Not sure why that is.  Really like the Mayday feature, this was a game changer for me, and had to use it right off the bat because my first HDX didn't deliver the right side audio channel when I plugged in my apple earbuds, but the HDX audio was fine withOUT the earbuds plugged in, not good for viewing movies in a public place. My older first edition KindleFire worked fine with my Apple earbuds, but not with the HDX.  With the Mayday tech, tried different settings, different earbuds, unplugging/ replugging earbuds into HDX audio port, various power cycling, resetting the HDX to default, escalated to deeper tech support, nothing worked, so Amazon actually sent me a new HDX replacement device and I returned mine that had no right side audio channel using earbuds.  The replacement new HDX device came in with  its right side audio channel working with the Apple earbuds!  I am very pleased.  The new technological advancements of this new HDX Kindle are very positive and noteworthy, and I would say it is worth upgrading to this HDX version, but for these advancements, there is a cost - battery energy supply gets used up sooner than the previous version Kindle Fire.  That is ok, and understandable for all the graphical/ sound enhancements and back end support of them in this new KindleFire HDX version.  Hopefully battery technology will catch up soon to keep up with the needs of our advancing electronic toys that are a driving force in technology.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy for anyone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CA70OZ41J0W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome holds a great charge for battery easy and simple to use anyone can use it lightweight and fun great buy", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ODI2KL0Q7YAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about this device.

The ability to add your own words to the dictionary is incredibly useful for customizing your Kindle Fire to be adapted to your personal way of thought and speech. If you are a member of Amazon Prime the Kindle Fire is a one stop experience for shopping, books, games, and video. The real problem is in the limited OS that Amazon has created to push its app store.  This could cause problems for people who are, like myself, used to the full access of the Google Play store which you cannot use. This also means that apps that are free on Google Play might cost you money on the Amazon store. This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products. Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need. Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One. Second screen does allow me to use the Kindle Fire as a keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One which makes surfing the web and navigating menus much easier.

I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

Maybe even increase the cost of the device. This, in turn, would likely cause customers to become more unhappy then they are with just the current approach, and at both \"store\" owner companies.I wonder if I could send my current device in to \"upgrade\" it's storage, or 4G capability, or to remove its adds, or something else at some point in the future for less than the cost of buying a new one, but I guess that is something to ask Amazon directly or look into on my own to see if such a thing exists.Anyway, I love my KFHDX7. Works great, has a good battery life, the screens colors are wonderful. The one I bought has a good screen size. It came with a good charger. The charger is one thing I absolutely love right now. It is, essentially, a wall plug in with a USB port. I can use any USB to mini USB cord to charge it, and the cord it came with can plug into the charger or my computer with no problem. I remember getting the charger for the Gen One Kindle Fire and having to go out and buy my own USB to mini USB cord in order to transfer files manually (instead of by email) or use my computer to charge it and that was something I found relatively disappointing.

I was able to get my favorite games (Flow Free and Candy Crush Saga), and there is no shortage of others.When I started up the tablet and input my Amazon log-on info, it synched up with all the books I've obtained in the past from Amazon, and had on my Kindle e-reader (old version with the keyboard on it).Setting up my e-mail accounts with the provided e-mail browser was quick and easy.So far, I haven't had to read directions, but I did buy an after market instruction manual from Amazon, which I intend to use.  Amazon has a Kindle support page on their web site, with loads of good info.  Though I've not had the need for it yet, the Kindle Fire HDX has the \"Mayday\" option for free, instant help from a real live person.The speed of the tablet is very fast. Moving from one screen or app to the other, or changing pages is FAST.  No problem with connecting with my Wi-Fi at home, or at work.The display is excellent, and very sharp.  We also have an Apple iPad Air, 10\" size.  The display on the Kindle Fire HDX is just as sharp as the iPad.  I see no difference.I spent the $15 and turned off the \"Special Offers\", and disabled the suggested apps thing just below the carousel view.  There are instructions on-line if you Google something like \"turn off special offers on Kindle Fire HDX.\"  No problem.  All gone.The tablet comes with a $5.00 credit at the Amazon app store. They call it \"coins\", and you get 500 of them to use when buying \"paid\" apps.  Once spent, you can re-up the coins for future use.Things you buy, like paying for apps, books, and everything else you might like, goes against your \"one click\" ordering account on Amazon.com.  Very handy, making it quite easy to spend money if you like.There is a good variety of cases/covers available for these tablets, many available on Amazon.com.  I have the Poetic Slimline case, in black.  Great case or cover, for a great price.I haven't found any negatives yet, and I don't regret getting the Kindle Fire HDX at all.  In many respects, I like the Kindle Fire HDX more than the Apple iPad (which is a great tablet - but about 3x the price - for one with 32GB). The price for the 16GB version is very reasonable.  I lucked out and got mine for free, using up my credit card bonus points I had earned.The battery seems to hold up quite well.  I'd estimate that I ran mine about 9-10 hours before charging it back up from only 5% left.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Kindle Fire HDX, but HATE customer service for Electronic Arts/Origin.", "Author": "Robin Setliff", "ReviewID": "R2R7ZCSPM7USE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Kindle Fire HDX, but absolutely hate that you can't get any answers from Electronic Arts/origin regarding a forgotten password.

I have to say I love it. My wife was able to try out the 8.9\" KF HDX and while the movies were beautiful on it the size was not for me since I read a lot, so I got the 7\"Screen = sexySound = It's a mobile device so I dont expect anything spectacular, that is where ear buds or headphones come into playCPU = Speedy little thing, quite impressedBuild Quality = SolidBattery Life = Great but like everyone else I want longer! :)Storage = 64GB and am happy Amazon offers this size and would love to see a 128GB or 256GB model in the future.OS = meh...... Read about it below.Bluetooth = WinWiFi = stable and solid I am an Android user and I like stock Android. I understand Amazon is trying to make it usable for anyone of any age sort of deal, but my biggest gripe is the freaking carousel (please fire the person/s responsible for this decision!!!) Please make a way to customize or just flat our disable for your customers that cant stand it. Second is the silk browser... I mean really come on! Why not use the default browser or Chrome that is part of Android, they are decent and average browsers that dont have issues with 60% of websites when loading them or hanging on the other 40% at random times. I just use Firefox Mobile to resolve this issue. Third and this is more of a personal issue that pops up from time to time since I got the Kindle Fire HDX and that is the seemingly constant need to be connected to the internet. When I am at home not a problem, when I am on the road really not a problem as I can use a hotspot (but do I really need to?), when I am at work that is really impossible as I have to keep it in airplane mode if I want to even bring it with me. This poses an issue sometimes when it needs to verify licensing to run some apps or play some games during lunch or waiting for code to compile, to watch a movie I downloaded from Amazon VOD so I could watch it while away from a data connection or a limited data connection in terms of data amount I can use. This needs to be resolved with all digital content that is usable on the KF HDX. I dont really have this issue when I use my Nexus 7 unless the app/game I am trying to run requires an internet connection for it to actually function due to the nature of the app/game.OK now that I got my negative out of the way lets add a few more good things to this rating.The app/game selection is pretty darn good, the game circle is cool but Amazon and Google need to make a love connection here with games that support G+ syncing so I can keep my saves of Reaper on my Android devices and KF HDX device. Don't think I need to play two separate games due to that (or at least make a way to export/import gave saves between the platforms). Digital content in terms of movies/shows and also music is great. I buy 99% of my content from Amazon as I can play the music on any platform and then stream video content to any platform. Then with the purchase of BR/DVD/Digital from the store if I cant add it to my Amazon digital library, then the support of flixster and such is available.I love reading books on this device, I have a ton of book I have purchased through Amazon and then ones I have as PDF from technical books I can send using the kindle address or side loading it. The good reads inclusion of the app is not as robust as the Android version or the website but it will do and it does let you see some other books based off of comments, ratings, and similar interest when you are looking for something a little outside your normal scope.Hope this helps other customers!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Got To Get", "Author": "Jeanne Klohr", "ReviewID": "R3TED0Z4OJJRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I wanted the HDX, I thought I would get the 8.9 display.

The screen is brilliant and beautiful, except for a few features which are not so pleasant.The purple/blue bleed people talk about, its real.  It is annoying and distorting.  I only read books in night mode, where the background is black, so the blue doesn't show up.The second issue is that in a large number of non-native apps, the screen flickers.  Sometimes it is just a little bit, once in a while, but in some apps, it can get to the point where it is so consistent that it gives an almost instant headache and makes the app unusable for more than a couple minutes.  I did find, however, that just hitting the power button and then turning it right back on again (so that the screen turns off but not the kindle itself) can temporarily get rid of, or at least greatly reduce, the flicker.Honestly, the display issues really make it feel like a cheap tablet.  Which is disappointing.  My wife has a first generation nexus 7 and I wish I'd gone for a second gen of that instead of the HDX.  We've found no issues with that tablet in the year-and-a-half she's been using it.A big upside is the ability to download free prime movies and tv shows (the downloadable ones are a much smaller subset of the free prime videos, but as someone who watches little tv, there's plenty there that I've never seen that will last me for a long time) which means having the ability to watch movies on the plane, in the airport, or in the train without internet.In all, the kindle is a good entertainment device for videos, but the screen issues mean it falls short of expectations in other areas, including reading and writing, which I'd expected to use my kindle for quite a bit.

Also the HDX is considerably lighter- so much so that when I put the HDX into a case with a wireless bluetooth keyboard included it was still lighter than my original HD.The sound quality is what I expected and I havent tested the range of the wifi but as of now I have never had a problem with connecting with a wifi signal.Battery life is as advertised and works well for me because I take my HDX to class and type notes for my courses with it.Overall I am thrilled with this product and everyday I try to find new ways to use it!", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's Perfect", "Author": "Vnyrdstar", "ReviewID": "R2WAZZ6B1WB14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say, is I ended up buying TWO the 7\" for my son and then the 8\"9 for myself.

The HD would probably be the better deal being the price is much lower for virtually the same product.  My other complaint would be with the Prime shipping.

I decided, because of battery issues with the old tablet, to buy a new one. I did quite a bit of research and decided on the Kindle Fire HDX. Boy am I glad I did! The quality of graphics is superb. My old tablet looks like crap after seeing the quality of this Kindle. It is very \"user friendly\". I thought I might need to buy a book to help me figure it out, but it is pretty straightforward and there is a help function built in. It is sooooo faaaaaast!!!! I am loading apps in 1 second compared to 10 or 15 seconds. I guess that is the difference between the dual core and quad core. I already had most of my apps from the Amazon App Store, so that was a bonus. This tablet comes pre-installed with the Amazon App Store (which gives away one free app of the day FAOTD every day). Transferring to the new tablet was almost seamless. You have the option at setup to become an Amazon Prime member, which would be good if you like to watch TV episodes or movies (one free month, then pay). Amazon Customer Service is fantastic too!! Maybe some of the people that complain about it would complain about anything, no matter what! I found Amazon Customer Service knowledgeable, kind, FAST with helping.

I enjoy all the features it has to offer with two exceptions. The first downside is that you can only use Amazon apps and cannot download any games or programs that require flash player as they are not compatible with the device and flash player cannot be installed on Kindle Fire. Secondly, the camera is a big disappointment unless you do nothing but selfies as it does not have a back camera. On the upside it is easy to navigate, the screen colors are very vivid and Amazon does offer a lot of apps, some I just find useless or don't want to install. The Mayday is also a great feature unless your device is completely frozen. Certain games that are currently the rage are available but they are not the same version as the Android, Apple or desktop versions.

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up.

My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!  I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it. Guess what? When I was sent the new one it worked just as bad as before.My next issue is What happened to flash player?!  My old kindle has it! And now when I go to watch certain shows I used to watch or when I go to amazon to view a product video I can't view it anymore!!Next ..  i used to watch the network apps such as the cw ect..  on my previous tablet and still do with no problems. but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work! Once back in i have to fast foward to where i left off ! This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet. if this were true then why does it work perfectly on the old kindle? Again got the new HDX replaced and still have same issue to this day. It's not my Internet !  I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this ! It was a huge disappointment!In my opinion they took more away and only added a camera.  If they keep this up I don't think I'll be buying anymore kindles in the future.

One in three times it will work. What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words. I guess I am somewhat disappointed because we have an IPad and there is no comparison between the two. (In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well. The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate. They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.  I have to disagree, because of having both I can do side by side comparisons, and everything I have tried the winner is clearly Apple. If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.

Weigel \"Donna Weigel\"", "ReviewID": "R3GNMV4OBSOTS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let\u2019s face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.

Its fast, lightweight & portable, has an ever-growing selection of apps, and a BEAUTIFUL 7\" display. To show what this tablet is like, I will be comparing the HDX to the iPad Air(NOTE: these opinions come from a hardcore Apple user who is trying out Android-based tablets. I'm not being biased)\u00bb\u00bb Contrary to what most people believe, the HDX is actually better than the Air. For starters, the iPad air base model is $499... the HDX on the other hand, is $229. Its $270 for a tablet that isn't as powerful.\u00bb\u00bbSpeaking of power, let's take a look at the specs of the devices. The HDX has a 2.2 GHZ quad core Snapdragon processor + 2 GB of RAM. Thats more power and speed than most tablets on the market. The iPad Air has a dual core 1.3 GHz processor with only 1 GB of RAM. So clearly the HDX is way faster\u00bb\u00bbThe display on the HDX isn't as big as the iPad Air, despite being \"HD\". The HDX has a 1920x1200 display, and the iPad has a 1536x2048 display. HOWEVER, the pixel density isn't as high on the Air. The Air has about 264ppi and the HDX has 323ppi. So, although the display on the HDX isn't as HD, higher pixel density means sharper & clearer images. In terms of which is better, this one is really a toss-up.\u00bb\u00bbThe camera on the HDX is absolutely terrible compared to the one on the iPad air... at least on the 7\" model. The 7\" HDX lacks a rear-facing camera, and the front facing camera isn't too spectacular. Bump up to the 8.9\" HDX and you have an 8 MP rear camera that rivals the Air's 5 MP camera. If you're going for the 7\" tablet and the camera is the deciding factor, go with the Air. It has a better camera.\u00bb\u00bbBattery life is HUGE when comparing the tablets. The HDX is really good at conserving power. Amazon claims the HDX has up to 11 hours of battery life, and that really holds true. I myself have gotten even more than 11 hours of battery life. The iPad Air is a different story. Although Apple claims to have up to 10 hours of battery life, iOS 7 is a huge battery killer. I would be lucky to get half that amount with average use. I have a feeling that if iOS 7 was fixed to be less battery consuming, the Air would win this battle. So this is yet another win for the HDX\u00bbAesthetics & looks: Apple is known for its amazing product build quality and sleek look. The iPad wins this one hands down. It has a finished aluminum case that comes in two colors: Gray and Silver. The Air is also really thin & lightweight + it has small bezels allowing for more room for your content. It overall feels really solid. The HDX, though has a fairly sturdy build, is made with materials that look rather cheap. It has a rubbery-material back + is made with plastic... not aluminum. Although the HDX is also really thin & light, the iPad wins this one, simply because it looks nice.\u00bb\u00bbApp selection & software: The Amazon Appstore continues to grow, and certainly has thousands of more apps than it did when it first opened. But nothing can beat Apple in this category. The Amazon AS is rather limited. Its different from Google Play, which has much more to select from. Apple's AS has a huge variety of apps... overall a great selection. Amazon is just way too limited at this point in time. Also, iOS 7 is much nicer & has way more features than Fire OS 3. Fire OS takes the stock Android and modifies it to the point that it just looks terrible. You can't change backgrounds, you have very little customization, and the gray, drab colorless home screen & menus really don't help. Another hands down win for Apple.Overall, the HDX beats the Air in terms of speed, power, price & battery life. However, if you want a tablet that has more app selection, a nicer-looking OS, a good camera, and a really solid build that is aesthetically appealing, get the iPad Air. Below I have ranked the Kindle HDX in terms of all of the above categories. I hope this review has helped you! If it did, please \"Up Vote\" this review!

Handy for checking emails, forums, and such, and very easy to use.  BUT.....Amazon and Google have GOT to get their heads together, and come up with a way for me (and others) to access the Android apps I've ALREADY PAID FOR in the Play store.  It's ridiculous the amount of functionality you lose not being able to access those apps.  If I could link this thing to my Verizon phone, and have all my Play store apps on this thing, it would've got 4 1/2 stars instead of 3.  Very disappointed that I have to hack this thing to be able to use it to it's potential.  And before you go all \"read about it before you buy it\" on me - I received this as a gift.  I had no choice in the matter...The other 1/2 star it's lacking is an easy fix, and it flat boggles my mind that Amazon didn't include it in the programming  -  NO HAPTIC FEEDBACK OPTIONS?????????  That's basic, kindergarten-level stuff some programmer left out, and it's beyond annoying.  Really would make this thing much more user-friendly if these buttons gave me some feedback when I touched them.So overall,  3 stars.  I'd be fine with recommending it as a purchase, just do your research first and make sure you can do without your Play Store apps.

She likes her Paperwhite Kindle very much, but when I had one, I did not care for it.  I borrowed my Granddaughter's first generation Kindle Fire and liked it, so bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD.  I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love it", "Author": "Melissa Kay Krause", "ReviewID": "R15G94MN9Y8O2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great.

I didn't need a high end laptop or a desktop with an i7 processor or any kind of powerhouse. I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something. The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal.

Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for. It was an incredible deal. Returned it. Purchased apple mini with retina display for $399. Returned it. Purchased Kiindle Fire HDX 8.9. returned it.The HDX \"7\" and HDX \"8.9\" are both amazing. I settled on the \"7\" because I bought it from BEST BUY for $239. The HDX \"8.9\" was $429 for the 32 gig unit. Four things. The Display color is awesome! The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN. ( Reading View feature is only available on certain websites so  it's not on all the websites I browse but it's a fantastic feature to have!!) The audio is wonderful. I also am very impressed with the \"MAYDAY\" feature which connects you with a live technical advisor in 15 seconds by simply clicking on \"MAYDAY\".

I decided the extra bells and whistles would be nice to have also.

All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7\" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7\" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.

This is one of the highest quality tablets I have ever used.  I argue that this is just as nice as my mother's iPad.  The device is fast.  The OS has major improvements.  That was always my issue with past kindle fires.  The OS was slow and buggy and the browser was awful and you couldn't organize apps very well.This is all changed.  You can organize apps beautifully.  The amazon app store finally has enough apps where I am satisfied (even though it is still lower than google play and the apple app store, it has everything I need).  The silk browser is awesome on this device.  Even if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't switch to another browser.I have not used the mayday button because I am pretty tech savvy, but I am considering getting my grandfather one solely for this reason.If you have any doubts about purchasing this, do it.  Especially if you are a college student.  Textbooks are so cheap on the kindle store, you can highlight and make notes in them, and it syncs to all of your other kindle devices.This device is light. and when I say light, I argue that it weighs about the same as my smartphone.  I can hold it in one hand with ease all day.The battery is not as good as past kindle fires, but I can't complain because of the performance increase.  I can still get a full days use out of it as long as I am not constantly watching videos.

Content is added frequently, which is a huge concern for me.  One of our biggest struggles was that my daughter constantly wants me to download her new games, often minutes after downloading something.  FreeTime completely eliminates that, which is amazing!!I still wish many things available for the iPad were available on the Kindle and I still use the iPad more when browsing the Internet or playing games on the Internet.

It feels perfect in my hands, and I am a guy.  The placement of the on/off and volume buttons on the back instead of the sides is so much better.  Most of the time when I am holding it the buttons are exactly where they should be.  Very thoughtful.  Unlike my wife's Samsung 7\" tablet where I often have to hunt and feel for them. I thought about a 10\" Fire but liked the feel and handling of my wife's tablet.  I even thought about getting the newer version of hers but liked the specs of the Kindle Fire HDX.  The Wi-Fi is very speedy and the quad core processor allows the tablet to run without a hitch.  Everything looks amazing on the screen.  It is beautiful.  One thing different from most android tablets is the main screen.  There is no personalizing like the Samsung my wife uses such as changing desktops and widgets.  But I do not miss this at all.  The \"Special Offers\" only shows on the un-lock screen and are usually for items that I have looked at.  Often it is for books at lower prices which we like.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is a high quality tablet that everyone will enjoy using.  The size is perfect for home of travel.  The screen is a pleasure to look at.  No jerky motion.  Just smooth.

The sound quality is amazing especially for such little speakers and is much better than other competing tablets. The battery life is pretty good, though not quite as good as my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I put this tablet through a lot in a day, watching movies the battery lasts a long time. However if you play intensive online games on it, (yes they are out there) the battery will need a charge every night. Still, all day long is pretty impressive!There have been some reviews of people having issues with the wifi connections on their kindle fire hdx dropping randomly. I have had 0 problems with this. Maybe they have a previous release or theirs came from a bad batch.There are only 2 drawbacks: The apps that aren't available (no Play Store access) and the lack of an SD Card for storage expansion. I can live with it though, this snappy little tablet is worth it. The processor is one of the best for tablets of this size and the price is right.The special offers are only on the lock screen so they aren't a bother at all.

I have submitted one or two, but usually leave it to those more eloquent and well versed in the art than myself. That being said, I like to write about things, and why not write about stuff that I order off of Amazon.To be honest, I was going to give the Kindle Fire HDX a four star rating over a five, and that would have been simply for the apps available. I would really love to be able to access the Google Play store and have all the apps that I have on my phone, but that simply isn't happening, and I don't know if it's something that will be happening in the future. Amazon has their custom OS over Android here, and while it is a pleasure to use (buttery smooth and easy to navigate) it sometimes left me wanting for more as my brain would connect Android with Google apps and then not find them in the Appstore. The reason I did not let this bring my rating down was mainly because of the tablet's intended use. This is an Amazon-centric tablet, and as such can be considered as a portal through which to consume Amazon's content. I signed up for a prime membership as soon as I received the tablet and it's almost a necessity. Maybe not almost, probably just is.Having a prime membership really opens the Kindle up, giving one immediate access to all of the movies and TV shows that are marked prime and allows them unlimited viewing. If you're a reader, you're offered a free book rental every month, and hey, two day shipping for free gets you your stuff faster.My model came with the special offers because it was cheaper and they aren't obtrusive or annoying in any way. They present themselves to you as a screen saver, so when you click the power button (and it has a darn good 'click') you're shown an offer, and if you don't want the offer, you simply go ahead and unlock the tablet, start using it, and forget the ad ever happened. I can think of five things right now off the top of my head that are worse than having to see a brief offer on my screen. Not that I'm adamantly for them, they simply don't, and shouldn't matter to you.As far as what you're getting for the price, your money goes a pretty long way. The specs are in line with the best of them and the hardware is beautiful. It feels like a nice piece of tech in your hands, and that in and of itself, makes me want to use it. The screen resolution is amazing and it lends itself to the quality of the device as a whole. It's as crisp and beautiful as it should be, displayed on such a high quality piece of hardware.I actually have not tried or used the \"Mayday\" feature. As someone who is familiar and adapts very quickly to new technology, it feels like more of a novelty - to me. To someone with a less of a background, it's probably awesome. I simply haven't felt the need to use it, but it's nice to know that it's there in case I suddenly forgot how to operate things, namely Amazon tablets.In conclusion, if you have some money laying around, and aren't starving, go buy a Kindle Fire; they're cool.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great fun", "Author": "nikki horner", "ReviewID": "RK06N7FNAL6HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does almost everything.

He gave me the option of a Kindle or an iPad so I choose Kindle because I wanted something different; we have a few Apple products already. Unfortunately when I received the Kindle, there was an issue with the volume buttons on the back. They only worked half of the time. When they did work they were kind of glitchy and the times that they did not work, well, you would push the buttons numerous times and absolutely nothing would happen. So Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. Once again, this Kindle had a problem as well (maybe I have horrible luck?). This time the area that should have displayed AT&T; 4G and the signal bars read \"INVALID SIM\". It would not work. So I went to AT&T; and got a new sim card and it still did not work. I returned both Kindles and decided to not receive a third.Things I did like about the Kindle: I liked the size. I didn't really want a big tablet so the size of the 7 inch was perfect. I liked the back side of the Kindle. The iPad's back are metal so I see them as being more likely to slip out of your hands but the kindle's back made for a better grip. I like the display. Also, the speakers on the back of the kindle were great! It has a nice surround sound like quality.Things I did not like: the hardware issues.Overall, the Kindle itself was nice but problems with the hardware were not okay. I did not want to keep having replacements shipped to me until I found one that worked 100 percent. I believe that once Amazon does some more work on these devices they will be really great but until then, the Kindle is not the tablet for me.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy, happy, happy", "Author": "Unknown", "ReviewID": "R35CNOEDGHIAWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an \"android\" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a \"fix\" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7\" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need. Youtube can indeed be run through the browser.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm SUPER-thrilled with this thing!", "Author": "Shirley A.

However, my basic Kindle had a feature that my new one does not:  the ability to group books into 'collections'.  I mostly read books that come from series.  Call me crazy, but I get invested in characters.  I have several different series that I enjoy, so it frustrates me that I cannot group books in the same series to one collection.

The audio function will work for a few pages and stop on 1 title, or on another title stop at the beginning of each chapter, etc..  After several hours with 6 different people at \"Amazon assist\" , I now have been told a work ticket has been sent to developers about the issue and I will probably hear something from someone within 5 days.  The 6 people have all been extremely nice, courteous and completely baffled with this problem.  I love the Amazon assist button.There has been an inference that perhaps it is a fault of the publishers causing the problem.  My older Kindle, however, plays the same books without any glitches.

I haven't owned a tablet before but I've played around on other's iPads. I feel like this tablet is very comparable to an iPad but at almost half the cost, I would pick the Kindle every time. I chose the 7\" instead of the 8.9\" because I like the smaller tablet and I personally would never hold up something so big to take a picture, especially when I have my phone or digital camera.Cons:- There is a blue/purple haze around the border of the screen that is visible on white. It actually doesn't bother me at all but it does bother some people. I don't even notice it's there unless I specifically pay attention to it. Even though it doesn't bother me, I would rather it not be there.- Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad. For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.- I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on. It's not really THAT big of an issue but it does take more effort than usual to plug it in.- This is more my fault for not reading/understanding the Prime benefits, but you only get the benefits of Prime if your account pays for it, not when you get added and another account pays for it (which completely makes sense). I was really looking forward to \"borrowing\" Kindle books for free and downloading movies to watch later offline but my husband wanted to keep paying for prime on his account and I didn't want to put my Kindle under his account or have both of us pay for Prime.Overall, I love my Kindle and it's a great tablet for the price.

On Christmas day I used my kindle as my cook book for my entire Christmas feast but the day after Christmas I couldn't find it at all, I looked everywhere.  It turns out that my grandmother who has Alzheimer was doing the dishes and put it in the dishwasher, the dishwasher was run the next morning on the hottest/longest setting and my husband found it and just about lost his mind!  He immediately put it in a bag of rice to try to dry it out.  It turns out that the thing still works!  I cant even believe it.  There is distortion on the screen and I'm pretty sure that it isn't showing the correct battery percentage because it is at 0% and still on, but it turns on and runs apps.

Without any changes from the factory set up, we had to charge the tablet once every two days with about 45 minutes use each time.  Unacceptable.There is a lack of educational software compared to Android and Ipad.The software for kids is okay.

The OS is limited and the kid time application sacrifices a lot of capability without buying an add-on program.  If it were a tablet for me, it would be fine if I could find something to extend battery life.  I can see most people enjoying this tablet.

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3RK1YPEQMC4EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to like? This is probably the best piece of hardware out there for the price hands down. I have 2 iPads, iPhones, iMac. I love the Mac environment and iOS.  The hardware is obviously quite expensive, but if you use the device even 1-2 hours a day I would pay the extra and get the iPad. If you don't use the device regularly or if you're an Amazon-o-phile and your whole world revolves around Amazon, the Fire is the only logical alternative IMHO.  I prefer my iPad in almost every way, but I like the small size of the 7\" to carry to town, mall, church or whatever instead of hauling around the iPad. It's an amazing price, and that's the best feature about this device.  I love the nice PPI resolution, which makes me feel right at home while reading.  The speakers are the next biggest stand-out feature that I really love about the HDX.  The first time I sat down to watch a movie on it, the sound literally blew me away!  It made the movie twice as interesting to hear the amazing surround sound or perhaps even 3-D sound if that's possible, awesome bass, great range, nice to hear it coming from both sides of the device when in landscape mode, all things I would expect from the more expensive iPad, but dont find! Also plenty of power if it's anywhere near close enough to see the screen.  I just have to gripe about the Amazon tweaks and control of the Android OS that just doesn't feel as customizable or as intuitive as plain old Android OS or obviously iOS.  Again for my purposes of mostly reading books, and the occasional movie, or browsing, this environment is actually just fine, but not my first choice, perhaps after using it long enough I'll learn to actually appreciate it, we'll see.  I wish it could be thinner and lighter of course, but I'd rather have the longer battery life that it does have vs. being lighter weight, with technology where its at right now.  I'm thankful for the wake sleep feature with the right case. I love that it has BT where a lot of cheap tablets in this price range tend to leave it out.  So far I've found all the Apps in the Amazon App Store that are important to me, so the App limitations haven't really bothered me yet. They seem to have a really good selection.  I do like not having to worry about bugs or viruses by only using Apps that are patrolled by Amazon, kind of like Apple does. It gives me a nice feeling of security.  Over-all, I can hardily recommend the HDX to anyone that doesn't use iTunes, or have an iPhone or Mac.  And to those looking to just get their feet wet in the tablet experience using it only occasionally. If you plan to really be using it a lot, I would instead highly recommend paying the extra money to get an iPad mini or Air, it's well worth the extra investment.  However this is a great starter tablet for kids or to just dabble yourself a little bit to see if tablets are really all they are cracked up to be!  I didn't get on the tablet bandwagon for almost 2 years, thinking they were just a passing fad, and were terribly limited compared to netbooks... well, after I saw they weren't going away after all, I got one, and I have never regretted it since!

The new features on the HDX and the positive reviews finally moved me to make a purchase, and I must say I am very impressed! It was very easy and quick to set-up and your having exploring and having fun. I am considering enabling the parental controls to limit my time on it!I purchased the 7\" because in my mind, I could not justify the jump in cost to get the equivalent 32GB in the 8.9 HDX fire. I also wanted something that would fit in my purse vs. having to carry something else around. I was a bit concerned about the ability to read text on such a small screen, but it really isn't an issue because the screen gives a very crisp picture and there is a magnify feature. Don't get me wrong, if you need glasses to read, you will still need glasses to read ;) I am very happy with the speakers for music and movies, etc.. You get a healthy volume with a quality sound that others in a room can easily hear.There are some neat features that I don't believe are advertised. One, is on the keyboard. There is a microphone symbol that when it is selected, transcribes your spoken word into text. Also, I was confused about whether a anti-virus or malware app would be required. The community forum had a number of conflicting opinions on the subject, so I chatted with kindle support. The representative assured me that the Kindle is already designed with all the security algorithms necessary. She added that there are apps available for anti-virus and malware if anyone wanted them. In addition, she advised me that the browser has a option called Security in the options menu, which will provide you a warning if you are about to Enter a potentially harmful site.Bottom line....

I have the old Kindle Fire and a Galaxy Tab 3, 10.1. Amazon did a great job with all the little extras they added to the HDX. If you have an old Fire a side by side comparison will have you loving the HDX. It is lighter,  faster, easier to maneuver around the system, the presentation/organization is cleaner, and the screen itself seems to keep off fingerprint smudges better. Another favorite is the ability to put books in collections. A set back on this ability is not being able to change the listing of the books within the collection's pop up window. The only available view is a grid view, and it's hard to see the books in this view.I would say that the volume output on the new Fire HDX is better than the Galaxy Tab 3. You can easily understand the conversation on videos and hear the musical notes on online radio as long as you don't become too picky about the notes. Picture quality is better than the Galaxy Tab 3 too. The colors are clearer, image is sharper, quite comparable to one of the better HD TV's on sale today. I was very surprised at discovering this. The TV we have takes quite a bit of power, now I just watch Netflix and Hulu on the HDX and get the same quality, less electric consumption, but not the big screen.Good battery life if all you're doing is reading or listening to music. Expect to plug it in more if you surf or watch videos. If you are planning to use it in sunlight, you'll need a lot of patience, but that is not the reason for buying the HDX. If most of your reading, watching and surfing activities are indoors, then you'll be fine.I bought a Fintie cover for it, the Fintie comes with 'buttons' that go over the HDX's existing buttons. These make pressing the power and volume buttons easier, and allows for better touch recognition too.Does it take the place of a laptop? Absolutely not. I do not believe any tablet will ever take the place of strong processors and lots of storage for people who 'work' on laptops.

I like the 64 GB and quad core processor.  The dual band wi-fi can use more power than my Internet can really deliver.  I will probably have to update my whole Internet package.  When I use the wi-fi to do downloads, everything on my wi-fi slows to a crawl and my Internet movies on Amazon and home computer freeze till it is done.  I think my phone company only offers 100 Mbps with my current package. This kindle is powerful and takes over my whole Wi-Fi service.The power adapter is a little different this year and goes in at an angle (thought it didn't fit).  The adapter comes with the Kindle.I will be keeping my old Kindle Fire HD, because I still enjoy it and some of the old apps I am not tired of yet (not compatible to HDX).  I will be able to upload more of my pdf's to this newer Kindle, because pdf's use a lot more space. Also I can download more TV shows and movies, since I live in the Amazon ecosystem.I like the clock on the screen is back. When I open the Kindle cover, the clock is in the corner with the date.  That was not on the HD, but was on the first Fire (it was bigger).I like the offers, because it is important to me what else is available.  The screen is beautiful as always. I did have to make some adjustments to brightness (using settings) and the books (using view) I am reading. Actually for us older folks, brighter is better.The sound is nice.

Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.  Due to the friendliness of the agent that responded, I found out I was only like the 10th person to use it that morning, as it's still a new feature, and the agents are new to this too!  She was EXTREMELY helpful and kind and informed me it could take a couple hours to receive this promotional credit.Last but not least...the power cable.  It is at a FUNKY angle on the tablet in order to keep with the contoured angle of the tablet edge.  It angles upward while plugged in properly.  If not careful, I can see this charging port or cable becoming damaged easily.Beyond those few issues, this is an excellent tablet, it's perfectly sized, fits well in the hand, the screen is bright (I see none of the blue tint as others are describing), and the support is phenomenal!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Christmas Gift She Loves", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "R2Z48UY20WV9ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife already had a Kindle.

Another plus to the device is the Appstore has grown a lot since the first kindle fire.  It has most of the games that iOS has.

As soon as I logged in with my account all my kindle content synced up! I got the free trial so I had picked the kindle with the ads and I did not feel like the ads were bothersome at all. They mostly showed up when the tablet was in a 'sleep' status so I saw them when I was turning it back on. I even clicked on some out of curiosity since they are items I would be interested in. I did not add any extra apps so I just used what was already installed. It was a bit of a learning curve since I have been using an iPad but I was able to figure it out without much trouble. The browser is user friendly and the menus are not hard to use (once you figure out where the controls are). I mostly used it to watch movies and shows from amazon since I have Prime. I loved being able to take it around the house and not have a sore wrist! It is very light and the screen felt pretty hardy so i didn't worry about scratching the screen or the possibility of it dropping. The screen was crystal clear so I thoroughly enjoyed watching movies and shows on it ( the imdb inserts during shows and movies were a plus for me). I thought its size would be a disadvantage but it felt just like a regular size tablet. I liked that I could easily carry it in my handbag without feeling the extra weight or bulk! Battery life was decent. I was able to use it continuosly for at least 3 hours before it got critically low, although I noticed that even plugged to the wall it would somehow still be on and wouldn't be 100% charged? (could have been tks I wasn't physically turning it off during charge time) I assumed that maybe it was because ads popped up during this time. I had a hard time returning it but I wasn't quite ready to part with that amount of money right then. I still want to get one for sure!!!! So basically to sum it up, this tablet is a small, delightfully light, hardy, crystal clear, fast (in my opinion), and handy tablet. If you use Amazon a lot, it is a great tablet to have! I buy and rent e-books from Amazon, and have purchased most of my music from here too so, it was great to access all my content from it! I didn't think I would want one but after test driving it for a month now I really really do want to get one!

In fact, on the Kindle Fire HDX website under the \"Kindle for Kids\" section it states \" Parents can create a profile for each of their children and choose what books, apps, games, and videos they want to give their kids access to.\"  This sounded great and exactly what I wanted for a media device for the kids.  However, upon setting the new Kindle up I found that the maximum number of accounts possible is 4.

I own a kindle keyboard so this is a huge upgrade for me. I am a huge fan of amazon and I did plenty of research on this product before even though I knew I would love it. I am a huge fan of the kindle. For those of you that post bad ratings due to lack of apps or other stupid things is your own fault for not researching this product first. This product is a KINDLE. This is not an ipad or other kind of tablet. For a kindle this is a very good tablet. The kindle was originally made to read books and even though now it is more centered around internet usage, it is still for reading. No you will not find the same features and capabilities on this kindle as you will on another higher level tablet. For the price paid for this kindle it is truly worth it. The color is beautiful and the processor is very responsive and clear. It really is a great upgrade for the kindle. It may not be up to the same level as an ipad but for the price and the fact that it's a kindle makes it amazing. This product is for amazon lovers and those who are dedicated to amazon. I have a prime membership and I have already tested out some of the videos which are great. I also love the sound and how the volume buttons are on the back. I understand that some of you actually have received a defective tablet and that would be a good reason to give it a low rating but it is a new piece of technology so there are going to be some defective ones. As far as the blue or purple hue when reading that everyone pointed out goes, I don't know if it is different on different kindles but mine is very faint and I can hardly notice it. It is definitely not a big deal. There are too many people comparing the kindle to an ipad. No it will not have all the same apps because kindle has its own browser called silk. There however is still a lot of apps available and I assume the popular ones wouldn't be hard to find. There is also a way to sideload apps and all it takes is some research on youtube to figure out how. I am very impressed with this kindle and I understand its greatness. For those of you that hated it because you did not do your research, you should be looking in to this stuff before you buy it. Again, the kindle is for amazon lovers and those who mainly enjoy reading and surfing the web. For those of you that simply play games and want a ton of apps, a different tablet would probably be better for you. I can't wait to learn more about my kindle and experience the other great things that are yet to come.

I'm coming from an Apple ecosystem. I have Apple everything. This is my first non Apple purchase. I really love the iPad but the market has changes since I bought the original version. There are way more options. The Kindle was a fraction of the cost of the ne iPad mini retina. The screen is gorgeous. I find it the perfect size for watching movies in the hand. Amazon makes it very easy to move your music over to the Amazon ecosystem from Apple if you want to do that. For 20ish bucks a year you can move all your apple music to the cloud at Amazon. From there you can download whatever songs you want to your Kindle or just play them from the cloud. Very easy.I was initially worried about not having access to the full Android spectrum of apps. It hasn't proven to be an issue at all. It took me about 10 minutes to sidestep the Amazon store and install Chrome and Firefox. I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser. I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all. This processor is speedy.A big upgrade from my iPad 1. The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1. I didn't know if I would be OK with the smaller screen bit I'm enjoying it quite a bit. The more convenient size has be taking the kindle with me more than I ever did with the iPad. The iPad was really just too big to lug around. The kindle slips into my coat pocket easy.The special offers on the home screen don't bother me at all. Once you swipe to unlock the Kindle they go away and don't bother you at all.Mayday is awesome! I had a question just today that I couldn't find the answer to so I tried it. Within 15 seconds I had a technician on my screen helping me out. She was courteous and helpful and solved my problem quickly. Really glad I made the switch.

OH my the screen is gorgeous. This gift was to my mom for the holidays and she couldn't have been happier. It replaced her existing first gen kindle and that upgrade is akin to going from a schwinn to a ferrari. Fast, easy to use, intuitive and did I mention that screen? Wow.The unit is super light and the 7\" form factor is perfect for her. She can read books in bed or use the apps as a kitchen assistant. Accessories are a bit pricey, but that's become the de facto standard for any iDevice or other. First world problems, I know.We/She hasn't had to use the mayday button, but just knowing that it's there is piece of mind for my husband who usually plays the role of tech support for our family's cache of gadgets. Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer. The only other mini-tab we were considering was the Nexus 7, but it was a gift for the not exactly tech savy 65 year old mother, so we wanted the familiarity and sandboxing of the Kindle HDX.Would we have liked it to have native access to the Google Play store? Sure, but most apps that mom would use are represented in the kindle store, so it's not a huge negative.Pros: Cost, incredible screen, ease of entry, light weightcons: no native google play store, expensive accessoriesverdict?

But before I get to what drags the score down for me, the good stuff about the Kindle Fire HDX:- Clearly more than a reader.  The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me. The good news is that many of these can be fixed; the question is whether they might actually be fixed. Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store. This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with. I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes!!!

The blue backlight in the device allows less power consumption and it provides the screen with a vibrant crisp image.The bottom line is, If you are getting a tablet as a gift this season, right now at this price, it doesn't get any better.

Over the next 4 years I purchased the Kindle Fire, the Kindle Fire HD, and now the Kindle Fire HDX (64Gb), all 7\" models.  Each Fire model has been a significant improvement over its predecessor, although of course none come remotely close to the battery life of the electronic ink models.  That being said, as a reader, battery life for all the Fire models is fine for those long airplane trips, where you have the bonus of the device playing music while you read.  Other reviewers have covered battery life for those willing to watch movies on such a small screen.  Being able to mirror movies from Amazon Prime onto my TV is good enough for my purposes.So what else is noticeably improved?  First off, the HDX is noticeably thinner, lighter, and faster.  Second, if your email requires VPN, there is an integrated VPN client that is almost trivial to set up (you may have to download the Thor OS upgrade for this, I did).  The provided email app connected easily for me. and I found new versions of apps I typically use, such as ES File Explorer and a really good (free) SSH terminal emulation app that works great on the HDX.I debated long and hard as to whether an upgrade from my HD was advisable at this time, and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm glad I did.  The HDX is living up to the hype.  I even found the help feature useful.  It connected immediately to a knowledgeable individual who pointed me to the need to upgrade the OS in order to get the VPN client.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade", "Author": "Bobbe", "ReviewID": "R2G7JIXDQYES45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved the original Kindle Fire, this one is better.

I think he had forgotten we had already checked that and my kindle was up to date.  Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.

My Kindle arrived with special offers enabled, though I'd ordered without them. An email to customer support resulted in a reply within a couple hours, on Christmas Eve no less, with the sponsored ads removed, no charge. Incidentally, I think it would be useful if there was a way to opt back in for that content in order to receive the special offers in an unobtrusive manner. If this was controllable by the user that might be useful.I rate the poor marketing due to the following information in the product description: \"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in OfficeSuite, and updated e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more\"There is no built-in OfficeSuite. There is a built-in VIEWER.  A viewer is a very different product from an office suite. One can read documents but not be very productive if unable to produce documents, spreadsheets or presentations. This in my mind is just false and misleading advertising. A deciding factor in purchasing this product was the presence of a built-in office suite tool. You won't even know this either, unless you go looking on the product forum, as I and others have done, posting \"where is the built-in OfficeSuite? That should tell Amazon something - consumers are expecting a true suite of office tools. Either include one or more accurately portray what is on board.I chose this device after one too many crashes with my first gen iPad. So far, I'm happy with the technology. It's intuitive, easy to use and the images on the screen are exceedingly clear and sharp. Set-up was easy and fast. The very simple on board customer service is in strong contrast to getting help from Apple, which is no where near as easy. That's a definite positive factor for this product.

HOWEVER, no access to google voice, hangouts, maps, Music, keep, gmail, docs, google calendar, and chrome makes this tablet limited in its awesomeness.  I use a laptop for most of my internet and \"productivity\" related tasks so no integration with the google ecosystem isn't a deal breaker for me.  But it sure would be nice to be able to have hangouts, keep, maps, and voice.  Almost 100% of my IMing happens in hangouts or facebook chat, neither of which are in the Amazon market, and I would love to check my texts with google voice on the tablet.  No gmail, chrome, docs, or calendar isn't a big deal because the substitutes they have are good enough, and no music is understandable because Amazon has their own music app BUT for light social applications and looking at Maps I really wish amazon would make a deal with Google or create  decent native apps that integrates with them.With that being said, I still like the HDX 7\" better than the nexus 7 tablet because of the seamless integration with the amazon ecosystem and amazing access to content through prime.

Google Nexus 7 (2013)7.) Nvidia Shield8.) ASUS Transformer TF-101First, let me say I think the Kindle Fire platform is really nice when compared to the straight-up Google android experience.  Amazon does a great job of bridging the technical gaps for a user wanting to use a tablet and not have to constantly enter their email and password.  The Amazon docs, photos, music and video compare better in use to Apple's iCloud experience and makes the Amazon prime a solid investment.  Additionally, the horsepower of the Kindle HDX is amazing and makes this tablet for the holiday 2013 season a solid gaming platform.  My own benchmarking of the Kindle Fire HDX shows that gaming performance and CPU performance place this unit within the same performance bracket as the current generation of iPads and the Nvidia sheild.  Which is saying something when the HDX is half the cost of an iPad mini and 2/3rds the cost of a Nvidia shield.My disappointment comes from the screen on the Kindle fire HDX.  The HDX's screen shows a very visible and noticeable blue ring around the display's edge.  I've measured the blue ring to be one-eighth of inch along the long edges of the screen and slightly less on the short edges of the screen.  These blue edges really become notable when you are reading a book or browsing a web page that have white page backgrounds.  The blue ringing is much less noticeable when viewing the carousel page (which are grey) or running a app that uses something darker around the edges.I can not recommend the Kindle Fire HDX to my friends, family and colleagues because of what I consider to be design defect in the screen.

It didn't even occur to me to look for this, the old Kindle Fire HD has it, so I guess I thought it would be a given.  Instead it relies on Miracast.  Miracast is supposed to be like a wireless HDMI standard, but you have to buy a $50+ device to make it work.  The other thing missing from this is USB hosting, which is present in every Android 3.1+ device.  I wanted to use my Kindle Fire HDX to upload photos from my camera to Facebook and the like while I was out on vacation by using a Micro USB SD Card Reader.The no HDMI thing doesn't bug me as much as the USB thing, I really wanted to be able to look at my vacation photos on my Kindle Fire HDX while I was out on vacation.  To be honest, if I hadn't bought this on Cyber Monday I would be returning it for a Nexus 7 for just this one thing.  Maybe its a software limitation that Amazon can fix, I don't know, but I hope it is, and they do indeed fix it.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Regarding Blue Light.....", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RIEDN27K0KKN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Regarding blue light........I poured through all the reviews on this device, so I was well aware of the negativity surrounding the blue light used in the Kindle.  I would say this:  If your intended use of this device is to read Kindle books, I would run away.  Far away.  Go with the black&white; Kindle.  But, if you plan on doing just about anything else, the Kindle HDX is an excellent choice.  You'll never notice the blue edges, except for maybe web pages.What blew me away most about the Kindle was the sound.  I have had every iPad since day 1 and have always just accepted the speaker quality.  I'll still use my iPad simply because of all the Apps I already enjoy, but for movies and TV shows I'll go to the Kindle every time.  Amazing sound.  Why can't Apple do this with the iPad?Bottom line is:  Buy it. It is well worth the money.  I bought the one with the ads and they don't really bother me at all.

My youngest is enjoying the free games -- haven't had any issues with any of the programs yet -- battery life is pretty good though we have to charge it every day (maybe it isn't that good, I don't know.  This is our first Kindle).Shipping was wicked fast.  Even with buying it on Thanksgiving night...we had it by Monday.  Then lo and behold a few days later it was (of course) an additional $50 off.  Quick online chat with Kindle customer service (about 7 minutes) and BAM!  $50 refunded and an email confirmation thanking me for allowing them to refund me $50 LOL!Set up was cake -- less than 5 minutes and we were off and rolling.  Amazon sent an email the day it was delivered with links to everything we needed.  Unit moves through any program we throw at it with ease.  Videos/movies - games - web sites are all quick and crystal clear.  Haven't tried all it has to offer yet -- but I see no reason to worry  I have no complaints. The one I did have (price drop) got taken care immediately.I'm certain some people do have problems -- but rather than run to Amazon reviews to complain -- most sane people at least contact Amazon first to try to fix the problem.  I get so tired of the negative reviews that say \"all these positive reviews are made up/fake because I had problems with mine!\" I tend to lean along the lines that someone who is that paranoid and angry/bitter/nasty about it is not going to be a credible source for my buying choices.Very Happy!

This version is improved over last years. The screen and sound are amazing! I did compare side by side and there is noticeable clarity in the picture quality playing a movie. The set up was very fast, love that the charger is included this year. The Kindle came already registered to me, saving time in setup. I have not set up email yet but previous versions worked fine. The wi fi connected very fast, an improvement from the HD model, where at times I have had to turn the kindle off and on to get a connection.  This is slightly smaller and lighter than the HD version. That is not a plus to me because I like the wider edge on the HD. So an old case will not fit. What I do not like is the rearranged buttons for power and volume! They are located on the back side and the kindle will require a specialized case in order to access them if it is being used in the case. They also did away with the HDMI port ! I use that feature on my original HD model frequently. Also the cable port is at an angle and off to one side. This is probably because the device is so thin. It compares to the I pad mini, but the mini has a larger viewing area.  If you have last years model I would keep it. If you do not own a Fire yet you will not be dissatisfied with the HDX.  I have not tried out the camera, I am already spoiled with the I pad mini camera which is wonderful, so it does not make a difference that the Kindle has one.  My favorite feature is Amazon Prime videos, and the speakers.  This is an excellent device for the price!

Looks great, fast and easy to use.", "Author": "MikeR", "ReviewID": "RYMD7JSQL312P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an owner of the first kindle way back when they cost a crazy amount (about $500) and it was a big clunky ereader but it did its job and I was impressed with its technology (I work in IT so I am a tech / gadget guy).  Since then I have tried out different tablets, smart phones and computers and over the years I have been buying more and more Apple products (I currently have the 5s, Ipad 3rd Gen and MacBook Air) and I still think Apple makes a hell of a product but my wife and I also still enjoy our kindles.  I am also a Amazon Prime member so when I saw the new Fire HDX and the good reviews I thought I would give this \"mini\" a shot.  So far everything has worked very well and the first thing that pops out if the graphics...  they really pop and it is eye candy.  The second thing you notice is the speed, this little guy is fast and while I agree the application store is a little limited it does well with what is available (and I am sure since Amazon is selling a lot of these things that the developers will make many more and ensure popular Apps from other devices are also offered on this...  might just take a little time for them to show up).  The third thing I noticed is the OS is clean and user friendly.  Some people might think its basic or limited but they have a very common sense approach on how to get to all the content.  when I was using this I was thinking... if I was going to get a tablet for my parents or non tech savvy friends and family this would be it.  With the clean easy to use OS and the mayday  option I could see this being a cost effective option for many people.  I end up being the tech support person for my family when anything breaks or has an issue or just end user questions so I think this device would take care of most of that.  Also after trying this out the last few days I now notice the weight of my full size Ipad and while at home I still enjoy using my Ipad the HDX is what I grab when I walk out the door.  Its does everything I want when I am out and about but in a much smaller lighter easy to use bundle.  So if you picked this up for the Cyber Monday deal of $179 this guy has a lot of bang for the buck, if you already use a lot of apple devices I am sure the Apple Mini is just as good though it costs a little more but if you want to try something new, want something that is a little more cost effective or easy to use for the more technology impaired (or if you have Prime membership) then this is worth the shot.  Amazon also has a great return policy if for some reason you decide the HDX is not for you once you give it a shot.  I think it's a keeper and I might end up getting a few more for my Parents and In-laws as I think this is something they would enjoy and could handle that would cut out the ongoing IT support I usually have to provide ;-)", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible value, and just plain incredible.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3PTBYQ85CD7V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in awe.

I've owned nearly every generation of the standard Amazon Kindle and use the Kindle App on my iPhone (and on my wife's iPad). I thought about getting an iPad for myself, but I was just looking for a backlit device to read Kindle books on with text-to-speech. The grad-school text book I'm reading on Survey Methods is pretty dry and I was hoping to listen to it in the car (it's not available on Audible). The latest Kindle Paperwhite doesn't support text-to-speech so I went with the Kindle Fire HDX.The first thing I tried to read was a course handout (PDF). The font-scaling on the PDF document was blocky, inconsistent, and difficult to read. This wasn't the case on the iPad, even on the iPad mini without a retina display. With low lighting in the room it was hard to ignore the uneven backlighting towards the edges (dark and/or purple fringing on all four edges).I switched over to the Kindle and went to read through an actual Kindle Store purchase. I reversed the colors (white text on black background) to make the screen easier on my eyes and make the backlighting issues less pronounced. There was immediately noticeable color-shifting on the white text towards purple. I tried to ignore it and kept reading. I went to try out text-to-speech in the middle of an all-text chapter and it wouldn't play. I turned the page and tried again and it played fine. There doesn't seem to be any logic as to which pages will/wont support text-to-speech.Pros:More feature rich Kindle app than the iOS versionText-to-speechCons:PDFs don't scale wellScreen backlighting near edges (I've never seen a backlit display where the issue was this pronounced)White-text color-shiftingWith the above issues I can't recommend this as a Kindle device.

Just as Apple lovers say you couldn't give them a Kindle Fire, you couldn't give me an iPad. Both are great products but appeal to different people. I did keep my original Kindle Paperwhite rather than upgrading but may jump on the next one depending on the specs. I think the idea of the May Day button is great but I haven't used it. Since I'm on my third Fire I've just not run into anything I need help with yet. If I do need help I'll be glad it's there. Everyone's experience is never the same so I feel for those who have had problems. But this I know, Amazon will make it right.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Enough", "Author": "Fred Dempster \"FAD\"", "ReviewID": "R3LR8UYDYMQWDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really like the new FIRE HDX 32GB. Good enough means I would expect to pay a lot more for perfect. Yes there is a bit of blue if you push the video, do not see on movies, and I use my Kindle PW for reading. The new origami case is cool, used last night watching a movie as I handed out Halloween candy. Still learning some of the less used features as I go.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CUTT4HY"}}
