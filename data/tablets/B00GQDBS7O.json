The retina is pretty but to me its unnecessary; i thought the resolution on my iPad 2 looked just fine.  The newer processer in the mini with retina is what really impresses me.  I didn't realize that i had gotten accustomed to waiting a few seconds for apps to open and again while switching between them.  This new iPad mini doesn't have any of that \"lag\" i experienced with the iPad 2.  It switches between apps seamlessly and quickly.  It also has impressive battery life, i can start the week with it fully charged, watch netflix on my breaks and lunches at work and i will usually run out of juice about the end of the day thursday.  And i use it throughout the day to check emails, online banking, send iMessages etc.  Also, despite some reservations i had at first about the smaller screen size, the clarity more than makes up for it and it is the perfect size for holding in one hand.

Yeah I know its not as sharp or colorful as the Kindle and some other tablets, but the difference is slight and nothing beats the feel and functionality of an apple.I'm really enjoying it.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best ipad ever", "Author": "Cynthia", "ReviewID": "R26PNUWPQQDPN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love it.

I'm not going to list them all because other reviewers have listed most of them already. I do have to say if you are looking for a tablet because you are planning on buying and reading books, I would highly recommend this. In my opinion the kindle app on this tablet is perfect for reading books. For me, reading on this really feels like reading a book and doesn't feel like reading on a tablet. When I set the color to sepia and turn the brightness low, the screen does not burn my eyes at all.Most people might already know this but I wanted to mention that the kindle app is slightly different on other tablets. I don't know why but the kindle app for the ipad mini gives you more options than the Samsung galaxy tablets. Apple's kindle app lets you change the font and lets you highlight text in 4 colors. You can't change the font with Samsung's kindle app and you can only highlight with 1 color instead of 4. I also want to mention the color sepia is also different in other devices. I personally prefer apples version of the color sepia because it doesn't burn my eyes when I'm reading books.If you are planning on buying this to play games, I would highly recommend getting 32gb or more. 16gb is really not a lot of space if you are downloading a lot of games. Apple actually has a lot of great games so trust me will download more games than you expected...The only thing I don't like about the iPad Mini with retina display is that a lot of the free games have way too much adds and commercials. Other than that I can't think of anything else I don't like about this device.

The iPad mini is just so much better than everything else. Sorry, Amazon! I love Amazon but even the latest Kindle fire is UGLY and very difficult to use. All Android tablets are boring and susceptible to viruses.  The iPad mini gives a consistent experience. I just wish the App Store had a grid listing view like on Windows 8. Other than that my iPad mini connects to WiFi every time and maximizes the speed, unlike the other tablets. The screen is totally the best! I play Amazon videos and they've never looked better.

I changed my galaxy tab 3 8 inch for this one, and will not say the tab 3 is a bad choice but the ipad mini retina is a superior tablet, the build quality is amazing! The look and design are flawless, The speed is also excellent and of course the screen resolution is where the money is. The rear camera takes excellent  pictures just as good as the iphone 5 i belive, and the front facing camera also has good resolution. In terms of Apps, i believe the Apple apps seem to be a bit better designed than android's, but android does have its perks. For example i miss the utorrent app!, also android's openness and the huge customization options it offers. But again i tell you this ipad mini with retina display is an incredible device, and i guaranteed you will not be disapointed with it. I watch movies in it mostly on netflix, they look great, i also do all of my social media, web surfing  and emailing with no trouble. One of the things that got me to buy this ipad, where the excellent free apps tha come with it, it comes with: imovie, iphoto, garageband, keynote, numbers, and pages and they are all amazing apps, and i believe they are all worth about 45$, so it's a great value, specially if you are like me, who makes music all the time and edit videos also from time to time.

Just the right size, not too small (although I do also own an iPod and iPhone) and not too large, but just right. I had first bought a Nexus tablet thinking I'll save a little $, but now that I have this iPad mini, I can say that was the wrong strategy because the Apple is sooooo much better that the Gooooogle.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT.

However, as you will see below I have some major gripes with the price/features combination for this model. Lately I have been seriously thinking about upgrading my iPad 3. Tried the new Samsung Tab 10.1 (2014), iPad Air, and this Mini. Neither one of those larger tables really tempted me to give up on my iPad 3. Yes, they were a bit better in this and in that, but eventually neither one felt twice as good as my iPad 3 to justify their price (I figured that I would have to double the $280 or so that would get after selling my iPad 3).iPad Mini retina did feel like a major upgrade in terms of size and weight. In fact, it is a better value in terms of size/weight vs screen size against iPad 3: you are dropping 50% of the weight and only losing 33% of the screen real estate (and nothing in resolution, of course). Surprisingly, most of the time I did not even feel any limitations of the smaller screen. I think part of the reason that made me like the new iPad Mini was that lately I have got a MBPr and the need for a larger retina screen now is satisfied by the laptop while the compactness of the tablet becomes more important.However, there are two main problems that I have with the new Mini. One, is the limited gamut of the screen. I might be picky, but I do see the difference and not only side by side, but also when moving from one device to another. The larger iPad's home screen looks simply gorgeous in comparison to the Mini's home screen. (Probably, part of the reason is that I kept iOS 6 on my iPad 3 and it's color scheme is less \"whitish.\")Another problem is pricing. How come after all these years of upgrading its larger tablets without increasing the price Apple decided to do it differently with the iPad Mini? The \"original\" iPad Mini was $330 and the iPad Mini retina is $400? Yes, the Mini got better, but the Air got better too with no price increase, same thing with iPad 4, iPad 3, and iPad 2. If they kept the price at $330 I would overlook the bleaker screen and go for it. Or if the screen had 100% gamut I would pay $400. But not both. I can not justify paying that much money while not feeling that I am getting a premium product. There are way cheaper tablets out there with 100% gamut and I do not want to pay $400 for a tablet and feel that it is inferior to a $220 tablet when it comes to such an important parameter as its screen.You can see how much fewer reviews of this tablet are out there on amazon compared to the iPad Air. Seems like people are just not buying this model as much. I am returning the Mini and waiting until Apple comes up with an upgraded model that has 100% gamut screen. And they better not add another $70-$100 chunk on the top of the price when it happens!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "One day shipping?
