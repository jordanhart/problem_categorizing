If you need it to watch videos, read, check on social websites and others, the item is perfect.Pros:- The price of course.- Design looks much more expensive and it seems to be good quality, even the box and package look pretty.- Touch is very responsive and has 5 finger capabilities.- Carries the Google Play Store.- Expandable memory, HDMI, native USB port, external speakers for only $70.- Has the latest Android OS version.Cons:- Battery life is too short.- The screen brightness and resolution is not as crisp as other tablets, but nothing painful, it looks OK (I just made a comparison with my Toshiba tablet that has LED screen).I purchased two units for my mom and girlfriend.

Suggest external expansion if you are a heavy app user;- Sound quality is just OK, for gaming, don\u2019t expect more than that.In short, great value android tablet, best gift for kids.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It worked as I expected.", "Author": "RODOLFO FERNANDEZ", "ReviewID": "R1KLBB8K875PKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far it has been performed perfectly.

Make sure you plug it in straight and pull it out straight and don't tug on it hard though and you'll be fine. But if you don't take care, these types of charging ports break easy. BUT they also DO charge off the USB, so even if the charging pin breaks, you can buy a cheap USB charger for a few dollars or charge from a computer.Over all good value for the money.

It ran fine until a couple months after I ordered it, until it stopped charging. I cleaned the charger and the where it plugs into the tablet, but no luck, I tried to return it but it said the return option had expired. I did not drop it or spill anything on it, I babied the thing and it still broke, talk about being cheap, I would not recommend this product to anyone if I could return it and get my money back I would, plus the manual didnt even have a number for me to call to talk to someone, I personally think the company is awful for doing this.

Web browsing, watching video on YouTube, running little app game, no problem at all, wifi signal sometimes weak, guess it has to go thru a few walls, make sure you stay close to wifi router when you try to watch online video.Anyway, can't complain about the price.Good buy, highly recommend!", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Tablet", "Author": "Sylvia Livingston", "ReviewID": "RC72BTXIPIJC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Didn't expect more from a tablet that worth only 60 USD, but was stunned by the performance.

It operates netflix good, however it can not operate large apps simultaneously.
