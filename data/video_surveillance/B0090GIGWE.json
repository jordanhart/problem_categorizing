The only down side was I was able to view on one cell phone but not the other, I don't know whether it only allows one cell phone to access or it is a issue with my phone or carrier, but no big deal, as long as one of us, wife or husband can check in during the day and see what is going on that is all that matters. Thanks for making it easy.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works OK", "Author": "SebastianA", "ReviewID": "RA57EEM7GS3ZR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First I was confused because I was expecting the cameras to be Sony branded and the outside was just the way are the Zmodo cameras, so I sent an email and they explained that the sensors in my cameras were Sony.The quality of image is fine, but is not the most clear image. But I can't complain because you can see enough details through image. Works good during night and day as well.You have to figure out what to do if the cables are not long enough, so you might think about that before you try to install the system.If you have to connect the DVR to a TV you have to buy the cable and adaptors, so think about that. If you have a computer monitor you don't have to worry about that.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "regular cameras", "Author": "Moncho", "ReviewID": "RF4YF310C3INW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "dvr works fine but the cameras do not have very good resolution but for the price this is more than good", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "View Video Online with No Service Fees - View your DVR's live or recorded video footage on any PC.\nLong time recording: - Base on the H.264 Compression, maximize the hard drive's recording time, as well as transfer video for viewing over the internet.\nNetwork Remote Access - Access live video footage directly from your mobile phone or PC anytime anywhere\nAdvanced Motion Detection Recording - This allows you record only when motion is detected.\nProfessional Grade Weather Resistant  CCD Cameras - See in the Dark with Automatic Night Vision.", "Name": "ZMODO 8CH H.264 DVR Security CCTV Surveillance Camera System with 4 Sony CCD Night Vision Weatherproof Surveillance Cameras - 500GB HD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CpwmS8asL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0090GIGWE"}}
