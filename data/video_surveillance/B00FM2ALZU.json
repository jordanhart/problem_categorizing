I could not be happier .works as described ,cameras exceed my expectations for a low cost  system. a 500 gb hd included and installed. free shipping, what's not to like. if I learned one thing in reading customer reviews its this, read them with some cynism, its pretty obvious some people don't read the description or instructions. and some people expect a Cadillac for a Kia price.. this unit is a fantastic bargain. I have been using it for 2 weeks so far. only time will tell if it lasts. the only con so far is that the full instruction manual must be downloaded and must be read and UNDERSTOOD  before operating as it comes only with  the setup  instructions and a disc. if it had come with a full printed manual I would given 5 stars. the set up is easy, the operation a bit more complicated, should not be a problem for anyone with some expertise.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great complete DIY home security and surveillance.", "Author": "Allen Hensel", "ReviewID": "R1GRYTNNSYN7Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You will no doubt find systems with better optics.... You will find systems with better night vision. But for the price of this system, I was MORE than satisfied. The cameras are crips and clear. The dvr can be a little tricky to navigate, but is a breeze once you get the hang of it. The 500 gb hard drive saves several days worth of non stop video, and the android app that allows you to view your cameras live at home is unbelievable.  The system came with everything needed for a complete surveillance system, including the screws. This is by far the best bang for the buck you will recieve, and the system is completely upgradeable for more cameras and remote control (ptz) cameras. You will love this system.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does not meet the selling points.", "Author": "randy maples", "ReviewID": "R70306B10MOZD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not really sure why my system does not seem to work like other reviewers state. Night vision is useless after 10 feet, outside, and no one would ever be able to make out a face. Motion detection only works within 9 or 10 inches of camera, outside, at night. Selling points state that IR goes to 50 ft. Mine will pick up a reflection in car light at that distance but no person would ever be seen. My spotlights pick up and turn on with movement at 45+ feet away, in the dark. This system will not. I have a hand held night vision scope that runs off a 9v battery that is 10 times better than this IR system. The motion detection is useless in the dark and IR will only show a face at 10 feet or less, any further than that and it is just a body moving, but if set to motion detect, higher setting, unless they wave their hand within 10 inches, it, the system, will never turn on. This was a gift so I will deal with it. I would never recommend to anyone to buy this product as mine does not do what the selling points state that it will.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good quality and customer support", "Author": "TN Hunter", "ReviewID": "R1HU3E4YOQXRIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the years I have probably installed 50 systems. Not full time just as one part of my job. This system was by far the easiest I've ever seen to use and setup. The camera quality was also very good considering the price. I even had to call customer support because I setup an admin password and didn't write it down. The next day for the life of me I couldn't remember what it was. They walked me right through it without having to to a factory restore. The whole phone call took me less than 10 minutes! I will make sure when I buy a system in the future that it is a LA View.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good/Bad Customer Service", "Author": "Rebelsun", "ReviewID": "RFO43PYP4A0Y9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying, running the wires, and connecting the cameras was the easiest part.  It took two of us, approx. 1 1/2-2 hrs. total, to run the wires through the attic, and to install the 4 cameras inside and outside the house, hook up the cameras to the DVR, a TV monitor, and ensure everything was working correctly.The next step was a bit more difficult.  That involved connecting the system to my router, and getting connected on-line.  After several attempts, I contacted LaView Customer Service.  Jesus first started out by walking me through the steps involved.  When the connection still couldn't be made, he took control of my computer remotely, made the adjustments necessary, and was successful in getting everything up and running.  The result was, I could now monitor my security cameras remotely from my smart phone and computer, just as I could from home.  I am very satisfied with that part of the system.The part I've yet to be able to overcome, is the night camera issue I continue to experience.  Customer Service at LaView confirmed by viewing my cameras at night, they are not operating as they should.  They offered to exchange my cameras for a new set of 4 cameras, at no charge to me, because they stated my cameras seem to have a common problem, which some cameras from their vendor have had, involving the night vision lights, which don't adequately illuminate the area being monitored by the cameras.  I have yet to receive these cameras.  Subsequent attempts to contact LaView Customer Service regarding this issue, have only resulted in an e-mail, which informed me, they would send out new cameras, after I packaged the old cameras, and returned them, at my expense, to them.  This was not outlined to me, when they admitted these cameras were defective, and would be replaced, at no additional cost to me.This is also unacceptable to me, because it would leave me unprotected by security cameras, during the time I disconnect them, and send them back, and (hopefully) receive the new ones, as well as incurring additional expense to me, for improperly working cameras, which admittedly have a manufacturer defect..", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Heidi Amador", "ReviewID": "R1MAS2WU38DT4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was a little hard to set up with a little help its up and running thank you would buy from again", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well worth the Price", "Author": "sergio parra", "ReviewID": "RZS0JLXZTOB9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system is easy to install and easy to program to phone or computer.

That being said, this was supposed to be new and with a 500gb hard drive. When it arrived it was clearly used(scratches all over the dvr and non factory screws) and there was no hard drive in it!  Amazon could not just send a hard drive.  I had to pack it all up and send it back. To amazon's credit they did promptly refund my money.
