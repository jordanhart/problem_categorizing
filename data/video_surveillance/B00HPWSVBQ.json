You can only sit and watch as it rotates around in scan mode, which was a major irritant. This camera is made for the Chinese market - the DDNS providers were all Chinese and I couldn't use my own provider. It took very long (20 seconds+) for camera to pick up commands from the iphone app - stop motion, LED light on/off, etc. The camera itself seems to be sturdy and well built but technology behind it leaves a lot to be desired. The motion is very slow even at the fastest setting. I will be returning this for sure.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HPWSVBQ"}}
