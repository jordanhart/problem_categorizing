My house was burglarized and I with a similar kit from Q-See I was able to get the guy convicted and he's enjoying some time in jail right now.  Since that time I have been on a quest to get better and better cameras and have learned a lot along the way.This kit has many of the same limitation that I've come to expect from analog systems.  The DVR has frame rate limitations on the number of channels you can run at the D1 resolution.  Do your homework and understand that just because the cameras can do 600 lines (btw, that's nowhere near 720p (1280x720) if you look at the missing horizontal pixels) doesn't mean that's the level of quality you're recording.  In order to support all 8 channels you will need to use CIF recording which has a resolution of 360x240.  If you want to bump up to the highest D1 resolution (which is 720x480) then you have to either lower the framerate considerably or use fewer cameras.  What you are seeing displayed on the screen live is likely not the same level of quality you are recording at. Which makes a huge difference if you need to use that recording to convict someone.  If quality is critical for you then I would seriously considering looking for a system that can support D1 @ 30FPS on all 8 channels (they can be found in this price range).  Better yet, go with IP cameras that can support 1920x1080 resolutions, but that's going to double your investment.The interface, apps, and user friendliness is on par with the rest of the industry (which isn't saying much as they are all kind of unfriendly).  The quality of the cameras is pretty good, but my experience with some of these kits has meant that 1 or 2 cameras will probably crap out in a year or less.  Luckily analog cameras are pretty cheap and can be had for $50 or less.All and all it's a good starter kit which may serve all you ever need, but be aware of it's limitations in recording quality.  In my case that's a deal breaker since I know how important that was during my run in with a bad guy.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the Advanced DIY'er", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R2JT5TPI8Z6VJE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Almost everything you need comes in the box. DVR, cameras, connector, and cables. But no manual. Sure you can download and print the manual online or you can take your smart phone/tablet with you in the attic when questioning a crucial step.Installation is relatively easy if you're comfortable climbing around your attic and running cables. Actually running wires in the attic is simple, but you still need to run wires through the interior walls for the dome cameras. Although the dome cameras can be mounted on the ceiling you may need to install some vertically as well.Pick a suitable location for your DVR. A place where all 8 wires, ethernet, power, and video can hide from bad guys. Even though you have a nifty, new surveillance system it doesn't mean you won't get broken in to. Hiding your DVR from the bad guys is important for future evidence.The cameras are black and stick out like a sore thumb on lighter walls. Luckily the camera bodies are aluminum and can be painted. The easiest way to prep your cameras is to lightly scuff them with a green scotchbrite pad. Clean them thoroughly then mask the camera lenses. A couple of light spray can coats should do the trick.When connecting the cameras to the wires add a couple turns of electrical tape around each connection. Sometimes the connector tolerances aren't the greatest and need a little help.Don't believe for one second that another reviewer had this entire system installed and running in 90 minutes. That's over 600 feet of cable being run AND 8 cameras attached to walls and ceilings. Realistically expect a full day to properly install this system. Take another day to prep the system and paint the cameras if needed.The HDD is 500GB and is adequate for most needs. This means that you should set your DVR to keep the past 7 days of video and erase the rest. Unless, of course, you're leaving for a an extended period. For those that need to record video 24/7 you should consider upgrading to at least a 1TB HDD.The cameras are decent for 600TVL, which is just below 720p HD. Realistically you can expect a 30-40 night vision range in complete darkness, However if you have motion sensing lights then you can expect a greater range of about 60 feet. Remember that too bright of a security light can wash out your cameras at night. We use 60 watt yellow bug lights with much success. We originally had 100 watt lights that made a person's face look like a bright white orb with absolutely no facial recognition.The software set-up is easy and posed no difficulties. I didn't install the mobile app.When networked you can view your cameras on your smart phone and PC. You can also save the videos you need and save them to your PC or a USB stick.I gave this system 3 stars because you MUST be networked to download a video file. My other system is a Q-See system. Q-See has an extra USB port on the back of the DVR. This extra USB port allows you to download a video file directly from the DVR. The Defender DVR does NOT allow you to download a file from the DVR. You must be connected to a network, then transfer the file from the DVR to your PC. Then you can download it to a USB stick.For what it is, it's a decent system. The price point is a bit high, especially with a 500Gb HDD. Installation is relatively easy and software set-up was fast. If you have a home network then you'll be able to use all the features. If you don't have a home network then look for a system with a second USB port.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hardwired System ~ Big Job ~ But That Goes With The Territory", "Author": "majormusiclover", "ReviewID": "RYN1O9XT0L8W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've not had prior experience with security systems, but we've wanted one for a couple of years,so I was willing to dig & research to get this one installed, (with the help of a good handy-man)When I received the system, I familiarized myself with the contents of the kit, and info on the micro disc.I opened the pdf file and found there to be 85 pages of instructions. I followed as stated, but with no success.I went to defender-usa web-site & phoned the 'Sales Assistance' # in the upper R/H corner,there's a prompt for technical assistance, someone answered, and was very friendly & helpful.He gave guidance for the best way to set up the system,--- (He said, Initially all three items, D.V.R. - Router & T.V. need physically hooked/wired together,go to defender-usa.com/1step, access remote viewing set-up and follow instructions, & once I got that set up,I wouldn't have to have a T.V. or (P.C.) monitor at the D.V.R.) ---So I hung up the phone thinking issues resolved, and followed his instructions, exactly, but with no success.So I phoned again, & happened to get the same fellow, this time he shared with me the fact that\"the above instructions work approx 50% of the time\"He was nice & patient & guided me through his instructions 5 times, and still nothing.During which time I was gently given the feeling that I must not be doing something right.He ended up having to take over my computer and go through it all again, and he wasn't successful either.During the course of that 1 1/2 hour phone call, he ended up needing to switch ports in the D.V.R.which finally accessed on-line viewing.FEATURES ~ Four Ultra hi-res 600TVL dome cameras - model #21060, indoor/out-door - night vision range, 65 ft. capability.Four Ultra hi-res 600TVL 'anti-vandal' bullet cameras, with 'sun shields' - model #21006, indoor/out-door - night vision range, 100 ft. capability.The design of anti-vandal cameras are supposed to be a plus, and the wires comes out the back so they can't be cut/disabled by an intruderso you must drill through the wall to run wires. (We didn't consider that a plus) Cameras have 60 degree viewing angles.System has Password Protection - Time and date stamp display - Full disc warning -Auto detect video loss alarm -  500GB HDD Storage capacity - Lifetime free tech support.FUNCTIONALITY ~ All eight cameras are displayed on one screen. The images are clear and distinct,with pretty good pictures on the screen, which shows eight-blocks = all eight cameras.NOTE ~ The cameras that come with this system are manual adjustment, video only, no sound.The D.V.R. has capability to support pan - tilt - zoom (PTZ) and sound butyou'll need to get different cameras if you want to utilize those D.V.R.'s features.And two cameras were frozen and won't pivot in their sockets when received, I still need to follow up on that issue.CONSTRUCTION  ~ Weather-resistant aluminum housing.CONCLUSION ~ This product isn't very user friendly, there's a lot of complicated instructions,and the wiring is a labor-intensive installation process, as apposed to wireless.This isn't a walk in the park, one should realize whats involved, not only with this brand, but any hardwired system.Not to be trite, but I want to re-iterate, there's a lot of wires here to hide.TIP ~ There are many things to consider before you buy any security system, mainly, what your needs are,weather your protecting a medium-sized home or office space, which may be as well protected with a wireless system.Or a larger property, where-as hardwired systems are still recommended.If you choose a hardwired system, are you willing to drill into walls?Can you get in your attic or crawl space to run wires?Do you have a plan how to manage the wires if you have a two story home?The cameras for this set are recommended to be from 8 to 13 above ground level.I wouldn't think it's possible to suggest an amount of time needed to install this set, every home will be very different.Hardwired systems really need thoroughly planned out in advance, you won't like destroying your beautiful home.ADDITIONAL INFO ~  For relevant ~ pre-purchase information, Defender's own web-site provides additional informationwhich can be found at, defender-usa, home page, type in search bar each model# found below and then click on specifications.This D.V.R., and both styles of cameras have independent model numbers on their tags in the box.1.

I deemed the wired setups to be too complicated for me so I first tried a wireless option. I get that they work great for certain homes, but for mine they just did not. I actually had a break in while away for 2 weeks and the resolution was so low that the perpetrator could not even be identified. Extremely frustrating. I was so thrilled to receive this set after returning the other system and to my surprise, set up really wasn't difficult at all. I'm not big on drilling holes into walls to run wires, so I opted to run the wires under the edge of the carpet and up inside the molding and it actually worked really well. The hardest part of installation was just deciding where to put the cameras. I did want to put some outside so I ran a cable up through my rafters and down through a vent near the back and side entry and mounted the cameras there. They've been up for almost a month and endured some pretty rough weather already and are still working great.The resolution on these cameras is amazing. I was thrilled again that the system came with a very nice sized hard drive. When you have the system set to record only on motion detection, this can easily last for months before needing to be cleared. I tested the motion sensor extensively as well and it performs perfectly, even in conditions with zero light. I was equally impressed with the quality of the night vision recordings. I walked slowly up to the cameras in complete darkness (following the IR lights on the camera) starting from about 20 feet away and I could clearly see my facial features and felt confident that anyone foolish enough to break in a second time will surely be recognizable. The remote also makes everything so much simpler as I don't have to dig the receiver out of hiding to switch the recording on and off. I leave it off when I'm home to avoid filling up the hard drive and I fully trust the motion sensors to record any movement in the home when I am not there. I have paired this system with an alarm system that I've set up on all the windows on my home and I finally have peace of mind knowing my home is safe when I'm away. I would gladly pay twice the retail price for the relaxation I've been able to enjoy while traveling. Highly recommended! Remember you get what you pay for and while other systems may be cheaper, the price will be reflected in the quality of the product.

I really liked the clarity of the images from the cameras and the infra-red was extremely clear. I would also say the cameras seemed to be very well made, not out of cheap plastic materials.The cameras were easy to install, but the cables that came with it were not nearly long enough.  Some of them would've been nicer to have longer.  Would be nice to see a variety of cable lengths, both shorter and longer.Drawbacks:The quick set up sheet wasn't as clear on directions as it could've been.  It was nothing more than a picture showing the cable connections.  It did take some time to understand.  The manual coming on a CD was okay, but a printed version of the manual would also have made it easier, since my computer does not have a CD rom drive.  Was disappointed to find that the ONLY way to access the interface is through Internet Explorer.  It really should be formatted to be usable for all browsers, or at least a much wider selection.Overall, this is a good product, and would recommend.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Setup reasonably easy for an amateur. Excellent visibility.", "Author": "Tooncesmom", "ReviewID": "R1E69IKEFQNEIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the Defender Sentinel 8 Channel Smart Security System from Amazon. Let me state up front that I have never installed a security system before so I hope this information is helpful to those who wonder how difficult it is to set up a DVR and the cameras with little previous knowledge. It's easy to say the setup was easy and everything works, but in my case, there was a steep learning curve. That said, the actual setup is not difficult. A one-sheet quick start shows you how to hook up the cameras and then connect the power supply and finally the cables to your DVR and monitor. What was more problematic was deciding how to set up the system and which monitor to use--a computer or a TV. My computer monitors do not have RCA connectors/plugs, so I either needed an adapter (RCA to VGA) or a VGA splitter with one cable going from the monitor the the computer and the other going from the monitor to the DVR or I could use a DVI to VGA cable since the monitor has a DVI plug and the DVR has a VGA. This works, but I have to switch the output with the monitor buttons so I can go from D-sub (the normal computer screen) to DVI (the DVR screen). I found the monitor buttons did not easily allow the switching. I then considered buying a switch that could be changed manually and quickly. Finally I settled on hooking the DVR to a second TV that's housed in an armoire in the master bedroom. This TV has only one AV input/output so I bought an inexpensive plug (Male to 2 Females) and had no difficulty setting up the DVR. I can access the main menu to change input with the included remote or I can add a manual switch that will change the input instantly. This, as I see it, is the main thing to consider when deciding how to view the camera output. Another solution would be to add a second monitor just for the DVR, but that takes up space.As for setting up the cameras (four dome cameras for the inside and four bullet cameras for outside (they are water-resistant but not waterproof, so you need to mount them where they'll have some protection as in under the eaves), I have only set the outside cameras in place to set up the system. We will install later next month when our painter finishes the exterior. For the purpose of this review, all cameras are working and the clarity is good, both during the day and at night. I will further tweak the system once the outdoor cameras are permanently in place. But here's what I learned: visibility is very good and under most conditions, a trespasser's face could be identified. Since we live in a remote mountainous area on acreage, we were anxious to have some type of monitoring/recording device in place.Defender has several videos to show best areas for camera installation, a five-step hookup guide (that didn't work for me but might for others), and a couple of guides to set up internal and external networks.In all, I spent about four hours watching the tutorials, talking to a Defender technician and my local electronics supplier to make sure I covered all my options. The actual camera hookup took only minutes; running lines through the house's crawl space will be a bit more time-consuming, but overall, this system was easy enough to figure out for a newbie and should be simple for anyone with a better knowledge of electronics and security systems. One negative was figuring out where the User's Manual was located. Go to the www.defender-usa.com site and click on Support, then Download Center. Click on DIY Security Systems and finally click on the 8CH Smart Security DVR - with 8 Ultra Hi-Res Security Cameras & 500GB HDD (Model No. 21031)--sixth from the top. The User's Manual is a pdf file available in English or French. Despite the difficulty of finding the manual, I give the system two thumbs up. While remote access is an added feature of this system, since I don't have a Smartphone, it's not something I can comment on in my review. I like that the 500GB hard drive can hold over two year's of recorded data and that the DVR functions just like a computer with a USB mouse and/or the remote.

The instruction manual was well-organized and comprehensive.  We elected the 24/7 \"always on\" option instead of only using the motion-detecting option (you can choose either).Observations:  The bullet (outdoor) cameras deliver a great picture both in daylight and nighttime.  The cameras have an IR cut filter that delivers more life-like nighttime colors.  Living in Florida, there are a lot of outdoor cats and I could easily see the black-striped one two doors down across the street.  I saw a fledgling Blue Jay hopping around yesterday under the guidance of its parents, tand went out this morning and saw a few feathers in the corner of the backyard.  I was worried so I viewed last night's footage and the camera picked out a raccoon attacking the little bird in the middle of the night.  It was very sad.  The only good news is that the camera image was excellent in viewing small dark animals.My wife checked on our baby sitter remotely (via smart phone) two nights ago and saw a good clear picture feed from the dome cameras inside the house.Recommendation:  Highly recommended.

Within 40 feet you get a very clear view even in very dark conditions.Cons:- One of my cameras was DOA - I have emailed support for resolution - we'll see what happens.- Again - setup is NOT for the faint of heart - there is a great deal involved from running the wires, to determining where to set up the DVR and even setting up remote viewing from your outside computer or smart device.- Uses RCA video from DVR to monitor - what is this, 1985?! What about HDMI like the rest of the world? It would be nice to pull in audio alongside the video with ONE cable.- In general I still have issues with security camera systems. They are low quality overall and anything beyond 30-50 feet is pretty much useless for positive identification. Given the state of the technology for cameras and recording ability, I really expect more from these systems.Overall this is a VERY complete system. You need to plan out your camera locations and be able to run the cables and mount the system properly. This means being able to drill through walls and run cables potentially through conduit or through the attic or crawlspace. Again - not for the amateur. Wireless is the wave of the future - I would think that would be a far better option given the state of the technology.UPDATE - Customer Support- After more than a week with no reply from customer support on my non-functioning camera I called the support line and we will see how the replacement process goes.

It also clearly showed the neighbors in their driveway 80 feet away that I could definitely see it was them and could even tell you what they were wearing, of course that was in the daylight but after seeing the people walking their dogs so clearly in the dark I have no doubt it would be just as clear that 80 feet away as it was in the daylight. We have a few thieves in town (mostly stealing gas from cars) and it's nice to know that even though this won't stop them from coming into your yard and stealing items you have out for display, it will catch them doing it and you will be able to use it to prosecute them without having to worry if the picture is clear enough to identify them.

In a way, it's a voyeuristic, movie-inspired paranoia to want these around your house. And yet, leaving a dog at home every day gives one pause.This camera set is more for a peace of mind than protection or a warning system in the way ADT might be. This is about getting you, the homeowner, involved and on alert. You get to make decisions, see who is hanging around your house. It wasn't a big deal until some punks decided to egg the neighbor's garage door. Then, suddenly everyone wanted to know if the cameras caught the perps (they didn't come so as far as my house).This system allows you about 500GB of space for recordings. The cameras are easy to screw in around the house. There are four, so placing them around the corners seemed the easiest.  It took about 2 hours to set up the set plus install the software, etc. I had help from one other person though.The only negative thing about these cameras is exposure. Usually, you only install them when you have something worth protecting. That's the thinking, anyway.
