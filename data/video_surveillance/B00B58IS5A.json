{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good DVR with some technical limitations but manufacturer cut costs a little", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "R1CTAJSDSYQ4JS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am experienced with DVRs and analog/IP security cameras and have used many DVRs. I like this MT-HDVR3308T 8 channel DVR as it supports 960H analog cameras (960H cams are capable of a better resolution image than older analog cams) or alternately IP cams (or even both D1 analog & IP cams in hybrid mode). The local DVR playback interface is sensible and better than some other DVRs that I have used (except I couldn't find a save snapshot button on the local DVR interface but you could do this via CMS software).*PORTS*8 BNC analog video inputs4 RCA analog audio inputs1 BNC video output.

If you need a spare or replacement Sabrent AD-LCD12 LCD Monitors 12V 6A 72W AC Adapter Power Supply works fine. The DVR only holds a single SATA hard drive even though the electronics/software seem to be able to accommodate 2 SATA drives.*DVR MODES*This DVR can function as an analog-only DVR (connect up to 8 analog cameras, including 960H cameras), an IP camera only mode (connect varied # of IP cams depending on resolution), or a Hybrid analog+IP cams mode. Here's a list of what can be done according to the software (I haven't tested every mode).ANALOG ONLY:Resolution: 960H (960x480), up to 8 cameras recording at same time, up to 2 simultaneous playbackResolution: D1 (704x480), up to 8 cameras recording at same time, up to 4 simultaneous playbackResolution: D1 (704x480), up to 8 cameras recording at same time, up to 8 simultaneous playbackResolution: HD1 Half-D1 (704x240), up to 8 cameras recording at same time, up to 8 simultaneous playbackIP ONLY:Resolution: D1, up to 9 cameras recording at same time, up to 9 simultaneous playbackResolution: 960H, up to 8 cameras recording at same time, up to 8 simultaneous playbackResolution: 720P, up to 4 cameras recording at same time, up to 4 simultaneous playbackResolution: 1080P, up to 2 cameras recording at same time, up to 2 simultaneous playbackHYBRID MODE:2 Analog cameras at D1 recording AND 1 IP CAM at 1080P AND 1 IP CAM at 720P (2 playback). That's it for hybrid mode and you should note that you can't do 960H analog and IP cams at the same time.IP MIXED MODE:Choice #1: 1 IP cam at 720P, PLUS 7 IP cams at D1, up to 8 playbackChoice #2: 1 IP cam at 1080P, PLUS 1 IP cam at 720P, PLUS 2 IP cams at D1, up to 4 playback**THE GOOD**+ Seems to be stable in testing so far. There is the option to have the DVR reboot at a specific time to ensure stability.+ You can connect to the DVR via IE plugin (i.e. browser) or using the CMS software. Both are included on the supplied CD, however I have found newer versions of the IE plugin online - search for \"NewActive.exe\".+ Clock/settings battery is user replaceable, unlike a previous DVR that had a soldered-in battery!+ Firmware installed on DVR had late 2013 date, indicating that software development is still in progress. I do not know where to get firmware updates from as yet. Hopefully Tough-CCTV will leave a comment giving some details here.+ I have not tested mobile device support, but here is what the readme on the CD says for supported devices:\"vMEYE_SB_S60_3rd.sisx:  for Symbian smart phone base on S60 3rdvMEYE_SB_S60_5d.sisx:  for Symbian smart phone base on S60 5rdvMEYE_WM.cab: for window mobile phonevMEyeSuper(v1.1.1).apk:  for Android smart phonevMEyev2(3.0.2).apk: for Android smart phonevMEyeCloud(v1.2.5).apk: Android operation system - icloud mobile softwarevMEye20120104(3.1.0104).rar: for BlackBerry smart phonevMEyeCloud HD v1.1.2 buildIPAD 20130703.ipa- icloud mobile softwarevMEyeCloud v1.2.3 build 20130703.ipa: iPhone operation system - icloud mobile softwareNote: if your mobile phone OS as iphone ,you can search \"vMEyeSuper\" or or \"vMEyeV2\" in appstore of iphone.\"**THE BAD**- I mentioned in the review title that the DVR is a little cheaply built. Specifically the manufacturer omitted a cooling fan for the case, even though there are holes/cutouts for a 40mm fan! What I did was purchase StarTech.com 40x10mm Replacement Dual Ball Bearing Computer Case Fan with LP4 FAN4X1LP4 (Black) and plug it in-line between the hard drive and the motherboard. I would strongly recommend doing this because it is proven that hard drive reliability decreases with increase in ambient temperature. Also the video decoder chip gets pretty hot during operation and I feel it should have a passive heatsink on it.- Unlike other DVRs there are no alarm input or relay output for connecting things like door alarm switches to the DVR. While most people would not use these features they can come in handy.- While there are 8 analog video inputs there are only 4 audio inputs. Again this may not be a problem for most.- The USB ports are only located on the back panel, there are no front mounted ports (for easy of USB backup)- Note that for IP cams you may not be able to connect up to 8 (as you would do with analog cams). IP cams generally require more processor time so for 1080P/720P cameras there are limits on how many you can connect to. Example, you can only connect up to 4 720P IP cameras, or 2 1080P IP cams. There are different modes for IP cam resolution so you can have more or less IP cams at the same time but the catch is that your IP cams must support these modes.- Even though the DVR claims ONVIF compatibility for IP cams ONVIF cams are a hit-or-miss thing with regards to compatibility (sometimes bugs in camera or DVR firmware prevent things from working). I have tried a few IP cams that claim ONVIF compatibility but were not detected with this DVR's ONVIF search. One high-resolution outdoor day/night IP camera that did work was GrandStream HD Mega Pixel IP Camera with Networking Cameras. Please note that IP cams will require an external network switch (since the DVR only has a single Ethernet jack) and high resolution cams will require more storage space, making you wish this DVR case had space for a 2nd drive).- The biggest flaw for me is that I wanted to connect some 960H analog cams and one or two 720P IP cams. As far as I can tell this hybrid \"960H analog & IP cams\" mode of operation is not supported, you have to choose between 960H analog only or lower D1 analog resolution & IP cams (see hybrid mode note above).- As mentioned above you will need an external network switch for connecting IP cameras since there is only a single Ethernet port. If you are using PoE (Power over Ethernet) cameras you will need a PoE Switch if you want to power the cam this way.- The DVR infrared remote does not come with batteries. You will need 2 AAAs.OVERALL, it seems to be a functional DVR for the price. I wish the manufacturer didn't skimp on the cooling fan/heatsink and the DVR supported true hybrid 960H analog/IP mode of operation.I hope you have found this review helpful, I have tried to be very detailed. If anyone has suggestions for Hybrid DVRs or NVRs with a good web interface and most importantly after-sales firmware support please let me know.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$268.00", "Features": "Onvif Compliant; H.264 Compression Format;DVR/HVR/NVR Three-in-One;HDMI Output;\nSupport Max 8Ch D1 Real-time Video Recording in DVR Mode;\nSupport Max 4Ch 720P Real-time Recording in NVR Mode;\nSupport Max 2xD1 Analog Cams+ 1x1080P IP Cams+ 1x720P IP Cams Real-time Recording in Hybrid Mode;\nSupport IE Cloud Access;Support 3G Smart Phone Access;Support Android, IPhone App Access; Support Wifi Internet Access;", "Name": "8Ch H.264 Onvif CCTV Hybrid DVR, D1 Realtime DVR, 1080P NVR with3G, Wifi, HDMI Output CCTV Security Systems", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SdQEMhAiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B58IS5A"}}
