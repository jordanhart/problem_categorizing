{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So Cool!", "Author": "Ben Woody", "ReviewID": "RA8TC7TUTKKIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is pretty cool, I just got it up and running and everything works fine. The directions are straight forward if you are patient and follow them correctly they really did help. The image quality thing this gets is pretty surprisingly good given you can barely see the tiny hidden lens. I can see that it will be great for having fun and playing jokes with my friends, and it almost makes you feel a bit like a detective or something. I wouldn't be surprised if a detective actually bought one of these themselves. If anyones Spy Pen didn't come with a USB cable, they are very easy to find and inexpensive, and can serve many more needs than just with your Spy Pen. Or just ask this Sherlock Hones company because it sounds like they said it was a mistake and they shipped you a cable right away. I really like this spy pen and also the pouch to keep it in is pretty cool.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best Pen for The Price", "Author": "Jessica Sanders", "ReviewID": "R2JH2AFCVFWJVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had several bad experience with items like this in the past and thought this would be the same. I was wrong about that. I've had the pen for a few days and so far it appears to be far better than the products I've tried. The camera is really good for being such a little device. The clarity of the video was better than I thought. The directions on how to use it was very easy to comprehend and follow. Overall, I'm very happy with this product.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Spylicious!", "Author": "marjean  toledo", "ReviewID": "R5Y9PAFUIBWLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great item.

I love this pen because it gives me a taste of what the gadgets are like in these type of films.The style of the pen is so nice and realistic. No one knows what it actually does. My friends were shocked when I told them that this small pen can capture images and videos. This pen is so impressively useful. I'd recommend this pen to all future Sherlock Holmes.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Cool", "Author": "amactru", "ReviewID": "REH6B9G0LFSPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been a big mystery/spy fan, and have accumulated a good collection of spy memorabilia over the years. So when I saw this pen offered on amazon I couldn't resist. Normally I'm hesitant to spend $40 on anything, but the pen appeared to be extremely high end, and I just had to have it! The design of the pen is really cute and functional, and easy to hide in a pocket if necessary. You can even just leave it right on the desk considering it looks just like a real pen.  It's very easy to use, and then easy to plug into your computer and upload the video when you are done. I have tried similar products and have not been to thrilled with the results. This pen, however, works great and makes you feel like your a real life undercover spy when using it -which is always a big plus in my book! I would highly recommend this spy pen to anyone who is looking to add to their collection, or for a gift for someone you know who is into spy/mystery.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "The perfect tool to investigate", "Author": "Franklin D.", "ReviewID": "R12GXQXGJZ3YNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This spy pen is the tool you want to take a discreet pic or video.

Great fun for kids and adults", "Author": "stephenstudio", "ReviewID": "R285FE59ZYQ38P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my spy pen and was immediately impressed with it's quality look and feel. You would never suspect it was a video camera as well as able to snap photo's too. Directions were straight  forward not your usual confusing obvious translated directions. The package came with everything needed to begin your amateur sleuthing. The attractive bag that holds the pen is a good idea as it will help keep It out of your pen holder where it would blend in with all other pens. After my first trial video the image resolution was impressive. I use the VLC player which worked perfect. Besides spy and detective fans like myself this pen would be a great gift for your younger teenager. The lifetime warranty is reassuring and speaks to a well made product. Very much looking forward to much more covert experimenting with this camera pen.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incomplete", "Author": "Patrick Maher", "ReviewID": "R21TVGDQCU54KQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just received this today and discovered it had no usb cable, meaning I can't charge it, and no 8gb memory card, which renders it useless even if I could charge it. So my actual review is zero stars, because this is what the advertising says, \"Spy Pen Comes w/ Everything You NEED In An Awesome Black Drawstring Pouch!\"Mine didn't. If they make good on these two major problems in a timely manner I will change my review. But for now, seeing as it has two of the most important pieces missing, which makes it totally worthless, they get zero stars. Amazon requires a minimum of one star, but one star would require a complete product that doesn't work properly. This can't work at all unless I go out and spend more money. The cable and memory card would cost me half of what I've already spent. That erases the one star.So now I get to repackage it, take it to my local UPS office and wait for who knows how long for a replacement. I am not pleased about any of that.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sherlock Hones Spy Pen is the BEST one to Get!", "Author": "Sara Becker", "ReviewID": "R25DR3QRMO1YJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am thrilled to have the Sherlock Hones Spy Pen, because I think it's better than all the rest. There are a lot of other spy pens out there and believe me they are not all the same. This particular spy pen is great because it comes with the lifetime warranty, great customer service who really do answer your questions, the ENGLISH written (step by step) instructions with pictures, and it comes with this really great black drawstring pouch to keep everything in until you want to use it.Look around on the pen and find the SH mark (for Sherlock Hones). If not, you probably don't have the Sherlock Hones with the black pouch, English instructions, a life time warranty, the memory chip, etc. If you don't have these things and especially the English Instructions, you'll never figure it out.You'll want to be sure you have all the right gear and that would be from the only one we found that worked was from Sherlock Hones.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incomplete Package", "Author": "Yvette", "ReviewID": "R20SLT2Y7BDJ99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very thrilled to have received my order, but after reading the reviews, and looking at what was sent to me, I realized my package did not come with the USB cable nor the 2GB SD Memory Card.I am very disappointed that I can't use this pen because after spending the additional $20 for the express shipping, I now have to go out of my way to return this package that could have actually been a good investment, if it had included all of the items that were said to be included.
