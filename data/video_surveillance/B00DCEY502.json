Sounds great, right. When I started hooking up the cameras, you would think 6 cameras just use 1-6. Well, that didn't work. I did find enough channels that worked to get the job done and everything is working fine. I still wonder if they had send the 8-channel would that would have been a better unit. Bottom line, it works. It was delivered fast.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Major unpatched security vulnerability in this device -- do not buy until Samsung resolves.", "Author": "R H", "ReviewID": "R14R7EFWYKIE3L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Major security vulnerability that has gone unpatched after 3 months of initial reporting.
