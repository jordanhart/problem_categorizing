This is extremely user friendly, I am having no issues with connectivity. I also gave it some thought prior to installing the cameras as to where I would keep the monitor. That is important for all cameras to connect. Due to my household there is only one camera that experiences some outage issues but it is not the camera (I switched it out with one that never does that) it is my location. But it works when I need it too by tweaking the location of the monitor. For my needs this was well worth the money, although I thought it was a little too much.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Security Man", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "RALWSMMZS3J3V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is ok.  I expected it to have intercom, which it does not.  It has audio from the camera to the monitor, but mine is so noisey I have to keep it turned off to be able to stay in the same room with it.  This is my major complaint.  Also, it certainly needs a larger monitor, and the transmiting range is very limited.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great system.", "Author": "Susan J. Roper", "ReviewID": "R272LOJ9JMT7H0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Daytime viewing is great.  Very high quality.  Nightime is OK but not even close to the daytime quality.  The audio is pretty bad.  The second day of using this security system I was able to tape the neighbor's dog attacking people walking down the street and finally something was done about a bad situation.  That alone made the whole system worth while.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL CAMERA'S", "Author": "Jeri", "ReviewID": "R5TVEK17GW5WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install, Wonderful night vision, sound,ETC.

Easy to set up, When the electricity goes out and comes back on, the system comes back up by itself (the reason I went with it, over the Lorax).Power cords for the cameras are long.Con's: Horrible, HORRIBLE reception, DVR keeps losing reception with cameras. I have the DVR in the kitchen and it is NO MORE THAN 28' from ANY camera, (vinyl siding, wood stud house). A far cry from the 200' claimed by the Mfg. I emailed Securityman and they replied with what I needed to buy to increase reception. Which I will do, because it's a $440 waste of money at this point.I have been wanting a system for years, but have been reluctant because I didn't want something that was unreliable.... Well, that's exactly what I got. If You are going to put all the cameras inside your home, it will work fine.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "SecurityMan system", "Author": "Pamela Ellis", "ReviewID": "R1761TCQZ0VD9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a little difficulty in getting cameras to pair with the monitor, called tech support and problem solved.
