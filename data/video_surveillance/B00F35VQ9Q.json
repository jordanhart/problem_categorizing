The shipping was pretty long, however because it came from China. The extra 8GB bonus micro SD card was really handy. The micro SD card as of right now on amazon costs about $6. The video quality and audio aren't so good. I took off a star for that. The sound was very hissy at times and oversensitive. However, this pen is suited for what I am using it for :)*Update* 1/14/14 (Day after I got product)I took off another star because the design is weak. You have to be careful not the push the micro usb cable too hard into the pen. If you do, the top might pop out. I would suggest firmly placing a finger on top the pen while pushing the micro usb cable into the port. Another thing to watch out for is camera shifting. As long as you don't twist the cable around while plugged into the pen, you don't have to worry about the internal camera shifting out of place.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$29.00", "Features": "Sold by Newgate--Ship from CA, With Free 8 GB micro cards\nVideo Format: AVI; Video coding-JPEG; Video resolution: 1280 x 960 VGA; Video frame rate: 30fps;\nPhoto Format: JPG 3840 x 2880; The ratio of image:4:3;\nInterface Type: Mini 5Pin USB; Storage card: TF Card;\nBattery Type: High-capacity lithium polymer", "Name": "New 8GB Plug-in Card Pen Hidden Video Camera Recorder DVR SPY 1280 x 960 USA", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XGrfiQdoL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F35VQ9Q"}}
