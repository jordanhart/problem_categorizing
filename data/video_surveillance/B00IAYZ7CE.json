{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quality and Support", "Author": "Robert B \"Robert B.\"", "ReviewID": "R1HNB1PO8G1R39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sharx SCNC3805 is a quality built wireless outdoor security camera offering higher definition and DVR capabilities. It is accompanied with an unusually clear and practical booklet of instructions that made set-up for both Ethernet and wireless operation easy. The built-in software provides all the features for home use including motion detection and email notification so that specialized software is not needed if needs are basic. The software is accessed through the browser.The Sharx camera uses the Apple Quicktime .mov format. I had some compatibility problems with the latest Quicktime version and Windows 7 until I eliminated unnecessary start up files through msconfig. Compatibility of the latest Quicktime with XP was good.The camera includes 8 Gb of memory on a MicroSD card. Installation of a 32 Gb upgrade was straightforward as shown in the manual. The new card needs to be formatted with specific free software prior to installation rather than with Windows.For wireless operation, the unit uses an AC adapter which is not moisture resistant, so that a receptacle enclosure will be needed when installed outdoors. Although the camera has PoE (Power over Ethernet) capability, most routers do not support PoE so this feature is only useful in more advanced systems.The field of view is wide angle with the infrared LEDs for night use providing good coverage edge to edge for my needs (porch surveillance). The resolution, said to be 1280 x 720, is more than adequate. As would be expected, there is some barrel distortion. Use of the inversion and mirror imaging feature (when the camera is used upside down) led to barely visible electronic snow in the image.Contact with technical service was very positive. With the greatest of patience they showed me how to modify my router parameters to enable remote access. They also offered tips about the use of redundant software that followed dynamic IP address changes. The camera already does this automatically.This camcorder has the quality and support I was looking for.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IAYZ7CE"}}
