{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ok.. But..", "Author": "Kevin S", "ReviewID": "R3Q3UCTNLR44H9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1-All the Cameras I got works, but came with Dirty lens on all Cameras. Showing a ring on the outer edge at night time vision, Clear in the day. Think it is on the inside camera from factory. Update-Found out it was not Dirt. I most likely got refurbished cameras, and not totally new, and when they did some checking and fixing on the camera before redistributing, they forgot the Gasket around the camera itself causing IR light refraction. Creating a halo at night. You ever see this, get the rubber gasket for around the camera and put it in there. I recommend this for any camera problems like this.2-Brackets can be improved on. The angles of movement is a little limited. See Pic of the brackets to see what I mean. Wished I had looked at that. Now don't know if this review will be used in the future if they change brackets. Just make sure to all ways check out the brackets in pic and description for any camera.3-After all this Gasket problem fix. I want to say this camera at night has great vision. Looks great during the day too. Also one thing to always remember with the IR cameras. The More IRs the better. 24 wont do for out in the open. 24 is ok inside a room. At least 36 and more will work a hell of a lot better.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DDP9RE4"}}
