I went to setup the Internet link and had problems.  It took a while to get to tech support but once I did they did a good job of getting me up and going.  I could see all my cameras from my smart phone anytime anywhere!  2 weeks later they sent out an update to the viewer on my android phone and it doesn't work after installing the upgrade.....  I have done what I can but it looks like a long wait on the phone to tech support again....", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Night Owl DVR System", "Author": "John Mayberry", "ReviewID": "RAMBEXG155XSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 8 channel DVR 500G system works great customer survive is great no problems, it has been running 24/7 for 2 years.I am going to up grade to a 16 channel and it will be Night Owl.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "garbage do not buy", "Author": "William Smith", "ReviewID": "RTYO2QWQEU6PA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this item from micro pc center item is garbage after about a month the hard drive failed and stopped recording i sent back to night owl they sent me a new one happened again sent me a new one second time lasted to day and now it won't reboot you have to be kidding me buy swan stay away from night owl stuff it is garbage I want my money back what a scam i haven't had cameras this whole time real security!!!!! do not buy stay away", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EDU4UPE"}}
