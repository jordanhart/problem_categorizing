{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Misleading Label, But Good Value Anyway", "Author": "Indo", "ReviewID": "R2MFMVI1G9U45R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a lot of security cameras, but this one is unique in the use of the four LED chips (not bulbs) for lighting.  They look like the \"welding arc\" brilliant LED chips in my high end, very bright flashlights.The obvious unique look of the camera, to me, is very Star Wars, Japanese robot, high tech looking.  It looks like it might strike up a conversation with you.  So far, it hasn't said anything like \"Danger, Will Robinson\".I like the bold appearance.  The high visibility of the camera is a passive deterrent against intruders.The white case finish is the standard low gloss semi-rough texture found on many of the cameras in this price range.  The metal housing seems sturdy enough.The 8mm lens, with a 1/3\" CCD provides a theoretical 33 degree angle of view.  My application is on a narrow side yard where a wider angle is not appropriate.  An effective range for face & body recognition with a 1/3\" and 8mm combination would be something between about 8 feet to 25 feet at night.The daytime color is shifted somewhat.  I'll get back to that later.  It's not my best camera in that regard.  The listed 600 TVL resolution was not as impressive as it should be, but it's not bad.  It's just not as sparkling sharp as some of my better cameras at that specification.The night time is where this camera really shines. (I couldn't resist that last sentence, even though I know you'll groan).  If you've purchased or seen the really brilliant, but expensive little flashlights becoming so popular, you may realize that those LED chips are expensive.  Much more expensive than the bulb type LEDs used on most CCTV cameras.First, the arrays of bulb type LEDs surrounding the lenses of most IR CCTV cameras interfere with the clarity of the picture produced.  Ambient unfocused light glow from the bulbs enters the lens, and fogs the picture to one extent or another.  The focused LED chips on this camera eliminate a lot of that problem, and that inherently makes the image sharper.  Second, the focused LEDS are aimed better than an array of bulbs, so the light is spread much more evenly where it should be.  I don't see a center bright spot washing out the center of the image, while the edges fall off to darkness.  I do think this configuration is the coming wave of newer models of cameras.  I like it much better than the current bulb lighting that resembles our old idea of a flashlight beam - bright in the middle and dark on the edges of the beam.I think the effective lens & light ranges on this camera are well matched for night time use.  I see good night time detail out to about 35 feet before resolution starts falling off.  As the objects get too close to the camera, it does a decent job of adjusting to the 'too bright' image.So far, average daytime resolution for a 600 TVL rated camera, but much better than anything else I have at night time resolution.  Now, lets return to the color shift mentioned earlier.  The camera is clearly labeled as having an OSD.  It doesn't have it.  \"On Screen Display\" is a way to adjust a number of camera settings, just as you might on a photo camera, or a new TV.  If you don't like the color settings, change them with the OSD menu, which usually is accessed by a few buttons on the camera or the pigtail cable leads.A more detailed look at the Amazon description confirmed that OSD is never mentioned there, but the Amazon pictures, and my camera, clearly have an OSD icon showing on the case.  The color shift, and the lack of the expected OSD knocked my review down one star, but the very good night time performance raised it up one star.  For me, daytime color shift is not a concern for a camera watching the side of the house.  It's much more important at the front where a car model and color might need to be more accurate.Given the very low price of this camera using four expensive LED chips, and its very good night time performance, I consider this camera one of the best bargains out there for a camera under $100.Edit:  I found that the standard home CCTV wiring cables were not heavy enough for the power draw that this camera requires.  Those typically use 24 or 22 AWG wires.  The high intensity LEDs of this camera do require a lot more power than the old style bulb LEDs.The Chinese style data sheet that came with the camera lists the power requirement at 1500mA to 3000mA.  Most home type CCTV cameras require somewhere between 200mA and up to 800mA for a zoom with a lot of \"bulbs\".I'm now using a 2000mA power supply, and using a 16 AWG cable (lamp cord or speaker cable) to power the camera mounted 40 feet away from the power supply.  That much heavier wire size keeps the available voltage at the camera reasonably close to 12 VDC.You could use a Cat 5E Ethernet cable, with three wire pairs dedicated to power (for barely 1500 mA capacity) and one pair dedicated to the signal.  You could also use a CAT 6 Ethernet cable, using three wire pairs, for 2800 mA capacity.  Otherwise, you could either mount a 2000mA power supply next to the camera, or use typical 16 AWG power cord, with a balun connector at the camera end, like I did.  However you do it, this is still a great night time camera, but you'll need to be somewhat handy with wiring to properly power the camera.  If this edit is all \"Greek\" to you, look elsewhere for your 8mm camera, one using the old style bulb type LEDs.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good night vision camera", "Author": "TV Junkie", "ReviewID": "R1JDWJPPB6564E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several cameras around my property for security but none of them have very good night vision.

Unfortunately the power consumption is so great that it is necessary to provide non-standard, very large diameter power cabling (14-16 AWG) in order to use the IR night vision. The power consumption shown on the camera is MAX 3W (250 milliamps) at 12VDC. If this was true, the camera could easily be served by standard 24AWG siamese CCTV cabling at distances from 60-75 feet. I had 50' pre-made cables, which work perfectly with all of my other CCTV IR cameras, but they could not supply enough current to operate the 4 large IR lamps that these cameras use. I am guessing that this model draws 600-800 milliamps or more, but I don't have the equipment to measure it. The camera only worked at night when I used a 2' long cable and a 2 amp power supply (2000 milliamps)--not suitable for most CCTV installations. It would not surprise me if this camera drew 12 watts or more (1000 milliamps +) when the IR lamps are on at night. By the way, the manufacturer specification for the night vision is 65-100' and not the 330' as shown in the item description. It does do a good job at 65-100', but is not going to give you much of an image at longer distances (assuming you give it the amperage it needs).The output video is definitely not up to industry standard 600 line video, but it is pretty good. If the cameras had worked with the standard 24AWG pre-made cabling that comes with the majority of security systems, I would have kept them (I bought 4). I know that I could have purchased a spool of 16AWG cable and some connectors and re-strung all of the cables and then fitted the connectors myself, but I am not looking for a career as a CCTV installer.The downside of a purchase like this is that installing the cabling is one of the most time-consuming parts of the installation. After I had carefully strung all of the cables (purchased from Amazon), that's when I found out that the cameras just won't work at night. The vendor put me through many time-consuming trial and error solutions before they authorized the return. I spent more time trying to make them work than I spent on the entire security system installation. I purchased four 8 Amp power supplies to replace the supplied 2 Amp power supplies, but there was just too much amperage required for the standard 24 AWG siamese cables. What's worse is that they know about the problem, and finally admitted (after about two weeks of emails) that they have received other complaints about this problem. When something is not industry standard and creates a known problem, the vendor should include the special components needed, or provide optional accessories, such as proper AWG power cables in optional lengths, e.g., 30', 50', 100', 150' etc. By omission of this critical information, the vendor is doing a disservice to Amazon and all of us.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Quality - Metal Not Plastic", "Author": "ValueTechnology", "ReviewID": "R2J3HIXMNGP1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually purchased two of these based on a Prime deal despite the fact that there were few reviews, to be honest it looked cool and I decided to take a chance on it.  I am an IT guy and my intent is to set up an open source surveillance software package called ZoneMinder built on Linux for home security.  I also like to see what kind of critters are coming in the backyard during the night.  I am no professional when it comes to surveillance so if anyone has some helpful advice/criticism by all means please post.  Shipping and packaging was quality, as for the camera I have had it hooked up for only a day now and I believe as many others state that I have gotten what I paid for.  I did not expect $500 worth of quality from a $75 camera.  The camera housing and mount are very durable, made of actual metal instead cheap plastic.  The BNC and power connectors seem to be of quality as well.  The view is a bit narrow but it has considerable viewing range so it works great for keeping an eye on my lengthy driveway.  As for night time viewing I am having some problems with the image sort of bouncing on the right side but that could also be because of a close wall on the right side of the view.  I did not have the problem when I initially hooked it up to test before mounting; I will make some adjustments and update once I figure out if that is the case.I know some may not necessarily see this as a feature but the camera looks quite intimidating at night when the four IR LEDs are lit up and it is large enough to be a considerable deterrent during the day.  At the moment I have it connected directly to a 40\" 1080p HD LCD screen and the image quality seems fair, but I also have the camera connected with a 150' low quality video and power cable which I plan to replace with a shorter and better cable to see if things improve.It is important to note that these cameras require more power than your average 12volt 200-500 milliamp surveillance camera.  You will need at minimum a 12v 1500 milliamp power supply.  I am also speculative that a little more juice may improve the IR image quality at night.  There was very little documentation with the camera, simply a small sheet that provided technical specifications and dimensions.  This was not a problem for me because I am a technical person and an IT professional, however I do not believe it would take much more than common sense for Average Joe/Jill to hook it up aside from the power requirements.  I almost thought I had gotten a bricked camera in the mail until further research in that department. So in closing, thus far I am content with my purchase but time will tell whether I have any problems with these cameras since I have only had them a short period of time.  First impressions show superior craftsmanship for the price paid. I will update this review once I make the aforementioned changes but I can say that for the price I would recommend them to novice users like myself but would not recommend for professional or mission critical applications without further testing IMHO.UPDATE:  So I have had two of these cameras running for a few weeks now with no problems except for a major issue when the night vision kicked on, BUT DON'T STOP READING HERE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  The issue is that when the IR LEDs would light up at night I would get a blue and black scrolling image, I have isolated this to a power issue and poor quality power cable.  Last night I replaced what appears to be wimpy 24 AWG power cable on one camera with a shorter run of 18 AWG power cable and the night vision works flawlessly now.  So spare yourself the wasted money of purchasing a cheap BNC and power cable combo and buy either a higher quality combo with at least 18 AWG power cable or purchase them separately.  I will update once I replace the power cable to the second camera.  At this point I am considering ordering 2 more of these as they have a quality image and held up in almost sub zero temperatures, rain, sleet, and snow thus far.UPDATE: I replaced the power cable to the second camera and it also took care of the issues I was having with night vision.  My suggestion to anyone that is having similar problems with the night vision is to take a voltage meter and check how much power they are getting on the camera end of the power run, if your power supply is at least 12v 2amp and your not getting those readings then you probably need to use a heavier gauge wire like I did to fix the problem.  Don't blame the camera before you check your installation!  At this point I am about to raise my review to five stars but I will give them a few months of summer heat and see what happens.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wicked night vision", "Author": "bmw5002 \"bmw5002\"", "ReviewID": "RWCDXWJQ75O3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has amazing night vision that frankly blows anything else away.

That was because I had it facing a window  so it just reflected off my white backed curtains, and blinds.I installed this outdoor camera indoors because of the price, and 600TVL, I'm not so sure it's 600, but it gives a very good picture on my flatscreen.  For those of you who say you can't see at night.  Take electrical tape, and cover the 4 LED's, and you'll have a great black, and white video, I promise.  Just as long as you have a decent light source, I park under a street light.About the housing shield on top of the camera, and the mount, I removed it because it was useless it didn't give a 90 degree angle, so I mounted it on a mini tripod I had for my HD camcorder, and that did the trick.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not work", "Author": "curtis stringer", "ReviewID": "R11WUVB7UV3U6C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Night Vision did not work day time worked great but that happens.

I am super impressed.  The power requirement surprised me. 12v 3000ma.  If I used the power for the bullet camera it replaced, the camera would turn off as soon as the lights came on.  I had to use a 12v power supply from an old laptop to supply it the power it wanted, but it was well worth the special arrangements.
