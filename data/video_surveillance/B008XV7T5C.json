Heavier gauge wire. Problem although I went on Swann's webisite to buy it with the same connectors (green ones) they were all sold out and then Customer service told me to search on the web to find it at a competitor site? Why they do not stock their own cables? I do not know - when I got the cables the ends were different so I disconnected the one end connector and hard wired it in to the other end connector.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exact Match to SWPRO-751 Camera (PTZ), a no-brainer to hook up", "Author": "R.
