Just the shock sensor alone won't give much protection. This way if someone is too nosy around your car it will do a few warning beeps and if they stay there the full alarm will go off.But it has to be adjusted correctly!Two things to remember when adjusting:1. It takes 20-30 seconds to fully arm and expand the radar circle. So don't just arm and step right up to the car, wait until it's fully armed and then test the sensitivity.2. After the warning has been triggered a few times, most DEI alarm systems lower the sensitivity to prevent false alarms. This makes adjusting nearly impossible. To \"reset\" the sensitivity, just turn the ignition on and off after every time you adjust the sensor.Just keep those two things in mind because they're not mentioned in the manual.

When I had my first Viper installed on a previous Eclipse GT, the guys at Audio Express in Raleigh, NC, installed a proximity sensor on it. Because someone attempted to gain access to my car, I can only assume that I explained this to them and while it may or may not have been an additional charge, I was not asked if I wanted it so I never questioned what the particular features were other than arm & disarming it. Now that I have an Eclipse Spyder, it is absolutely imperative that a motion/proximity sensor is added to it since to gain access inside, no one would have to break a window: they could simply cut the top open. While it explained to me a couple days ago that the only people who should be concerned with this feature are those who have convertibles or Jeeps since Jeeps are exposed anyway, I would still encourage anyone with a hardtop to get this if you have expensive upgrades to your car.

The leds telling you which field is being tripped is great, I first thought that only the outer field was working turns out half the time the enter field was being tripped its that the first message was still being broadcasted.  I was thinking that you would want the first field to trip a warning and the second to trip the alarm, this will not work, it would be tripping the full alarm all the time.I just have the warning on.
