Indoor photos will be blurred if you're not perfectly still, as will videos. Outdoor (sunlit) shooting is much better.Now for the main discovery that caused me to remove my previous one-star rating: 16GB memory doesn't work with this camera, at least not with mine. I wondered if the 16G micro SDHD might be an issue, so I picked up an 8GB at Tiger Direct here in town. With an 8G memory, it works. The crashing and shutting down after a few seconds, which were the main complaints I had with it before, have stopped altogether. I have recorded for 30 minutes at a stretch on the 8GB card with no real problems. Apparently it auto-saves every 10 minutes so a 30 minute recording will make 3 files.If you have one of these and it is giving you problems with shutdowns or crashes, try a smaller memory.", "Date":

The quality of the video isn't great, but honestly I'm just happy it works for $10! I bought a 16 GB micro card separately for about $6.The video I uploaded gives you an idea of video quality of the camera. The bunny was obviously suspicious of the pen! ;DI like that it automatically saves video if the battery dies or you run out of space. Also, the pen can actually write.With that said, I found it to have some issues:- For the first 5 mins or so of recording video, it sometimes glitches and video is shown in jerky movements, and sometimes these weird blue lines flash on the video for a few secs. After the initial few minutes, the video is fine with no glitches. (Not sure if this has to do with the device or memory card)- I have only recorded one lecture so far, and the battery lasted for only about 45 mins on a full charge- It saves video in 10-minute segments each, instead of a continuous video, so you will need some kind of video editor if you want to put all the video clips together into one long video.Despite the cons, I found it to be worth the price. I purchased my pen from HealthSpot, which was a \"fulfillment by Amazon\" purchase. It came inside a BPR 6 box, along with instructions and the USB cable. Not much of an issue, but I received a pen with silver trim, not gold like the one pictured.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "It worked", "Author": "sophia duran", "ReviewID": "R2WGPUWXYY8U4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It worked.

The instructions were very unclear and found myself re-reading through them a couple of times. Works perfectly and after reading the instructions a few times it becomes very easy to work. The memory slot is a bit sketchy because when you usually insert a micro sd card, it clicks, but in the pen you need to insert it with force and you are left wondering if its broken or not. The video quality is NOT in HD but it is acceptable for a camera that small. The audio quality is acceptable too, but it is not in HD. The pen overall is a neat toy and may be what you are looking for if you need it to spy on someone without the importance of seeing things crystal clear.

First, the instructions are not clear.  Fortunately, it is simple to operate and if you have any technical inclination, you'll figure it out quickly.  Second, inserting the SIM card was a little nerve wracking as I thought I was going to break such a delicate item.  It just takes a steady hand, and the contacts slide in facing the port.

It doesn't work well in low light, but normal room lighting or outdoor ambient provides excellent clarity.

The HD Spy Pen Hidden Camera Camcorder is a terrific concept: an attractive, functional ball-point pen that records video and audio.  It took over a month to get here.  There is an instructional video about this pen on YouTube which I followed to the letter.  I charged the pen, added the 8 GB microcard recommended, and got exactly one video out of it that was very impressive for such a small device.  After that, never again.  Nothing I did could make it work.  I contacted the company, who offered me a refund minus shipping costs to send the pen back, and then they offered to sell me another one at a 10% discount.  I said no thank you.  They are a very nice, polite company, and I wish them well.  Perhaps they'll make a better version of this item soon.The pen was not expensive--it was $5.00 plus shipping, very cheap--but, as everyone has said about such things, you get what you pay for.  I knew that when I bought the camcorder, and so I'm not miserable--just a little bit disappointed.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "It does what you would expect", "Author": "Vincent A.

My now fianc\u00e9 loves elephants and my nephew who works at the zoo was able to manage a presentation. I placed the pen in my shirt and turned it on (controls are a little weird to use but once you get used to it you're fine). She thought she was there to view his presentation but when flipping his board of facts had the will you marry me words on the back. I had the pen at an angle that unfortunately was unable to get my proposal. The camera is not that great of a quality and definitely works better outside then it does inside of a house with moderate lighting. As far as quality it's ok, not HD but decent enough that would definitely work for what you're looking for it to do. It didn't help me out but for the price you get what you pay for so I can't give this any lower then four stars because I knew what I was buying. Just want whoever reads this to know the same.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "great :)", "Author": "tom", "ReviewID": "R27O8LN1DOK40K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was a great price for a HD Spy Pen used it twice and work like a charm now just waiting for a low light one", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "stopped working after 2 times of trying to use it.", "Author": "Robert Kinlin", "ReviewID": "R1206CBH1G9FS8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worked fine the first two times I used it.

Both work just a good as the other. They aren't High Def by any means. The video with mine is actually better quality than the photos. I don't know why. They are really easy to handle.It is like the camera is ZOOMED in so stand back from what you are trying to film. Make sure to be in an area of bright lighting. But for $9 dollars They are awesome! I am recommending these to my friends and you!Instructions in better English- Hold top power button down for 3 seconds to turn on. Tap same button for photo. HOLD IT STILL for about 3 seconds for each picture. It takes a sec. For video hold down the button until the light on back starts to flash then let go. The light will go away which means it is recording video. Once done with the video hold the button for 3 seconds. Sometime the ones I got will act like they shut off. I usually just tap the button to see if it takes a pic or not. If it does take a pic the light will flash once. If it doesn't do anything, it has turned itself off.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "spy pen", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R31ZIIQUVA4M64", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "get what you pay for.insturctions are crazy lousy.good luck with this one.I cant get it to work.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "not bad when you learn how it works (and doesn't work)", "Author": "Roger", "ReviewID": "R1MAB931ARVL1E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like other reports I didn't get a 2 gig card to work either. Fortunately I had an extra 8 gig and with it the camera light stayed on. Buyers would probably do better just to spend the few extra bucks to get the memory with the pen. The instructions are poor and it took some experimenting to learn how to get video to work. Pushing the on/off button for two seconds gets the blue light to stay on constantly. Pressing the button quickly while the blue light is on takes a picture. Holding the button for a few seconds while the blue light is on actually results in a red blinking light which (for me) went off after several seconds. I thought the camera was off since there was no light on. However, this is how the video portion worked, at least for me. It makes since in that you really would want no light on when you're taking video! Unfortunately, I can't turn off the video camera unless I connect the pen to my computer.
