They loved it, but also didn't have any experience with a different model to compare. I still thought it was pretty good once set up, and took a look myself so I could write a more informed review. Here are the highlights:Pros: * Night vision works very well--you can actually see the room in the dark. * Range is good, and covers my niece's fairly large home. * Two-way speaker actually works, though there's a tiny bit of lag. * If your child likes the lullabies, you can turn them on from your end. * Monitor is portable. * Option to plug everything in instead of eating batteries. * Night light. (I know, other reviewers slammed this. But it's enough of a light to find the unit in the dark if you need to. I don't think it was ever intended to light up the room. It's not that much different from the light you get from a digital clock.) * Motion detector works to activate features, and you can set the sensitivity on it.Cons: * No ability to adjust where the camera's pointed from a distance. When the dog ran through and bumped the dresser where the camera was, niece couldn't see anything useful until she went in to fix it directly. That also means that a small child could conceivably move it accidentally or intentionally. * Digital zoom is a joke on any device, as all it does is show larger pixels of the same image on the screen. (Don't confuse digital and optical zoom; just like on a camera, \"optical zoom\" uses lenses to give you a \"real\" zoomed-in shot, and digital just changes what's on the display. I thought the resolution on this was fine for ordinary use--knowing what's going on in a room--but it's not good enough to give you anything extra by zooming in. Odds of you having the camera perfectly aligned on whatever you want to see are nil more closely anyway. * Shows a fairly small area of the room; no wide-angle setting.Note: What the monitor does do just fine, like any other system, is let you know when you really need to go to the monitored area physically. You can do a little bit from a distance, especially since there's voice communication and lullabies available. But mostly, this just lets you know when the bump you heard in the night is nothing worth worrying about so you can go back to sleep--or that you need to go be Mom now.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything is great EXCEPT for ZZMode/Noise Sensitivity", "Author": "April", "ReviewID": "RT1L0RLG0P1EK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What's most important to us is a monitor that has the capability to set the sensitivity level so that we don't have to hear our child all night long when he talks, sneezes, etc. We also don't want to hear the sound machine in our kids room either. (We keep the noise maker on loud!) We have used the Tommee Tippee video monitor with our son- the monitor ONLY turns on when he is crying. We have it on the lowest setting and it doesn't pick up anything else. We have gotten such great sleep that way!We decided to buy the Lorex because it has the ZZ mode AND multiple cameras. We are expecting our second baby, and want to video monitor both. The Tommee Tippee doesn't have the dual camera function. We were excited that the Lorex had the VOX technology. To our disappointment, even on the lowest setting with the noise maker across the room from the camera, the monitor kept turning on and waking us up. We are soooooooo sad that it didn't work, because everything else about the monitor was really great.If anyone knows of a monitor with multiple cameras that has a very low sensitivity setting, please let me know!!!

I actually got this for our 3 year old daughter. I wish I would have gotten it MUCH sooner. There are times when I hear movement from her room and I want to know what's going on. Before I had it I was afraid to check because if she was almost asleep and just taping the wall or something, going up would start the \"Mom, I'm thirsty\" routine. Now I can spy on her without that.It has a button I can press on the screen and I can press and say \"Get back in bed.\" She gets a look on her face like: \"Holy crap how did she do that?\" The picture is really clear considering it's pitch black dark in her room. It is color when it is daylight and black and white at night. The receiver runs out of batteries very quickly. It makes an annoying sound when low on batteries that's so loud it wakes me up even if it is in the other room. It is really best to keep the receiver plugged in all the time. We mounted the camera across the room and we can see almost her entire room. It doesn't have to be zoomed into her bed only.I like it.  One thing I saw on the news that I wondered about is that anyone with a receiver could see into your child's room with these video monitors. I do not have another one to test that theory. I thought that having a Lorex (never heard of the brand before now) would be much better than something more common. I would think that someone would be more likely to have sony or something.

The 2 way communication is nice because my wife no longer has to send one of our screaming kids out to get me for dinner or if they are in need of my assistance for something.  On the other side, I can ask for assistance if I am doing a big project or am just in need of some company (not usually why I'm in the shop though).The range on this thing seems good.  My workshop is about 50 feet away from the house and I have no problems using it.  Sometimes, for kicks, my 8 year old son will turn on the lullaby which always makes us both laugh.One feature we never thought we would use is the night vision.  I am rarely in the shop after dark and if I am, the lights are on.  However, about a week ago, I noticed some of my things were on the floor when I know they were on the bench.  After watching the night vision, I found that a squirrel decided to setup a home in my shop and would not go in while I was in it.  We saw how it got in and made it so the little thing cant get in it again (at least not that way).  There are plenty of woods for it to set up a home in near my house.Unfortunately, we don't use the other options on it, although, I do like to see the temperature of my shop before I go to it.  It allows me know if I need to turn on the AC or soon, the heat (yuck).Very little setup was required.  It actually worked pretty much right out of the box.  The monitor is rechargeable and holds a charge well, although we mostly keep it in its charging station so it doesn't get lost.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Quite Perfect, But Still a Decent Monitor", "Author": "Katherine Chan", "ReviewID": "R30O3Z34FXXH7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With young kids in the house, it's near impossible to keep track of them at times.  LorexBaby 7\" Baby Monitor definitely helps to keep track of them, although there are a few things about this monitor that keep it from being a 5-star \"can't live without it\" monitor.  However, overall it gets the job of monitoring your kids done.1. Resolution - What you see in the preview pic for this monitor is NO WHERE to what you get.  The resolution of this monitor is about as good as a mall security monitor...which really isn't all that great.  The images are highly pixelated, particularly in \"night mode\".  My daughter has a poster on her wall with big print, and I couldn't read the lettering from the monitor.  Also, when in a lighted room, the colors are very muted - again, not even close to what you see in the preview picture.2. Night Vision - I was impressed by the night vision mode.  Even in a completely darkened room with the nightlight off, I was able to view my daughter sleeping and my son sneaking down from the bunk bed to take some of her stuffed animals.  The viewing quality is still pixelated, but clear enough for me to view everything clearly enough.3. Night Light - This light is also a joke.  The lighting from the three stars on this unit are not bright enough to light up 5\" away from the unit, let alone a room.  The light is there more to know where the camera is than for anything else, as far as I'm concerned.  I did notice our daughter looking at the camera at night when it was the sole night light, as that was the only thing she could see.  We ended up bringing back in the kids' old night light because it was impossible to navigate the room with this one.4. Two Way Speaker - This was one of my favorite features on the unit.  The sound on the speaker (on both ends) is pretty clear, and when I caught our my son sneaking out books to bring up to his bunk bed, I was able to tell him through the unit that he better get back into bed.  This eliminated my need to come into the room, and also gave him a hint that he should be in bed!  He was able to reply to me without running out, although he did go outside a few times to figure out how my disembodied voice was in the room!  There is a tiny time delay in relaying the sound to and from the unit, but it's less than a second.  If you've ever spoken on a phone and heard a small echo, that's what it sounds like.NOTE - If your battery is running low, the monitor will make a strange a strange echoing double beeping noise.  I'm not sure if the camera or if the monitor triggers it, but it's pretty annoying.  Once both units were plugged in, we didn't have any issues.5. Lullaby Sounds - This is also a nice feature to have on the unit.  When our kids had a tough time napping, I would put it on and they enjoyed listening to the music.  The music is turned on remotely, so I was able to do this while working at my desk.6. Charging and Battery Consumption - The camera unit can be used plugged in, or with 4 AAA batteries.  We opted to use the camera unit plugged in, so I can't give a good gauge on how long the battery life is.  The video monitor unit is rechargeable, and was also used by us while plugged in.  When unplugged, I lost track of time, but lasted over 2 hours for sure unplugged before I replugged it in.7. Range - The camera to monitor range is pretty good.  I was able to go to every room of my house (one story) and didn't lose signal once.8. Temperature Monitor - This is a small added bonus, as this camera unit has a small wire on the back that gives the temperature of the room.  This seems fairly accurate - our thermostat indicated our house was 77 degrees, while the unit indicated our kid's room was 75 degrees.  I think this feature would be most useful in the winter when trying to determine if our kids room is warm enough.9. Digital Zoom - This feature is not all that great.  Because the camera has no feature that allows you to control the direction on which the camera is pointed without manually walking up and moving the camera, I'm guessing Lorex tried to add in a last ditch effort to have some sort of \"camera movement\" feature on the unit.  The digital zoom does allow you to look at various points of the image up close, but because of the pixelation, it's really not all that necessary nor effective.  I would have rather liked the ability to control the direction of the camera remotely.All in all, this unit is a great video baby monitor.  There are options I would've like to see on the unit, particularly video recording capabilities via SD card and with a pan/tilt feature.  What baffles me is that they have it on the Lorex LW2450 LIVE Video Baby Monitor with Pan/Tilt Wireless Camera (White), which features the pan/tilt, SD recording, AND Skype remote viewing...the screen is smaller, but the unit overall is cheaper and you get more useful functions.  I would rather have those features instead of the 7\" monitor, night light, and lullaby feature.  However, this unit is fairly good overall, and if you want the bigger monitor, this is a solid unit to have.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R2B203CHQBI5NU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works really well, clear image, good sound, nice vox feature, easy to use. A little bit of lag but nothing significant, and has some random fluctuations in signal strength but again not significant. The power and vox indicator LEDs are super-bright - I've put stickers over them and they still manage to give quite a strong glow at night. The power indicator light on the camera is also bright enough to see the cot by, which does mean I don't have to turn another light on and disturb my son more than necessary. The thermometer seems to be affected by the camera unit's heat - you would think they could have compensated for that, though it  isn't a big deal for us. Also, I had to buy powerpoint adaptors for use in Australia.

The wireless communication here uses the 2.4GHz band, same as cordless phones. While we don't have any cordless phones, my neighbors do, yet as long as we don't keep the camera a whole house away from the monitor, reception is fine, subject to very occasional interferences. The monitor is a little hefty at close to 1 lb., and the buttons are a little difficult to understand, so you'll need to read the included printed manual to figure out everything, such as navigating the setup menu system.The camera and its built-in mic are both sensitive. My issue with this product, hence the four star rating, is the camera and monitor could have used a higher resolution. The pixel counts are not listed in the specs. To me the resolution feels like QVGA, at best VGA. I feel that at this price point, the manufacturer could have opted for a higher resolution camera and screen, such as 800x600.

I had been using a Samsung unit for 18 months, and decided it was time to upgrade. This system was a total disappointment.1. The battery of the monitor didn't fully charged, therefore, when unplugged from the power supply, I couldn't get more than 60 minutes (even by using the ZZ mode) before the low-battery signal started to go off.  This happens for both daytime and nighttime usage.2. The big screen doesn't ensure any better resolution.  Instead, it's stretching a normal screen to this huge screen, burn more battery and not giving me a better view.  The pixels are huge!  I wouldn't say it's bad, but unlike other reviewers stated, it's not that awesome.3. I tried to use the split screen... it gave me automatically 4 screens even though I don't have 4 camera. And even then, the resolution didn't get any better, still the huge pixels in 1/4 screen.4. When using in ZZ mode (sleep mode), it was totally quiet, unlike the Motorola unit that switches to sound monitor.  I personally feel safer when constantly hearing my baby's room rather than waiting for the noise sensitivity to wake up the system.  Talking about that, the motion sensitivity, when set to high, gave out a startle chirp when motion was detected... scared me both time it went off, so I had to switch the sensitivity to medium.5. Viewing angle is very small.  I placed the camera across the room (maybe 11ft wide room) and all I could see was the crib.  I was hoping to see maybe half of the room at least.Ok, what I like about this unit: when it's on, I can hear clearly any noise from the baby's room without the A/C sound.  My previous Samsung unit had good sound, but the Motorola sound was like coming through a plastic tube plus all the background noise.Hmm, maybe I should have given it 1 star?", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific monitor!", "Author": "Jenna of the Jungle", "ReviewID": "R1W0SI1H1MTEZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two Summer Infant Day & Night Monitors before, and this isn't even in the same class. This is worlds better. I've been using it for six months.APPEARANCEThe camera looks like a cute little robot with reddish-orange light-up stars on its helmet as a nightlight. The monitor is large and sleek. However, my daughter is afraid of the \"robot\"-- she thinks it looks like it's frowning when the lights are on. I get it. Not sure why the lights don't go all the way around.MUSICSo sweet! You can press a button on the monitor and the camera will play really cute chime lullabies that are not at all the cheapy, tinny sound most devices give off. The songs repeat until you turn it off. The only thing I would have liked here was the ability to also start the music from the camera itself.SOUNDWhen the child's room is quiet, you won't hear anything at all. I thought it was defective! My Summer monitors all gave off a static sound even when there was no real noise in the baby's room. This one turns its sound off after a few seconds when there's only low background noise, so you don't hear static or anything else. It comes right back on if there's a sound (crying, talking, music, etc.).BATTERY TIMEThis isn't one to use as a handheld monitor for long periods. It comes with a rechargeable battery so that you can use it that way, but the battery doesn't last more than 4.5 hours, so it has to stay plugged in overnight-- but at least you can wander around the house with it at naptime!TEMPERATUREI love the fact that this shows a temperature reading. Like another reviewer mentioned, though, it's not accurate-- mine is reading about 5 degrees hotter than the room actually is. But just keep that in mind and adjust the number accordingly. You can set an alarm to tell you if the room gets too hot or too cold. I love this idea because I leave the air conditioning on when my daughter goes to bed and sometimes don't realize until morning that it got really cold in there!SOUND QUALITYGood on both ends. I can clearly hear things on the monitor side and my daughter can clearly hear me on the camera side when I use the intercom feature. The only problem is if we're both talking at the same time; it picks up only one or the other.PICTURE QUALITYCould be better, but it's perfectly adequate for me and even allows for zooming and panning. It's not like a high-definition camera image, but you can clearly see what's happening in a room both in light and dark conditions.\"BABY IS UP\" ALARMOne cool feature is the \"moving baby\" alarm, which you can set or not as you choose. If you want to sleep peacefully, but you want to be alerted the minute the baby gets up, before he or she tries to climb out of the crib, then you may want to try out this movement alarm.ZZZZZThe \"zzzz\" button turns off the display to let you sleep, but when it hears a sound, the display and sound come right back on to alert you.RANGEShe's upstairs and I'm downstairs.

When the baby cries or whimpers, you can easily see the red lights below the 7 inch screen light up. They're very visible.2.) Setting up the camera + screen was super easy. There's no menus or anything to configure. It just works.3.) The camera has a \"cute\" aesthetic, so it won't look out of place in baby's room, especially since it has built-in adorable orange lights.4.) The screen has a battery which you can recharge for bringing it to a different room without worrying about plugging it in.5.) The \"night vision\" aspect of the camera actually works really well (although in black and white).6.) Has multiple-camera support on the LCD, a necessity for those with several children to keep an eye on.Things I didn't like:1.) The build quality is nothing to write home about. The screen is very plastic which scratches easily, and my unit came with a large piece of dirt in between the plastic and the LCD panel itself. It'll be stuck there for all time.2.) The resolution is pretty awful. For a screen this size it would have been nice for something a little less blurry.

During the day, the colour is crisp and sharp. At night, it switches to black and white mode, and can see in the dark. As long as there is some little bit of light, the night vision mode boosts it, and makes it possible to see what's going on. The two way audio is useful, and the sound quality is respectable.The best part is that the display screen comes with a battery that you can keep charged, so that you don't have to plug the viewing screen into your already overburdened night stand's power strip.I can't get over how crisp the picture is. It's like physically being in the same room without having to leave your room. I'm also surprised that it works great through closed doors, walls, etc. I live in an old building, made of solid brick. I can still get reception on the view screen all the way in my bedroom, with all the doors between it and the monitor firmly shut.Initially, the view screen's battery came charged about half way, which made it possible to use immediately.

The star lights and music are novelty and make this more about baby.  But I am currently using it as a security camera and intercom for my front door. I'm on the second floor and it is very convenient to have this on my home office desk.  I can see what is going on in front of the house, see the UPS guy, ignore solicitors etc.I only have the one camera connected, but you can have up to four.  The picture quality is fine for being so compact and portable.  The range seems to be a little limited.  I cannot go to the back of the house, for example, and expect it to work well with the camera at the front door on the bottom level.  But works perfectly in my home office in the center of the house.The sound quality both ways is very good.  Seems to weed out  excess background noise and enhances voice.Night vision is the most impressive I have seen from any baby monitor.  I tested it in a closed closet with lights out and could see everything in closet very sensitive.

Sad I know. Let me tell you why. I've never had a baby monitor myself but my daughter has had one in the past for grandson. Well she is expecting again so I jumped at the opportunity to get her a more up to date model of a baby monitor and the Lorex brand was a recommended brand so . . .After ordering this monitor my daughter and her husband had dug through my grandson's old things for the purpose of a baby monitor, I'm thinking \"She is going to be so happy when she gets this newer monitor\".So I receive the delivery and am all excited (with my low expectation, of course) - well, I like the monitor.  It's about the size of my Kindle Fire, give or take.  I like the little camera. Honestly? Cuz it's cute first of all and has awesome functions second of all.  I like it being wireless. I like the resolution.  It's better than the one she has. It has horrible resolution because it has no camera or monitor. Oh did I forget to mention that part? My bad.I am impressed with it's many other functions it's \"Bells and Whistles\" so to say.  So why the 4 stars, well lets be real people, a nite lite is a nite lite.As I said, she is expecting, so I plan to update this review after she actually gets a chance to play with the monitor in a month or two.

I already have one other system but wanted some extra security, and this allows me to feel better about things. The monitor will split-screen or allow you to check an add-on camera out one-by-one, which seems pretty nice of you want to not only utilize this to keep an eye on baby but their environment as well.Speaking of environment, I like a few other things about this monitor that add to that. First, it has a motion sensor setting that allows you to know when baby moves, or allows you to put it elsewhere to use if you don't want baby moving toward doors, or whatever fear you have rational or otherwise. Peace of mind is priceless, and it adds that for me. You can set it to detect slight motions, or to detect movement based on sensitivity settings. There is also a temperature gauge, and the thing is pretty accurate. I don't keep my house hot so I'm not sure about that, but the low 80s in rooms that were not for the baby and the temperatures in the baby's room where accurate to within a few degrees. You can set them to warn you if it gets too hot or cold, and you can increase sensitivity. That's good because we recently moved, and I didn't know how the rest of my home's temperature  was impacting the baby's area but now I can see it.I have tried it out in a two-level condominium and in a single level home, and had no issues with range. Some people reported they did in larger houses, but it has done me well wherever I've set it up thusfar. I tried it out in a pretty spacious country home as well, and it picked up beautifully. You can work with the picture, zooming it in until it looks good, which i had to do at first. It still has a bit of grain to it but nothing terrible - were they to fix something here I'd like better resolution but can still see pretty decently, and the night vision picks up wonderfully as well. The sound picks up and the alarms can be set to piercing, which is good because we sometimes sleep the deep sleep.There's also the nightlight setting, with the camera having little stars on the outside, which is cute and makes it look like less of a surveillance device, and the the songs it plays add a little extra to calm baby. So many odds and ends I thought might not be needed, but were nice.I really liked this, and will add more cameras in the next month or so.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly great for new parents", "Author": "Neal C.

I expected something more, but it really was very simple. The camera is cute and playful looking. It doesn't have a harsh aesthetic that I kind of expected (I was thinking mid 90s Logitech webcam type design) but instead, it fits in. And it has a nice nightlight on it.The quality of the baby monitor's display looked pretty good. \"Night vision\" mode is limited to black and white, however. For me this wasn't a big deal. It had pretty decent illumination when the room was dark so I could see what's going on. The audio worked well - it wasn't amazing but it was decent enough. There is a handful of lullabies that sounded fine to me. Again, I have low expectations and they didn't sound tinny.Overall I'm quite happy. I can add more cameras (at $100 a camera) as the baby gets older. But one of the things I wish the baby monitor had is smartphone/tablet integration. The more devices I could see what's going on in the nursery, the better. The real test will come when the baby arrives, and this is used frequently.

You get a clear view and the night vision works well.  It is not an amazingly clear picture - certainly not HD or anything.  The camera angle is fairly narrow, it would be much better if it were a wide angle camera.  A fisheye would be ideal.The audio is clear from the camera to the display, but the speaker on the camera renders 2 way conversation pretty useless.  Your child will not recognize your voice.The largest problem, however, is range.  I have a pretty large house (~5,000 sq ft over three floors).  It is standard wood and drywall construction.  I am in a very rural area, so there is not much RF interference.  I had very irregular reception.  Sometimes I would have full range power a few rooms away, but move ten feet further and the reception drops to zero.  Other times I would have full coverage, but then the microwave (or something) would cause it to lose all connection for a moment.  The MOST annoying problem is the out of range chime.  It is loud and cannot be disabled.  Thus, if you leave this in a area with good coverage - but it periodically loses the connection - you get an out of range alarm.  This cannot be turned off.There is a temperature gauge, but it reads about 5 degrees hotter than actual (checked with laser thermometer).  This is probably because the temp sensor gets effected by the electrical heat from the camera body itself.Thus, this is okay, not great.

In the back of my mind, I was thinking of ways we could use it as well. My children are older, but that didn't mean I couldn't come up with a few uses for it.-Keep an eye on the kids while in the pool.-Have a two-way speaker and visual for when the kids are sick, and confined to their room.-When you're babysitting.-Keeping an eye on the puppy in their restricted room to make sure they're not getting into anything.Oh how I envy today's parents. If only we had such an amazing device for our babies, especially for new parents who tend to be worrisome. Having four children, spread out in years, I didn't have the luxury of baby monitors with my first. What a delight it was to have one for the others.

It's often the ones that are quite that you have to worry about.Pro:-Night vision - can you believe it?-Able to see what your child is doing. If they're sleeping or awake. If they're getting into anything.-The capability to see in four rooms at once.-Two way voice. You can talk to your baby, comforting them and encouraging them to go to sleep.-Plays music at the push of a button. How cool is that?-Great sound.-Clear, vivid pictures.Cons:-None! Zip!
