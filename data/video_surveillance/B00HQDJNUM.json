{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, mounting hardware and software could be better", "Author": "Dennis Swena", "ReviewID": "R3UIMDTEN7V4AF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because it was high def (720p) and had an optical zoom, both important features for my application. The item shipped promptly but came from China so it took 3 weeks to arrive. The fit and finish of the camera itself is very good. The mounting hardware included did not measure up to the quality of the camera itself but is adequate for my purposes. The documentation is very brief and poorly translated but I was able to set it up and get it online in a manner of minutes. The image quality, although 720p, is not great. The images have poor color saturation although being a photographer I am probably more critical than most customers who are just needing images for security purposes. My biggest criticism is with the software. the iPhone app allows you to save images and videos but does not support transfer to the camera roll or by email. Not very helpful to save the images and then not be able to use them! (perhaps I am missing something?) The user interface of the iPhone app is very poor, especially the screen that displays a live image. The icons are VERY small, closely spaced, and their white color is not very visible. I do not have particularly large fingers but still found it difficult to operate. Also, the button that allows you to zoom in was a minus sign and the zoom out button is a plus sign. The camera supports FTP transfer and email transfer on alarm but it is either/or, I could not get it to do both at the same time. The browser management application was functional but very basic and not well documented.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HQDJNUM"}}
