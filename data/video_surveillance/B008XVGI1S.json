My neighbor noticed the one near my front door and thought it was real.  It is very realistic looking.  The main negatives are the fake cable is difficult to make realistic and the inability to turn the flashing red light on and off without removing the battery.  In hindsight a wireless fake would be a better option, but overall I am satisfied with the product or I wouldn't have bought a second one.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks Real!", "Author": "Scott Dakota \"scottkb2000\"", "ReviewID": "R3J5C7PND4M4A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This fake security cam looks just like the real thing, for a fraction of the cost.

I am quite impressed with this fake camera. It is sturdy and looks like a real camera. I don't plan on using the flashing LED because real security cameras (at least the ones I've seen) do not have this feature so it would likely be a tip off that it is in fact fake.
