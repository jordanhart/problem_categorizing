{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Picture for CCTV Cam", "Author": "Reds55", "ReviewID": "R3D2KLRBF7SVG9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchases this camera to be placed in a bar/night club.  The camera itself has a lot of options but in order to take advantage of those options you will need to hook up the camera to a viewer as the options or on screen displayed.  Navigation of the camera is tough too.The camera has the equivalent of a .3MP being it is a 700TVL.  The image for a CCTV is very good but if you are planning on trying to see a face or if you are going to be placing it in a setting where you need detail, then you should not be using CCTV but instead using IP cameras.  The price point on IP cameras are pretty good right now.  Ranging from 100 - 157 for HD(720) quality image.  You will need to know how to install IP cameras but after the first one......its like riding a bicycle.  Check out Dahua IP cameras or Google Empire Security Systems, they have a nice selection of cameras.Of the CCTV cameras that I have installed this is in my top 5.  I do security installations in businesses and farms.  These are the cameras that I place in a farm setting where the detail is not so critical and for the price point, won't hurt the farmers pocket book because they are rough on items.Overall, quality camera, nice metal construction.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$168.00", "Features": "Professional Indoor Vandalproof IR Dome Camera, 1/3\" SONY EXview HAD CCD II, 700 TV lines, 3.6mm lens, 24 IR LEDs.
