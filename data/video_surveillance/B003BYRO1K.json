Therefore if you ever catch a criminal on camera beyond that range and you want to press charges, I found it useless to use that in court. If you are looking for good image with longer range you have to start at least with a resolution of 550 TV lines per camera which could bring the price for a 8 channel system to over $1200.

No worries it will not be lengthy, but rather to the point.Purchased this for a mobile audio business to watch over the shop and surrounding area, but with the cost in mind. The Defender SN301 fit the bill perfectly !After literally weeks of searching for the 'right' one to get, browsing many stores as well as Amazon I came to this one. Granted though, I still tried to findmore for my money, simply put, there was nothing. Comparable ? Perhaps, but nothing else stood out to be a better purchase. Combined with Amazons price and quick shipping (Prime member)it was a no brainer.Pros:8 ChannelsLarge DVRVery easy to use web interfaceClear viewing in low light.Cons:None really of significance, but figured I would still mention for those wondering.No 'real' zoom. However for the price it should not be expected, really, it shouldn't.The zoom that it does have is digital and just single - zoom or not. When zoomedthe image appears pixelated and difficult to view. Otherwise quite clear when not using zoom.Again, must mention this was not an expectation I had, but wanted to mention for anyone wondering. The Blackberry access .. it is simply that - access via your browser. Not an 'app', but just logging ontothe site to browse your cameras. Not a big deal at all !So in summary, would I recommend ? Absolutely.I did have one problem when installing. The cameras use two power cables at the DVR that are pigtailed intofour 'outlets' if you will. In other words two sockets on the back of the DVR power 8 cameras, 4 per socket.One of the pigtail harnesses was bad out the box. Odd, but true ! All cameras worked flawlessly, but without thatsecond pigtail you can only connect a maximum of 5 cameras - 4 on the pigtail and one direct. I contacted Defender ..Minimal hold time ( a couple minutes maybe) and I was told they would send a new one out right away. All that was required was a proofof purchase ( from Amazon is fine).

I told her she would still get paid by the insurance company if I died from a ladder fall :) The Defender system works well under both day and night conditions. The problem is with the quality of the cameras (cheap). My system came with four Defender cameras with my 8 channel system. I purchased an additional four cameras from  another manufacturer, (VideoSecu). The quality of the Videosec is much superior to the Defender cameras. (this must be a case of you get what you pay for). Not only are the Videosecu cameras visual better but  the mounts and the thick quality of the BNC cables are superior.(better connection than the Defender RCA/adapter type cables).The VideoSecu and other camera manufacturer makes several different types of cameras. I purchased small domed under eves mount cameras for the front of my home (hardly noticeable by people and don't detract from the looks of the home.) However, criminals know that they are there.

There are 8 security cameras, the DVR, and all of the cable and connectors you need.* 4 cameras are powered from 1 supply back at the DVR itself, so you only need 3 total outlets for the system* Each camera comes with 60 feet of cable, plenty to handle most installations.  They get power from back at the DVR itself.* Cameras have built-in infrared illuminators for night vision which work quite well when outdoors.* Setup was a breeze.  As soon as I plugged in the cameras, they appeared on the display.  I could easily see everything on the screen.* Remote access was easy to setup although problematic in using.* There appears to be a lot of power in the system if I could ever get it working.  Video can be flagged with motion detect alarms, and you can mask parts of the video to only detect motion in areas of interest.  For example, a camera that monitors a window in front of a road can be set to detect motion inside the room, but ignore cars driving outside.The Bad:* Kit was obviously assembled from a few different manufacturers.  DVR has BNC inputs, but cameras have RCA outputs.  The kit comes with adapters, but these add bulk to the back of the DVR, and can create a mechanical reliability issue.  For this price, the cameras should have BNC connectors on them (or the DVR should have RCA).* Remote monitoring through web browser is not entirely stable.  Setting up Internet Explorer properly is time consuming (many security settings must be adjusted), and other browsers are not supported.  A few operations such as Playback gave me non-descript errors, so I could not view recorded video remotely at all.  Some controls crashed the browser.  I was able to view the live feeds, but the UI is sluggish.* There is no iPhone solution to speak of.  Despite all of the hype about using a mobile device, they rely on a 3rd party app that does not work and is 1 star rated in the Apple App Store.  I could not view my feeds from my phone.* Cameras have built-in infrared LED illuminators that cannot be turned off manually.  I wanted my camera behind a window, but at night, the illuminators glare off of the glass.  I want them off, but there is no option to turn them off.* Camera resolution is 480 lines, technically hi-res, but not good enough for facial recognition in many cases.* The included user manual is very weak, so you must go online to understand how all of the settings worked.  Once on the Defender website, a pop-up form asked for my serial number.  No manual matched my serial number, so I had to experiment until I found one that looked right.  Much of the website was like this - broken links, outdated information, and poor access to manuals.* The software may show you a live view, but anything else is counterintuitive.  My cameras were beeping some sort of alarm at me, and it took forever just to silence it, to say nothing for figuring out the problem.Overall, I do not recommend this system.

I am not disappointed.  We needed a system first and foremost as nanny cams as well as some cameras for outside surveillance and deterrent. I received it and had my alarm company rep install it for me mainly due to the heat in the attic during summer in Florida. What can I say I'm honest. I watched as he finished the install in 4 hours the wiring and programming as well. He attempted to sell me a 4 camera system at double the price and he is a friend who informed me that was at cost. He was so pleased w the system that he is recommending it to customers to buy themselves and he will install. Now I will say that the camera quality is the weakest part of this system but they do a good job for my needs. My wife and I can log in either by computer or on smart phone and see how things are w our 4 month old daughter. If you need a reasonably priced system for security and observance this is a great one. The picture quality is good on computers and monitors but it does get a little worse if you try to enlarge the view.  The cameras outside provide a good picture as well. Lastly as I type this review on my I phone the playback w computers is only compatible w a pc not a Mac but the app for the phone to watch live is great an easy to install. The support for set up is great and very helpful. Just have your receipt handy to scan to them for proof of purchase and you will be good to go. I hope this review helps.

Wow, was I wrong.  The Defender SN301-8CH comes with the cheapest cameras I've ever seen.  The anti-glare shroud doesn't slide into grooves in the camera body like on most other security cameras.  It's just a friction fit.  Of course, the 480 TV lines make for a somewhat low-res image, but even the similar systems that come with higher-res 550 TVL or 600 TVL cameras can only record 480 TVL.  But if those were the only issues, I'd just stick the four included cameras in less important places and buy some better cameras to cover the more important areas.The biggest flaw in this system is that it can't record D1 resolution (704x480) at 30 FPS (frames per second) on more than one camera at a time.  Although Defender advertises the system as being capable of 240 FPS (which is 8 cameras @ 30 FPS), that's only for CIF resolution (352x288), or 1/4 D1.  If you want D1 resolution, you can only record 60 FPS (240/4) across all your cameras.  That means you get 1 camera at 30 FPS, and you have to split the remaining 30 FPS across the other 7 channels.Unfortunately, most of the other issues present in this system have to do with the crappy firmware which is common to all of the lower-end DVR systems, whether you buy Defender, Swann, or some other name-brand or off-brand.  In case you didn't catch that they all use basically the same firmware--the only significant difference is the branding.  If you want to buy a junk system, this one is better than the off-brand one I bought several years ago, but that's not saying much.  I think anyone would be much better served by a few WiFi IP cameras, a PC, and whatever DVR software you're comfortable with--whether it's ZoneMinder (Linux) or any of the dozens of Windwos DVR programs.

Did you know that high end security systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars? This system costs less than $1,000. No, a big box electronics retailer is not going to use this as their security system. This system is meant to provide a low-cost entry level of security service to your home or office. In that respect it succeeds quite nicely. In addition to providing decent video quality in small settings, the deterrence factor of having visible cameras is not to be discounted. This is a perfect system for keeping an eye on employees in a small business or people working around the house (construction, nanny, etc) as well as providing a minimum level of outside perimeter security. No, this will not give you an HD image taken from 100 feet away at nighttime. Again this system costs less than $1,000.

Running cables through attic was most difficult part of installation.

Eight is great, but now that I've done it I wish I had at least four more cameras.Finally, the only reason I don't give this product a full five stars is because it doesn't work with Mac OS, you have to use Internet Explorer to do your network setup if you want to remotely access your security video.

Not with this set, it's right there and all you do is plug the cord into it and hook it to a TV or monitor.I am hiring someone to screw the cameras down, just because I am not handy.  But I think if you have a drill (and the right bits) it would be easy.  And then the cord can run along the top of the wall or underneath the deck.  It's black, which works well with what I have, and VERY THIN.I really think this is a great deal!", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera/DVR system", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "RYCXPJBKZ1X7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system is highly recommended...DVR is awesome, and so is the camera picture quality.

The instruction booklet and the disk, which is the extended version of the instruction booklet takes you through each step of installation. The installation was easy with the exception of crawling through a spider infested crawl space. The camera picture is sharp except when you zoom in, it appears pixulated. I can see with the night vision from 15 to 20 feet, not the 75 ft it said in the description. That's why I will give it 4 stars instead of 5. The DVR seems to store 10+ days of video footage, which really depends on the number of cameras you have hooked up to it. I only hooked up 4 cameras instead of 8, so I would have 4 to spare if I need to replace any of the 4 I have hooked up. I was able to gain access through my desk top which has windows XP w/explorer 8 and my laptop which has windows 7 without any problem. I just had to figure out which port in my router to use. I've had it for over two weeks now and it wroks great for the price I paid. The only flaws I have with it is that you can't zoom in or see beyond 15 to 20 ft during the night.

I've owned the system for almost a year and overall the system functions pretty well. The cameras a mid-grade and do a good job of identifying people/objects but not at a quality where you could make out a license plate per-say. Accessing the security system from the DVR unit isn't all that bad. The unit ships with a mouse but navigating through the menus can be a bit confusing and laborious. Accessing it from your web browser is much easy if you know how to set it up correctly. Defender has several \"tutorial\" videos on their site on walking you through setting up internet explorer or safari (the only two compatible browsers) in order to view your camera feeds. Personally, in a day-in-age where everything is a one-click operation any more, it's disappointing that defender makes you spend upwards of 30-45 minutes just to enable all the controls and configuring your router. After your system, router, and browser are all setup only then can you actually view the feed from your cameras. Personally I'd recommend going with SWANN over Defender any day.Pros:- Solid system with little to no crashing/down-time.Cons:- Defender support is terrible! Can't overstate this enough.- Remote access is limited at best and only works on a handful of devices/browsers. Don't expect remote viewing to be easy or even possible.- Getting the system to do what YOU want and not what IT wants to do can be a long process of trial and errorRecommendations: Stick to SWANN security systems.

It can support up to 8 cameras, can work in almost total darkness, supports motion detection and scheduled recording, and has enough access options both networked and mobile.Unfortunately, when compared to the Samsung VKKF007NUS SDE-4002 8 Channel DVR 1 TB HDD 4 Box Camera and 4 Dome Camera, it is an exercise in frustration.1. Setup.Before you begin using this unit, you MUST read the accompanying yellow leaflet. Otherwise, you have to deal with an incessantly beeping and unresponsive unit. I missed it initially, and was literally up the wall trying to figure out what was going on.The reason for this inane behavior? When a monitor is connected via the VGA port, the SN301 boots up in a mode that disables all front panel buttons, the mouse, and the remote (except for its 0 button which is used to change the mode). Without any visual indication!And all the while you are figuring this out, the unit will beep continuously as each camera's motion detection is triggered.Seriously?2. User InterfaceThe SDE-4002's DVR user interface is clean and bright, and you can literally navigate it sitting across the room, using just the remote. The SN301, on the other hand, with its smaller fonts and screen choices, demands the use of a mouse. Even worse, its firmware does not make for smooth mouse motion - so you're constantly fighting the mouse as you navigate the screens.And, it redefines common user interface idioms. E.g., a right click is the same as backing out of a screen. And clicking the Exit button on a screen (even after you have made changes), will take you back without prompting you to save the changes made.3. Remote ControlLike the SDE-4002, the SN301 lets you use the remote to type on a virtual keyboard. However, by another design blunder, you cannot tab from one field to the next with the remote. So, you're forced to crouch in front of the DVR/monitor fiddling with the mouse.The SDE-4002's remote is an order of magnitude more powerful than what you get with the SN301.4. Design integrityAs another reviewer stated, this unit feels like its been cobbled together from various manufacturers. Unlike the SDE-4002 which oozed elegance, there is no unifying design theme with any aspect of this system.For instance, with the SDE-4002, a single Cat 5 connects each camera to the DVR.With the SN301, the camera connection needs an entire diagram with about 5 steps to explain! There is a power supply, a splitter, a custom cable, a video jack that connects to a BNC connector, and a power jack that connects to the splitter. Phew!5. Coaching iMenuAnd what about the much advertised Coaching iMenu? That is nothing more than a single phrase of text next to a bubble. And there are no help screens! By contrast, even the SDE-4002's iPad app (iPolis) has better associated help.While the SN301 had about the same functional capabilities as the SDE-4002, I was constantly battling it to get it to do what I wanted. Instead, I much preferred the polish, shine, and friendliness of the Samsung Techwin's SDE-4002.Happy Monitoring!", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok for low end security system", "Author": "C. Boudreau", "ReviewID": "R3OPQ9XXZWUTV0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So often, on the news, they show video footage of someone committing a crime, and the quality is terrible. I always wonder why it is so bad and how they expect to identify anyone. ThisDefender security system provides similar quality. If the subject is fairly close and looking right at the camera, it would be very helpful. From a more typical distance, you would probably be able to tell what happened, but not necessarily, who did it unless you were trying to identify a know person based on general characteristics.The packaging was very well done. It was easy to open and identify all of the parts. Every cable was exactly where you would expect it to be. Setup was easy. Of course, the hardest part would be running cables through walls or ceilings, cutting holes in your house, and mounting the hardware.I wanted to place the cameras so they could record through windows. That was a miserable failure. It couldn't handle the reflection off the window when it was dark out or very bright out. It only worked in the morning or when it was overcast. I think every cheap handheld camera I have does better than that.The night vision is barely functional. It results in a very low quality picture with little contrast. Again, you could probably tell what happened, but not who did it.The DVR software is very limited. Searching for a particular point in time is jumpy, slow, and frustrating. The system's setting to record only when there is motion should have helped, but it didn't. The slightest movement of leaves in a tree caused it to record despite lowering the sensitivity. Maybe, this could have been tuned further.Overall, it is ok for the price, but has limited use from my perspective.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Defender", "Author": "Kimberly J.

It is a low end system price wise. I needed a halfway decent surveillance system in a hurry and on a tight budget, so this appeared to be an ok deal at Sams Club for 350ish. Setting up was easy enough, the dvr's menus are fairly easy (if somewhat clunky) to navigate. I have not set it up on the network but it should be doable (I'm a sysadm by trade.)Biggest gripe so far is, I had one bad camera out of 8, sent it in to replace, they sent it back NOT FIXED. Problem was the sensor making the image completely white in full daylight. Obviously it was not tested in daylight, so I made the company pay return shipping since I already paid the first time when they did not fix it. In the meantime, I purchased one camera from Home Depot to replace the broken camera. Guess what, THAT cam had the same problem - actually you can see where the sensor was glued wrong and doesn't even sit in the small window where the light comes in - so the stupid camera is in night-vision mode all the time (just like the original camera.)So, here I am still waiting for a working camera, after a month.  Defender's tech support is really slow, but I guess I can't complain too much being it was so cheap.As far as image quality - it's not great. You can change the resolution but even with the mode set to D1 (highest resolution/lower frame rate) you get pretty choppy blocky images. It should be sufficient for most purposes, and it can be useful to identify perps, but I would not rely on it 100% as it's not gonna produce 1600x1200 resolution like a digital camcorder!The setup for framerate is confusing, the documentation is very lacking here. I had to find info elsewhere, and found this useful page on cctvforum under the subgroups:CCTV Forum > Digital Video Systems > Digital Video Recorders -> topic: Frame vs CIF[...][...]you will have to decide which you prefer: a higher quality picture at a lower frame rate or more frames per second with a lower quality picture. That's not uncommon. The typical high-quality recording is at 4CIF (704x480 in the U.S.) that is four times the resolution of CIF (352x240). Many DVR's can not do 4CIF at full frame rate (704x480@30fps.), so something has to give.[...]That page also points to a pdf manual for another cctv system that has much better explanations of CIF, resolution and frame rate. Wikipedia also has a page on CIF.Another problem I had was that the unit claims it's files are saved in h264 format, but, these files are headerless, so they are pretty much useless without the proprietary Windows utils to view or convert the files into a useable format (avi). Which could be a problem for non-windows users like me.Fortunately the programs did work in WINE on my linux system. Still, I would have preferred a useable format, the fact that the sales pitch touted H264 is one of the reasons I bought it - I also read that the DVR is a linux box under the hood, which was another selling point for me.I have other minor gripes, but not worth detailing really. If I need higher resolutions, I can upgrade the cameras to something better (I have a Sony cctv bullet camera somewhere, if I ever feel like digging it out of storage. It's only a B&W; camera with no night vision, but it has a zoom lens and much better imaging capabilities.) There are  much better cameras available (from other brand names), and this unit will control ONE pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera so that's a plus.Overall, it's an ok system for the price I paid. It's not worth more than half the MSRP.PS: I purchased a decent UPS to keep the system powered up during blackouts - or in case my cat-killing neighbor (reason why I installed surveillance in the first place) decides to shut off my power [power circuit box is outside.]I bought a Cyberpower 1500va / 900w unit, which stated it has two 8.5Ah batteries (but does not say if they're connected in parallel or in series - which would mean the difference between having 17Ah total power, or having 24 volts and 8.5Ah) - I am assuming they're in series which would give a total of 8.5Ah. The dvr consumes 1.5amps, the cameras consume (guestimating) 3 amps (there are 2 power supplies, I can't see the backs to get the actual amperage.) So, let's say a total of 5 amps to power everything, that would give me approx 1.5 hours on the UPS (the UPS reports 86 minutes, estimated. This also leads me to believe the batteries are connected in series.) That should be sufficient to see me through most power crises :)", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great security system", "Author": "Magic Auto Inc \"club^x3m\"", "ReviewID": "R17SN1WLU3V4DR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything is great about it, except the quality of the video cameras, but you can always upgrade them with better HD ones in the future.Great software.
