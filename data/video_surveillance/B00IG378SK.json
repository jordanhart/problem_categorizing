{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Use as security or communicating with family!", "Author": "Chandler", "ReviewID": "R10AN9B31SMVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are so many bells and whistles on this that I am just getting to the tip of the iceberg in all that it can do.  I could see this as a fantastic mother's day or father's day gift because it adds security with the alarm and video function, yet it also allows for one-one-one face-to-face communication and showing of videos.  A big plus for grandparent's.You can communicate via two of these but it will also interface with other smart video products.  For example, I was able to use my tablet.You can also allow others to capture the high adorable factor of your cat via taking a screen shot. And you can do the same.  And if your spouse is on a business trip, you know sometimes they love seeing videos of...the kids and you and the cat of course.Thing is, you can't always capture how funny and cute your cat is the minute you are on the video phone, so it allows you to capture his adorableness playing with the toy mouse and then show that to everyone you know as well.The Video Compression Format is H.264 with a video resolution of 640-480.  It will detect motion for the alarm and security component.You can utilize the built-in speakers or use a headset.Stay safe, stay in touch, stay connected.And for family members who just can't get with the year 2014 to see the wonders of you on Facebook, send everything to them direct.  It's easy to use and it's intuitive so they can stay in touch, without having to send paper photos.Package includes:1 x Network phone Camera1 x 3C card1 x Charger1 x A pair of door alarm touch(2 piece)1 x Alarm Remote Control2 x InstructionsCamera provided by LemfoReview is my unbiased opinion", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IG378SK"}}
