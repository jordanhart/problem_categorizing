We had been using a \"As Seen On TV Driveway Patrol Infrared Wireless Alert System\" inside our porch screen door to be alerted to visitors before they got to the front door, however, after 18 months, the bitter cold Mid-west temps caused a series of three \"Driveway Patrols\" to give constant false alarms (often at 2 AM!). I realized we needed a differently designed tool for the job.After a bit of research, I learned that the heat sensing of the patrol device was not reliable and magnets where the solution! I found several different magnet type entry alerts, but chose the \"Heath Zenith Wireless Plug-In Chime with Entry-Alert\"  after reading the other reviews and the reasonable price. We've had this device for about four weeks and it has worked consistently during our very cold weather during that time.I've only have two issues with the \"Heath Zenith Wireless Plug-In Chime with Entry-Alert\". First, one of the two 23A 12v batteries included with the device was dead-- luckily I'd already ordered and extra spare battery (Wireless Doorbell Replacement Battery #SL-6198-B). Second, the chime must be plugged in (it does not have a battery option), so it limited the locations we could place the chime. The nice thing about the \"Driveway Patrol\" was the chime runs on batteries allowing us to place it where it could be easily heard.Shortly after successfully setting up the Heath Zenith Chime system, I realized we needed to get a second chime (due to the first one being poorly located at our only available plug-in receptacle downstairs). Many of the Heath Zenith chime systems share the same signaling and the systems can be joined together to expand your home coverage. As we only needed one door entry alert, I went with a \"Heath Zenith Basic Wireless Plug-In Door Chime with Two Transmitters, White #SL-6142-C\" (a chime with two doorbells).

I wanted a chime for the front gate, as it is the only point of entrance around my house that does not have a lock.  After a bit of trial-and-error, it is now working flawlessly.  I wrapped it in kitchen plastic wrap and a little bit of duct tape, and secured it to the gate with zip-ties.  Yeah, it's a little MacGyver'd, but I get a nice chime everytime the gate is opened.A couple of minor cons:The unit needs to be aligned just right for it to properly work.  If the smaller piece is too low or too high, you won't get the chime.  Also, the volume of the receiver is pretty high, even at the lowest setting.One nice thing that the unit features is multiple tones.  One ding, a ding-dong, and that chime that every grandfather clock seems to have (I think it's called \"Westminster\").  You just have to change the jumpers on the back panel.If you are looking for a good chime to give you a heads-up that you have a visitor, you could do a lot worse than this little guy.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Fred Fourby \"Fred\"", "ReviewID": "R1PHCA0QCS638D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works as they said.  Needed an entry alarm at my new office.  Hung sensor on door in 5 minutes with just a screwdriver.  Actual chime is in another room about 80 feet away and works fine.  Only problem I had was my wireless door bell was on same frequency.  So if someone opened the door my door chime and door bell went off each a little apart.  Almost sounded like a grandfather clock.  Was easy to fix.  Per simple instructions I just had to change the little jumper position.Shipping was mega fast.  I had just printed the receipt after ordering and 5 minutes later the UPS driver showed up (just kidding but it was fast)", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "great gate announcer", "Author": "F.

I still decided to risk it and make the purchase. My experience was exactly the same results. Installed ok on our garage-entry door and it worked perfect using outlet 20ft away in hallway... but when I tried moving it to 3 different outlets at 40ft to 60ft away from the door, I got intermittent results and then next day it stopped working completely. I don't know why the signal was so weak, since we had no \"interference\" problem. We have Wood frame house and no other radio ways in the house or surrounding us. Finally, I moved back to outlet 20ft way and now it works 90% of the time.
