{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review", "Author": "Stuart Stecker", "ReviewID": "R31EY93S4Y7MUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this unit after someone tried to break in to our house in the middle of the day.  (My wife was home and scared him off.)I wanted a network video recorder because I would be able to monitor the cameras from a computer/iphone while away from home.  Overall I like what I bought, but it was a tad challenging getting the ports forwarded which is something you have to do in order for remote monitoring to work.  The instructions were good and I had to be very meticulous in following them.  Even after I thought I had followed them exactly, I realized I missed a step.  The app for my ipod-touch works fine and I can log in to the NVR from my Mac but the application is a \"lite\" version (due to me having the latest OS) and I can't do all the functions that I can at the NVR itself like changing the motion detect.The product comes with two 100' ethernet cables which was plenty for where I put the cameras.  However, be very careful when fishing and running the cables.  I brought the cables into my attic and then down the interior wall next to where the NVR is located.  In doing so, I must have broken or damaged the wire(s) inside because one of the cameras was not showing up on the monitor.  I bought another cable and had to go through the hassle of rerunning it.  Once connected all was good with that camera.  I was adjusting the cable for the other camera so it would be secure to the facia board and somehow I damaged that cable.  Instead of buying another 100' and rerunning, I bought a crimper, some CAT 5 connectors, cut off about 6' of existing cable and fixed it myself.I found the customer support to be pretty good.  One Sunday, I was able to talk to a support person who actually contacted me to arrange the call on a day they don't make calls.All in all i like the unit but I would like a more robust software version for my Macbook.  Oh, and I should mention that the NVR fan is a tad loud", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.00", "Features": "Completely Digital 1080p & 720p HD Recording Resolution (Connect HDMI Monitor for HD Experience)\nNVR will Record IP Cameras Located Locally or Remotely\n4 Integrated Power Over Ethernet (POE) Ports\nRemote internet monitoring (up to 20 users at the same time)Mobile Phone Surveillance\nFree Q-See Mobile App (Q-See QC View for IPhone/Ipad and Android).
