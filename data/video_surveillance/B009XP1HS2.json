{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BEWARE FAKE REVIEWS - This Product is Garbage.", "Author": "Arjuna", "ReviewID": "RHBDGEV73OG57", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First let me say I have a fair amount of experience using many different IP Cameras, but I am not a snobbish user.  I tend to use simple, reliable IP cameras and then manage them through a good software product such as Blue Iris.  I have a mishmash of IP cameras setup for  my home surveillance system of varying quality.  Today I saw these cameras on sale in a two-pack at a common shopper's club. When I saw the two-way audio feature listed on the box I had to try it out as this is something I was wanting.I got home and quickly hooked one of them to my network and followed the installation process.  I was immediately concerned when I was forced to go through the Samsung website to setup my camera.  Every other IP camera I have seen allows you to setup the camera on your home network, but this camera absolutely requires an Internet connection and that you FIRST register your camera with Samsung AND give them total access to your camera.This means that:1. Samsung Has total access to your video streams AT ALL TIMES.2. You cannot access your camera UNLESS you go through the Samsung website.... FOREVER.3. Third party Camera management software cannot access this camera in any way, shape, or form. Every other IP camera on the planet allows direct access by a web browser or camera application software.4. When setting up your camera you are divulging very sensitive data to Samsung, such as your WiFi router's password. There is no way around this.Here are some other failures of this camera.1. The packaging claims this camera has 2-way audio. in the IP camera world this means you can listen to audio from the camera as well as communicate back to the cameras speaker from your monitoring application.  This is not the case with this camera. Using the Samsung website or phone app you can hear the audio from the camera, but the 2-way feature is an intercom that only works if you use the Android Smartphone app.  Again, since all traffic in these cameras MUST go through the Samsung website the 4-5 second delay I experienced just for the one-way audio was maddening. The two-way delay must be excruciatingly slow.I was unable to configure my camera for a static IP address.  I tried to do it using both the Firefox plugin and the Internet Explorer plugin, both of them failed when I tried to apply the settings.  I am a networking expert, so I know the settings were spot on.The YouTube configuration as described in the manual was non-existent on the Samsung website. I believe this is because YouTube may have recently turned off the ability to auto-upload videos to them.  This pretty much removes the only video save feature this camera had.  There is no way to capture and/or save video from the camera to your PC.On the video quality, this unit has a fair to poor quality picture. The night vision image is OK at best. With only 6 Infrared LED's, as opposed to some of my cameras which have 48 LED's, the illumination at night is very limited. The stated range of 15 feet is a stretch.  My Sharx SCNC2700xx cameras produce a sharper, brighter image at 60 feet than this one does at 15 feet. The nighttime contrast is poor too. Unlike my other cameras at night, which have sharp, high contrast night time images, this camera's image appears somewhat washed out and gray rather than black and white.I am terribly disappointed. To me this camera has no redeeming quality. For some people it may prove to be useful for one reason. It is fairly simple to setup and use as long as you are willing to put up with the very restrictive access to the camera. If you don't mind Samsung having access to your private life, and if you don't mind not being able to use any of the many great camera monitoring applications out there, then it is not the worse camera you can buy. Like I said, I use a couple applications that are capable of viewing almost any IP camera on the planet. I have 5 different manufacturer's cameras on my home surveillance system and I use many different applications to view all of them in one consolidated view, but this camera is unavailable to any of them.  If you buy this camera and one day the Samsung website to view them goes away then you will be left with totally useless cameras.I did not do much testing using WiFi with this camera, so I have no idea how reliable it is or what the useful range is.  I will say from experience that using Wifi to control more than one or two cameras in your home network in not advisable. (see note below)BEWARE FAKE REVIEWSI went through every single 5-star review listed under this product. With only one exception, they were all written by users who have never reviewed any other products on Amazon.  This is a strong indication that these reviews are completely bogus.  This is becoming a huge problem on Amazon.com.  I am sure if you removed these bogus reviews this product would rate in the range of two stars.Note:This is not part of the review, but I thought I would add this information based on my experiences setting up and trying many different types of home surveillance systems.  A standard resolution IP camera running at 15 or 30 frames per second uses a lot of bandwidth--something WiFi does not have much of. Even when I was running only 4 cameras at 640x480 15 FPS on a 100 mbps switch I was rarely able to achieve full FPS on all cameras even though the cameras were all rated at 10/100mbps capable.  It was not until I put all cameras into a gigabit (1000mbps) switch that I was able to get all frames to process through to my computer.  There are very good technical reasons why this is so, but for those who don't understand how switvhes work just take my word for it, you need a gigabit Ethernet switch and a gigabit Ethernet card in your PC (which most have today) to build a reliable home surveillance network with IP cameras. Alternately, you can buy a Network Video Recorder with built in ports for each camera.  For me, the best setup is a piece of software called Blue Iris ($50) and the Gigabit Ethernet switch along with a mishmash of IP cameras.  THis is by far the most reliable and robust I have seen and the cost can be quite reasonable as all you need are the cameras, the $50 software and a PC.  Blue Iris also has an iPhone and Android app that integrates all the cameras into one system.  It works like a champ.  I am running 7 cameras, 4 of them 640x480 at 15fps, one USB at 10fps, and two 1080p at 15fps, all of them wired into a Gigabit Ethernet switch. The streams are fed into my PC running Blue Iris version 3.  Blue Iris is recording all the cameras 24 hours a day onto one USB 3 hard drive.  The 3TB drive can hold weeks of video.  Blue Iris is also creating alerts every time someone walks in front of a camera so I can have alert thumbnails which take me right to the relevant video portion I want to see.  I continue to be stunned at the capabilities of the Blue Iris system. It is the best $50 I ever spent on software. While it may sound like I work for Blue Iris, I can assure you I do not. I just like it that much. For less than half the cost of a similar turnkey system from one of the big companies like Q-See and Lorex, etc. I can build a system that is better in almost every way, and you can too.

Samsung somehow really failed with these cameras.I have seen a number of negative comments with regards to setting this camera up, but I had no such problems. The cameras were very easy to set up and they show an image of whatever they are pointing at reasonably well.They claim to automatically update to Youtube. Nope. Doesn't work, and all I got from a Samsung rep is that they know there is a problem and 'they are working on it'. So without the ability to record video, the only utility for the camera is to use it to observe.Oh, the motion detection? Sure, you can turn on the motion detection and it sends a neat little alarm to your phone. The problem is that the motion sensitivity is either so sensitive that it goes off all the time for nothing, or it doesn't go on unless something big is right in front of the camera.And the really dirty little secret ...... \"Relay mode\". Unless you are at home and connected to Wifi, you will go into 'relay mode'.That means if you are at work and would like to check on the camera, it takes forever to connect (when it will) and the video image is terribly slow.No, don't be taken in by the apparently good price, These things are worthless.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy to set up, but what Samsung does not tell you", "Author": "Tman", "ReviewID": "R1Q0MNHV40DXS4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, I agree this camera is very easy to setup, literally in about a minute or two, you can have the camera up and running.  I bought it because it was a Samsung and I have had great success with their products.  I also bought it because, it optionally uses a wired setup to the router and since I intended on placing the camera in the room with the router, I might as well have a wired access for faster more reliable use.If you intend on using this as a baby room monitor or other room in the house that you occupy within the wireless router then, it is a great camera.However, if you want to use this camera as remote monitoring, using Samsung's website then I say beware.  If you want to view the camera with the website, then you are stuck in \"relay mode\".This means that you are limited to 3 minutes of use and very slow, grainy response since your video is passing thru Samsung's servers.  I called the toll free number that was included in the package.  The explanation given was that I am using 2 devices prior to the camera.  Namely a cable modem and a router!!  Samsung support indicates that they do not support live remote monitoring unless you are connected directly to the modem, not the router!!  What's the point of having a wireless camera then?Samsung clearly missed the mark on this productupdate May 23, 2013Apparently last night Samsung did an update on their website for monitoring this camera.  In the process, the deleted all the registration information and I have to re-register with the serial number from my camera.  Well, I'm not sitting next to my camera, that's the whole point.  Customer service cannot give you your serial number over the phone and they don't know why camera registration's got deletedStay away from this camera-", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only negative point is resolution...", "Author": "hookworm", "ReviewID": "RYIQ3U5M85ICQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update: a few months after I purchased these, one of the camera's infrared stopped working making that camera almost useless.I just bought two of these and set them up in my lake house which is 2 hours away. There is a bundle pack of 2 for $200 at some stores, such as BJ's wholesale. It's a steal at that price, if you ask me. I ran them all weekend and tested the motion detection, alerts and other optional features. I tried the samsung app (on my iphone) and used Samsung's PC app too, very EASY to use. I also tried the private youtube (it uploads 30 second clips, not 50 as some advertise), picasa (still photos) and twitter options...individually and together. All of the features worked well and the cameras work well over wifi or cat5. In fact, the wifi stayed up 100%, which is a constant source of pain with other wifi cameras. It should be noted I updated the latest firmware too (which was a 1 click action item, real easy). The resolution is not the best, these cameras are very much like webcams but they are not awful. The night vision works OK. If you aim the camera through a window to view outside, at night, it will not work if there is no light or street lights. The audio is not great but I don't intend on using these for two-way communication. All in all, they are rock solid and work well. One other thing to note, when it switches from normal view to night vision (and vice versa) you will receive a motion detection alert, don't let that scare you ;). In fact, I consider it a twice a day reminder that everything is still working!", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible product - the plug-in, app, and site are all awful.", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R1QQHSQYEKDD5T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this product sounded great, and I managed to get it on sale, so I was disappointed to have to return it - but it is a really awful.(I was particularly interested in the Youtube feature and would be interested if anyone can recommend another product with that feature.)To start using this product you create an account on their site and install a browser plug-in.  I'm using a very ordinary Windows 7 computer and I tried multiple browsers, but that plug-in always crashes before you can do anything.  I guess that's one of the problems with depending on a proprietary plug-in.But that's OK as I will probably mostly use the Android app.  There is no app which lists this product (1011N) as supported, but it appears that they intend you to use this app which is for a similar Samsung product (1010N):[...]Unfortunately, there are serious problems with this app.  For starters, the reviews suggest that the product and the app are really bad.  As well, the app requires permission to read and modify my contacts.  That is the most important permission on Android and there is no reason for this app to require it.Next I decided to check out some of their other features that can be configured via the web site.  To do any camera configuration you must start with the viewer, which is silly because it means that you can't use the product at all if you decide not to install their plug-in.  In my case I had to go through the restart browser and crash the plug-in sequence just to get to the other options.It turns out that  the other options are as poorly implemented as the plug-in and the Android app.Setting up e-mail notifications should be super simple, but they have managed to ruin that too.  Instead of simply using their own e-mail server, they expect you to provide your own so you must enter the technical info for an SMTP server including your account password.And they mangled the Youtube and Picassa features with inept implementations as well.  Instead of using the normal and secure method of uploading videos to your account without your password, they force you to provide your password.These days, only scam sites still force you to provide your password when their is no need to.  Of course, I'm not saying that the creators of this product are scammers, I'm saying that they should stop acting like they are.Ultimately, this is not a big deal - you can just create another, 'throw-away' Google account to use with this product - but it is remarkable that with the plug-in, the Android app, and the online services they can not meet the most basic level of competence, usability, or security.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not work with iOS7", "Author": "JDawg", "ReviewID": "RJEELW67GDOUC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Complete waste of time. Setup is a series of repeating the same step and hoping it will work this time. Seriously, I repeated the same steps changing nothing in between and it finally worked without explanation. Finally, I attempted to use the iPhone app and I got to the step where it asks for the 'Camera Password' with no discernible way to enter it. It just asks with an 'OK' button and doesn't allow you to enter anything. This might be because they haven't updated the app for iOS7? I don't know. But I am taking this crap back. I also don't like how it forces you to utilize Samsung servers. The fact that they can watch your cam at any time just creeps me out.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great IP Camera for home security and other use!", "Author": "ben chae", "ReviewID": "R1OZVC1CY3KWMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me tell you this. Previously, my home was burglarized, and burglars destroyed my security DVR by smashing it with sledge hammer. How outrageous.. Since then, I was looking for security devices that secure from those violent acts. That is the reason why I choose an IP camera. I researched through Internet and saw all the comments about how horrible IP camera is. So, I didn\u2019t have a high hope on IP cameras but decided to give a try. I ordered each IP camera that available on Amazon, and end up with this SNH-1011. Here is my review for Samsung SNH-1011.Great picture quality and transmitting speed:I saw couple of complaints about choppy and lagging video, but I guess Samsung step up with this problem. There are three type of option for bandwidth speeds; High, Medium, Low. I tested all these setting with my Verizon Fios and guess what? With highest setting, there is no delay at all! Medium 0.3 sec delay and low 0.8 sec delay. Not a big deal.(I just confirmed with Samsung\u2019s representative that Samsung will expand their data server within US)Set up is easy and simple:The manual that Samsung provides is quite straight forward. You just have to follow their instruction. The downside is there are so many features that need more time set up such as YouTube, Picasa, E-mail notification, and etc. It took me around 35 minute to set whole thing up including other features. Once I set it up, it was working flawlessly.Web Browsers:I tested it with several web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  As a result, each browser has different installation time and transmitting speed. My preference is Chrome > Internet explorer > Firefox > Safari. Also, Safari does not support bandwidth option somehow. I tried to adjust it, but browser wouldn\u2019t let me. It was no big deal to me since I probably use SNH-1011 with either Chrome or Internet explorer.Android and iPhone App:SNH-1011 has free app called \u201cSmartCam Mobile\u201d. Available on both Android and iPhone App store, but if you such through iPad, it will not show up. You need to switch your setting to see iPhone App compatibility apps. I do not know why Samsung does not list this app to iPad store, but they need to create an app for iPad since iPhone SmartCam Mobile app is does not work efficiently with iPad (stretched image just bothers me).Slick looking with heavy base: I love the exterior design of SNH-1011. Looks slick and has bright white color. LED Status light is also big plus (Red, Blue, and Purple). On the bottom of unit, there is a heavy weight component to prevent SNH-1011 to fall down. The weight is just about the right and can be removed.I believe that Samsung is trying hard to make this SNH-1011 right. Only downside is it does not support cloud storage. To me, 30 sec record through YouTube is not enough. Also, I agreed that there should be way to protect our user ID and password. I\u2019m not quite comfortable with this. If you are not going to use features like Picasa and Youtube, it does not really matter. But asking e-mail address and password seems lack of security feature. I contacted Samsung to ask about this, and they mentioned that they will fix this problem, and also, they will provide cloud service around March. Overall, I\u2019m quite satisfied with my purchase and hoping Samsung will follow up these known issues and make it better.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Please do not buy!!!", "Author": "Kevin C.", "ReviewID": "R8CMW9LNRXV3N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Brought this camera from costco. 2 camera pack for ~194.00.

If you're just stream video it works fine. If you want it to email you an alarm event it's awful. Here's why. The motion detector gives off false alarms constantly. I now have it on its lowest sensitivity because anything thing above that will trip false alarms with no movement or even light in a room. I have noi animals or any flying insects.The audio alert is overly sensitive too and i now have that on the lowest settings. This is my second camera so its not the hardware. I have an alarm in my apartment and might have to just use the audio alert and turn off the motion detector. The app notifications work well and the uploading to youtube is great but I have dozens of false alarm videos uploaded to it. I have a Mace Home Security Alarm and will use it in conjunction with the Smartcam to view my apartment if the Mace trips for some reason, though it seems rock solid and doesn't false alarm. If the motion and audio detector worked great this would be an awesome camera. Now it's just ok if streaming video is all you need.

After doing some research, I was able to find this IP camera.  It connects to internet and lets you view wherever the camera is pointed at 24/7, as long as you have internet connection.  I have this setup in the baby room, where I can see them inside their crib.  Most of the time its night time at home (the camera has pretty good nightvision too) and they are just laying there sleeping, but as long as I get to see their faces, I am more than happy.

I bought hoping I could return them if not satisfied. But, after 3 months of use, that never happened.Installation is a breeze. You do need to register with Samsung and download software. During installation it is connected via Ethernet. I am not concerned about giving my router password to Samsung (What they gonna do?)Now this means that:1. Samsung Has total access to your video streams AT ALL TIMES. No big deal. Samsung does not have time to watch your videos.2. You can access your camera via Samsung mobile app or PC software or directly via web browser and view your video from anywhere. I have installed on all my devices without any glitch.3. Camera management software is by Techwin, a Samsung affiliate..4. When setting up your camera you are divulging very sensitive data to Samsung, such as your WiFi router's password. Okay so what's the big deal in this? If you want my router password just email me and I will be glad to provide if it makes you happy.Here are some highlights of this camera.1. The camera has 2-way audio which is very crisp and loud enough. The speaker is located at the back of camera. You can talk while you watch, like a walkie-talkie. You can control the volume.2. The camera switches resolution from 640x480 downwards depending on WiFi signal.  If there is a glitch in WiFi, it reconnects. I never had to unplug this device for this purpose.3. The night vision is awesome.4. It uploads videos to YouTube, Picasa and emails you video/image link of any motion detection activity. Even if you entire house is cleaned out by burglars, the video is safe on YouTube. You can download your video from Google+.5. You can control at what times to detect motion.6. This is excellent device for baby monitoring because of excellent night vision and 2 way talk feature.7.

I feel that the biggest drawback in terms of features is lack of remote pan/tilt. It's almost double the price of other IP cameras on the market but provides fixed view only.2. The camera is a bit unstable due to the cord connections being at the top. It's hard to position the camera on a flat surface even with just the power cord connected.

As a result, I was looking for an inexpensive way to supplement my current alarm system.  I purchased this at Costco, and they came two in a pack, so the price was right.Until recently, I was just using it as basically a kitty cam and would log in using my Android app.  However, I am getting a security door installed tomorrow, and thought that I might like to try some of the motion/sound detection features so that I may mount it between my security door and the front door to see who is coming up the walkway.YouTube upload:At first, I could not get this to work for the life of me.  I kept getting the error message, \"Check your ID and password.\"  Finally, I logged into my YouTube account first, then went to the settings tab on the samsungsmartcam.com tab and was able to save my information.  Then, I selected both sound and motion, and set the settings for sensitivity high.I walked in front of my camera.  Nothing.  Again.  Nothing.  Thinking it didn't work, I went to bed.  When I got to work, I had 38 email alerts from YouTube for motion (the camera is in my bedroom!)  :)  It is unclear to me if sound is detected or not.  So, for those of you who have not been getting the YouTube function to work, I was able to do so.Sound detection:Doesn't appear to work.  :(  Maybe I'm doing something wrong...Optional iwatchlife.com service:The only benefit I can see to this is that you can set \"zones\" that make false alarms less likely.  Also, the length of the video matches that of the movement, so if you want more than the 30 sec. of video that the YouTube service offers, this would be for you.  However, I wish they offered monthly plans.  The cheapest plan is $59 a year.  I am still evaluating this service, though, and will update more later.Overall:It's not cutting-edge technology, and the website interface leaves something to be desired, but overall this is a good purchase if you want a either a doggie/kitty cam or a supplement to your home security system.  I think this will work perfectly mounted in the door frame of my front door to monitor \"visitors.\"  Will add more feedback after I install at my front door.Update 2/8/14:Audio detection works!  Too well...I shut it off.  I think the iwatchlife.com is necessary, unfortunately.  It has you create a \"watch zone\" that eliminates unwanted detections.  I had 40 of them without the iwatchlife.com help.  Sigh.Mounting this thing to my doorjam was HELL.  Hell.  I finally gave up and just used the sticker that is enclosed in the box.  Anyone else want to throw this thing while trying to use the mounting bracket???Update 3/15/14:I have to say that I really like this camera!  It DOES give me lots of false alarm motion detections from the iwatchlife.com service due to sunshine shadows and bushes blowing in the wind, but, that's okay.  I like that you can set recording schedules, or record on demand for a set period of time (with the iwatchlife service).  I might be taking a vacation in July, and I would set a recording schedule for the time period that the cat sitter would come.  This gives me piece of mind, which is priceless.

For the life of me I cannot figure out why there is so much hate towards this camera.  I'll admit that I had some frustrations setting up the camera because it turns out that you cannot connect the camera's wi-fi to an Apple Airport Extreme, but once I connected an old D-Link into my Airport and connected the two cameras to the old wireless router, I was in business.  I then downloaded the Samsung App onto my iPhone 4S and set up the camera via the app.  I don't recall \"signing my life away\" as one reviewer stated - who knows, maybe I did.  I'll live with it (think, The Lives of Others). The app is great in my humble opinion (granted this is my first experience with a wireless camera).  You can view live events (about a 2-3 second delay), review audio or motion events automatically sent to a (private) Youtube account and adjust the camera's features via the app.  I primarily use my two camera to watch my dogs while away at work and to ensure the dog sitter actually comes to the house during the day.  The image quality isn't bad, but isn't great.  You can make out my facial features and recognize me at 10-12', beyond that you can tell what are you looking at, but without great detail.  I've seen bank robbery images that are much poorer quality than what you get with this camera. The night vision is absolutely fine in my opinion, allowing me to see my entire living room at night (18x25' or so).  The best part of this camera - once you buy it, you don't have to pay any ridiculous fees or keep a subscription.  This is the main reason I bought the camera. Two last thoughts. I paid $75.00 for one camera on Ebay which seems a bit more fair than Amazon's listed price of $100.00.  And finally, Samsung recently announced they will be releasing a new HD interior AND (awesome) HD outdoor camera.  Search Google for the article.  If you can wait three more months and don't mind spending twice as much, I'd forgo purchasing this camera, but if you're looking for a decent wi-fi camera, I wouldn't hesitate buying the Samsung SNH-1011.PS I'm real.

So, I followed that and it worked! Will have to see if it is a stable connection though....See this video [...] and follow the part until the 1:15 mark. First disconnect the Ethernet cable.

Plus, unless you just happen to be watching when they're ripping up your down comforter (yes, and we weren't) then it's not possible to use the mic to tell them \"no\". More importantly, if you want this tool to communicate with, say, an aging relative, forgetaboutit.I hear it can record, but I see no such functionality. That's important if you want as a security camera. Frankly, I don't see this useful at all for security unless you want to monitor your back door from the bedroom.

Some issues...", "Author": "S. J. Luke", "ReviewID": "R23LAS2HPGLGB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Setup:Pretty darn quick.  Plugged the power cable in, plugged the Ethernet cable in.  Went to the website and registered the camera.  On Chromium I had to download an install a plugin to get the video, but in all, it probably took 15 minutes from unboxing to having it connected to the WiFi (you setup the WiFi from the web page).  I have a few Belkin cameras, and setting them up is much tougher (my third Belkin took 1:20 minutes, partly because it is complex and partly because the cameras will crash multiple times when you change settings) - setup is actually the reason I chose not to use Belkin this time.Features:Key features for me, that set this camera from others are the remote storage and the night vision.Having the ability to upload the video to YouTube when a trigger occurs is great for peace of mind.  The other cameras I use have to use FTP or SMB to store images, and that just isn't available for remote storage without paying yearly fees.  They can send email alerts, like this camera does, but they don't support SSL, and almost no email service worth using allows non-SSL connection nowadays (and if they did I wouldn't use it).  So I end up relying on home computers to host image storage, shuttle the data off to network, and as an SSL tunnel to an email service.  Since they rely on local computers they are (more) susceptible to outages or being interrupted by intruders.  The fact that this camera can send images directly to the internet without relying on local computers makes it harder to interfere with and less likely to fail (OS updates and all...).The night vision is surprisingly good.  I purchased it with night monitoring in mind, but honestly had low expectations, but the camera works as good at night as during the day for me.Resolution and Speed:When viewing live remotely, the video starts at pretty poor resolution, but as you watch the resolution increases.  I have never had any resolution issues with the videos uploaded to YouTube.  Speed and delay is also spotty.  Sometimes I see the video with a second or so lag, other times it is much worse.  If you are on the same network, or allow port-forwarding, you can actually view the camera without the Samsung site intermediate.  This could allow faster remote monitoring, though i haven't tried it out yet.Issues:This has been talked about before, but there are a number of false positives.  This seems par for the course: I am pretty sure a few of them each day are related to switching between night and day modes, because there is a severe shift in light intensities.  I also know the sound trigger is pretty sensitive.  I can deal with false positives, though.  Better than not being sensitive enough.  But these cameras do seem to trigger more false positives than my other cameras.There are limited configuration options, turning triggering on and off requires configuring a triggering schedule, which means changing from a routine could lead to lack of protection.I have a third party smartphone app that I use to monitor my other cameras, but it doesn't seem to work with the Samsung, you need their app to monitor.

So here goes:Complaints:(1) The website is slowish, but that's forgivable. Just a minor nuisance.(2) The email function (sends captured video - noise and motion - to your email) is too complicated to set up.  It requires your email address and password, along with other information that I cannot find and really just don't know what it is.  Thus, my videos are uploaded to YouTube as private. Which works too, but I would like e-mail notifications and not just phone notifications.(3) The YouTube upload also requires your username and password.  As the other reviewer said, why are we giving out our passwords to strangers???(4) If the camera detects motion/sound, it captures a 30 seconds clip about 1-2 minutes apart.  You cannot view more than 30 seconds of previously recorded video or combine multiple 30 second clips to view one continuous video. There is no function in which you can go back in time to view continuous video beyond motion/sound detected in 30 second intervals, 1-2 minutes apart.(5) The camera should be $99. Just my opinion.Pros:(1) The website is easy to navigate, except for setting up your e-mail notification as I mentioned in (2) above. Otherwise, the site is fairly simple.(2) For the price, the video quality is good. It has good color and night vision.(3) The phone app is handy and works for me (Motorola Droid Bionic). Motion and sound notification are sent to your phone. Again, see (2) in complaints regarding email notifications.(4) The YouTube function is handy and the videos are uploaded as private.(5) You can log on to the Samsung website or the phone app and view live video.

Never really been up to date with all the latest gadgets and what not, and when I first received this camera as a gift I was a bit hesitant.  My first thought was, \"an IP camera?? What is an IP?  How am I supposed to set it up?? It's going to be such a pain....\"  With all the confusion and skeptical thoughts going through my mind I just thought might as well give it a try, it was a free gift anyway.  To make the long story short, this is an IP camera that ANYONE can use and setup.  Even I was able to set it up, which means pretty much anyone can do it.  All I did was followed the instruction in the manual step by step, and I had no trouble setting up the network.  You first plug the ethernet cable into the camera, so all the online signing up stuff and register the camera, then you follow further instructions to setup the wireless network.  Once that is done, you can pretty much move the camera and place it anywhere in your home.  I had mine setup in the living room and I can view my home anywhere as long as I have my phone.  I know some people use this camera as a baby monitor to monitor their babies, but it's a great pet monitor as well.  While I'm away, this thing makes sure that my dog Copper isn't making any more mess than he should  This thing also has a talk back feature, meaning I can yell at my dog and make an interception before the crime is done.  I will admit, although it was a gift I couldn't help but check the price and it's not at all as expensive as I had imagined it would be.  It's definitely worth its priced value and I think it makes a great gift for anyone, not just those who have babies or pets to monitor.  Just setting it up will allow you to view your home or office anywhere, so you will have assurance that everything is well and put even though you're not there.
