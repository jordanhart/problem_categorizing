I was about to give up on them but stumbled upon a fix that worked for me. On the ball swivel piece you will notice an allen head set screw opposite the thumbscrew.  What I did was use an allen wrench to remove the set screw and swapped it with the thumbscrew on the opposite side of the shaft.  The threading is the same on the thumbscrew and the allen set screw.  Now with the thumbscrew located in the hole furthest back from the ball swivel it easily tightens the swivel.  I am not sure if this setup is how it should have came from the factory or not, but it might explain how some peoples reviews say it works great and some reviews complain about the lack of tightening.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "VideoSecu Mounting Bracket", "Author": "Easy-G", "ReviewID": "RJ9C96ZNQ38H7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a couple of these mounting brackets for my Panasonic network cameras.

No big deal, the envelope they were shipped in contained the spill.The ball head was initially tight, but as soon as it broke free from what I assume was the paint that was holding it steady, I could not tighten either one down to make the head stop moving. The way the design is supposed to work the setscrew on one side and the thumb screw on the other are supposed to put pressure that forces the ball cup into a friction fit with the ball. It just does not happen. And tightening the thumb screw any more just strips the screw.Poor design, poor materials, poor packaging... you will just end up $6 poorer than you already were.

As long as you are ok with mounting the camera straight out or straight down, this will work fine.Also, as a note to several other reviews I have since read, the thumb screw that holds the adjustable piece is VERY easy to strip.  When you get it tighten up enough to keep the thing from moving, it stretches the threads badly, and is pretty much unusable if you ever have to change the position.
