The spec says the night vision is good for 100ft, but in some locations the video is 100% black.  The movements are rather slow and doesn't have tracking capabilities.  I should have spent another 300.00 to get a high speed dome but live and learn.Also the cables with this product didn't funcation properly, I would get video & power but the PTZ wouldn't work.  I called q-see and the first level support guy was very helpfuly but he couldn't figure out the issue and said a senior level tech would call me back.  In the mean time I bypassed the data cable by hooking directly to the screw down block and got the camera to move.  In the mean time I get an email from q-see's senior level support guy and relay what I did and he told me to submit an RMA for a new cable.  Not sure what the return policy is on this but will research it to see if I can get some refund on it and get one that does auto tracking.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "J.

I had finally figured out that instead of the default camera ID being #1 has the manual instructs, it is actually #16. So now I got my camera working for about 20 minutes, when the iris shuts, and cannot be opened again. I contact the seller, which was a third party seller and all I get told is to send the camera back at my expense and they will ship me another, and I can try that one. The packaging for this small camera is oversize so it cost $33.00 to return it let alone another day to get the cabling uninstalled from the walls without causing any further damage. I haven't received the next camera yet. I will update if I get one that works.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Carolyn Ellis", "ReviewID": "R2166XW76957T4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had been watching the price on this item since I had my security system and this is the best buy I have come across.
