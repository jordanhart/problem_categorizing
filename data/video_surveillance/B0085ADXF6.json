Within 24 hours of it being delivered, I caught her!The video quality seems to be pretty good.  I'd probably compare it to a decent laptop webcam.  After searching through the options on Amazon, I found this gem.  Many other models of alarm clock camera seem to have smaller batteries and a smaller Micro SDHC card capability.  While recording, it breaks up the files into 20 minute increments ... which is nice.  You'll need a decent sized SDHC card for extended use of continuous recording.  The first video shot was about 57 minutes long and took up a little under 2GB, so my 16GB SDHC lasts about 8 hours in continuous record mode.  Supposedly, the battery lasts 12 hours in continuous record mode w/ a full charge.  For $30 w/ shipping, I'm happy with my purchase.  Now that I don't have a problem with a thieving roommate, I have a decent travel clock!Cons:*Needs to be charged via USB cable.  No battery compartment and no dedicated power cord.  Must flip open 'secret compartment' to access USB port for charging.  So it's not really 'hidden camera' material while it's charging and the TF card slot and ON/OFF button is exposed.*Motion detect mode is one of the reasons I bought the camera.  But when you set it to motion detect, the blue LED blinks like crazy when it detects movement and goes back to a solid blue LED light when no motion is detected.  NOT a good feature for a 'hidden camera'*Instructions were a lot better than expected, but I still can't figure out how to mute it.  For some reason, it shouts out the time on the hour, every hour.*DO NOT loose the remote.  Without the remote, you have no access to the camera controls.  I wish there were mirrored controls in the hidden compartment.  So it would be possible to control the camera's 'secret features' without the remote.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hidden DVR Security Camera Alarm Clock", "Author": "J.Pitts", "ReviewID": "R11CY5H1QHBZNG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Tried to use this when I went out of town to see whether my bedroom was being occupied or tampered with.

The instruction booklet indicates that a USB cable and an AC power supply are included, but I got two USB cables instead. The rotating cover for switch and ports broke off completely the second time I opened it. The plastic piece intended to operate the ON/OFF switch is so poorly made that it hardly engages the switch. The included driver does not work for the device so it does not connect to the computer. Either the device is malfunctioning entirely, or no driver exists that allows it to be connected to the computer. Since the device cannot be connected to the computer, the included utility to synchronize the date/time with the computer cannot be run. After hours of charging, the unit never indicates that the battery is full as described in the instructions.

Then my windows computer could not read the CD. I could get my linux  computer to recognize the memory card in the clock but that was all. The video/camera part did not work at all. You have to use the remote which is very frustrating because I can't tell if it is the remote or the camera that is not working. I bought a new battery for the remote in case that was the problem. But after charging the clock and then pressing every button on the remote, the recording light just would not come on. I even tried taking out the memory card and putting it into a card reader. It was empty. So after wasting about two hours trying different things, I was forced to admit defeat. The camera does not work. I am returning it. And I will not be buying another.

With out the TM card I can't set up the security functions and without the charging power chord I can't even use it as a clock, when the charge runs out. When I contacted the vendor with my complaint they replied that they didn't say it came with a TM card...which is like buying a car without seeing it and found that it didn't have a steering wheel and the dealer says we didn't say it had a steering wheel. The first line in the manual to set up the security features say's... insert the TM card. They also said it came with a USB cord...It did come with a USB cord, but I was talking about the power cord. They closed the complaint so I guess I'm stuck with a used clock with no power cord. The device cost $25.00 and even if I send it back I will have to pay for postage it wouldn't be worth my time.
