{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not recommended, very disappointed", "Author": "popgam357", "ReviewID": "RC6TPR13FYCBT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "NOT Recommend: I have had three 19821w cameras for 13 months now. Throughout the year the cameras would be intermittent in staying connected (wireless). When they were connected was a very good picture and could view them away from home with IP cam viewer. When contacting support it was a headache, they didn't listen and seemed to have a set script to use (their way) I wanted to use internet explorer; they keep trying to use chrome or a different browser.  It would always take a couple of hours to get anything done and when it was over was normally ready to throw the cameras away. Now do to the last update one of the camera\u2019s quit streaming video, it also screwed up the IP tool on my desk top (had to restore my computer to an earlier version to make it work right again). Tech support could not get the IP tool or the camera working again. Told me to take the computer to an IT specialists to make it work again and to get an RMA to replace the camera. Well heard back from returns today the camera is a month out of warranty and they won't replace it, even though it was their update that broke it. Will NOT recommend these camera's to anyone.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works but don't expect good software design", "Author": "R. Lee", "ReviewID": "RL5876WOX1L76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to install a camera for security surveillance for a long while.  After reviewing all the models available, I decided on buying this camera.  I got it from Amazon for below $100, so it was an OK deal at time of purchase.  If you are not technically inclined, this will give you some trouble.  Its Windows application is not user friendly although not difficult to use once you got used to hitting extra few buttons.  You need to search for the camera, then add it and define an area before seeing the video.  I set it up to detect motion and I have to say it is really good.  I tried it for a few days and it sent pictures to my work email so I know when the kids get home or there is unexpected intruder.  All works well so far.  I also tried using their free DDNS account to set up remote access.  Each camera comes with a free account for that purpose but the instructions said nothing about it.  What I discovered is that the web accounts are different from the user accounts set up via the Windows application.  And the default admin account on the web server has no password.  It took me a couple of hours to figure out these differences; but once it is up, my family can download the free smartphone app and see the video stream on their phone.  But for security reason I disabled it afterwards since this requires you to set up your router for port forwarding, this open up a hole for people to hack into your home network.  I plan to use it only when away for vacation.  Pan and tilt control can be difficult but you can use preset position to overcome this issue.  The video looks good and I have no complaint.  Infra-red works but I have no big use of it as this camera is not mounted outdoor.  I did not try the audio yet but don't expect it to be great for a wireless model.  The most irritating thing I found was each time when you logged into the windows application, the application left a directory CMS on your C: drive.  This Windows application also left a Record directory on your C drive.  And you have to manually delete multiple CMS directories so your C drive won't look like crap after a while.  This looks like some sort of time-stamp files and so far I cannot find a way to relocate them on the Windows application.  After completing initial set-up with Windows application, you can switch to use web access as your primary means to check the camera via wireless network, and this stamped file won't happen anymore.  One thing the web account can do and Windows application can't is to set the system time correct for daylight saving.  This part is missing on the Windows side.I did call their customer support two times for questions.  The first offshore guy speaks good English so after a few-minute discussion, I resolved my issue of knowing to hit some extra buttons to get the video.  The second guy however has typical difficult-to-understand foreign accent, it took some effort to communicate with him.  There is no deal breaker so far BUT don't expect user-friendly software to help you through this process.  Instructions that come with the hardware are minimal and it is worse than a summary in most cases. I did find a Youtube video by Foscam to set up an older model, it helps but not in a direct way.If you are good at searching answers on internet, know your router and understand web access, there should be no big challenge to set this up.  If not, this is far from plug and play so you may have to find a friend who does this before.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Foscam Service", "Author": "Danny Cano", "ReviewID": "R2I8CC219IJAEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Service by Calvin, He took his time to help me setup my camera and got me running in minutes.the camera is great I got 6", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Far..

I will probably get a few more. The images are crisp and clear in the day and the nighttime mode works well enough in lower light conditions for my needs.I connect these using \"N\" wireless which allows me to stream the camera feeds at the highest settings. When I had these setup on lower speed wireless (a/b/g) the streams were a little choppy. You can always lower the stream quality to compensate if N wireless isn't an option.I have no issues with the built in web app to manage the camera but I do not use it. I use a program called Blue Iris which serves as my DVR application too.My only complaint with these cameras are the LEDs. You cannot turn them off if you want the camera to automatically switch from day to night mode. I mounted my camera inside the house looking out a window in both cases. Those LEDs reflect off windows horribly and at night basically render the camera useless unless you find a way to deal with the LEDs.I found a work around on the internet where you basically create a little cover for the LEDs out of aluminum foil and then tape it down with black electrical tape.  It works great and solved the LED problem.I also think the newest Firmware at the timing of this review adds better control over the LEDs but I am not going to rip off the custom cover at this point to find out.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "great camera, customer support", "Author": "AV", "ReviewID": "R9XKMK3E1S918", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera has a great picture.

It has a memory card so you can actually record events based on movement... which I really like... no need to run separate software on a continuously running server anymore.  Anyway, I can't complain... it pans, tilts, and has a great range of motion.  It takes a little more time to \"load\" the picture than the FI9820's did, but that's to be expected due to the fact it carries an HD video stream.

I googled the issue and came across this thread ([...] lots of people experiencing the same issue. I contacted Foscam and they said it could be one of 3 issues. 1. I needed to update my firmware (I had already done this) 2. IR filter was out of wack (they wanted me to shine a flashlight at the camera for a minute, this didnt work). 3. Issue during manufacturing where the sensor was screwed on to tight. (needed to send it in for repairs). They also wanted me to pay to send it in for repairs, when I never had a fully working device to begin with. There customer service is horrible and takes almost 2 days to respond to emails. They don't respond to post on their message board. As it stands now I'd stay far away from this camera and maybe Foscam in general.***Update 12/10/13*** Returned my first one to Foscam, replacement came and had the exact same issue, called Foscam they asked me to send it back again.

Panning or tilting from the website was unresponsive and buggy. The voice over internet was inaudible and just sounded like feedback. The auto IR was annoying, it would click on and off all night while watching TV because it would detect the bright flashes of the TV and turn the IR off and then during the dark scenes it would turn the IR on.I bought the Foscam to test, if I liked it I was going to buy more. I missed the return period so I I ended up tossing the Foscam in a drawer and buying three new cameras from a different maker.Camera quality was OK. Nothing great and far less than other cameras I have seen.My friend is going out of town and wanted to borrow my Foscam, since I am no longer using it I told him he could take it. I also warned him that set up is a pain. He owns an IT service so he was like - I think I can handle it.

But I do have a graduate degree and am a member of Mensa.  So I'm not a self-professed \"technie,\" but I'm not a moron, either.Now:  This *might* be a good product if you have considerable experience with networking, port forwarding, troubleshooting etc.  BUT it is NOT a good product if you're just trying to stretch the boundaries of your experience.  This is the first review I've written on Amazon (or anywhere, for that matter) because this product has been so frustratingly difficult that it merits warning others.It took me around 10 hours before making two of these cameras operational.  And to get to that point, I had to stumble my way through upgrading the firmware.  Why, when purchasing the product, it is not already loaded with months-old firmware is a mystery.  When finally making the cameras operational, that lasted about a week.  Keep in mind the instructions are minimally useful.  That was a huge part of the problem.  I had to Google over and over to try to stumble my way through troubleshooting, most often relying on Foscam forums' bits and pieces of info.  No single source for the multiple hurdles ever contained all of the help needed to get these cameras up and working.Then, both cameras started giving us trouble.  By now I've spent close to 20 hours messing with these things.  One camera may be okay.  But the video on the other died when we used the panning controls on the Android app tinyCam Monitor PRO.  Don't think that it might be the app, because after 2 1/2 hours of slogging through a factory reboot and getting the camera operational, as soon as I tried the pan feature in Foscam's own camera management software, the video went dead.  In fact, the audio is dead.  The microphone function from laptop to the camera's speaker will work, but the audio and video streaming from the camera to computer (obviously, the more important functions) does not work.This is a horrifyingly troublesome product, and I just wanted to believe I could get it to work.  Our Summer brand baby monitors have been dying regularly--one expensive video monitor per year for 3 years now--that there had to be a better answer out there.

This last call didn't have the best experience with a person that did not talk to me on the phone, i couldn't understand him with the horrible accent, and i got hung up on (sort disconnected accidentally doesn't happen!).  So i called back and got in touch with a guy named Fred Jacobs.  He did an excellent job remotely accessing my computer and resetting up my camera after it stopped working after a recent power outage.  Anyhow, I would recommend this camera and using their customer service.  They are knowledgeable about the product and the software connected.  Just hope you get a quality person like Fred.
