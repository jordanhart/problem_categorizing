Due to the delay between the camera sensing motion and actually taking the video the cat (or whatever triggered it, who knows) was no longer in the frame.  I think it's a half second delay. I noted in one of the other reviews that they said it ate up batteries.  I have not noticed that in the time I've used mine, a couple weeks.

Definitely not worth the money in comparison to other cameras of slightly greater price.  Two prominent problems.  One, the motion sensor is way to sensitive, in fact, it is so sensitive it takes most of its pictures, especially after dark, when there is no movement at all.  Consequently you get hundreds of pictures that have nothing in them.  I usually get anywhere from six hundred to a thousand empty pictures within a 24 hr. period.  For some reason during the daylight it is a lot less sensitive.  Secondly, it uses batteries up fast, which is caused, of course, by the frequent picture taking.  This camera is OK if you can get to it everyday, and have lots of cheap batteries.  The pictures quality is plenty good enough within the stated range.

It takes absolutely gorgeous pics of trees, sky, dogs (us of course) walking the trails on the farm by our stream running at the back of the property.  Overall, this is an amazing product.

For my purposes - enjoying the nightly visitors to my backyard - this has been absolutely perfect!  With nothing to alert the animals that they are \"on camera\" they behave normally and are not spooked.  I take the SD card out every morning and plug it in my laptop to see the action from the night before but could also use the USB port as well. This was half the price of any models I saw in stores and far simpler to use.  I have used the single picture, multiple picture and video mode and changing modes is simple.The pictures taken in the dark are surprisingly quite clear. The only times I have not gotten the pictures or videos have been purely operator error - not turning it on before closing it!This camera could not be more fun and easier to use and a better value!
