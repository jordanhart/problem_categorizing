There is no shortage of camera system manufacturers out there, so I bought this one based on the Samsung reputation and the features I needed in the price range I was looking at.  The only thing I needed that didn't come in the box was a BNC to RCA video-out adapter so I could connect the DVR to my receiver to put the images onto my TV.  Got that at Radio Shack for a few dollars.  Installing the system took me the better part of a day.  All cams are outside and hung under the eaves of my house.  I had to drill a hole big enough for the camera connectors to pass through and into the attic, then locate the connectors in the attic and connect the cable and run it to the DVR in my entertainment cabinet.  To make this easier, I taped a straightened coat hanger to the connectors and then pushed everything through the hole from outside.  The coat hanger was easy to spot with a flashlight once in the attic.  I bought some cable grommets at Lowes for a clean look where the cable passes into my house. There is plenty of cable for your average sized house.The most difficult part for me (because I'm not an IT expert) was setting my router ports to allow viewing over the internet.  However, this wasn't all that difficult.  Now I have the capability to view images on my TV and on my PC and iPhone from anywhere.  I highly recommend connecting this to your network and then setting everything up everything else on a PC instead of using the remote.  I haven't used the remote at all.  I had full functionality of the system in about two days.  The manual could be better, but it's not as bad as some would make you think.  I called tech support once.  They were helpful and encouraged me to call back with any issues.The motion detection is nice and I like that you can block out portions of the field of view to ignore, such as trees blowing in the wind.  However, even at the lowest sensitivity setting, at night I'm getting lots of false alarm emails due to insects flying past the camera.  During the day there are virtually no false alarms unless a bird or bee happens to fly by close to the cam.  If cams are installed indoors there would be no false alarms.  My DVR is recording about 2-weeks worth of data at its current settings.  You can record audio on Channel 1 only, but you'll need your own mic or another cam that has one built in.I'm very pleased after owning this for about 4 months and recommend it.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good System, Horrible Manual", "Author": "Philip S. Brooks", "ReviewID": "R235M6AUWEK5RJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a supplement to my 4 camera Lorex system instead of buying a new 8 camera system. One of the selling points was the in-store ad says you can view remotely via PC or Mac. Well, the actual product box doesn't say that, and its not yet compatible with Mac. Not a huge deal, but Mac capability would be nice. According to Samsung's web site, it's in the works.Overall it provides much more functionality than my Lorex system, but it is not easy to setup, especially if this is your first time setting up a home system. Having set one up before (the Lorex) was a big help, but Samsung's documentation is HORRIBLE. It only tells you what each button or menu item does, but does not explain in detail the features and how to actually configure it. I only needed an hour or two to get it set up, but it was a couple more days to really learn all that it could do and how to do it. I can now say that I really like the system, much more than the Lorex.Best features for me are the clean interface, motion alerts via email (though a bit cumbersome to setup), the options for increasing video resolution, the ability to update the firmware across the Internet, and the IPOLIS iOS app for my iPhone/iPad, which is much more friendly than the Lorex app.Downsides are the Mac incompatibility and the HORRIBLE setup guide & user manual (did I mention they are HORRIBLE?). DDNS setup is also a bit hokey, but it works.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major unpatched security vulnerability in Samsung SDE cameras", "Author": "R H", "ReviewID": "R2ECGACSAKA4VF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As with the rest of the Samsung SDE-x000 product line, as of 11/29/13, there appears to be a major security vulnerability in this camera. The current version allows anyone to modify your DVR settings and see the username/passwords of all the users configured in the system if publicly exposed on the Internet. It has not been patched by Samsung even 3 months after the issue was reported on security mailing lists.See [...]The actual code to exploit this loophole is included in the posting.If you have already bought it, you can verify for yourself if you see this problem by using the Python code included.  Otherwise, I would complain to Samsung Support and avoid purchasing this system until it can be patched in a firmware upgrade.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Fit for Port Forwarding Idiot Like Myself", "Author": "Runner123", "ReviewID": "RZ4J8VUSPZDA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My major concern, before I decide on which security camera system to buy, is how easy it will be for me to set the system to enable me viewing my home while I am away. I am NOT a computer geek by any measure, & I have no idea how to perform port forwarding. for this reason I searched customer reviews & noticed some comments how user friendly the Samsung customer helpline is. Although there are other models on amazon which offer 8 channels & 8 cameras for the same price, customers review tend to criticize the level of customer support those manufacturers offer.I therefore decided on this Samsung model, & truth be told, I simply could not set up port forwarding o my own. You can run the installation CD & view detailed instructions on your computer, flipping back & forth trying to set the system up yourself, but it simply was beyond my computer intelligence. Finally I made 1 phone call to the Samsung helpline - and voila - the technician can log into my computer & perform every step without me lifting 1 finger. the only issue is that you have to call your internet service provider to obtain the user ID & passport to configure your modem. Once you have that information, the Samsung helpline set up my port forwarding in 5 minutes or less.I am extremely pleased that I chose Samsung, & the customer support is worth every penny !!!Regarding the system itself, I cannot comment authoritatively since this is the first system I have bought. Physical installation was simple, the plugs & part fit together well, camera images are decent. I have an outside light which permeates some of the light into the downstairs family room, & that is enough to render a clear night time view of the family room area.All being said, I am really pleased with the system.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A nice , but limited system.", "Author": "Michael B.", "ReviewID": "R31VMDK16YA6CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was not worried about the security flaw, for I don't access this system from outside our home network.  So far I have been please with the system. It was easy to install and setup.  (I have a lot of network experience)  I don't like that the system is limited to four camera, but I knew that at this price point it would be a compromise for me.I suggest using the downloadable Smart Viewer found at Samsung's security product website, rather than using the Active X web browser app to view the cameras over your local network.

Manual is very technical and is probably easy for a security tech. I got it all working and adjusted the settings after some trial and error. I'm happy with the whole system.In hindsight, I think I should've bought some higher definition cameras. Hard to make out detailed faces, but it works for the most part.I'll probably upgrade my cameras eventually.I do like the ability to see cameras on my phone, although the app doesn't let me search for recorded files. Customer service said this model doesn't have that feature. You can search files from a computer, but you MUST use internet explorer. It doesn't work with Firefox.
