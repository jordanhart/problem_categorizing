The flex is simple to set up, easy to navigate, and is a great buy.  I highly recommend any DW DVR.  I especially love the smart phone APP for apple products because it has the capture button, once you see live streaming and want to take a picture of that screen hit the capture button, and it saves the photo to your phone.  Plus the APP is FREE.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Buy", "Author": "Jeters", "ReviewID": "R2C6QJIMZXEHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've installed dozens of these units and they have proven to reliable, affordable and simple to use. One of the biggest issues we have with the cheaper DVR s is the lack of DDNS function and if it is present they drop off way to much!  Neither us or our customer can afford frequent service calls to re-initiate the network or have the DDNS go down while they are away on holidays.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy and works well with mobile", "Author": "T.
