I set the camera up charged the battery, armed the device, made it take a picture and send it, left waited about an hour did the #t# like the instructions tell you to make it take a picture and nothing. Went back to the camera and it was off. Never could make it stay on mor than 30 minutes. Great idea but bad product", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life, not as manufacturer claims- only lasts ~8hrs, flash is not invisible", "Author": "C. Lee", "ReviewID": "R1IELJTHGM9Q3H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was able to setup the camera with a PTEL mobile sim card which should cost me about $5/ month which was nice.  I am able to arm and disarm and take pictures via SMS.However, there are some inaccuracies here.They claim a \"Blackout invisible IR flash\" but there are visible red lights from the IR LED diodes when the flash goes off, so it is not \"blackout invisible\".Also, they claim \"* Very low power consumptionWith <0.25mA (<6mAh/Day) standby current, build-in Li-ion battery will take and send hundreds of images. You also can use the external power source.\"HOWEVER, with a battery that is 1200mAh you would expect the device to last for a LONG time at less than 6mAh/day as they claimed.However, I charged it fully overnight then this morning I turned it on and armed it at 8:46am and it sent me a message at at 4:13pm that \"I will run out of power soon. I can't send MMS/Email, please change battery\"This was with NO activation of the motion sensor as i faced it towards a wall and No sending of texts or SMS inbetween turning it on and it running low on battery.So in real world situations I would expect you to get 7-9hrs of use from one charge.The 'standby' mode that they claim takes <0.25mA must be when it is not armed, and what use is that for a motion detector?  The power drain on 'armed mode must be closer to 150mAh.The motion detector works much better indoors and at night than it does in the day.  In the day outside I walked about 10ft in front of it and it did not detect me until less than 5 feet, but at night it got me from 10-15 feet away.It has survived a few nights of rain outside without any damage so far.If this really had what it claimed as far as invisible flash and good battery life then it would be 4-5 stars, but at 8 hours of battery life it is hardly usable", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Indoor red flash camera - not invisible", "Author": "bruno", "ReviewID": "R2FP7ZEZ5GZOYU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is nothing like HCO's description. It is NOT an invisible night flash - it has two rings of red led's that light up when taking pictures. It is not an outdoor camera as suggested by \"wildlife monitoring\" in their description. The battery is only a backup battery and the unit MUST be connected to outside power source - not what the description says \"very low power consumption\".! It will not send to phone numbers and e-mail together, you must choose either one or the other and then it only sends the first picture in the \"photo burst\". The setup steps that you can do with the buttons and display on the camera are not all listed in the very marginal manual that is supplied, so you have to guess on some of the setup. It will not send any images until the \"backup battery\" inside the unit is fully charged - which can take up to 8 hours. The USB cord to the camera does not show battery charging on it's display screen, the manual does not mention anything about this, so I take this to mean it does not charge with the usb cord... HCO has a useless technical support staff that doesn't even know what the normal operation of this camera is - sent me back comical answers that are a joke! Not too impressed with HCO!!!!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy", "Author": "Kymberlee", "ReviewID": "RPSA397L0LVCE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before you spend your hard earned $$$ on this piece of trash, think twice!
