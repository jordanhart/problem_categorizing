However setup can be on the tricky side.  The camera comes with mounting hardware, power adapter, software and and ethernet cable.  There are basically two ways to set this camera up.  One is using the WPS (Wireless Protected Setup) button on your home wireless router/access point.  That is if you have one and it hasn't been disabled to prevent someone from hacking your system.  The other is to hardwire the camera via the ethernet cable to your router/access point and manually setup the device.  The hardwired method is the one that I would recommend.  It isn't hard to do and with most systems, using DHCP, IP addresses are automatically assigned.  The tricky part is using the software.  It will load a setup menu screen with several choices.  The important ones are the top three 'Install Camera', 'Setup Wizard' and 'Install SecureView\".  The main thing to remember is to keep your password the same on the install camera and on the SecureView.  I messed up my password and had to reset the thing before being allowed to get into the camera.SecureView is designed to accept and manage multiple cameras for whatever system is  being designed. Picture and sound quality are quite good on this camera.  There is of course the, second or so, real-time delay but nothing that will cause much of a problem.  I believe there is an app for android/iPhone but have not tried that as of yet.  For the price this isn't a bad camera and one that is well worth getting for home/business monitoring.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad once you're past the setup frustration", "Author": "plyopowerd \"Arrow Dynamic Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R3BPNH6D597U9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera works, but confusing instructions and software make this a headache to set up and run.  I started with the simple-looking 3-step process on the box: 1)unpack box (yes really, that's step one), 2)insert CD and 3)run Install Camera wizard.The Install Camera wizard, the first selection on the menu that appears when you run the CD, takes you through the steps of WPS setup (push buttons on the router and camera) and setting an admin password.  Done; now I want to see some video. So I followed the PDF user guide and opened the Setup Wizard on the menu. An Install Wizard opened and asked if I want to install the Setup Wizard. Didn't I just go through the Install Wizard? And why a wizard for setting up a wizard? I installed the setup wizard anyway, and when it prompted with a logon screen, I tried to log in - and it wouldn't accept my new password OR the default \"admin\" password. I had to reset the camera and start all over again.So, DON'T use the Setup Wizard on the CD menu. Just use the Install Camera wizard, open a browser, and go to the IP address of the camera to see the video.  The video looks ok for a security camera, and there's also audio, although the camera makes an annoying clicking sound.The included software gets an F from me.  I couldn't get the email feature to work (would not log in), the menus are in computerese, the java window takes forever to load and their own android app didn't download at all. Like the other reviewer suggested, IP Cam Viewer Lite works fine as a monitor, at least within my network.  But what good is the motion detector if it doesn't even alert you, or anything?If you don't know what SMTP or dynamic DNS or FTP are or why you'd want to know, you'll be going to Google or Wikipedia every step of the way, which really shouldn't happen for a consumer product.  Instead of being written in geekspeak, the user guide should answer simple questions like \"How do I record video?\" or \"How do I save those recordings?\" or \"How do I monitor the camera away from home?\"I haven't tried any other IP cameras, but there's got to be something better than this. At least something where the company's own software works, or doesn't feel like bloatware, and where the instructions are in plain English.Update: I added another star because the camera has been working continuously for a few months now, and I can easily view it from within my wifi network on Android using IP Cam Viewer Lite or an ipod using NetCamViewer, both free third-party apps. I still can't figure out how to view it remotely, record video or get it to send alerts. But IF you can get it set up (or find a genius to do it for you) it works fine for indoor local use as a baby or pet or backyard monitor. I have it pointed out the window at the front door, so I can see who's at the door from other parts of the house just by looking at my ipod. This is definitely a better buy than the Vuezone camera system that not only costs more but requires a paid subscription for most features and registering on its site to use it at all.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "pretty good for the price", "Author": "amzn hunter", "ReviewID": "R1EZEXD51BQCD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My expectation was low having read some of the reviews, but after a few hours of tweaking I would say it's not bad.  I was able to get it up and and running on WiFi rather quickly. You would point your web browser to the camera's web server to set things up rather than use WPS.  I was able to view on my web browser, as well as the TrendNet SecureView app on Android.  This camera actually supports more dynamic DNS sites that my main router so I was able to get a DNS entry up and running. The intriguing thing was that the TrendNet mobile app only works with the LAN address but not the WAN address.  For the latter I had to use IP Cam Lite as other people suggested.Night vision works but not through window glass.  No surprise as the IR light gets reflected by the glass it seems.  So if I want to use it to monitor the outside at night, I might be out of luck or would have to try installing it outdoors, but its operating temperature range is 0-degree C to 40-degree C.  And rain may kill it.  So that cost the camera one star.Another drawback is audio.  There is a pretty bad clicking sound (static) which was supposed to be caused by the WiFi radio built-in.  When I hooked it up to an ethernet cable which supposedly turned the WiFi radio off, the static went down considerably but was still audible.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Wireless IP Camera but you will need skills", "Author": "Steve Fredericks \"media consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R1C90Y3BOVD4GF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bottom Line Up Front: This camera does what it's supposed to do but you will need to be patient and conduct some web research if you're not IT savvy. Don't assume you can plug-n-play 5 minutes out of the box. This was my first stand-alone IP camera that wasn't a PC-attached video chat camera.Setup: I recommend using the included Ethernet cable on your router to get it configured as you will likely need to DL a firmware update on your PC and pass that to the camera. Since that will likely turn off the Wifi radio in the camera, you will want the wired connection there. The TRENDnet web site has the updated firmware when you're ready for it.Your router will assign an IP to the camera, write it down and set up your router to reserve that IP address for the camera in the advanced settings section of your router's control panel. You don't want a power cycle on the router to re-assign its IP assignment. Mine is 192.168.1.10 on the LAN side. Opening a web  browser on any tablet or PC on your home network and typing http://192.168.1.10 (or whatever your router assigned) will show the camera's home page as it has a web server built-in. The web page will have a screen image from the camera and some menu options.Configuration: Use the provided CD and follow the instructions to get through th setup. One note right up front, motion detection will work if you have a computer OS and browser that allows unsigned, unverified ActiveX content from an external  source. I had to use my daughter's Windows Vista OS and IE8 to get the camera's motion detection set-up image. If you don't see an image with a grid overlay (to turn on motion detection areas in the FOV), you won't get motion detection  functionality.Email: You will need to identify an email accout from which your camera can send images from. I knew from previous experience that trying to use Yahoo or Gmail wouldn't likely be supported so I used my ISP's email account as SMTP server information was easy to find. I then setup the camera to email my Yahoo account so I get reports on my phone or tablet no matter where I am. I tried both the interval email and motion email options and they worked fine. I have not tried the  scheduled email option yet.Streaming: To see streaming video from within your own home LAN, just visit the http web site for your camera's address or download a third party app. I use IPCam Lite (free) on my Apple iOS devices. You remotely turn off/on motion detection and LEDs from your smartphone. To see your camera's streaming video on the internet from anywhere in the world, you'll have some work to do.Your home's IP address: Learn it, write it down, check it often. You can use this as an alternative to Dynamic DNS services that may cost you. Since most ISPs use dynamic assignments for resdential consumers (unless you already have a static IP),  you will need to set up your viewing app with this IP address to get to your house from the internet. You willl also have to poke a hole in your routers firewall to allow outside access to your camera. Each router is different in this regard so research port forwarding and how to add a port number to an IP address. For example, if your home IP address is 50.80.122.253 and you are forwarding your camera's port to port 21, you'd enter 50.80.122.253:21 in the web address.I have yet to try FTP and Dynamic DNS so no advice for those yet. Also, if you put this cam in a window to view an outdoor night scene, command the LED off and put it in Day Mode to turn IR LEDs off too. They reflect off of the window and spoil the image.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "No scheduled motion detection", "Author": "Janek Uin", "ReviewID": "R2OD0723IEZ6CI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera has the same hardware and firmware as the latest D-Link models (several versions of which I also own). This is good and bad at the same time. You get a good image quality and some nice features. Except one feature that's crucial to many - you can not do scheduled motion detection. This means that motion detection is either always on or off. You can not have the camera switch it off, say at 5 PM when you get home or during the weekends. Previous Trendnet cameras that I own all have that feature and that's why I went with Trendnet again this time. Little did I know ...So, in short, if you don't care about missing motion detection scheduling feature, get a real D-Link camera instead.

All manufacturers provide a startup wizard and background services (Dynamic DNS) to allow remote access to live views.  The fact is, the ability to capture activity triggered by motion when not viewing live is the most valuable capability of this and more expensive cameras.The motion detection features differ by manufacture.  TRENDnet cameras can be set to capture and transfer images whenever motion is detected until motion stops.  The Panasonic models with motion-detection can be set to capture and transfer images after motion is detected for a user defined interval even if motion is not ongoing.  Both work with WERMS, TRENDnet cameras tend to produce more, yet shorter events.  TRENDnet cameras have very good sensitivity adjustments and a focus ring.To get started with any Internet camera, you must connect the camera to your network with a cable.  The TRENDnet cameras use DHCP out of the box to obtain an internal IP address from the router,  Panasonic uses a fixed IP address XXX.XXX.XXX.253.  It may be easier for you to identify the IP address in your router's DHCP table, than to use the TRENDnet wizard.  With this key IP address, you can view live locally immediately and access the administration pages so you can make progress exploiting the camera's features.  The default administrator username/password combination is \"admin\" and \"admin\".Next, it helps to familiarize yourself with the TRENDnet Administration/Configuration menu.  TRENDnet uses Active-X (Windows), Java, and Apps for live view and some configuration tasks as apposed to the generic, device agnostic techniques.  Some older Apple computers, iPads, and iPhones do not support Java and require an App for live view, but this should not deter you from this camera.  Many cameras have these constraints.  The TRENDnet camera's home page will display a current snapshot.You can now define a secure admin username, define wireless settings, and set the camera date and time.  We recommend leaving the cable connected until all setup objective are completed.  We also suggest that that settings be inserted to synchronize the camera to an Internet time server.  The server \"pool.net.org\" should work.At this point, WERMS can quickly prepare your camera to use their remote monitoring solution and provides detailed guidance to help configure the camera and your router for live view.If you sign up for free at WERMS (werms.com), and add your TRENDnet camera for a no risk trial, you can use the simplified setup screen to setup for motion detection and FTP image transfers to WERMS.  After you start accruing a motion-triggered event history, you will feel much better about attempting the live view setup steps below.  The ability to detect motion and transfer images to powerful monitoring service like WERMS is the most important feature of these cameras!The steps to prepare for live viewing from remote locations can be confusing at first, however, all Internet cameras require these actions to grant access to the camera from the cloud, otherwise unwelcome visitors could access your network without permission.  These steps are not required for WERMS monitoring.To allow live viewing from remote locations, you should use the TRENDnet configuration to define a static (permanent) IP address and port using the \"Network\" page.  Make notes as you go or use the worksheet in the WERMS Setup Guide.  You must enter a gateway and DNS address.  Each camera should also be assigned a unique port.  You will need this new IP address and port (i.e. [...]to access the camera after you save the changes.  If you can access the camera with the new static IP address and port, you are ready to configure your router to allow remote access.  In you router, define a port forwarding rule that will accept external requests to the defined port to the IP address and port for the camera.  If done correctly, you should be able to access you camera with the router's external address port (see your router's status page).

You must configure your router to \"port-forward\" the TCP/IP ports which your camera use, so that they are no longer blocked by your router by default for security reasons. Another way of saying this is \"opening up pinholes\", so that the router can allow the camera video data stream to go through.But because this \"configuration\" is not done on the camera but on the router, and it does require some technical know-how, this is the place that trips up most users. If you do not know how to setup the router to do port-forwarding, you will not be able to view camera videos remotely. My ISP is AT&T; and they did help me setup the port-forwarding. What they do is basically taking temporary control of your PC via remote control to do all the configuration. It may cost from $15 to $25, but I'd say it's worth it, as this is done only once and their expertise will save you a lot of headache.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apparently I ordered the wrong camera for my requirement.

Goldstein", "ReviewID": "RC8BB1S12JXF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There have been a lot of mixed reviews on this product, and clearly some people have had problems, but I have not.  I now have a total of 9 of these Trendnet TV-IP551W cameras making up my home surveillance system.  They are good cameras and they work well.  Picture is crisp and clear, and the included software is great - more on that later.  The 802.11n wireless is very solid and reliable.  There is also an Ethernet port for wired connection.  As mentioned in other reviews, the \"IP Cam Viewer Pro\" app by Robert Chou allows you to view the cameras from anywhere using an Apple IOS or Android device.  Fair warning though, you do have to know something about Firewalls and Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to make this work from anywhere over the internet (you may need your IT buddy to help you with that part - but that is not unique to Trendnet as most IP Cams work in a similar manner for most home users).  I should also note that one of my nine cameras is the TV-IP551WI (the day/night version).  All I can say is \"Wow!\".  I can see everything in a large room in total darkness when the IR night vision mode is on.So why only 4 stars?  The audio. Audio from the camera is all clicks and static when using this device on a wireless network.  You can hear what is going on above the noise, but it is really difficult.  I contacted Trendnet support about this and they were great, but admitted that the noise was interference from the camera's own built-in wireless network adapter radio (design problem). If you have the camera plugged into the wired Ethernet, the WLAN radio is disabled and there is no static at all.  The microphone picks up sounds from far away, and the sound quality is great.  Just not on wireless.  I did get around this by purchasing a few Netgear WNCE2001 WiFi Ethernet adapters, connecting them to the wireless network, and then using a short Ethernet cable to the camera.  I only did this for a few, where I had to use wireless and really cared about good audio.  That did the trick.  The adapter is small and does not take up much space, but does need an extra power outlet.The camera comes with included Trendnet SecurView Pro software allows you to have full DVR functionality.  Very good and powerful software if you take the time to read the manual and learn how to use it.  I have it running on a dedicated server with a Seagate STBV3000100 3TB USB External disk (that I got on Amazon for just over $100) to hold the recordings.  So far, with 9 cameras feeding audio and video to the SecurView server, I can retain over 5 days of history using less than half the capacity of the drive.  I could probably increase retention to 10 days. The software has lots of options, including motion-based detection events and is highly configurable.So in summary, it is a very good and capable camera, and is easy to setup.  Yes there are others out there that may be better, but the combination of the price, video quality and the SecurView software made this the reason I kept coming back.  My whole Trendnet system including cameras, USB disk drive and a couple of network adapters was just over $500 and works as well as more high-end commercial systems starting at $2000.  For the money, it was a good choice for me, and I am happy with my system.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Epic fail!", "Author": "Denise Crawford \"DC\"", "ReviewID": "R2HUB4J0S5943H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera because I was burglarized and wanted to increase monitoring of my home beyond the alarm system I promptly had installed (yes, a little too late but at least the signs and decals might stop the next criminal).

To say that \"set up is tricky\" is an understatement. Since I have protection on my home wireless, I did not want to disable that to allow the camera remote access. I tried the hardwire method but was unable to follow it or get it to work using the directions or the set up wizard.
