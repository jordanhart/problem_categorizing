Reliable so far (I have two of them and they are both about 3 months old). The range far exceeds their claimed 165 feet. Outdoors we get semi-reliable signal at 1300 feet!", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price.", "Author": "Richard Patterson", "ReviewID": "R3LU85BVQVXPU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Preformed as well as I had expected.  Very easy installation and set up.  Great color in daylight and preforms very well at night.  I have a night light installed near where the camera is installed, this gives the camera an almost daylight operation.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOrks Great even at Night!", "Author": "Timothy Sayre", "ReviewID": "R1O7NB6SJX9FCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Added this camera to my system, put it out in my barn with a metal roof at least 100 feet from the system and the signal is great and the night vision is better than any of my other cameras. Was a little worried that it may not function well through the metal roof and wood walls, but no problems at all and playback of recorded video is clear. I am adding 3 more of these to the other areas of my acreage to keep an eye on things as they really work well.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Much better image than the last Lorex wireless I ordered.", "Author": "Spoot", "ReviewID": "R36ODZUBRS1CCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a small 4-channel system that records in D1/960h. The wired cameras are 700TVL. I added a couple different Lorex wireless cameras (LW2110)when I installed the whole system. Now I added this wireless. It it a noticible improment over the other cameras in both image quality and frames-per-second (fluid video stream).It also adds sound to the recordings - nice!The adjustment knobs were just plastic, so I had to be careful using the screwdriver (thumb screws are small for bigger hands).Night viewing is also notably better with this model versus the LW2110.It may cost a bit more, but I thinnk it is worth it.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great wireless cameras", "Author": "Jeramy C.", "ReviewID": "R1TJRUZSUKSEW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.... Installed at a church that was a old movie theater with concrete walls. Longest run was 140' and going through four seperate concrete walls with no signal loss and great picture. Will use in the future again for hard to wire projects.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incomplete information", "Author": "Lyn Hill", "ReviewID": "R1675MJH2CTPF6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really don't know how this works because I don't have a DVR and it wont work without one.

Parrott", "ReviewID": "R15P8WV2BTQXQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an ok camera but it wipes out any wireless signal from your 2.4g router no matter what channel or no matter what u do.  you would have to have a 5.0g router for your wireless stuff in order to use this camera.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Let the misrepresentations begin!", "Author": "Marathon Freak", "ReviewID": "RGINUWOAIGIH7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK, first this thing is marketed as an indoor/outdoor camera but then it states it can't be submerged in water and must be installed in a sheltered area.  And then it says it's weatherproof.  Apparently they mean it's good-weather proof.  It says wireless but will clearly need power from somewhere (a problem for all cameras with PoE being the best option for power/data in a single wire.)  This thing is not WEB-enabled.  No smartphone access.  No web access.  You MUST have a DVR or a dedicated monitor.  There's no mention of how the signals between the camera and the receiver are secured or how multiple cameras can operate.  Anyone with a similar camera could theoretically pick up your signal and view your camera.  If you just need a quick solution that doesn't need a web interface or have any security and already have a DVR, this might be for you.  If you're looking for a plug-and-play one-camera does it all, this isn't it.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D3MJ152"}}
