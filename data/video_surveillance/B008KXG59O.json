That means all you that use Chrome or Safari are out of luck ( or your favorite *nix ). figuring that there was an apple app for the cameras and I all ready had one this would not be a problem.  turns out they use a differing protocol so my old camera app was not supported, should not be an issue they have an app for this product ( seems that the techs tell you that theirs does not work and you should use another one that well didn't work... for remote viewing from any thing other then IE this thing would be -1 stars, but seeing this does power up and you can use the VGA or BNC/TV out for a office or home that does not require remote viewing  id say a solid two... ( more so because it has not caught fire yet ) also to note with the non-standard items you would assume that the battery would be a standard 2032 coin battery, used in every appliance one could imagine but this uses a CR1220 battery. Lastly this thing has a pizzo buzzer on it that was remanufactured from those personal 120db security sirens, and its not afraid of using it for every error one could imagine and there is not a check box for disable stupid repeaded 1/2 second beep beep beep beep...

The menu system is completely different than the other Zmodo DVR I had. Some parts are better, some are not. The computer software is a little quirky at times, but mostly gets the job done. If you're just viewing the cameras live and not trying to replay something it works pretty well. Replaying and downloading on the computer is troublesome. For example, if replaying two cameras at once, their times are not synced. The time you're watching on camera one may be at 8:00 AM, but the time on camera two may be 8:15 AM. Makes it rather difficult when trying to watch someone going from one camera's view to the next. I haven't tried the same thing doing it straight off the DVR, so that may work better.

The hard part is programming it to view the cameras on the web, smart phones etc.The manual is useless and the Zmodo web site looks nice but lacks basic but vital information. It has a nice tutorial on how to get connected to the Internet but it leaves you hanging if you have a \"dynamic IP address.\" If you don't know what I'm talking about you'll just have to figure it out like I did! Basically, I can see my cams from a computer using the same router as my DVR but not from an external computer over the internet because my internet IP address changes like most peoples\u2019. They offer some free service to get around this. I signed up but there is no explanation on how to get it working so I'm stuck.The DVR has lots of settings but there is no information to tell you what each one is for. If there was, it might be possible to figure out a lot of things.The DVR itself is OK but I expected the saved videos to have better resolution. You can adjust the quality but even the best quality is not very good. The image during playback is very small and if you enlarge it, it is very grainy. To compensate for this you need very good quality cameras, which cost money. I thought I was buying good cameras but they ended up being the blurry ones everyone talks about. The resolution is so poor I have difficulty recognizing people I know never mind a stranger.The built in program is a bit quirky. Its different when accessed through the DVR then through a computer. So, in a way you have to learn to do everything two ways. Some things are easier to do from a computer and others are easier from the DVR. Some things I can\u2019t get to work. The DVR also comes with another program but I can\u2019t get it to work on my computer with Windows 7.Its all a very long and tiring learning process due to the lack of organized information. Perhaps over time I will get it all figured out. But, I think I will need a tech to set it up to its full potential.For the price this DVR does the job but the lack of information and instructions make setting it up very time consuming for the average Joe. I\u2019m astonished that companies have the nerve to sell a product without providing detailed info to their customers.I use this DVR for apartment block surveillance. So far I haven\u2019t caught any thieves but thanks to this system I did discover who barfed in the parking lot after drinking too much.
