I just received the package and was pissed when I opened it. It was only one camera in the box. Wish I can call this company and speak to them about this because I only intended to spend around $40 on a camera and not $129 for a single camera. As for the functionality I haven't tested it as yet. When I do I would probably repost", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.95", "Features": "600TV lines of resolution provides excellent picture quality\nNight Vision up to 50ft away in total darkness\nAutomatic Infrared Filter ensures true color in all lighting conditions\nOutdoor weatherproof and tamper proof housing rated at IP 66\nhigh resolution, built-in 3.6mm wide angle view lens\nBuilt-in Infrared lights for night vision\nWeatherproof aluminum housing for indoor and outdoor application\nAuto Gain Control; Electronic Shutter Adjustment; Great for indoor security\n60ft cable and power adapter included\nColor CMOS image sensor", "Name": "iSmart C4010DP6 CMOS 4 Pack IR Dome Security Outdoor Weatherproof 600TVL CCTV Surveillance Camera 60 ft cables & power adapter", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hWTz7gXHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DZVF2ZE"}}
