This is a large mic and I'd recommend smaller pickup/mic if used alongside camera. I mounted this atop/side of the main box. I would not feel comfortable using for exterior application. Be sure to get male/male RCA connection if you use for my application. As I put in other reviews PLAN, PLAN & PLAN your build. Know the specs of the equipment and accessories needed before you start. It's tough to start and have to wait for needed pieces.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing sound", "Author": "Aaron Gustafson", "ReviewID": "R3PEM8899KWODW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't expect these to work Tremendously, but after hooking it up I was absolutely amazed by it's audio quality.
