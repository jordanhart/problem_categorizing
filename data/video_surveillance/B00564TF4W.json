It's early days yet - but it seems to be robust and well made to last a long time.The short videos it creates are time stamped - which is what I was looking for - and can view something in absolute darkness.The videos are a bit over exposed as they need to be to catch the tiniest of light sources. I don't intend to do anythingexcept keep track of animal movements at night - so the videos are just fine for me.The instructions are clear. But, they tend to assume that the reader is completely aware of what they are referring to.In order to set the time and date stamp (which works very well) you need to create a small .txt file and transfer it intothe folder of the camera.For those confused by this - on a Windows machine (sorry can't speak to what is needed on Macs, . .) in the 'Accessories'folder in the programs of the Start Menu, you should find 'Notepad'. This is what you would use to create the .txt file with thecurrent date & time. (The text you type in and save is completely spelled out in the instructions, . . .)Once created and saved - you drag and drop it into the camera folder after you have connected the camera to ]your pc. That's all there is to it.One note - this may be tripping up some trying to set the time and date - The time that needs to be set is based on a24 hour clock (which most of the world uses, . .) as opposed to a 12 hour clock that we use in the States. So 5PM iswritten as 17:00.  This may be one of the reasons setting the time hasn't worked for others.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great rodent tracker!!!!", "Author": "Mark's_reviews", "ReviewID": "RTFU67M3OO5PC",

in a nice, baited trap.Upon arrival of the camera, I was initially disappointed to not see any option for adjusting the sensitivity of the IR detector, as I had seen on other cameras advertised (I was worried that the factory adjustments wouldn't be sensitive enough to detect something as small as a rat). Oh well, I thought, I'll give it a try and if it doesn't work I can always throw it into the vast pile of other useless electronic junk that I seem to be addicted to buying off of the internet.Using the factory settings for video capture time (30sec), I mounted the camera on a tripod, in our kitchen, and aimed it in the vicinity of where we've been seeing evidence (droppings, puffballs of fiberglass insulation, etc). I turned the unit on at 11pm and went to bed not expecting much.After waking up the next day, I went about my business, not being overly excited about the camera; still convinced that it couldn't possibly be sensitive enough to detect a rat. I finally got around to retrieving the camera and attaching it to my PC with the included video cable (BTW, my unit did not come with a memory card, and had to purchase a 4GB one from Best Buy for $13 + tax. Be sure to buy one from Amazon as the price can't be beat).Anyway, after attaching it to my PC, I opened up the camera's folder, and there were 15 videos, ranging in time from 30 sec to 90sec. Could the camera have actually caught one of the little son-of-a-guns?, I wondered? With anticipation, I opened up the very first video file and was pleasantly startled to see what I saw. There it was in all it's tiny glory, skittering around my kitchen floor, thumbing it's wiggly little nose up at me!Based on my new-found knowledge of his whereabouts, I'm in the process of putting together a party for my little friend - a party from which he'll hopefully never return!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nifty little device", "Author": "Matt W", "ReviewID": "R2UBWS2IRBNV9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this for a few weeks to watch for people snooping around my work cubicle after hours.  So far I'm fairly impressed - the device works as advertised.Pros: - Excellent battery life, I have left it unattended for several days at a time. - There is a tripod mount on the back of unit, but I haven't tried it yet. - Very small package - does not look overly conspicuous. - Included rubber stand allows for easy positioning - Incredibly easy to use once configured - just turn the switch \"on\" when you want it active. - The night vision, while I have only tested it once, is surprisingly pretty good.Cons (mostly already covered) - The instructions are not very clear. - The field of view is not very wide - I'm only able to capture about 1/2 of the area in my cubicle. - When in pitch dark, the IR LED's light up for the night vision to work.  The IR's are not invisible - they emit some low red light, which to me was clearly visible in a mostly dark room - this makes it somewhat conspicuous in the dark. - There is a definite delay in time to start recording.  This is the price for long battery life - the device is in \"standby\" until it detects motion, so there's a delay for things to get rolling.  Typically a person is fully in frame by the time recording starts.  I don't think it's a big deal personally, but expect the first 2-4 seconds of an \"event\" to be missed. - Connecting it to my PC is rather flaky using the built-in USB port.  I usually remove the microSD card and use a separate microSD reader to access the stored videos.And here is a rough setup guide that may help those who struggle with the included directions:1) Acquire a microSD card that is at least rated as \"Class 6\" - I bought a 16 gig one from a different online site.  It is NOT included.2) You must be able to access this microSD card as a drive on a Windows PC - either by following the included directions for activating the \"removable storage\" on the camera, or the much easier method - use a microSD USB reader.  Many microSD cards come with a reader.3) The camera comes with a small CD containing a setup executable (.exe) file.  You must copy this setup file to the microSD card.  Do NOT launch the setup program from the CD - copy it to the microSD card, and then put the CD away - you won't need it anymore.4) From the microSD card, launch the setup program that you just copied.  Here you will set resolution, frame rate, and date/time.  Click the \"save\" button.5) The program will instruct you to reboot the camera.  If you are using an external card reader, take the card out and put it into the camera - remove the battery cover and gently pull the battery aside to expose the microSD slot.  If you are not, then disconnect the camera from the USB cable and thrn it \"Off\".6) Wait a few seconds, then, turn the camera switch to \"On\".  Set it somewhere, dance around in front of it, whatever, to test it.  I would recommend running it for several minutes, some of that time spent moving in front of it, and some of that time spent out of the field of view, to give it a thorough test.  The camera generally will NOT save the video it is CURRENTLY recording, so if you just turn it on, move around, and turn it off, the camera will not save any videos.  You must allow it to reset to standby at least once for it to write the video to the card.7) Turn the camera off and move the microSD card to your reader (or, follow the directions to put the camera in mass storage mode).  Open the \"VIDEOS\" folder on your SD card.  There should be folders sorted by date, and then videos within for each motion detection, the file name being the timestamp.  Make sure you can play them.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Somewhat impressed", "Author": "morfeus4", "ReviewID": "R298HBJQQEQKK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to put into my car and everything works fine except the motion activation takes too long to activate.  If you walk at a normal pace past my car then the activation is too slow to catch the motion.  If you linger for more than 5 seconds, only then will it will catch the motion.  I have an internal motion activation system in my house that senses motion instantly even in the dark.  I guess I am used to INSTANT motion detection and this camera has 5 SECOND DELAYED motion detection.

Have not used it for 10 days straight yet because I used it for 12 hours and the battery ran out.I assumed it was user error because there is no way to tell if the battery is fully charged! I plan to charge it over night and try again...Also don't waste your money on a 32gb memory card because the camera over writes the old files anyways.A 8gb is enough to where the battery will run out (10 days on standby) before the card is full. (a 32gb card if the camera is always plugged in)According to the user manual, 7mb for a 30 sec video for 10 days will not exceed 8gb. At which point you will have to charge the camera anyways.Calls for a Micro SD card class 6 or higher so avoid the common class 4 cards that are always on sale...Only complaints: When the subject is close to the camera the IR lights over expose them, the detection is on average 2-4 seconds before recording starts, the IR light and blinking light on the front are obvious in the dark.Quick fix: put the camera further away or higher up, aim the camera in advance of where the subject will be so the camera sensor can detect them and by the time recording starts they will be entering the frame, obvious lights: black marker on the IR lights and some electrical tape over the blinking light.UPDATE 4/25/2012: The battery lasts about 8-10 days after a full charge.

Upon opening it I found the packaging to look like the cheesy China stuff you see in the dollar store...Packaging says 2-32GB TF cards..IM not sure what that means No card is included nor were there options for the color bases it shows.There is no wall mount that comes with it as advertised on their site...I only saw a slot for one micro SD Card ( must be ordered separately) Inside the highest quality item is the rubber stand that holds the cam. The cord, power pack, battery and cam itself are cheaply made for $135.00. I can't speak for the battery life this early in the game since we just purchased it.The directions are a nightmare.

So id say it doesn't work with macs...I did read where one buyer was able to email SpygearGadgets and get them to send him a file via email ..I can only get a answering machine that says to leave a message. Technical support seems unfounded let alone lifetime service ..I really have to question the value of the 1 year manufacturer warranty. However, I will hold Amazon to it ...Spygeargadgets web site says their products are made in USA of highest quality ...This was not made in the USA nor was it packaged in the USA ...Re Instruction Manuals:Page 2 of guide talks about upgrading software on DVR ...They ask you to put in cd and click on config.exe and copy this supposed file to your micro card root directory ?? Root directory is what?Im not sure who wrote the \"USER GUIDE\" but it too looks like someone not fluent in english tried to convert another language to tell us how to set this thing up..Heres an example..\"Note: The exact instructing, Please as CD-software manual\" What does that mean?  or how about this \"Exception Clause: We don't guarantee for the document veracity, reliability or any content except regulate in proper laws. Including no guarantee for product suitable market or  suitable area promise\" Meaning what ?One of the two files on mini cd is a 3 page \"Software Manual\" now this is different from USER Manual that comes in the box. Very confusing directions to add to confusion of the other manual ...Again if you can understand what the person is trying to tell you ...I couldn't.I spent 3 hrs trying to figure this out ..finally searched net and read someone else's directions on how to set this thing up...how to set the date and time, how to set up files and how to view them etc..As for the quality of the video ..for darkness at night video seems to be pretty good and sound is good..once you get it working ...It takes a least 5 seconds from first movement to actually come on and about the same when movement has stopped to stop. It is motion activated Sound alone will not activate it ...Many so-called 'spy shops' sell bargain rate hidden cameras and low-tech surveillance gadgets; toys that are as useless as they are cheap. But if you have a serious predicament, you need professional-level, high quality equipment and a support staff with trained expertise.On their Web Site they state....which I seriously beg to differ on ....\"At Spy Tec, we pride ourselves on stocking only the highest quality, state-of-the-art spy and surveillance equipment such as Hidden Cameras, GPS tracking Devices, Nanny Cameras, Spy Accessories,  Bug Detection Devices and much, much more.Whether you are in the corporate world, a small business owner or a concerned parent, Spy Tec's discreet and knowledgeable staff of security experts will provide professional advice.\"In summation I'm truly amazed that any seller especially AMAZON would sell such poor quality device with such poorly written instructions that aren't even in proper English.For $135.00 I expected a lot more ...Most likely will return product and look at higher end products and spend $300-$400 to get something that doesn't seem like a cheap plastic toy from the dollar store.I would encourage AMAZON to take a serious look at this product and its instructions and discontinue selling this over priced poor quality CHINA junk that tarnishes their reputation.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Cam for the money!!", "Author": "Simon Mall \"Will Salem\"", "ReviewID": "RX8XICDSAOC82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT spy cam for the money.

I mounted the camera on my regular cameratripod (the cats thought it was a toy when it was just standing on the ground,) turned it on, and let it run.In 18 hours it had stopped filming, but there were a heck of a lot of 30-second videos of my cats being cats,so perhaps I hadn't charged the battery fully, or the SD card was full. I plugged the camera into my computer and used Windows Media Player to run throughall the videos. The video and sound quality were better than I had expected. The camera had good focus from 10 feet away up toabout one foot from the lens, and the details were clear enough to be able to tell all the cats apart, even in the night shots.The motion detection had no problem picking up even our little six-pound cat.I'm very happy that I bought this camera.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality but not perfect", "Author": "Hicoteo", "ReviewID": "R32AQ79PCRZXUP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very good quality product.

Unlike other cameras that seem to turn on for nothing.The night vision doesn't work at all. The manufacturer would be wise to make a new, and cheaper model, without it. Also, it does not last 10 days on standby. When the battery is fully charged you are lucky to get 7 days out of it.

Then, I soldered a larger battery, with the same voltage, to the wires and glued it to the back of the camera. Now the camera lasts more then 10 days on a single charge!

I read a lot of reviews about a lot of cameras available on Amazon, & I eventually got this one based on my needs & the various reviews. I am pleased with it. Be aware that you need to also purchase a microSD card for this camera (with adapter). The Amazon site says you need a minimum class 4, but the product camera booklet says class 6. However, I did get a 32GB class 4 and it works fine for me.I relied heavily on other reviews to get the setup right. It's a little confusing but not overly complicated. It's just that I had to bypass the way the included instructions say to do the setup, as have some other customers and the directions for doing that aren't included with the camera. I was able to get this working relatively quickly considering the problems I had. It took following the troubleshooting advice of 2-3 others who were kind enough to share in their product reviews with instructional fixes. I'll try to summarize here.My advice is to first try following the included directions. If it doesn't work as instructed, follow my procedure (& check for other helpful reviews if you're still stuck). I suspect that following the stock instructions would go smooth for someone working with an older version of Windows. I have an older computer, but really wanted to use my new one so...I persevered & got it working just fine. Please don't be discouraged if you like this camera. I'll explain how I did it so hopefully this helps you. The camera, cord & desk stand are good quality.Problems I encountered: #1 Getting the microSD card into the camera's slot. It took some finesse to line up the tiny card & then to push it in just right so you feel & hear the spring-loaded lock \"click\" in place. It got stuck a few times w/o me hearing the \"click\" & I didn't want to take a chance that it wasn't lined up right so I used a small pocket knife & firmly but gently pulled out the mini card, then lined it up more carefully next time. It takes a bit of patience & either strong finger nails (I don't have) or something like a metal dog tag edge or the dull edge of a small pocket knife to push it in & sometimes to pop it out. It was tricky at first but with just a little practice it became much easier & now it's no big deal.#2 Camera set-up: Transfering the config.exe file to the camera & time/date set-up: (Note: The user manual procedures for initial camera set-up are explained AFTER things like camera operation & viewing recorded videos, so you'll be jumping around a bit). Try following the included directions. If that method fails, try this: I couldn't get my computer to read the camera's USB cord as a storage drive, so I had to bypass that set-up method. I took the microSD card out of the camera and (w/ adapter) put it directly into my computer's SD slot. From there, I was able to see the video camera's (empty) storage card. First, you need to copy the config.exe file from the included CD to the camera's memory card (just copy & paste). Now, open the camera's memory card & double-click to run the config.exe file. You should see the screen that lets you choose recording options & time/date. If you're able to enter the time/date here then do so. For some reason, in order to get the time/date set, I then had to take another step (as instructed in another review) I opened Windows Notepad and typed (& saved) a file that set the Time/Date (using the format described in the instructions that came with the camera) then I cut/pasted the Notepad Time/Date file into the memory card for the camera. I returned the microSD card into the camera, then began the test videos.roblem #3: When I first tested it out, I thought it failed because I only video'd myself in front of the camera just once & immediately checked for the video file, but there were no video files. Then I read another review from someone who advised that the first video taken will not write to the camera until there's a second video, so I repeated the process, activating the camera filming for about 20-30 seconds then turning it away from me and so on, about 4 times and voila! It worked perfectly.I used this camera to catch my dog peeing on the carpet in the middle of the night to see her routine and make a plan to correct her behavior. It works well for that. It's not really a Spy camera because it not truly hidden & the IR LED's glow red in the dark so you can't stick it in a window (at night) to look out because of the LEDs reflection. It's good for daytime, or for monitoring your room if you have roommates, or your home if you have construction, sitters, etc...It could easily be somewhat disguised as a toy with some felt, craft supplies & ingenuity. It might not even be recognized as a camera to a novice theif, so I see value in this product. I will eventually be buying other types of cameras for live viewing and home security.I would take this camera on a vacation and leave it in the hotel room aimed at my valuables. I've had a maid at a 5-star hotel in Cabo San Lucas rip off a bunch of $20's from my dresser before, but couldn't prove it. Wish I had this then. The concierge actually spent the entire vacation telling me he'd get me the key to my safe \"in just a Mexican minute\" & chuckled (wonder what his cut was?). If I had video evidence, I'd have got it back. Also, I lived on Oahu for 3 years & know that if you're vacationing in Hawaii with a rental car, unfortunately the youthful &/or ice (meth) addicted locals do break into trunks frequently (even while parked in the hotel lot!) & I think tucking this camera in there w/ some velcro would work well.

This is by far one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Amazon and I am amazed that Amazon would soil its name with a product like this. If the product description simply read \"cheap lo-def motion sensor camera,\" it would basically be correct. Despite what the adverting says, this product is NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. Repeat: NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. The mini-cd that comes with this toy (and it is a TOY) cannot fit into most Mac slide-in disc drives. Also, even if you happen to have a mini-cd adaptor (or a DVD/CD reader that pops out to receive disks), once the program is uploaded into the camera, the programing software used to configure the settings cannot work on any Mac OS. So, \"mac-compatable\" is a complete lie in the advertising. As for the quality of picture this toy captures, everything looks like sepia-toned Bigfoot footage. Good luck getting any face, license plate, or useful physical features with this product. Other problems: The camera is COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE THROUGH WINDOWS no matter how clean the window is. So, if you're trying to capture something outside your home, you'd literally have to place the camera outside, where it could be easily discovered thus defeating the whole purpose capturing someone's activity unaware. And why would someone find the camera? Because, the camera CANNOT BE HIDDEN!  When the red night-vision lights activate, they can be seen from as far as 150 feet (So again, false advertising for this being a \"spy\" or \"hidden\" camera. Isn't this much false advertising illegal?). And what do you get with this incredible night-vision technology? NIGHT-VISION THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS FROM A CAMERA MADE INTHE 80s--grainy, unfocused, blurry. And the AUDIO SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT CHARACTER IN A PEANUTS CARTOON--words indistinguishable and incomprehensible. THERE IS NO 16-PAGE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. Yet another lie! There is one (1) sheet of instructions coming with the camera (as well as a completely useless pdf on the mini-cd--a whole three pages of 24 font size text)  full of pigeon English and confusing instruction. This product is obviously FOREIGN MADE AND PACKAGED.  The package itself is completely different from the one shown on Amazon. Also, THERE IS NO LIFETIME 1800 TECH SUPPORT. Yet another 'nother lie! There's no number or address anywhere on the product for customer support, and NO WARRANTY INFO OR CERTIFICATE. And, finally, the price. Are you kidding me? For nearly $120, I expected a top-quality product that at least delivered what it promised in the product description. In reality, this camera is worth about $29.99 and should be sold and described as such. Great for kids who like gadget toys, but useless for any type of serious surveillance. DO NOT BUY!WARNING!
