I didn't mind the installation of these cameras which included drilling holes in walls, putting wire molding over the wires and getting all the extra accessories you need to make the system function, i.e. 50ft ethernet cable, 1TB hard drive, etc. When I finally turned the system on it went into a rebooting cycle. It continued this cycle indefinitely every three minutes until I finally shut it off. I contacted tech support and eventually got a new DVR since the old one was tested and confirmed defective. The new one did the same thing. I tried switching the hard drive, swapping the ethernet cable, playing around with the settings but nothing worked. Altogether I dedicated 40 hours to getting it to work and it was all a waste of time and money. Don't buy this garbage. The vga camera quality was horrible too and you have to work in IT to be able to setup the network capabilities.. but then again, what do you expect to get for a $100 surveillance system?", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent system for the money", "Author": "Kakashi", "ReviewID": "R24HDYBJV1FQXC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this system for installation around the house all outdoors. It works nicely. The previous 1 star rating was given to this system because it was defective - well electronics are sometimes defective - so...Anyway, the Night vision works well for me. Due to the location of cameras, I have pretty much entire lot covered including the drive way, front lawn, backyard, and the small space behind the house. The iPhone app works acceptably well.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Warranty\nZmodo PKD-DK40107\nZmodo PKD-DK40107 4Channel DVR 480TVL 6mm Weatherproof Camera Surveillance Kit **NO HDD**", "Name": "PKD-DK40107 4 Channel CCTV Security DVR Day Night Weatherproof Camera System - No HDD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51e0PomaydL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007RV6BNK"}}
