{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This camera changed my mind......", "Author": "LoJack", "ReviewID": "R1DB6WJV1Y2Q09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About 420TVL CCTV cams.  First off, let me say that I read all the reviews on this camera.  Twice.  I could not believe the positive glowing things being said, since this is only a 420TVL cam.  I usually turn my nose up at anything below 540TVL's.  But since I was getting one more cam for the inside of my garage, I surmised that I could bump my high requirements down.  I own 10 cameras (I have a 8 channel DVR, and a 4 channel DVR---watch out! once you get into installing CCTV cams around your house, you just might get bit by the \"bug\"....Camera Acquisition Syndrome!!) LOL!!  I also installed my entire system.  I really enjoy educating myself on the details of this.  Since I am retired (ex-NASA employee) I have plenty of time to putter around.  But, back to my review...the camera arrived in just a few days.  I unboxed it and first thought...what a small camera!  And I really didn't think that 26 IR led's would suffice to even see anything in a dark garage!  ( I have installed motion lights in my garage to cut down on the electric bills. I've got them set to five minutes of inactivity.  There are always those family members who 'forget\" to turn off the lights after exiting the garage.  Anyways, I got the camera mounted, went to my DVR room in the house, and plugged in the included 12volt adapter.  (By the way...this is a 'switching\" 12Volt 500ma adapter, so they ship a qualilty ac adapter.  ALL of my cameras have the regulated switching adapters plugged into an uninterruptible supply.  Yes, I am kind of anal.  haha.) As soon as I inserted the adapter's plug into the camera cable...WOW!  This camera seems to be sharper than my Sony 540TVL Super HAD camera!!  Yes, the reviews are true!  These are not fake reviews!  This camera is razor sharp.  I don't know how 420TVL can produce such a wonderful image.  very, very detailed.  I am running this through an Insignia LED/LCD TV (\"hybrid\").  It is a 32\" TV.  And the night vision is remarkable.  Extremely clear and sharp.As a final write up, I have always made it a point to refuse to buy the 1/4\" CCD chip.  I always went for the 1/3\".  Nowhere in the listed \"specs.\" on  this camera does it say that it is 1/4\" ccd.  So, I just \"assumed\" it was.  When I opened the box and read the sheet, there it was-- 1/4\" ccd.  I felt that I had made a big mistake.  Well, after seeing what this camera produces, I have also changed my mind on the 1/4\" ccd.  By the way, this camera is IP55 rated.  Just for those who want to know.  Here is what IP55 means, for those who really want to know:\"Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented, but it must not enter in sufficient quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipment; complete protection against contact.Water projected by a nozzle (6.3mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects.\"  Wikipedia.So, it seems like it's good enough for my application.  But my other cameras are at least IP65 rated. However, they are outside, not in a garage. The first IP rating digit (5 in this case)  is for dust, the second (also 5) is for water.I am extremely happy with this camera and might even order another to put under the tree.  For myself! LOL.  BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION TO FIGHT CRIME.  You will see how the UPS guy really delivers all your packages.  haha. WORTH EVERY PENNY.  Free shipping sealed the deal.The only that I don't like is the color.  White.  But, that's just nitpicking.  I can easily remedy that with a spray paint job.

There are so many criminals on our block,it's astounding! After the crazy cat hoarder next door continually vandalized our property we bought this and it works great! We've had one inside for about six months and recently installed one outside, each facing different directions. The night vision is clear and everything records nicely. The range of this camera is spectacular, about four houses in each direction per camera. Aside from knowing when people are messing with our property, we find it somewhat amusing to watch the drug dealer across the street as a never-ending stream of cars make quick stops.

I was in search of a replacement/supplemental camera for my Q-See system. I had installed my Q-See cameras and while I was happy with the coverage for the areas that allowed for the cameras to get a \"long\" shot, the performance of the Q-See cameras for tighter distances is poor. No wonder, they are 4.8mm cameras with a much limited field of view. The images produced by the Q-See cameras and their Sony CCD are nice and the night vision is good but having installed one of these VideoSecu cameras, I'm ordering another one. The daytime image quality is very close to on par with the Q-See camera with perhaps just a little less sharpness but we're not talking about HDTV here so I'm fine with it. The night vision is as good as the Q-See. (EDIT: After a couple more nights with the VideoSecu side by side with Q-Sees, I have to give the edge to Q-See in the night vision department. There seems to be a little bit of a bluish interference with the VideoSecus. The Q-Sees seem clearer at night. The night vision range is about the same. I'm still happy though. Price versus overall performance is still good.)There seemed to be several excellent VideoSecu cameras here on Amazon but none of them offered the mounting option this one does. I have done an under-eave mounting with my cameras and these mounted are very accommodating. They mounts have quite a range of motion and can be mounted under or behind the camera. The range of motion blows away the Q-See mounts too.The main reason I bought this camera is the 3.6mm lens. It was a good choice. The field of view is significantly better than with the Q-See's 4.8mm. I have posted a couple of cellphone camera snaps of my security monitor showing a before and after of the same location where the camera was mounted in the same spot at about 20 feet up. If you need a wider field of view, these cameras are great and the price makes it a steal. (EDIT: Added two more comparison photos after buying another one of these cameras. I am even more pleased with my purchases!)Note about Warehouse Seller: They were fantastic! I have bought cables and this camera from them and they were extremely fast. My orders were processed within hours and to my door in under 3 days. (EDIT: Second camera I bought was shipped and received almost as fast. I'm still happy.)", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "works great, like viewing angle", "Author": "Barry Alan Porterfield", "ReviewID": "R1GXRMPP5SUHJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to add to my camera setup.

Not everyone can afford to shell out a lot of money just to put in a home security system. I purchased two of these VideoSecu IR24S cameras to monitor our driveway after a robbery and I have now had them installed outdoors for about 3 weeks with no issues even through the recent frozen December frost (currently about 25 degrees F at night). I love being able to just glance up at my monitor now 24/7 when I hear something outside rather than running to turn on the porch light and then to a window to see what's going on out there.The video clarity on these VideoSecu IR24S cameras is great for a 420 TVL CCD camera - night or day. I bought two of these cameras to replace the two cameras I had purchased at Harbor Freight made by Bunker Hill Security which were also about $35 each. The video is much more clear than the Harbor Freight cameras and the IR light at night is also much brighter. The night view on the Harbor Freight cameras was basically worthless but these cameras by VideoSecu have a much better picture. I can actually see inside the cab of my car and truck at night if they are parked facing the cameras. It was well worth returning the Harbor Freight cameras after waiting a few days for the VideoSecu cameras to arrive using the free super saver shipping method.I combined two of these cameras with an old outdated computer I had just laying around and two PCI style analog video capture cards I bought off of Amazon and Ebay for about $15 each  to create a very cheap but adequate home security system. My budget to do the whole system including 2 cameras, 2 cables, and 2 video cards was about $120.I currently have two of these VideoSecu IR24S cameras connected to my old Pentium 4 / Windows XP PC tower equipped with the two Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150 (Internal PCI style) video capture cards for video input along with the Blue IRIS security software made by Perspective for motion detection video recording.I paid about $70 for the 2 cameras together and they came with the correct working power supplies.I paid about $18 more for the two 50' power/video cables together (also offered through VideoSecu) that you WILL need to mount this camera anywhere outside.I paid about $30 for the 2 Hauppauge PVR-150  video tuners together (used).PROS:Great picture quality for a $35 analog video style security camera with just 420 TVL.Bright IR lights for night vision mode with just the built-in 24 IR LEDs.Automatically switched to the night vision mode when needed without a dark window in between.Comes with a the power supply and a warning sticker :-).Very easy to mount and install using supplied hardware.CONS:The included mounting bracket is a little lightweight and would not stand up to very much abuse.Did not include the required video cabling needed to install this camera outside.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Infrared failure", "Author": "Lynn Arceneaux", "ReviewID": "R1SBPDESP9M3NF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in October 2011 and the infrared system went out in the middle of January 2012.

You won't be able to read license plates or any of that stuff but it'll let you know what's going on.Like I said, it's a good little camera but there are some annoying flaws. First, the mount is made from really cheap steel. If you mount it outdoors near any kind of wind, you'll need to reinforce the mount because it keeps coming loose and starts flopping around. I just used a couple small pieces of duct tape and it works great. The other flaw is also for outdoor use. When the IR lights turn on, if there is any dust in the wind, the reflections on the dust particles will make it look like it's snowing outside. It doesn't really detract from the picture quality, after awhile it's even kind of soothing but just so you know.Bottom line, not bad at all. I'm buying 2 more.

The main thing that it has going for it is its small size, it really is a nice little package.  The mount is among my favorites as far as flexibility and ruggedness, although it does require a metric allen wrench (not included) to adjust it.This camera unfortunately had a few negatives, performance-wise.  The picture was \"noisier\" than others I have tried, both in daytime and in nightvision, although the nightvision is plenty bright.  Also, this camera exhibited a dark horizontal bar that slowly scrolled up the screen in night vision mode.  This usually indicates some source of 60Hz interference, although none of the other cameras in my system did this, even when I swapped them into this one's place as a test.  So there seems to be some susceptibility to 60Hz.This is also not a wide-angle camera, so consider that in your application.This camera does not compare favorably to another camera that I got for the same price, the VideSecu IR30A: VideoSecu Outdoor Infrared Day Night Vision Home Security Camera Weatherproof 1/3\" SONY Super HAD CCD 3.6mm Wide View Angle Lens 420TV Lines 30 IR LEDs A12  I really like that camera.Edited to add:For all of the people complaining about me comparing differently-priced cameras, GO BACK AND READ MY ORIGINAL REVIEW (above).

I have this set up on a rear patio and a more expensive Sony CCD model in front. The difference in images between the two is stunning.Resolution on both is so-so, but the area where this VideoSecu really falls down is in contrast, shadow detail, and dynamic range. The image is COMPLETELY lacking in any shadow detail and looks like it has about 3 stops of dynamic range, worse than the camera on a 1st generation iPhone. If you have a scene where there is a sunlit ground area in part of the image, and shaded areas in the rest, the camera will expose to not blow out the brightest area and completely kill any detail in the shaded area, making it appear way too dark.Looking at the same lit scene with the Sony CCD cam (forget the model, it was about $75 from Amazon), the dynamic range is MUCH greater with much more gradation visible from light to dark.I am very much wishing I'd spent another $50 or so to get a good camera for my back patio, as now that this one is installed it's a pain to take it out and reinstall a new one. Not sure if I will be keeping it or not. Well, for 30 bucks or so, nobody should expect too much!UPDATE - I just saw this camera's night vision performance and upgraded the rating from 2 to 3 stars.

Tested it out by hooking it up to my older SD tv with a BNC to RCA adapter that came with the 100 foot cable I bought, picture was just as clear as broadcast TV back in the old days before HD.  Color was pretty true, night vision was excellent.  In pitch dark in my basement I was clearly able to see myself on the TV.  Only thing to note that the IR's glow slightly red when looking straight at them, so people will know there is a camera there.  Can't really see the IR's unless you are directly in front of the camera though.As for installation, what a breeze.  Drilled a 1 inch hole in my fascia (I had removed the soffit and ran the wire along inside the soffit) took the base/bracket off, screwed it in place with three screws, put the wires through the hole, screwed the camera back into the base/bracket and adjusted the aiming of the camera.  Plugged it into my old Geovision 650 DVR pc and instant camera.  Didn't even need any kind of software color/brightness correction.The wire on the camera is very sturdy, not cheap and flimsy like the videosecu 50 foot cables I bought(which did work rather well, and came with two BNC to RCA adapters by the way).  The camera housing is all metal, and the wires are in the housing.  I'm sure a well swung baseball bat would break it, but the houseing is at least all metal.  In case you need to, you can also pull the wire out through a slot in the base if the wire isn't going to go through the wall.Overall, a great investment for 35$  Would buy again!", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wide Angle & Very Clear", "Author": "penkyle", "ReviewID": "R2G1FV3QMPERC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have upgraded our system with these cameras.

There are three threaded holes on the camera and the base can be screwed into any of them.  One is on top, one is on bottom and the other is on the back.  The cabling does not pass through the base.  The sun shield fits snugly onto the camera body, which is good.  The camera has a real power connector rather than bare wire connectors.I was impressed by the day-time quality of the camera.  It was as good as a $200 camera I bought from another place.  The 3.6mm viewing angle was adequate for covering my 3-lane driveway.  The colors were accurate and the image was crisp.  However, the thing falls on its face when it comes to night vision.  I found the IR to be a little weak.  My biggest complaint is that there is so much noise in the night time image that my Zoneminder system detected motion almost constantly after dark.

Truth is, I am delighted with this camera from VideoSecu, and have purchased several similar cameras from the site over a period of time. I am most impressed with 1) the quality of the image, and 2) their ability to withstand harsh outdoor weather conditions. These are mounted in various points, only a couple of which have any kind of wind break or semblance of protection (i.e., one is mounted beneath the overhang of the main barn and one beneath the overhang in front of the house). Otherwise, they are in the \"wide open\"---extreme heat, wind, rain, snow, sleet---they have handled them all.

I am still very satisfied with it though as in the setting I have this camera mounted even though the Ir kicks on the image is still in color.  it will only go black and white when it is total darkness.  I really like that it does that.  my other cameras kick into black and white as soon as the ir come on.

This camera replaced a TrendNet IP camera, and I was impressed with this camera's much wider field of view. I guess I've been spoiled by the image quality of IP cameras, because right away I noticed this camera's image had much lower resolution than the TrendNet it replaced - now I know that 420TVL isn't really all that great. The big trouble came when the camera switch to night-vision mode. The image was so grainy and noisy that I could barely make out anything at all in the picture, and the motion detection software couldn't \"see\" anything! I could see the cut filter was active, and the IR lights were on, but the image was totally useless. It may be that this particular camera is defective, but it seemed fully operational in all other aspects.I returned this camera and replaced it with the \"eSecure ES183270 Security Camera\" (ASIN: B0089GC0YQ) which performs **much** better than the VideoSecu camera. The eSecure has the same wide-angle view as this camera, but has much better resolution, and the night vision works great - I can see small objects at over 50ft away.Many other reviewers indicated they purchased these to replace cameras in their existing \"package\" systems and found it to be of much better quality - I'm assuming the cameras that come with those systems must be **really** bad in order for this camera to garner such positive reviews. I've been using and tweaking my home brew Zoneminder system for several years, and with the addition of the video encoder have been experimenting with non-IP based cameras for the last few months. Although the wide angle view on this camera is great, the resolution and night vision were worse than anything I've used up to this point.

I figured that in the very least, it would help the police investigate any break-in and might help to get my stuff back.  The cameras that came with that system were very basic CMOS units with small sensors and few TV lines.  The resolution was poor and the color was biased towards infrared, making images recorded in bright sunshine quite disturbing with the IR-forced color shift.  (I'm not a big fan of purple grass.)On occasion, I would refer back to the recordings to try and figure out when a package had been delivered or if I really put that garden tool in that strange place, and the system met my expectations.  Over time, however, I came to realize that the resolution was so poor that any recording would probably not be of significant use to the police after a break-in.  I did my research on upgrading and determined that I needed a camera with a larger sensor and that the sensor needed to be CCD-based.  Armed with that info, I began to search for cameras that I could afford.This camera really fit the bill.  It's not as good as those that I used when I worked in public safety, but these cost thousands of dollars less and offer most of that performance.  The color is good during the day and the resolution in the dark under IR lighting is also very good.  The larger sensor of this camera yields more TV lines, which brings greater resolution along for the ride, and the wider field of view actually allows me to overlap some of my camera zones, something that I hadn't even thought possible.  Moreover, as my house is light colored with white trim, these cameras really blend in so that a casual observer will not notice, while reflecting light and heat off the camera instead of inviting it in as with a black-painted unit.  Less heat buildup inside the unit should offer a greater chance of the unit holding up over time.  Likewise, the metal frame and base should hold up over time much better than plastic-framed or plastic-mounted units as metal is not subject to photochemical reactions that change its basic compound or make it brittle.Overall, I am truly happy with this camera and ended up replacing all of my outdoor cameras with this model.  The little extras that this camera came with including a power supply and a window sticker make it suitable for a first-time install as well as for an upgrade, and with this camera priced as low as some decoy units by other sellers, you know the price is good.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "For $30....it's good", "Author": "D.

I connected it to a Toshiba 19\" widescreen LED TV, via my VHS recorder.  So from the camera, to the recorder, to the LED TV.  I used the best possible cables I have, they had gold connectors, and they are not Radio Shack specials, they are really high quality cables.  So really the signal from the camera was fairly good, without the cables reducing the image quality much.I mounted it outside under the roof eves to a center patch of trees and shrubs we have.  I wanted to see what was messing up our center planted area every other day. Was it an animal or person, something was doing it.  So I pointed the camera there and after 2 days, I finally got my answer.  It was a little black bird with a yellow beak. I was stunned, I thought it was maybe a stray dog, or maybe a cat, or a squirrel, it was this little bird, he was looking for worms.  I would record from 3am till about 8am, he actually came between 6:45 - 8am.  I could not believe it.Anyway, back to the camera, the performance of the camera is really awesome in daylight.  When it transitions from night to day, the image really comes alive.  During the night the infrared leds on the camera illuminate the view, but the image is mostly black and white, you really have to spend time adjusting the contrast and brightness to get the clarity of the image.  Aside from the night image, it is very easy to connect and install.  The mounting hardware and power supply are all included.  It does use a BNC connector for the video, so you may need a converter to RCA to connect to a recorder or a monitor, unless those devices have a BNC.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Help with setup", "Author": "Bar \"SunInSanDiego\"", "ReviewID": "R14HYR3J4MHR9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This seems like a great camera but I need help.
