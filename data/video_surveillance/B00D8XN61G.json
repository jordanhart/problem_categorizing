Let me explain the trepidation, I wanted a wireless system to operate externally on my house but after reading many negative reports about the loss of signal due to building materials it has to travel through, I was lets say hesitant to click the 'confirm order button'. Now, I was fully aware that I need to install regular electrical outlets close to the camera locations, I did read somewhere that the plugs convert the power from AC to DC current so hard wiring the electrical cord was not an option you need a standard electrical outlet, easy enough but hard wiring the cameras back to the DVR was also not an option that's why I opted for the wireless cameras. Upon receiving the order I immediately got an electrical extension cord plugged in the camera and checked to see if I got a clear signal to the DVR at the furthest point away (about 65 feet) through stucco, wood framing with insulation, tile roof and wood flooring and even though the signal strength was 1 out of 4 bars, the picture was good and clear. Trepidation now replaced with elation, I installed all four cameras. Set up of the DVR was simple enough.The cameras do transmit on 2.4 GHz and did interfere with my WiFi BUT I have a Dual Band Router (I bought this about 2 years ago for about $100) and set everything else to 5.0 GHz, easy fix and all works well.Easy to get the app for my phone and Ipad, just inputted the required info and all works well.The system works as advertised for that I give it 5 stars, now let's see how well it stands up to the test of time.UPDATE....5-28-14.  Well, it's been 7 months since I did the install. One camera failed about 3 weeks ago (the one furthest away from the DVR) not sure of the reason but the power supply converter that you plug in to the wall outlet might have failed. I have sent the camera back to Lorex and have been told they will replace it free under warranty, we'll see...The only other thing is the software for my phone, at first it was OK but then became sporadic, so I tried 'Port Forwarding', difficult to achieve and didn't really solve the problem. Still working on that one.Outside of those 2 issues the system runs well, the other cameras still produce good quality pictures and survived a cold Colorado winter outside.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price...", "Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "R37AZ7BTZK0BT0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cameras work well. Very easy to set up. Software is very functional. Their support is VERY limited. If you have questions about things that are not in the manual (the manual I received didn't match the software) make sure you have PLENTY of time to sit on hold  before talking to a tech. The techs know 'the manual' but seem to have very little actual experience with the software. The only negative I have found is that you can't schedule email motion alerts. Once enabled, you receive alert emails even during work hours when you KNOW there's motion. You can schedule recording times. But not alert messages. I suggested to support they add this as an update suggestion.

The camera setup was pretty straightforward - the only hiccup was setting up a mobile user for use with the iPhone and iPad app. Apparently you can only have one mobile user and you configure this user separately to the other user accounts. Go figure. Lorex tech support were helpful (if a little abrupt) and I managed to get remote viewing access pretty quickly.I probably would have happily given this product more stars if not for two things - the cameras aren't really \"wireless\" as you still have the power cable running from the cameras. The bit that's wireless is the video communication back to the DVR. While that is still helpful and much cleaner, the issue is that Lorex don't sell extension cables for the power supply, so you're camera placement is limited to within 6ft of your power outlets which is not ideal for all rooms in my apartment. I've seen an extension cable that might work, but nobody has used it for the wireless cameras so I'm trying to get Lorex to confirm before I buy them.The second issue is the user interface on the DVR itself. It has a bunch of useful features (you can set it to record only if it detects motion, set up motion alarms, and you can even configure the space that it detects the motion in)  but all of these features are hidden behind the most unintuitive menu options. Even playback of video is camera by camera and a little painful. This is one of those devices where you HAVE to read the detailed user manual page by page, or call tech support to find out how to do the one thing you're trying to do.The cameras themselves are good (if larger than I expected), the video quality is also good (although it needs a fair amount or light before it will switch to colour), and I would bump the review up to 4 stars if I can get the power cable extension sorted.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy to set up", "Author": "cryscon5", "ReviewID": "R15EHVN2VZ854W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "however the camera's tend to loose signal, and go bonkers. still trying to fix one of them, another camera just keeps coming and going.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy set-up but wi-fi hog", "Author": "GlenO", "ReviewID": "R32IU3BF78I703", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:Set-up was easy.

Mcdole \"Steven\"", "ReviewID": "R279YOLD7C9DUI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It works, but it isn't perfect.  This is the cheapest wireless camera my family could find, and they didn't want to mess around running wires.  So it works.  However, here are some notes.Neutral:* You don't need this on your WiFi network to work.  It comes with a wireless transmitter/receiver per pair of cameras that hooks into the channel ports in place of the cable a regular camera would have used.* Decent quality.* About a week's worth of memory.* We have the highest quality DSL line in our rural area, and it caps out at 800 Kbps upload speed. Off the top of my head the manual stated a recommended upload speed of 1000 or 1100 Kbps if you want the mobile features.  Considering the network issues stated below we didn't even test this.Bad:* If you have a lower end, older single band wireless router kiss any Internet connectivity goodbye.  Thankfully the wireless range on these transmitters are iffy through solid walls so your neighbors will probably be fine, but we had to spend another $200+ upgrading out other computers and the Internet wireless network to work after installing this thing.* The menu system isn't the most inuitive unless you want to mess around with it for a bit.  It doesn't take long to figure out, but there are places where you would think you can move to the next section you have to hit menu (on most things cancel) to confirm your selection.* Occasionally the unit glitches out and you will have to power cycle (turn off and back on) to get the controls to work again.  The system still records while the controls are locked out.Personally, I'd give this system two stars.  It's a cheap for what it is.  My family who I set this up for would probably give it four stars complaining about range problems in their all brick home.  Older home so some of their internal walls even are brick inside of wood.

Incredible.  The image resolution is high quality.  The system can be configured with differing levels of motion sensitivity by camera to minimize false alarms. The system is far cheaper than hiring a security firm.  In a few months, you will have made your money back.One little complaint is that the mounting screws provided for the cameras are lousy. Made in China from cheap metal, which practically melt when tightened, making their removal really difficult.  It is worth taking a trip to the hardware store to buy some high quality ones for $2. It is a shame Lorex got cheap on something so inconsequential.Despite a few small details, we are overwhelmingly pleased with this system.

The cameras work well in daylight and at night. However, the one camera that monitors an area illuminated by a sodium street light never switches into night vision and subsequently is a bit darker than the others. The greatest negative surprise was the impact the wireless camera communications had on my home wireless internet environment. The cameras, even when event driven, just killed the home wireless response. I saw my normal 95 to 100 Mbps response times drop to 5 to 10 Mbps due to the conflicts with the camera traffic, in the same frequency range, and ended up locating the Lorex DVR and the internet router at opposite ends of the house and three floors apart. This is not conducive to using the Lorex to provide internet access as it would need wired internet access through the router.  I even attempted to limit the impact by selecting and locking each individual channel within the wireless frequency range on my internet router to no avail.

Like my title says, I really didn't like this system after opening the box, but now I like it better.  I haven't figured out all features yet, but I am learning something new every day about the system.  So far, I have 1 camera setup with remote viewing.  I am in the process of installing the last 3 cameras.Installation:The actual installation is pretty easy.  It took close to 15 minutes to have atleast 1 camera up and running.  It comes with 4 cameras, 4 wireless receivers, 1 DVR, Ethernet cable, HDMI cable, a remote and a mouse.  For the most part, everything is plug and play. I would highly suggest plugging in a mouse to maneuver through the interface if you decide to connect to a computer monitor or TV.Video Quality.So far, the quality isn't bad.  It seems fairly average and gets the job down. I would need to do more testing to really test the quality.  I don't believe the camera has audio although.  I haven't performed a test to see if audio is included.  My first cam is on the opposite side of the house and I have received 2 bars which isn't bad at all.  For me, reception isn't a problem as the wireless receiver is extremely powerful.Remote ViewingI bought this system with the idea of remote viewing my home when away either from business or vacation.  IMO, the remote viewer when working is exactly what I expected. I can view live video or prerecorded video.  It took me a while setting up remote viewing as the directions were not clear.  Remote viewing requires a Lorex DDNS account on their website which took me a while to create.  See below for other issues.Cons:This system isn't perfect and includes some cons.  The biggest issue I had is with wifi interference/jamming and remote desktop setup.  This system uses similar technology to baby monitors (FHSS) which are known to cause interference.  It is almost impossible to not have some sort of interference with wifi.  Depending on where you place your receiver it can cause up to 90% drop in internet speed.  I have had speeds as low as .5 mbps and speeds as high as 12 mbps (max paid for).  There are a few workaround though.  I have noticed that the wireless receivers (not camera) are extremely powerful and can overpower your wifi router.  One solution is to move your wireless receiver atleast 3 feet away from your wireless router and wireless device.  Another solution is to weaken your receiver by placing aluminum foil on the antenna.  Last, you can use a dual band 5ghz router for your internet. I have also found changing your wifi router channel to either 1 or 11 will lessen interference due frequency hopping. The remote viewing works well once you get it to work. To me it was difficult to setup.  First of all, remote viewing requires you to connect your DVR to your router via a ethernet cable.  First, you will need to forward your ports (default 80).  Second you will need to create a Lorex DDNS account that is free.  Last you will have to register your device and start the warranty.  It took me a few tries to finally get it working.In conclusion, this is a pretty decent system for the price.  I recommend as a product to use if you want a basic wireless system with remote viewing and email alerts and do not mind occasional drops in internet speed with a workaround.I decided to rate this a 4 although a 3.5 is closer to how I currently feel about this product.

He wanted wireless cameras for easier installation.Setup is rather simple.  I was a bit surprised that the Lorex comes with its own two wireless bridges/routers, connecting two cameras each.  This means you don't control the connection.  I also don't like that you can't turn off the infrared night vision, which can hinder usage through windows.  (Though these are intended as outdoor cameras.)  Resolution is good.  Global access is very convenient.HINT: LorexDDNS.net, which allows you to connect to your camera DVR over the Web from anywhere in the world, probably won't work inside your own LAN network and/or behind your home router.  Use a VPN service, another location, or an LTE connection to test it.As for wireless hurdles, the reviews are correct -- initially, it absolutely strangled my household wireless network.  Since it uses its own routers, this is interference, not bandwidth usage.  You also can't manage or QoS-limit the traffic like you would a game or HD media stream or other wireless application.  However, I solved this considerable problem by adjusting my wireless architecture as follows:My equipment is a Netgear WNDR4000 Dual Band Wireless Router.  Before, I was using it as a wireless bridge/repeater to my base wired router (same model).  Instead I attached it directly to the network via wired switch and set it up as an access point.  I think the key here is the 4000's dual-band capability.  I set up both bands as NG-Mixed.  Since Lorex said their wireless uses 802.11G channel 14, I set the first band on Channel 1 20 MHz channel width, and band two on Auto with Auto channel width.  Both are set up as Bridged.  Apparently this lets all our devices connect fine with Wireless N.  I have plenty of wireless experience, but would not consider myself a networking genius.  However, I do know that setting up N-Only on 5GhZ (my first instinctive solution) did not work, because nothing would connect.

Maybe I got a bad package, but it's going back and getting replaced by something else.These wireless cameras can be set inside a house or outside.  They are good at seeing in the dark, but they also need to be pretty close to their transmitter. Just 1-2 drywall walls, and they don't operate.I installed it and went overseas.  I saw 2 of the 4 cameras for one day, then they disappeared forever.  When I got back, I found that their wireless transmitter had conked out.  The other two performed as expected.  But also the hard drive did not record anything.  On return, I banged it and it started, but despite 2 hours with technical support, I could not get it to record.  The support folks said to just return the order.At any rate, the system was erratic.  Sometimes it said 'failed', and I did not know if power or the internet were out.  But normally the house does not have so many disruptions.By comparison, I have two lorex ip cameras in an apartment, and they perform admirably.  The 32 gig microSD records, they send messages if someone opens the door.

Yes if you have over an hour to wait on the phone to then be rushed through your questions and then before you know it you are off the phone and WAIT!! IT STILL DOES'NT WORK WELL! Then this may be the product for you. Our system played back a full five seconds slower than real time. The clock on the camera counted it off so we could easily see it. The tech support said there was no way to speed it up. I am sorry but I don't want to spend more than real time trying to watch what is going on.  We even put it on motion only and that was still impossibly slow to get through.  We are not stupid people, but it seemed the set up, the running of, and the entire system is just poor. If they would just pay someone to take the time to make a really detailed how to manual, much better than the one that comes with it on the disc maybe the support lines wouldn't be covered up.  Still that would not make the actual product better.  Yes the pictures are extremely clear that is where the two stars come from.  We were able to see well.  But there was a time that we knew my husband was in the line of sight of the camera and he did not even show up on the recording.  What else is the thing going to miss? A robbery??

I read several reviews about the company and the product, so I decided to try it. Amazon had the best price, and being a customer for years and knowing their customer service is excellent,  I purchased it from them. Setup takes about 20 minutes with easy to install software. The camera resolution is excellent, and the  best part is the excellent resolution at night! The manufacturer's specs are truthful here. I live on a dark wooded lot, and after looking at the images at nightfall I was truely amazed. The DVR unit has many advanced recording features, many of which I probable will never use. The wireless signal is excellent, and requires no setup out the box other than plugging the receivers into the DVR unit.There are a few minor drawbacks, such as the power adapter (AC to DC) cords to the camera being only 6 feet.  But for outdoor installation you can use a standard outdoor rated extension cord and enclose it in inexpensive conduit. I called Lorex and they stated you can buy an extension for the power adapter in Radio Shack or any online electronic supplier.The only other minor drawback I found is that the web browser only works in Internet Explorer, not in Chrome or Firefox. It does work in Safari, though.  Being a linux user, I am not fond of Internet Explorer or Windows, but another option for remote viewing is that it does come with a software client for pc and mac which you can use in place of a web browser.You cannot beat this product for the quality and price, and ease of setup.

I don't think the wireless was the right decision but I was smart enough to buy the unit with 8 ports with the 4 wireless cameras so I can buy wired cameras when I need to.Here are my experiences.First the negatives.  The wireless cameras allowed me to find the best location for each camera, but as I read in another review you still have to run a cable for power to the camera so it may be just as easy to run the cable to a wired device.  The length of cables supplied is disappointing at the very least, the cable from the DVR to the wireless receiiver is so short it's useless ( I haven't yet asked Lorex it they supply an extension) but if I coud install the wireless receivers the other side of my outside wall I could get maximum connectivity and a clear view of the cameras.  The HDMI cable has the same shortcoming, it's too short.  I bought a much longer HDMI cable which suits the needs.  The zoom on the DVR is dissapointing it switches from far away to a little bit closer but doesn't zoom as I understand the definition of Zoom, to go real close.Here are the postiivesI am impressed with the night vision.  I can clearly see the gate at the end of my property about 200 ft away and any activity at the gate, in total darkness we have no street lighting and no lights on the property.
