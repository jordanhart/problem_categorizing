image quality and night vision.Mounted it under an outdoor soffit, above the garage door, tucked in behind a downspout. Used a 1\" hole saw to pass the connectors through and powered it with a D-Link POE: D-Link DWL-P200 Power Over Ethernet AdapterAmazingly, the image maintains brightness, color and clarity when it's almost dark. Switches to b/w infrared beyond that.Works well with Foscam Blue Iris Professional for your PC and the Android or iOS version of IP Cam Viewer Full enabling you to watch feeds from your tablet while you adjust the cameras.If you get the Android app from Amazon, it's available to all of your Android devices without having to pay each time, so we have it on the Kindle Fire, the Samsung Galaxy Tab and our HTC smartphones. With the $4 IP Camera Viewer, you can watch your feeds from anywhere there's internet.This video was captured by Dahua's Pro Surveillance System, which usually comes with the included CD. If not, it's also a free download from the MarsCCTV site.So far, Blue Iris Pro seems to have an easier time sensing motion and recording feeds in a more useful format.Update: We now have 16 of these Dahuas powered by four TP-LINK TL-SF1008P at three homes and a shop, all monitored by Blue Iris Pro. Four of these are also recorded by a 16-channel Dahua NVR: Dahua 16 Channel Vertical NVR It's like a tiny computer with two removable hard drive bays on the front. Add one or two 3TB hard drives, like WD Red 3TB - WD30EFRX and you'll have more than enough to watch your house while you're on vacation.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ease of use", "Author": "MTEK", "ReviewID": "R33JEQJN0XX0N2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Folks!!! for the price its a nice camera for your around the home use. All you need is a POE switch and to run a CAT5/CAT6 network cable to the location. Its very easy to setup, and the clarity is great, especially during the day. Night vision... its a bit choppy in low to dark areas. You can play with the video settings to fine tune it (left mine at default). Configured it to record to my NAS... if you already have one, does not require you to purchase a NDVR.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good wide angle HD dome IP camera", "Author": "Bill A \"Angus\"", "ReviewID": "R39Z06MZ4ILOE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1st up this is a do-it-yourself IP dome camera and is intended to be part of a system of products (DVR or NVR, router, monitoring software, etc). For information on the other parts of the system see my other product reviews - Q-See QCN7001B  720p HD Weatherproof IP Bullet Camera & Blue Iris Pro Surveillance Software. When you purchase this camera you will get a brown box with the camera itself, mounting hardware (including mounting template) and a mini CD with software/user manual package. Although you get less in the box than you would with a full retail product - there is no POE injector included for example - you pay significantly less than a full retail product. I already had my network and Blue Iris Pro Surveillance Software (which I highly recommend) set up for monitoring/recording, and I simply added this camera to it. It's worth noting that I really like the POE feature of this camera - it saves you from having to mount the camera near a power outlet and only one cable is needed.This dome camera has the same \"cons\" as the Q-See bullet model - the cable (ending with power and network connectors) coming out the rear is a little short (it's only about 18\" long) & the hole required to pass the cable through the wall needs to be ~ 1 1/8\" or so. As with the QCN7001B review, I only took off 1 star total for these minor complaints as I was able to work around them.This camera has the same great video quality as the Q-See QCN7001B at the highest resolution of 1280 x 720. Video clips (triggered by motion) and still images are crisp and well-defined. I have the camera mounted over my garage door overlooking the driveway (replacing the Q-See camera) and found that the FOV is almost perfect. The dome camera has a 3.6 mm lens (vs the Q-See's 6 mm lens) and a lot more of my driveway width is now in view of the camera. The dome camera does have a bit of a \"Fish Bowl\" look to it due to the wider FOV, but that is to be expected. As a side note, both cameras seem to be exactly the same with the exception of the lens and camera housing type. As stated above, the same short power/CAT5 cable and large/attached CAT5 female plug are also present on the dome model.Like the Q-See QCN7001B, this is a great camera with a few (slightly) annoying design choices. It DOES work pretty darn well when used in the right scenario. Just do a little research to make sure what your needs are prior to ordering.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "Ed Barkman", "ReviewID": "R207FC1Z3IRIUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "not bad for the money. in the daylight looks great at nite it needs adjusting. it is easy to adjust, dont bother with the zoom its worthless. the first click it pixelated so bad it was useless.HD720p should be better than that.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly good news.

Does not put out SO much data that it \"clogs\" my NVR.CONS:  The template sticker they give you to guide drillng the holes is inaccurate, misleading and aggravating.  The screws are cheap.
