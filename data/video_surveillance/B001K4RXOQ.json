Battery access is also easy with the removal of a small screw on the inside upper portion above the knob. However, the problem comes when you unlock the door from the outside, then come inside and try to turn the center to lock it. It would not turn without a lot of effort. I unlocked the door using the keypad and then locked it again with the outside keypad and it seemed to work fine. Once again, using the inside knob and turning the lock it was near impossible to turn. I called the 800 number for support and the gentleman told me to hold the inside of the center lock while putting the code in to unlock the door. Holding the center lock in place while it is trying to unlock the door you can feel it start to move but stopping it from actually moving the locking mechanism makes the clutch reset. This fixed the problem in being able to unlock from the outside come inside and then turn the lock to once again lock the door. However, I keep having to do this over about every 2 or 3 times when I unlock the door from the outside. It appears that this clutch is not working properly or that depending on where this clutch ends up in the process can cause the inside lock to be turned slightly (being neither exactly horizontal or exactly vertical. Very annoying. The knob works fine when using the pad to unlock and lock the door. However, when using the inside lock it will hang and is nearly impossible to turn about every 2 or 3 times.

Luckily, I have not experienced the problems that others had experienced... perhaps the internal design was modified since those reviews were written.I purchased the polished brass version.  While not the best looking brass finish that I have seen, I have no real complaint.  What the knob may lack in quality brass finish it more than makes up in functionality.The knob installed very quickly, just as installing any other basic door knob with the exception of putting a wire through the door hole.  I do not have a deadbolt on my door, but because of the height of this unit on the interior and exterior sides (there is a sizeable battery box on the interior), some may experience problems when trying to fit this and a deadbolt.Connecting this deadbolt to my Insteon Morninglinc module and Smartlinc was very easy.  Although I cannot check the status of the lock, I can lock and unlock remotely via smartphone or computer, if needed.Operation of the knob through the keypad is successful about 90% of the time.  The other 10%, one of two things happen: 1) the keypad misses the first digit pressed, and spits back \"error\" beeps; or 2) the door tries to unlock (motor spins), but does not actually unlock.  Because these are rather rare occurences, they do not bother me much at all.  To address the first problem, be sure to press the buttons fully, and listen for the confirmation \"beep\" after *each* digit pressed.  To address the second problem, simply press the *lock* button on the keypad to reset the motor and lock, and then enter your code again.  In my experience, the second problem was usually caused by myself or my wife failing to fully turn the lock/unlock knob inside the house, sometimes leaving the knob partially between locked and unlocked.I really enjoy using this lock, and the ability to enter the house without keys (garage door opener is a backup) is really great.I wouldn't hesitate to buy anotehr of these locks and encourage others to try this product.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "KPG \"c4 guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2SAQ3KDFDB4BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this door lock.  I usually don't even write reviews, but this was worth it.  I bought an extra remote for my wife.  Installation was easy. The unit seems pretty heavy duty, and strong.

The hands free action is very convenient. It was pretty easy to install and program. It looks very modern and doesn't seem cheap or flimsy. It comes with two (mechanical) keys and one remote fob. The key pad flashes green when unlocked and red when locked. Things to keep in mind: 1) this is not a deadbolt, just a handle lock 2) if you already have a deadbolt in your door, this lock might not fit under it because it's pretty tall. I had to put this new lock on top, and the deadbolt on the bottom 3) it takes 4 \"AA\" batteries. Heed the instructions warnings about only new batteries. The only thing I don't like is that it seems pretty expensive.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "So easy to use!", "Author": "Victoria C.

Now I don't have to hide an extra key outside or give a key to a neighbor, house cleaner or relative.  I just give them their own code.  My wife has not used a key since the remodeling.  We have a electronic opener that allows us to unlock the door from the car before I bring in the packages.  A couple of reasons it is not 5 stars.  (1) the screw that holds the battery cover screws into plastic that has stripped out.  With a little steal wool I get it to hold but a strong slam of the door and it falls off;  (2) a plastic piece of the latch broke recently.  Morning Industry is replacing the latch but a little heaver build would be nice.  (3) the door knob is very slick and difficult for children or elderly to get a grip.

The lighted keypad is helpful when we come home later than expected and don't have the porch light on. I entered an easy to remember code for each of my two teenage daughters and my wife. Now when the kids come home from school, dance, sports, clubs, or whatever they can get in without having to remember to bring their house key. I feel better knowing that if I can't be there, they are not stuck outside until my wife or I get home.

I have two of these locks.  The one on the main door going into the house works just okay most of the time.

I have 4 of these locks in total and keep switching the one on the garage door.  Right now it is working after lubricating the replacement.  But this won't last long.  What it does is lock up tight and you can not even turn the release inside manually with your fingers.  It would take a pair of pliers to turn it.  So I take it off and replace it with a freshly lubricated one.  I am using Vaseline for a lubricant right now but have tried everything under the sun.
