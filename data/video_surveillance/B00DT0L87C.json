Dopwell", "ReviewID": "R2FI0B0BZ9SGXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This CCTV monitor has allot more features packed into it than the other budget monitors in the same price range, but the features are not listed in the product description. Beyond being a 2.8\" LCD monitor which can output up to 600ma to power any basic cctv camera, the four buttons on the front can be used to do the following (starting from left to right):(1) Return Button - Used to scroll through stored images\\clips(2) Video Button - Used to record video from the connected camera. Stored as .avi(3) Photo Button - Used to take a snapshot of the image from the connected camera. Stored as .jpg(4) Function Button - Used to access the images\\clips that you stored.Note - To use any of the above feature you will need to insert a microSD card into the right side of the CCTV Monitor, without it the unit can only be used a basic CCTV monitor. For my testing i used an old samsung 1Gb microSD that I had lying around which I formatted in windows as \"FAT\".So far the quality of the stored images are great, I will test for a few months with various cameras on and will update this review to comment on how it holds up to being used out in the field for installation jobs.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "exact specs..", "Author": "P.
