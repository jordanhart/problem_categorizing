{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Upgraded to 8 channel and better cameras", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2A3PC31NDZKS9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "BUYER BEWARE!!!I had a 4 channel system with the basic cameras.  I found that I needed  more cameras, so I bought this system.  The longer range night vision cameras were just what we needed. The system works great.The reason that I rated this as 3 stars, is because one of the cameras stopped working at night, and SVAT is not too responsive.  I cannot get to talk to a live person.  When you do get through, you are told to send them an e-mail.  This problem is about 5 days old and I will update this review as things happen.______________________________________________________________________________________________SVAT is part of a company called CWD(Circus World Displays Ltd.) It is located in Niagara Falls, Canada.  They do have a location on the US side of the border, where I sent my camera.Just before Christmas, I received my camera back with a note that they could not re-create the problem. When I tried the camera, it did work in both modes, but when it switches between day and night, there is a grinding noise that sounds like you are trying to put a truck in gear without pushing the clutch in.  It is not worth my time and the cost of shipping to send it back.Since I did not complain about the grinding noise (it did not grind when I sent it back) the crack technicians a CWD decided to send it back and let me deal with it.  As far as I am concerned, you are buying SVAT products WITHOUT a warranty since they don't want to fix their problems.Over the Christmas holiday, I was at my other home, and I noticed that one of the cameras from the 4 channel system stopped working. I did not try to fix it since it was snowing and blowing and I did not want to be up on a ladder.I will say that the recorders seem to work well, so I will leave the three star rating, but if the cameras don't work the system is useless.This will be my last purchase from SVAT, Defender(another CWD company) or CWD.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great For value", "Author": "Puertoroc21", "ReviewID": "R10T4ZWDUA73W5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price of the Kit you can't ask for more.
