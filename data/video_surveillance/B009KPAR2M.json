{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Horrible setup process, but functional in the end", "Author": "Lenny", "ReviewID": "RDJERX1H4GA1A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very long review. If you want to skip to the chase : it took me more than 4 hours to get everything working (and another 1.5 hours to write this review). If you take the few minutes to read this review, however, you will have the instructions you need to set it up in under 15 minutes. You need to connect with http on port 85 to get to the web interface (add :85 after the hostname or IP address), you need to do a fair amount of configuration on Internet Explorer, the documentation leaves much to be desired (and didn't come with my camera) and the software the documentation refers to does not exist. The picture quality is good, however, and the build quality looks solid. It supports power over Ethernet, but you can power it through the included 12V adapter as well. There may be some issues mounting it to make sure the camera is secure and your house waterproof. Read the rest for more details.First, some background about my experience level (skip this paragraph if you're not interested). I own a number of IP cameras, including 3 Panasonic (2 different models), 2 Foscams (different models), and a Belkin. I've set up all of them myself, often without need to refer to a manual. I'm also a software engineer who works on network protocols and network architectures, and I'm very experienced in setting up networking equipment, including home routers - I've gone through 5 now, over the years. My first NAT router was a Linux machine I assembled (not because I'm masochistic, but because there were no inexpensive ones available then).The camera arrived with no documentation, no quick start guide, and no CD. This could be an oversight on the manufacturer's part. After all, it is a review unit. No matter, I went online, and after 30 seconds with Google, I have a PDF user's manual. I also learned that this is essentially a rebranded Dahua IPC-HFW2100. The camera is IP66 compliant - sealed against dust and protected from heavy water spray (but not immersion).Initial impression was favorable - the all metal construction feels solid. Once mounted, the camera can be adjusted to point in any number of directions. There's a Philips screw to tighten it once you have it adjusted to your satisfaction.The camera sensor is in a separate compartment from the IR LEDs. This is good, because it means that IR light will not be reflected back to the sensor from the front glass element. There is at least one IP camera that suffers from this design flaw.On further inspection, I see some potential issues when mounting this. First, there's no watertight seal for the base of the unit where it connects to a wall or ceiling. Not only that, there's a notch for the wire to come out, presumably to be run along the wall. I had assumed that I was meant to drill a hole in the wall behind the mounting plate. I suppose I can do that, but the size of the connector (a square shaped RJ-45 connector) means that I would need to drill a hole of at least 1 1/4\" diameter. Seems rather excessive.The viewing angle is 40 to 45 degrees. Rather narrow for a security camera. It needs to be a good distance away if you want to cover a wide area. Good thing the IR illumination is rated at 100 feet.The rest of the package comes with a power adapter (12V), mounting screws and anchors, a paper drilling template, and 100 feet of Cat 5E cable.The first part of the manual talks about using the camera with a DVR, with a lot of emphasis on power over Ethernet. I decided to plug in the camera and see what I can do with it instead.I plugged it into my network, and plugged in the power adapter. I used Fing Network Tools (Android app) to see what the IP address is (the hardware address is on a sticker of the camera). I tried connecting to port 80 of that address. No response. Hmm...Tried power cycling. Nope. There's a reset button. Tried pressing it. Nope. Maybe hold it down and power it on (a common way for factory reset - but there's no mention of this in the manual)? Nope. https didn't work either.OK, when all else fails, read the manual.Manual refers to \"ConfigTool software\". What software? Oh, the one that is on the CD that didn't come with the camera. Never mind, let's download it online. It's not available on Q-See's website. Thank you, Q-See.So I fire up my port scanner and ran a quick check on the camera. I learned that it is listening on port 23 (telnet), 85 (my scanner says \"MIT ML Device\") and 554 (RTSP).I tried to telnet into port 23, but it will not accept admin / admin. A quick search of Dahua's forums turned up \"we do not reveal login credentials to customers\". 554 is likely the video stream, so I tried port 85. Success!Seriously, port 85? If you're going to do that, at least put a sticker on the box or the camera. It will save you tons of customer support calls.OK, let's check out the video. What, no video? Perhaps it is because I'm using Firefox. I had the same problem with a Foscam H.264 camera (all the MJPEG cameras work fine, but they're only 640x480). Forum discussion suggest installing QuickTime, but I had issues with QuickTime in the past and swore to stay away from it. Let's fire up IE 9 instead. I'm using Windows 7 64 bit, I made sure to run the 32 bit version of IE because many plugins will not work on 64 bit IE.I was prompted to install the ActiveX plugin, which I did so. Still no picture. Played around with IE settings to lower security. Still no pictures. OK, back to the manual.Manual says to add camera to Trusted Site. OK, done. Set security for trusted site to Low. OK, done. Still no picture. Back to the manual.Manual says turn off User Account Control. You have got to be kidding me. Presumably I got this to protect my property. You want me to lower my security on my computer in order to protect my property?In order to review this unit, I went ahead and did that. I've already turned it back on so that it will be enabled again the next time I reboot.(Edit : I turned UAC back on, not expecting the camera show a picture in IE. But I still get a picture. As far as I can tell, I have full functionality. On account of this - that I consider the unit usable - I'm upgrading my review to 3 stars)OK, I finally got a picture. It took a few seconds to appear, but it looks good. Very clear picture, either in IR or in daylight mode. Lag is under 1 second (likely under 0.5 seconds). IR light can be controlled, but you need to go into the setup screen to do so (Camera, Day & Night : color = day, black & white = night. Period is by time, and auto is self explanatory). Since the IR LEDs use a lot of power, I would like them to be off if the camera is not actually in use.The picture looks distorted initially, but that is because it will stretch to fill up the width of your browser, but it keeps some strange aspect ratio. Clicking on \"100%\" will revert it to its original size and aspect ratio. There's also a \"W:H\" setting that always goes to \"adaptive\" instead of \"original\". Minor annoyances, but this comes at the end of a long list of annoyances.I tried the web app, which works well on my Asus TF101 tablet (rather old Tegra 2 tablet by today's standard). I can't test it on my Kindle Fire HD because it is not availabe on Amazon's Appstore, and by this point I really don't want to sideload it on my Kindle. The video on the app is limited to the substream - D1 (704x480) or CIF (352x240). There's a 1 second lag in the video. I can have both the computer as well as the app viewing at the same time.You can create additional admin or user accounts. Note that the camera comes with 3 accounts created by default : 2 admin accounts and 1 user account. I'm not sure why the two additional accounts are created (they cannot be deleted) but be sure to change the password on all 3 of those accounts for security. The password is the same as the username.The camera has alarm settings and automatic FTP uploads for recordings. It does not have any local storage, or the ability to add any.I was this (imagine me holding my finger and thumb 1/2 inch apart) close to giving up on this one and giving it a 1 star rating. I give it 2 stars (edit : I upgraded it to 3 stars which to me means \"functional\" after further testing - after verifying that it actually works with UAC turned on) as I managed to get everything up and running in the end. If you learn from my experience here, and if you don't mind disabling User Account Control, or if Firefox with Quicktime works for you, it might be a 3 to 4 star product for you.Pros :Metal constructionIR will not reflect internally to sensorRelatively small sizeVery good picture qualitySupport multiple streamsBuilt in web server, or can be used with a network video recorderWeb interface is actually very comprehensive, if a little awkwardly phrased sometimesSmartphone app availableCons :No documentation, CD, or quick start guide (not sure if this is universal)Mounting point not weather sealed (requires additional hardware)Narrow viewing angle (good if camera is far from point of surveillance, bad if near)Security issue : reset button at back of unitSecurity issue : telnet port enabled, login unknown to end userSecurity issue : two accounts \"888888\" and \"666666\" are created by default. Cannot be deleted, but password can be changed. Default password is the same as the username.Defaults to http on port 85Does not work by default on Firefox (might require QuickTime)IE setup rather tediousIR tedious to control manually (not an issue if you leave it at auto)Web interface login always defaults to WAN (only lower resolution stream available) - it's one click to change, but it gets tediousWeb interface awkward in places - for example, DST setup requires you to specify start and end time for DSTVideo defaults to \"stretch to fit browser aspect ratio\". One click to fix, again tedious. Would be nice if it remembers settings using cookies.Finally, a few advice regarding network security. Do not put this on the DMZ, as the telnet port is a huge security hole - made worse because you cannot disable it, or change the password. You can use port forwarding to allow access from outside your home network, but the username / password is easily sniffed by anyone if you're using a public access point. For best security, set up a VPN server (some routers have VPN servers, or you can set up one using a Raspberry Pi, for example). Connect to your home network over VPN, then access the camera through VPN. Setting up a VPN server is beyond the scope of this review, and I'd rate it as \"medium - high\" in difficulty. For those who wish to try, there are how-to guides available online.Update : 10/28/13. Finally got around to trying FTP file recording. Took a bit of experimenting, but it works fine. I used Filezilla as my FTP server, but any FTP server will work. It sends an ALLO command (allocate) that most servers ignore. Babyftp will return an error, but it might be ignored. The FTP implementation of this camera is VERY chatty, so if possible, set your log level to low. The recording scheduling doesn't work in IE, only in Firefox (didn't try Chrome, assume it works) which is stupid, because viewing the video doesn't work in Firefox. Recorded video doesn't play back in any application I tried (PowerDVD, VLC, DAV players that I found online). You need the \"Smart Player\" application (by Dahua, the manufacturer of the camera). I managed to find it using Google Search but I just tried and can't find it now. It should have been on the CD, but if you didn't receive it (like me) or if you misplaced yours, contact Q-See. It worked well enough that I now know it is a skunk that's raiding my vegetable garden.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "You won't be getting a Q-See branded Camera just go buy ipc-hfw2100", "Author": "Volunteer", "ReviewID": "R33TGHCROEDU7O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought four of the cameras because they were advertised as QCN7001B cameras.  It is my first time using the Q-See product including the Q-See 16 channel NVR for a business.  I didn't want any setup hassles so I figured I'd stick to Branded product.  I got all the cameras through this HD Security company through Amazon and the NVR directly through Amazon.  I have a problem with one of the cameras not wanting to hook up to the network and the NVR can't see it.  The other three hooked up just fine and I did a firmware upgrade from Q-See.  All went well except for the one camera.  I started looking for information on the box and camera and realized I didn't get anything branded or otherwise by Q-See.  It's just a Dahua IPC-HFW2100.  Now I had read that Q-See just rebrands Dahua cameras so I'm not shocked.  What ticks me off is the fact that I paid a premium for these \"Q-See\" cameras and could have saved about $40 just buying the IPC camera on Amazon.

Honestly, my first impression is this is one serious IP camera...WAY more serious than the Foscam one I already have. The more I unpacked, however, the more distressed I became as there is no installation manual and no CD with installation software. Right on the box it says \"\"User manual and software CD\" included. Nope - not there.So I go to the q-see web site...and it's next to impossible to find the product since they're all organized by \"Platinum Series\", \"Premium Series\", etc., and the \"series\" of my camera is not stated anywhere on the box. So I find the model number on the camera itself and do a search, and after wading through numerous pages, I find the sales page for this product. However, there are no manuals to be found...so it would appear I'm going to have to make a call to the people at q-see to figure out how to install this thing. I'd certainly expect better than this for a product that sells for close to $350.UPDATE. After almost an hour, I found the user manual for this product buried many layers deep on the q-see web site. Had to go to the Site Map to even get close. Now I have to decide if I want to print the 96 page manual...then I have to find the software that also wasn't included in the box. I'm already not enjoying the installation experience, and I haven't even come close to hooking it up (which, based on my experience with the Foscam product, will probably not be fun).", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See QCN7001B 720p", "Author": "Gammy_W", "ReviewID": "RJYG7TCZCGQL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You won't need any software to setup the camera itself, or its functions.

I work in a seperate building, behind my home, and needed a clear view of what was going on in front of my house.  When expecting deliveries or visitors I would spend a lot of time focused on listening for the arrivals, and dashing out of the office only to find that what I had heard was not the expected arrival.  It seemed it would improve my efficiency to install a camera on a corner of the building I was in, direct it down my driveway, between my house and my neighbor's house, where I could observe any vehicles that may approach my house.I estimated the distance and width of view I would need, and considered the distance I would need for the night IR view, etc.  I then read many online camera reviews, specifications and looking at demo videos.  I wanted an IP camera solution for several reasons, but primarily for the ease of running only one Cat5 cable and the ability to access the camera over my network.  I can see sometime down the road where I may want additional cameras, and maybe an NVR, but I am not ready for that investment yet, so this seemed like a good way to start with a scheme that can easily be expanded later.I decided the Q-See QCN7001B camera was the one I wanted to start with, because of its reviews and specifications, but I was not willing to pay the price I saw that it was going for.  Rather than settle for a lower priced camera I put the project on hold while I kept watching prices and researching other cameras.  I did find a great price on the camera at Amazon and placed the order.  It arrived sooner than was promised, but it had no setup software or POE injector.  I did not realisze the version I ordered was intended to be an add-on for a Q-See NVR system rather than an independant camera.  Fortunately, with an hour or so online I was able find a POE injector for about $20 and download the installation software from the Q-See support web site.  It was still overall a great price and I have no regrets.Once I had the POE injector and software, the camera was resonably easy to install and setup.  The video quality is excellent and the perfomrance is exactly as I expected.  The camera is about 100 feet from the street we live on and I can cearly see another 200 feet beyond that baring obstructions.  I now clearly see everything I need to see - and more - without getting up from my desk.The camera has been in operation for a month, and I have observed it in various weather conditions, both day and night.  The night (IR black & white) transitions well and there is no IR \"ring\" as you see in some less expensive cameras.  I am very pleased with the purchase and only rated it with 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to go find my own POE injector.

The installation instructions address pretty much all of the points that other reviewers have made on here, e.g. go to port 85 and so on, and I found setup to be mostly trouble free WITH THE EXCEPTION that it requires an activex plugin to view any video directly from the camera. I run linux so I had to install vmware with windows so I could get IE.That said, A few comments: The pivot that the camera sits becomes loose and floppy after a few turns, so you may need to shore it up a little. The BIGGEST CAVEAT, though, is getting video off of the camera correctly. I'm using a ftp server and the camera uploads the video, however, it doesn't create directory structure consistently, and this screws up the uploading of video.because it's too busy trying to look for directories for jpeg snapshots which hoses the video upload, and it's a problem that seems to occur only after the nightly reboot the camera goes though, which is set by default.

My 1st try was a Defender PX301-010 all-in-one kit that I ended up returning due to the camera image quality. To be upfront and fair, that system - which included a camera, LCD monitor and SD card recording - cost the same as this single camera does. The system had a max resolution of 640 x 480 while this camera can go up to 1280 x 1024. I wanted - and was willing to pay for - a higher resolution camera. I was also willing to use my PC as a DVR/NVR to view and store images and video clips.The Q-See QCN7001B that I received included a power adapter, 100 feet of Cat5 network cable, mounting hardware (included mounting template), CD with software/user manual and a POE injector all in a sturdy retail package. Judging by other reviews of this product, earlier shipments included little or none of these. While on the topic of earlier reviews, I read them all and found the information VERY helpful when setting up my camera(s), especially the network information. I used both the included web service and configuration tool to get the network information of the camera before switching to Blue Iris Pro Software (which I highly recommend) for monitoring/recording. I did all my setup and network testing BEFORE choosing a monitoring location and mounting the camera. While this wasn't necessary (the camera works great) I wanted to avoid having to take the camera back down if it was non-functioning.(Note: I really like the POE feature - it saves you from having to either mount the camera near a power outlet and only one cable is needed).Mounting the camera was where I ran into my 1st \"con\" of this camera. The camera cable (ending with power and network connectors) coming out the rear is a little short - it's only about 18\" long. This limits the mounting location to ~ 12\" from the cable pass-through hole into the house. You could mount the camera further from the pass-through hole, but then the CAT5 and power connectors would be exposed to the elements. Although the camera itself is waterproof, I doubt the connectors are. This brings me to the 2nd \"con\" - the hole required to pass the cable through the wall needs to be ~ 1 1/8\" or so. I had seen this mentioned in another review, so I knew it ahead of time and won't deduct any stars for this. I WOULD like to see the cable lengthened to roughly 2-3 feet long and/or make the CAT5 female/power plugs detachable. I only took off 1 star total for these minor complaints as I was able to work around them.Once the camera was mounted and up/running, I was impressed with the visual quality at the highest resolution of 1280 x 920. Video clips (triggered by motion) and still images were crisp and well-defined. I had the camera mounted over my garage door overlooking the driveway and found that the FOV (Field Of View)) is too narrow for my intended location. The camera has a 6 mm lens and doesn't fit my entire (two-car-width) driveway in the frame. This is not the fault of the product however - the chosen area I wish to monitor is simply too close to the camera (I have uploaded two images to illustrate the difference). I would guess that the monitored area should be no closer than 15-20 feet from the camera - maybe closer if the area is fairly narrow. In the end I moved this camera to the front of my house to monitor where I park my car and anyone coming to my door. I then purchased and mounted Indoor/Outdoor IR Dome Network Security Camera camera to watch over my driveway. The dome camera has a 3.6 mm lens which equals a much wider FOV. A lot more of my driveway width is now in view of the camera. The dome camera does have a bit of a \"Fish Bowl\" look to it due to the wider FOV. As a side note, both cameras seem to be exactly the same with the exception of the lens and camera housing type. The same short power/CAT5 cable and large/attached CAT5 female plug is also present on the dome model.In the end the Q-See QCN7001B is a great camera with a few (slightly) annoying design choices.

They're a bit more technical with the setup and configuration options, but definitely worth the time it took to learn.They are a vast improvement in night vision mode as well and have the option to stay in color instead of B&W;, unlike most analog cameras.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great IP Camera and good price.", "Author": "J Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R1H7NZEOHLVW4K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased a few of these cameras over the past few months. I am writing this review because I think the product is getting unjust negative reviews. IP cameras are a total different platform than their analog counterparts. First off, one should have a good understanding of network configuration and router settings. If a person has strong network knowledge, the setup is a breeze. You simply setup your router port forwarding to the desired IP address and ports of your cameras and get a dns to view them remotely. You then can set your internal ports to an appropriate setting to view them from within your network. You do not need to pair this camera with a NVR to view remotely either, but a NVR is the best method to host them externally and for recording purposes. Is it a high end IP camera, no. Will it work for nearly every average installation, absolutely. I think the biggest problem people have is networks are complex and it isn't designed to be a simple plug and play setup. I hope this helps some consumers you are looking at this camera. If all else fails, call a local professional, they can help with any problems.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth any amount of money (IMHO)", "Author": "Roger Daisley", "ReviewID": "R3PQIGV2MB4BFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a few weeks ago and experienced the same unpacking shock. The camera was nicely packed, but did not include a user manual, installation information or anything else ... just a camera.I phoned the seller and asked for help. He provided a link to the Q-See webpage. Like a previous reviewer, I had considerable trouble locating anything remotely applicable. When I found the manual that was described as applicable, I discovered much of the information was not useful.Having stated the installation \"fire drill,\" the real BOTTOM LINE is simply it does not operate reliably. Several times per day, I notice the picture (which is very good) is frozen and not changing. This requires I close out the camera and re-log on. Obviously, for a security monitor, this is unacceptable.Regrettably, I will be returning the camera to Amazon.UPDATE: August 10, 2013I returned the first camera to the seller in May and received a replacement. This camera worked intermittently for several months. During this time, it would go to \"green or gray screen\" frequently every few minutes, or sooner.I called Tech Support and received \"fluff\" for advice. It seemed they simply wanted to tell me something to try and \"call back if I had any more problems.\" The last \"Tech\" said he would email a file to me that might help. It never arrived.After several tries at \"Tech Support,\" I have finally given up. I asked to return the unit for replacement, but was told I needed to \"try one more thing.\"At this time the camera will log on to the \"Setting\" page, put will not come forth with a picture. I give up. I will send this piece of worthless junk back to someone in hope of receiving some kind of refund. Any amount will be appreciated.Needless to say, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap", "Author": "Nean", "ReviewID": "R2ELIFZIA4DTOH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this piece of Chinese crap here.
