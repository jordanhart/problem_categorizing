{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TERRIBLE SEARCH/PLAYBACK", "Author": "jpfarren", "ReviewID": "R383185Y1ZP989", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One of the fundamental purposes of a DVR is to search/playback events that occurred during your absence.  This DVR is terrible for that.I realized it when trying to find an event that occurred sometime in the past 12 days, so I need to review all 16 cameras to determine where the event started and where it ended as well as the progress in between.  This DVR won't do that.1.  You only have two choices of playback:  1 or 4 cameras at a time.  That's it.  You can't watch all 16 at once, or even 8 at once.2.  It performs playback at 1X, 2X, 4X, 8X and 16X speeds.  At 8X and 16X it skips so many frames your unable to see the event your looking for. - what a useless feature.  2X and 4X look nice, but way too slow for a multi-day playback.Searching for an event that occurred in the past 12 days requires you to watch a maximum of 4 cameras at maximum of 4X speed.  With 16 cameras, you have to repeat the search 4 times and it will take 3 days each time.  What a waste of time!My previous DVR was a Dedicated Micros and it allowed review of all 16 cameras at once at 64X speed and did not skip frames.  It was very nice to watch the playback.  It only takes a moment to spot an event if you're not skipping frames.This Q-See DVR skips so many frames at 8X and 16X speed you miss most of what happened.  The only useful review speed is 4X which takes way too long for a multiple day review.  So this DVR fails in one of the fundamental purposes of a DVR.UPDATE:  Tried to return it, found out about the 25% restocking fee!  Talk about old school lousy customer service.  I let them know of the Costco guarantee that accepts returns for a full refund, no questions asked.  That is the state of the art for customer service.  Decided to keep the DVR to show others how bad it is.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.99", "Features": "16 Channel Real-time DVR with 1TB (1000GB) Hard Drive included\nFull D1 Recording Resolution: Broadcast-quality D1 704x480 pixel resolution\n480 FPS Total (30FPS per camera x 16 cameras)\nRemote viewing from both PC's and Mac's\niPhone and iPad users may download the FREE \"Supercam\" app from Apple's App Store.
