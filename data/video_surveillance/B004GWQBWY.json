{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Genuine LOFTEK Brand CXS 2200", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TX81QTQSCF6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I really like this camera.  Mainly I wanted to share some helpful tips with others that may be considering this for purchase.1. This is a night vision camera.  If you use this outside in the daylight colors will appear different than they do to the human eye.  This is normal.  (It looks like my trees are Cherry Blossom's in full bloom.  Kind of cool.)2. They hard code an IP address in the camera and expect to see your home network in the 192.168.0.X range.  If it's not, (like mine, it's a 192.168.2.x net) then you may have difficulty getting to the camera from your PC to set it up.  I simply backed up my router configs, changed it to a 192.168.0.x network, reset my PC's networking, and I was able to browse to the camera and set it up to where I wanted it.3.  This is an indoor camera.  If you plan on pointing it out a window it will work pretty good during the day, but after dark the infrared lights will reflect back off the glass and blind the image.  This is normal for this type of camera.  You can still point it out the window, but you'll need to do something like cover the existing LED's on the camera and purchase an \"infrared illuminator\" (there are several on Amazon) and install it outside the window, covering the area you want to see.4.  I have 64 bit Windows7 and could not get the little CD to work for me, but was able to configure the camera just fine via my web browser after I got through the initial networking stuff mentioned above.On the CON side, I'd have to say that it would have been smarter to simply make the networking DHCP and not have hard coded the IP address.  I'm sure a this has confused folks into thinking that their camera was dead on arrival.  I'd also like to have an easy way to turn the built in infrared LEDs off if I want to use an external source.  That's all the negatives I have though.  Great bang for your buck.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Support, Great Price!", "Author": "Seed", "ReviewID": "R3HHOZTVPYCT8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a non-PTZ camera to watch my puppy while I was away at work. It's a nice camera but I found that I needed to be able to pan or tilt to see anything beyond the set view.  I was skeptical in PTZ cameras being so cheap in price as usually for a good quality one they would be hundreds more. I took a chance on the loftek one and I was very impressed.I opened the box and everything was there including a little CD for drivers. Well I have a slot loaded CD that can't accept these so I surfed the net to try and find the drivers. no luck. So I wrote support and with a few hours they wrote back saying please send us your regular email and we will send you the drivers. I was skeptical that they actually would but I sent my email anyway and waited. The next day I checked my inbox and low and behold there was a compressed file with all the goodies in it to get me going. Setup was easy and the PTZ option is great. I even setup audio to be the \"voice of god\" for when my pup is being bad or on the couch. The audio feature works but only with IE.Now that the dog is pretty well behaved I'm going to move this to an external camera for security. I then told myself, bummer I wish they had white because black really sticks out, at least on my home. I wrote to them and asked if they had any white ones. Within a few hours they replied they would in a couple days. Sure enough I get another email in 2 days stating they now have em on Amazon. Amazing. I ordered 2 more just because the support experience was so good. The price can't be beat and the CS is great. This is my first review ever and I felt I really needed to do it because this experience was by and far the best experience I've had dealing with a company and their product support.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent IP camera for this price", "Author": "Adam Kelley", "ReviewID": "RXGTDGC2A0949", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of this camera for what it costs.  Keep in mind, this isn't going to give you HD quality video or even close.  But for the sub eighty dollars it costs, you can't beat this.  As background, I have extensive experience with IP cameras, from Arecont to Axis to Mobotix to Panasonic, and just about every brand in between.  I thought I would take a look at the cheapest cameras out there so I could recommend them to clients looking for a cheap home solution as a nanny/pet cam or just wanting to check on a vacation home.  Keep in mind, this camera (and the 100s of other Chinese made cheap IP cameras) should not be used for real surveillance or security purposes - great for casual home users, but I wouldn't rely on them to protect a business.Image QualityThe video image is pretty decent at 640 x 480 resolution.  Daylight use colors are vibrant but a tad off, which is common in low end cameras, but better than those that lack an IR cut filter (this model does not have the ir-cut filter, but the updated Loftek 3200 model does).  The IR LEDs are quite powerful and you'll find that you'll want the camera at least 10 feet away from any object as they will be washed out by the somewhat powerful IR lights (i.e., if using as a baby monitor, don't put it too close to the baby, or the baby will be completely washed out in light).  Also, you can manually focus this by twisting the outer ring cap of the lens.  You can also replace the lens entirely if you want (different zoom or FOV etc.) by unscrewing the lens off.NetworkingI found the set up to be very easy.  My machine I used to set this up on is a Windows 7 64 bit desktop.  My internal network runs on 192.168.1.xxx, the camera by default runs on the 192.168.0.xxx subnet; this was no problem for the camera search utility that came on the included CD.  In fact, the search utility found the camera in about 1 second.  Using the utility I set a static IP address for the camera (I could have allowed my router's DHCP to assign the IP, but I manually assign all of my camera IP addresses as it makes port forwarding on the router easier).  The camera rebooted and I accessed the camera directly through the Chrome browser.  No problems.  Video came up right away.  Was able to switch between various video resolutions (160x120, 320x240, 640x480) without any problems.  I then set up my wireless network; again, no issues.  Like any network camera, if you aren't familiar with basic networking concepts and more advanced ones like port forwarding, you may have trouble getting this set up to be accessible from outside your home.Camera FunctionsThe pan/tilt on this is quite good.  For such a cheap camera I couldn't believe how quiet the motor mechanism is on this.  The only other cameras that I've found to be this quiet during pan/tilt (PT) are Sony cameras, but you'll pay upwards of 10 times more.  So, if you're looking for a quiet PT this is actually quite good.  Pan/Tilt speed range is quite good too (in the settings, you can specify 0 - 10; I made the mistake thinking that the higher the number, the faster it would pan, which was wrong; a setting of 1 is very fast, so I set mine at 3 which is fast, but still controllable).  I was however, disappointed that there wasn't any zoom available.  I knew there was no optical zoom (and really, how could there be on a sub 80 dollar camera?), but I thought there would at least be digital zoom via the client software.  But no, no digital zoom in either the Java client (for non Internet Explorer (IE) browsers) or the ActiveX version for IE browsers.  Which brings me to the issue of the ActiveX (IE Browswer) versus other browser functionality.  Like most IP cameras (even from the professional lines) you're going to be able to access more camera features through an ActiveX interface than a Java client.  So on the LOFTEK CXS 2200 you can only record, take camera snap shots, access audio, and view multiple cameras through the ActiveX client.  Also, I had no problems accessing the camera from my Android phone using a product called IP Cam Viewer (available in Amazon's App Store or the Android Market).Windows/Mac/Linux CompatibilityI have not tested this on a Mac computer so I cannot comment on using this camera (or even setting it up) with a Mac.  In the Windows world, this worked fine on Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), and Windows XP.  I was able to view full motion video and audio on an HTC EVO 4G cell phone, running Android 2.3.2 on the Sprint Network (3G speeds only; haven't had a chance to test 4G yet). My Linux (Ubuntu 11.4) clients had no issues accessing the camera view Chrome (I did not test setting up the camera using a Linux box, though)ConclusionFor what this camera costs, you can't beat it. The video quality is fine for this camera price range and set up was a breeze using a Windows 7 machine.  Playback was fine on a number of Windows 7 and XP machines, as well as an Android 2.3 phone.  There is no zoom available, but the lens can be replaced easily.  I can't speak to the durability/reliability of this as I've only had it running a couple of days now.  But like I said at the beginning of this review, this camera shouldn't be used for real surveillance or security purposes.  If you keep these points in mind, this camera should give you more than enough value for its cost.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't beat the usability for the price", "Author": "iERG", "ReviewID": "R1MCA77C7XER7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the most cost effective solution per feature I could find.Great picture quality in light or pitch dark.Pan and Tilt controls have a wide range of motion.The flip/mirror feature allows upside down mounting for high on a wall.Motion detection notification works like a charm.Audio monitoring is surprisingly sensitive.  I haven't tried to *send* audio yet.Works with WPA2 WIFI.The setup software on the CD is the key to successful use of this camera.  Allow the software utility to *find* the camera on your LAN, then manually configure the IP address that you want your camera to have.  THEN: setup an external (visible to the internet) port (pass-thru) on your home router so the camera is accessible from the internet (via username and password you establish) and then you can view your camera at home from work... or vice-versa.Setup multiple cameras in multiple locations and the very slick viewing software allows you to see all cameras on one screen... or choose to monitor just one camera in full screen mode.I'm going to buy several of these to keep an eye on my senior parents while I'm at work.You probably won't use it for cinematography any time soon, but it's a wonderful WIFI/IP camera for the money.There may be more \"high-end\" cameras with more intuitive software interfaces... but for the money, I think this one deserves 5 stars.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid IP Camera", "Author": "joyce.", "ReviewID": "RZ53CMXYIX7KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for use as a baby monitor.

The camera lets me view the video stream, and also has a built-in microphone so I can hear what's going on as well.

I am running Mac OS 10.5 and 10.6 so it will work on both operating systems BUT, you pretty much NEED a PC or PC emulator software to use the set-up software and make any changes to the camera. You also need a PC to setup the wireless. Safari, Chrome or Firefox will only allow you to view the camera image and use the tilt/pan functions from a mac. You can't adjust image size or use advanced alert and FTP settings directly.Fortunately I have a PC desktop as well and once I got it up and running I was able to set things up. The most difficult part of the set-up was setting up the camera to work remotely. Through the help of a website, portforward.com it walked me through setting up the camera for my particular router and I used the settings from Foscam and that worked.I had problems getting one of the two camera I am using to work wirelessly and thought it wasn't working but restarting the router solved the problem.Once I had everything set up on the PC I, I realized that I needed a decent IP camera software that worked on the mac. I decided to purchase Vitamin D software. There is a free version that supports 1 camera but in order to do advanced features such as defining an alarm area and adjusting image size you have to purchase the software. It doesn't, at the moment, control pan tilt, but you can do that from a web browser on the mac (Safari or Chrome, the image never displayed on Firefox).The camera quality is exactly as expected based upon the earlier reviews. I will say that I wish the camera wasn't so bulky. But for the price, it is something that I can live with.Knowing all I know now, I probably would prefer a camera with integrated Mac software.

You can pan, tilt, listen to audio, setup motion alerts, view at night, etc..  I think for the price, the feature set is top notch.However, there are glaring security vulnerabilities that Loftek is not addressing.  This issue first came to the public spotlight a week or so back when a Texas couple had their baby monitor hijacked by a hacker who was controlling the camera.  The exploits are out in the open, and are very easy to execute.  Foscam, Loftek, and other camera manufactures are all vulnerable, but Foscam drew the most criticism and has consequently put out firmware updates that are supposed to resolve the issue.  Feel free to read all about the security issue here:[...]It's very easy to test on your own camera.  Without logging into your camera, just go to your [...]  This is a dump of the memory, and with a little searching, can see your username/password in plain text!This link would show the hacker your wifi password.  [...]This link would let the hacker actually reset YOUR password, so they can access the camera and you cant.  [...]I've contacted support several times (as has the author of the article I just mentioned) but they have yet to commit to resolving the issue.  The support from Loftek is questionable - while generally speedy, the responses are in broken English at best.If you already own this monitor and just bought it, send it back for a refund!  Let's get Loftek's attention and have these issues fixed.  If it's too late for a return, then close up any firewall ports, because anyone with a little effort can take control of your camera.  If you are a little more tech savvy, you can setup a VPN, reverse SSL proxy, or IP filter tables to block access - but you are not 100% safe.Loftek, please read this review and address a major security vulnerability in your entire line of cameras.  You should feel a sense of responsibility to your loyal customers to secure your cameras.UPDATE 9/11/13After posting this review, Loftek did release a new firmware that fixing the most critical of these known issues, for the CXS2200 Camera.  I'm not sure if this new firmware fix was rolled into other vulnerable Loftek cameras, but I'm guessing it has not.  I do thank Loftek for finally committing some resources to fixing this issue.  I'm raising my review to 3 starts.  I still feel a full security audit is in order, fixing all known issues should be done, and releasing new firmware for their entire line of cameras needs completed.

I recommend reading all the information in the two manuals that come as part of the cd--first. It works best for me to get an overview of what they want you to do. Going step by step is like leaving bread crumbs in the woods-it is always better to get an overview of the forest before you start the journey.. I normally use Firefox browser, and yahoo mail. For this project use Internet Explorer to access your camera, and I created a special Gmail account in google chrome for all camera related email that is sent out over the web when triggered.The instructions with camera is great. If you stumble on something like \"port forwarding\", remote email etc--utube has wonderful videos on every obstacle you might encounter, setting things up. I'm not a computer programmer, and found that everything went smoothly. This is a great opportunity for the novice like me to learn about routers, and computers.Setting the camera up with the \"quick set up guide\" is easy. \"Port Forwarding\"--you need to be able to log into your router and follow directions. There are three excellent videos from Loftek that are great visuals. The hardest thing for most of us is following directions. Every once in a while it really works. If you don't believe it look at the cereal boxes in your kitchen-they rarely are opened like the manufacturer recommends--I've seen them opened upside down.I have Nikon software for my \"point and shoot camera\"--I love the way the Loftek csx 2200 puts the photos into a file with my other photos. If a burglar spots your security camera and destroys it---to late.Plan to only use adapter not batteries, and if you are planning to have your cxs 2200 more that 50' from main computer-hard wire only by extending ethernet cable directly from router. You have to experiment. If you have a laptop that stops working as you move further from the router-so will the camera.It depends on the router signal strength.Burglars go for guns and jewelry so I placed the wireless ,IP camera in a gun room facing door.The wireless camera is only 20' from main computer in the next room. When someone opens the door they are already videoed and caught on still shots, sent immediately to my Gmail address. If they find my main computer and decide to cart that off the information is already in cyberspace and can't be stopped.I ran ethernet cable through my attic to the opposite end of the house for additional out door cameras that monitor driveway and rear door. This camera has two way sound so you can speak to the intruder and he can speak back instructing you as to how he wants his body shipped and to whom.There is no zoom function, but I accept that--it would be a great tool. The focus on the camera can be adjusted by turning the ring around the lens. The pan, tilt and ability to take video and stills can be done from anywhere in the world, on any computer.The night vision is great--total darkness looks like daylight. The picture quality is very good if you adjust the focus.Remember this is a security IP camera not a video camera with a DVR.My only moment of pause here is the regret that an American company didn't design and produce this wonderful razzle-dazzle gadget.

Also, when I bought this camera, I had already browsed every networking, port forwarding, and IP camera forum you could think of, and learned A LOT about networking in the process. You should have a basic knowledge of networking and internet settings if you want to set up this or any camera to be viewed from another location, which will vary depending on the router and modem. I'm moderately computer savvy, and it took some reading before I was able to understand the more advanced features of this camera. However, it's a greatly satisfying feeling when everything comes together and is working properly.The camera is not without its faults. For some reason the Bsearch.exe software occasionally has trouble opening a browser, even when the camera is detected and displayed. To bypass this, I found that typing the camera's IP address directly into the address bar works. Next, the installation CD and manual are on a mini CD - As an old fashioned guy, I'd like to see a print manual. Also, mini CD's don't work in all disk drives. Lastly, as someone mentioned, the web interface is as quite ugly! Not polished at all and looks tacky.Now for the good stuff: The initial setup is fast. After plugging everything in and doing some basic configurations, I was viewing it on my wireless network in minutes. The wealth of features crammed into this thing is impressive. You can read about them in other reviews or the description. Basically, short of tasing intruders, it has everything I could ask for in an IP camera.

Since I have Charter Internet with dynamic IPs, I did go to dyndns.org and got a free proxy so friends could just time in the domain name and the camera itself updates the IPs automatically so it's always connected. also, UPnP works with this so it helps set your router ports up once you turn it on inside the camera.

Once you've changed the camera's IP to what you need, then just set your pc back to xxx.xxx.1.xxx and you're on your way with the rest of the camera configuration.I installed the camera in my attic to see what kind of critter had taken up a home there.  I thought it was a squirrel mom and litter.  Within about 2 hours of installing the camera it alarmed, I looked, and it was a raccoon.  I'm now keeping an eye on it to see when it takes the babies out of the house so I can seal up how it got in.It's great to be able to see from either the application on the pc or from a web page while I'm at work.  It works fine with the browsers on my Xoom and Android phone too. The camera's tilt and pan is controllable from anywhere I can access it.As far as color vs infrared, the built in infrared lights up my dark attic for about 20 feet easily.  When the attic light bulb is on I see decent color and if I pan you can really see when the infrared takes over.I haven't messed with the audio or the alarm triggering connection, but probably will before it's all over.For the relatively inexpensive price I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOFTEK", "Author": "AAA", "ReviewID": "RHQWVN5LFZPLY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1.

Those years i ordered plenty of Branded indoor IP Cam spread across Foscam, Tenvis, Hootoo and Loftek on Amazon. I am here by providing some advises regarding how to choose a good cost-performance IP Camera based on my years of IP camera using experience.I thought the CXS2200 camera is the most durable IP cam that I ever had, because I possessed of this camera for more than 1 year. I recommended this camera because it lasts for more than one and half year and still working. The camera works well in day and night and is a great buy for the price but there are a few things to consider. Firstly, the infrared lights can't be turn off by software, they will be turn on all the time in dimly lit place. Although its IR lights can't be cut off, but as a camera it provided stable and awesome night vision picture with good resolution. Secondly, the monitor software of the IP camera is simple but is real easy for ppl to handle. Lastly, for those first time user, Loftek camera has a little bit difficult in wireless setup. But as to Hootoo and Tenvis cameras, wireless connection is a real problem. I am not sure if it is the problem of camera wireless models; I always lose wireless connection and have to reboot their cameras for reattach.Most of the indoor IP Cams in the market are look similar in appearance; the only differences appear in the WEB UI and firmware. And the functions are more or less the same. Generally, each branded IP Cam have their own brand desktop client monitor software, I had six different brand cameras, so I had six kinds of monitor software. I can't recall their name one by one but Foscam monitor software is the most convenient and useful one I have used, although I used a third part monitor software to manage all my camera. If u are looking for a camera with user friendly software u can take a look at it. Foscam is an old IP Cam brand, and their Camera such as FI8918 sell very well till the last years reported had a serious net security bug.If you are a brand oriented buyer, you can buy Foscam. But if you are a cost-performance oriented buyer I highly recommend you Loftek camera.A sample was provided and the review is fair view of mine.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "You better be an IT person", "Author": "Perry Ambrose", "ReviewID": "R2G8ANWX1VVPDQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Many people here tried in vain to set it up.

You can get 1 day of storage for free and it's easily viewable remotely.Using my phone, on Monday I saw my delivery pkg sitting on the front porch about 11:45, and an hour later it was gone!  When I got home and viewed the recording on my PC, it clearly showed the guy stealing it from my porch.Phoned police, they came by, watched the video, printed some still shots for them and gave them a copy of the recording.  Cop was impressed with the quality and said he's seen bank surveillance cameras that didn't record as well.  They proceeded to then bust the perpetrator that night.So that's why I'm giving this little cam 5 stars - it did exactly what I had hoped it would, and saved me ALOT of future trouble with this thief.  It worked so well, I'm going to buy a couple more for viewing other areas around the house.Couple of other points:- you really do need to follow the included instructions exactly for it to connect wirelessly to your router.  If you do, it's simple.  Initial setup requires a wired connection to your router - make sure you launch a new browser to see it wirelessly after you disconnect the cable.  It took me a few tries after disconnecting the ethernet cable and I thought it was not working, before I read the instructions again and it stated to repeat a step where you're relaunching the browser.-I didn't do the IP forwarding thing to make visible to a web page - because I'm lazy, and it looked too complicated, and the sensr.net thing seemed a better option and was a very simple setup- color is kind of washed out, but for surveillance, I don't really care about the color- I found the infrared/night viewing outside totally useless with this cam.  It's mounted just inside a window and all it does is completely reflect off the window - even with a light on outside.

I researched lots of IP cameras (this being my first purchase of one) and decided to take a shot at the Loftek CXS 2200.This is actually my second unit as the first one was faulty.  I contacted Loftek directly and they were VERY helpful.  I had quite a good email exchange with them and each time I sent one I had a reply within 24 hours (and usually by the time I woke up the next day).  They confirmed that it was faulty and asked me to mail it back to them.  As soon as I provided them with a tracking number for the return of the unit they shipped out a new one straight away and they also refunded my shipping costs - fantastic!  It's always a shame when products fail, but when it does happen it's nice to have good customer service to back it up.Anyway... on to the camera.  It's pretty easy to set up - it comes with some useful setup software and the Quickstart guide is decent but there are more detailed instructions online if you want them.  You connect via wired Ethernet to start with and then set up the wireless connection.  One word of warning - the MAC address that the setup software tells you is the MAC address of the WIRED Ethernet, not the wireless connection.  If you have MAC filtering on your router like me, the easiest thing to do is temporarily disable it, connect the camera wirelessly, find out the wireless MAC and then add that to the router filter list.  After setting up port forwarding on my router, family can now view the camera anytime they want.  Rather usefully, each camera comes with a unique DDNS name so you can just give that out to potential users instead of an IP address.The camera itself produces a good, clear image, although the daytime colors are a little washed out and slightly mis-colored (although that's completely normal for a night-vision-capable camera like this).  The night vision is excellent and, aside from losing the color (again, completely normal) it's just as good as daytime for items within around 20 ft of the lens.  The IR LEDs aren't visably bright at all which is great for not disturbing sleeping subjects!  The pan and tilt is really good too - fantastic range of motion and very easy to control.  Lastly, the configuration software is very easy to use and the user set up is nice - you can set up Admin users (full control), Operators (who can move the camera but can't control the set up of the device) and Visitors (who can view but not move the camera).  The only issue I've found is that a plug-in is used to view through Internet Explorer.  I have 64-bit Win 7 and the plug-in kept crashing my machine.  However, my father used 32-bit with no issues and we view it using Google Chrome (which doesn't require a plug-in and nor do Firefox or Safari) and have no problems.In short, it's a nice little camera that produces a good image and it seems to be backed up by great customer service - thanks Loftek!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING...IT works after being under water via Storm SANDY", "Author": "tommy", "ReviewID": "R1U00MQIKBAKVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEW  12/1/2012,,,My basement had approx 2.5 feet of water.The camera was on a shelf about 18 inches from the floor viewing 2 sump pumps.

The router was approx. 30 feet through 3 internal walls or so and it was pretty \"glitchy\". I then decided to hardwire it and am very pleased with that decision. The camera functions as i hoped. The nightvision is very clear and easily to identify anyone, or thing. The setup for motion detection was slightly confusing and still is a bit off but id rather it be overly sensitive than not work at all. The camera pans and operates on a daily basis and emails me every day due to bugs.  I thought this might become annoying but i have come to like it due to knowing its functioning properly every day. The look of the camera is sleek and because of where i placed it, its hardly noticable.Prior to purchasing this camera, i reviewed and researched many different kinds and brands. I cant tell you whether or not this one is better or worse, but with previous experience in different kinds throughout the years, this one has to rank near the top...especially cause of cost savings.Im actually on here now to order another one to use in the nursery for our twins that are due in a few months.

I bought this camera because it got better reviews than the Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) in terms of picture quality, and it was cheaper. Foscam also makes the Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) - Black NEWEST MODEL, which supposedly has better image quality then the Loftek, although it is currently almost double the price on Amazon. I intended to use the Loftek as a baby monitor through my iPad or Macbook Pro. I had read some of the reviews explaining that setup would be slightly more difficult without using a Windows machine, but I wasn't worried about that as I also have a Windows desktop. That's my situation, now to my comments.Setup is slightly more difficult on a Mac (I tried it that way just to see). The bigger issue, however, is with the software running the camera. To get full capability, Internet Explorer needs to be run with a special ActiveX plugin installed. Without it, some features, most notably the two-way audio, will not work. Thus, Firefox, Safari, Chrome etc. users are out of luck if they want to get audio from this camera. If I am wrong on this, please reply to my review with instructions on how to get it to work, because I have not been able to and I would appreciate the help. Also, there are multiple Apps available specifically for Foscam cameras on iTunes for the iPhone/iPad, as well as other Apps for Android and BB. The options for Loftek, on the other hand, are pretty slim. I did try the \"Foscam Surveillance Pro\" App, and it works with the Loftek, including audio. Hmm. Still, the interface is somewhat clunky and lacks controls for all of the features, as it was designed for the Foscam.The Loftek's picture is decent, especially at this price point. The audio that I get is pretty awful. It has very high background static, and the sound is delayed several seconds from the video stream.Overall, this is a reasonably nice camera, especially for the price.

The camera viewing software did not work with the Chrome browser, but worked fine with Firefox and IE 7.  If you are less than technical when doing IP address type stuff I suggest checking out some youtube videos to help you set up your camera if you are going to want to view it from outside your home network.  The frame rate drops low when doing the wireless mode.  But I use it for home use, not to catch people breaking into my place of business, so again it works well.

I've read a few forums where others have had the same need.A message to the email address for support was promptly returned, but did not offer a solution.  My solution was several layers of duct tape in the shape of a disk.  Has to be thick.  I cut a circular hole in the middle of the disk which allows the camera to pick up images, but blocks the IR.  The tape is sticky enough to stick to the edge of the lens.  I have my front door light on at night so the camera picks up the light and gives a decent view.

This could be addressed in prior reviews but I did not read through them all.  Anyway, my setup is a linksys E1000 router behind an Actiontec modem hooked up to DSL internet.  It took me several hours of reading forums and setup pages only to figure it out on my own.- First, you need to bridge your modem.  For me it meant selecting \"RFC 1483 Transparent Bridging\".- Second, set your router to PPPoE mode and enter your login information provided by your DSL provided (if required)- Now you can set up remote viewing using port forwarding.- With the linksys router you cannot setup a virtual server, you must forward your ports.  I forwarded ports 80, 8080, and *** (the port assigned to the camera) and used a port forward checker to if my ports were open. (Make sure you have TCP or BOTH selected)- Now your camera is \"broadcasting\" and you should be able to view it using your external IP/port address.Now just make sure you set up your security settings properly and ALWAYS change the password for the camera from the default.

It may be difficult to setup if you decide to try it without reading the directions as I did the first 10 minutes.  I have to disagree with a previous post who said the \"little disc would not work with 64 bit Windows 7\".  I am using the same Operating System and it worked fine for me (64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium).  I also read in a review that users are stuck using the hard coded 192.168.0.x network.  This is also not true.  If you read the directions you will find a file called BSearch_en that you need to run to change it to work with another private network like 192.168.1.x (linksys default private network worked for me).  The part that stumped me for several minutes was once I made these changes I thought I should click the \"Close\" button when what I should have clicked was the \"Browse\" button.  The \"Browse\" button launches another window where you can see and control your camera.  If you forget this step and click on the IPCMonitor program from the disc you won't get anywhere...you would think that the 4 blank screens and controls that come up should be the program you use to control your camera but they don't appear to be.  I just got the camera today so I haven't had time to determine why that program is on the disc...click the \"Browse\" button at setup and it will launch the correct control window.  If you are using Internet Explorer be sure to click the second link to \"Download the Player\" before you attempt to click the first link to view the cameras.The picture and color are good indoors.  At night the picture is closer to black and white which is to be expected.  The movement of the camera is quiet but not silent.  My video seems to be slightly choppy but meets my needs.  I don't have any newer cameras to compare the video against.  The audio is not great...you hear quite a bit of noise when listening.  I haven't been able to test speaking through the camera yet.  Oh and the box seems well made and well padded.

It comes up on a hard-coded IP address on a 192.168.0.x network, so if your network is 192.168.1.x or something else, you'll have to do some magic to find it and change it.

For example, you could keep an eye on your dog while you're out during the day, watch your baby while they're sleeping, or monitor your basement during heavy rains. Because it's geared for infrared vision, the colors are weird, and you should basically consider this a b&w; camera. You'll never be able to make out any real facial detail unless someone stops and stands completely still less than 5 feet in front of the camera, so don't think about using it to track down the neighborhood kid knocking over your trash cans.A few other things to note, this is very much a Chinese product, likely reverse-engineered from another manufacturer's camera. The manual is difficult to read, and the interface has a few odd choice words. On the panel where you set how sensitive you want the motion detection to be, the adjustment slider is labeled \"image sensibility\".

Wireless Performance is good when closest to router but as you get further away the connectivity can fade in and out with less frames per second of video. Fading wireless signal = less frames per second = lost signal = lost ability to capture photos or video if too far from router. Works great when camera is hardwired. Camera must use 120v source. Camera has no battery capabilities.  My router is in the front of my house.  I set up the camera in the back of my house.  The wireless signal will go thru several walls.  The more walls it has to transmit thru the lower the frames per second which means some critical video or pictures can be missed.  Also the signal is sometimes lost for several seconds and the signal will come and go.  Camera works great hardwired to router so if you have several rooms wired with a Cat5 cable TV connection which is the rj45 connections in a room then you could hard wire the camera through the RJ45 wall TV connection and the camera will work fast and have a good video capture rate.  If you don't have RJ45 wall connections then the camera's wireless signal will need to be used.  Also if you do not have the camera hard wired back to the router, having your wireless computer stationed close to the camera will make the camera work better and give a decent video capture rate.  But as soon as you move the wireless computer farther away, then the signal will slow down and possibly not catch all pics or video you may need.Wireless Camera seemed to work ok with wireless signal going through 2 or 3 walls and 50ft from router. But it also worked slower and captured less frames per second vs hard wired camera which gives constant good video.  I also experienced having to take the camera down from its mounted location when I lost the camera signal and I had to take everything back to the router to reprogram it and reset it up to the router again. It had lost its camera settings several times when i was testing the camera after it was set up in wireless mode and being farther away from the router.  After numerous testing I have come to the conclusion that being 50-60ft away from router where I need the camera to be located, I am better off hardwiring the camera to the router.  This insures higher video capture rate and no loss of the camera wireless signal and it also eliminates me having to reset the camera settings with the router which meant I had to take the camera down and hardwire it to the router to fix its settings and for the router to find the camera again.  Now,  if your are close to the router with the camera, say 10-15 ft, I think the wireless mode will work fine.  Also the camera has a pan feature which doesnt seem to allow me to program it to pan left to right.  Still trying to work out some bugs.  I am an engineer and I do not feel the settings menu is very user friendly.  I will say if you follow the instructions, you will get the camera to work but the camera settings and menus could use improvement.  You have to go back to original software to modify some important settings and they should have made the settings more menu friendly and user friendly.  I guess at this point, for the money the camera seems decent.  I was dissapointed that Loftek does not have a support phone # to call.  Only email for support.  That is somewhat bogus.  I rate the product as fair.  A wireless camera should be able to have batteries installed to eliminate the 120v hard wired power requirement. But this one doesn't.  and if you have to hard wire the camera to get decent video and a constant connection then whats the point in buying wireless.

The image quality is best when viewing at night. The day viewing is okay, but the color is a little off. The camera works great for me since my primary use is to monitor kids at bedtime and during naps.The setup will require that the camera be hardwired to the network. I am a network engineer by trade so I was able to find my way through the setup, but the non-techie type may want to get a tech savvy friend to assist. This camera will not come out of the box knowing what wireless SSID to connect to and what passphase to use on a secured wireless network. You do have your wireless network secured with WPA2 and a PSK at a minimum, right? Just saying.Once configured, there are three options (modes) for viewing and controlling the camera. The \"best\" option allows for use of a standalone program called IPCMontior that can only be downloaded using Microsoft IE and runs only in Windows. This software will allow for multiple cameras to be accessed if you have purchased more than one camera and gives a wide range of control of the camera, switching between cameras automatically, etc. You can maximize the software to fill your monitor with the image from the camera unlike with any other mode. Like the camera setup, the setup of the IPSMonitor software is not for novices in my opinion. The second viewing mode is a great option for those on other operating systems like Mac OS or if you favor other browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. in Windows or Linux, but the browser must be able to run Java Script. IF this option/mode does run in your browser of choice you get much of the same control as with the software mentioned above, but you must open a separate tab or browser window for each camera using http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where the X's represent the IP assigned during setup. You can adjust resolution, but the highest resolution option is 640x480. The third viewing option is for use with limited function browsers like those found on a smartphone, tablet, or Raspberry Pi. You can view the camera's image and control pan and tilt, but the resolution is limited to 320X240.I would recommend the camera, but you should be tech savvy or have a tech savvy friend assist with setup. You get the \"best\" viewing options when using Windows, but the camera can be viewed using smartphones, tablets, or just about any operating system that will run a browser.

You can also set the camera to pan back and forth on it's own, or just set it to one spot and leave it there.Both the daytime and nighttime clarity of the video feed from the CXS 2200 is very good for a camera in this price-rang. Night viewing is extremely clear and picks up a remarkable amount of detail. The camera itself is decent in size and comes with it's own hardware for mounting it on a wall or another other similar area. You know when the camera is powered up and broadcasting when a green LED light on the front is blinking very quickly. That is something to keep in mind as well, if you're buying this camera with the intention of having it subtly tucked somewhere, not trying to draw attention to it. With the flashing green LED light, it's easy to spot. So you may want to put a small piece of duct-tape or a sticker over it if you don't want the flashing light drawing people's attention.The software is where things can be a little tricky with this camera. Some working knowledge of how your home network works is necessary to be certain you get to enjoy the full use of your IP camera. The software is not necessarily as basic as what some people are use to when setting up a new router in their home. There's a process of working with IP addresses and in addition, you will likely need to log into your home's wireless router and change some of the settings there. Your camera will need access to a port with port-forwarding, and this can be especially tricky for anyone who is not at all familiar with working within their router. However there are some really helpful videos on YouTube for each of the Loftek cameras to help guide you through this process. One way to know if an IP camera is something you can tackle is by going to check out the instruction videos first. Watch the steps and see if you are comfortable with the process of setting the camera up on your home network.One final thing I found was that my installation disk didn't work. I noticed a few others mentioned this as well. It could be that the disk works on some versions of Windows better than others. However you can still get all the software you need from the Loftek website. I downloaded everything I needed from there and was able to get the camera up and running with out too much hassle. I recommend this camera for those who are comfortable with working within your home wireless network and are looking for a camera with very nice video quality, with some great additional features like alerts and the ability to pan your camera.

Many of the complete DVR solutions out there proved to be overkill and extremely expensive, so I decided to build my own.  After researching cameras for quite a while, I found this little jewel for $65.00 and thought I'd give it a shot.Man am I glad I did.  For the money, you'll be hard pressed to find a better value in a wireless IP camera.  There are a few minor issues with the device, but for the money I'm not going to complain.  The camera has many built in features that make it quite powerful.  It has the ability to notify you via email when an alert is triggered.  The email includes several photos snapped when the camera was tripped.  Additionally, if you are tech savvy enough to setup an FTP server, you can configure the camera to upload any alerts to your server so you'll have a log of any events for your review.Pros:  * Very simple setup  * A ton of built in features for the money  * Wifi or Wired use allows for great placement flexibility  * Works well with IP Camera apps on my iphone  * Provides audio and video  * Built in alert system works well  * Excellent field of vision w/pan and tilt  * Surprising night-vision qualityCons:  * Construction feels a bit cheap.  The plastic could be more sturdy  * The web management interface is decent, but really should be improved.  * The users manual and configuration web site were obviously written by someone with a limited grasp of English  * By default, the camera uses a DynamicDNS service provided by the manufacturer in China.  There is no way to disable this \"feature\" without downloading a separate tool from the manufacturer.  I assume that disabled the \"call home\" but without a more detailed analysis of my network traffic I don't know for sure.  It does make me wonder how secure the device is from the manufacturer if it's accessible from the internet.  That said, some people may like this feature, as it does provide essentially a free DDNS service along with the camera.  * In addition to GUI/verbage improvements in the management website, I also feel that there should be greater ability to change the devices settings (IE, device hostname, alert settings, etc)All in all, I am very pleased with this camera.

Video is immediately available when the app starts, very seamless operation.My mother-in-law loved the video so much she insisted I get her another one to use in the bedroom.  The IR LEDs make it perfect to keep an eye on him at night while he is in bed.The alarm feature works great as well.  She had it set to send her emails when he walked in front of the camera so she was nearly immediately notified when he was up and moving around and could easily peek in on him with her smart phone regardless of where she was.

It feels solid to hold and work out of the box.  However, you'll need some computer network experience to setup this IP Camera.  It's not for everyone because a lot of configurations have to be done manually.For example, you'll need to run the BSearch program to reset the default IP address to your home network LAN, preferably a static IP for remote viewing and port number for port forwarding.  I'm very surprise the built in camera server runs flawlessly and work as soon as everything configured.  Wireless signal is adequate for my home.Only one major privacy concern, the default manufacturer DDNS is a serious privacy threat. Even you set the manufacturer default DDNS to empty using the program provided, it still upload your home internet IP with their server in China, which I don't like at all.

Setting up this camera is a pain, especially if you have a network with static IP addresses assigned to your network devices. I wish they would change the default setting to automatically obtain an IP address from the router vs. having a set IP address. The night-vision works well within 10-15 feet. I wish you could disable the IR lights from the camera's settings page, but you can't. I've suggested a firmware update to LOFTEK, but I don't think they're considering an update. I got the feeling that they are focusing on a newer model, which has lower user reviews than this camera. Sometimes I wonder why companies don't focus on improving one product and stick with a great product vs. coming out with a new model that isn't as good.I can't speak to the alarm output or audio output, nor the wireless performance (I use mine with a wired connection...which is always recommended for IP cameras).

That being said, it took me several hours to figure out how to get this camera to work remotely over my Motorola router/modem.The initial setup was fairly easy.  I plugged the network cable into the camera and my router, and almost instantly had the camera up and running.  After that, things got tricky.  I had never set up port forwarding or a virtual network before, which you must do in order for this camera to work outside of your home network.  This is where the rating lost two stars for me:  the instructions were absolutely useless from this point on.  Using my own resources, I was able to set up the port forwarding correctly, but I was still at a loss as to how to access my camera remotely.  Finally, after scouring through endless web pages and wasting an hour or two, I figured it out and had my system up and running successfully.Luckily, once everything was working correctly, I was really pleased with the quality and functionality of this camera.  If you are experienced with IP cameras and don't need detailed instructions, then this would be a fantastic choice.  But if you anticipate needing a little more guidance with your setup, you may want to look elsewhere.ADVICE:  for anyone with a Motorola Surfboard router, my advice to you is to use a range for the port forwarding.

First of all, I must say I was quite impressed with the capability of the CXS 2200. It pans and tilts controlled from my computer, and with the night vision I can see the entire room (baby monitor) even in complete darkness, a little bit creepy, I know. Installing the camera is fast because after the initial setup you don't need the LAN cable anymore. It's completely wireless, other than the power cable. I found a video on youtube specifically for the CXS 2200 explaining the wireless setup, which was pretty easy to follow along with.There's a bunch of stuff on iTunes for remote IP cam viewing, which I plan to download sometime, but for now using it from PC is perfect. To view from elsewhere on the web you will need to setup your router accordingly, and I'm waiting for one of my tech friends to help me with that, because right now I do the viewing my inside my house and maybe would like to watch it from somewhere else in the future.Great buy, and highly recommended.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value For The Price", "Author": "tomwiles \"truckerphoto.com\"", "ReviewID": "RL2AR1XSPZC0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera represents an excellent value giving a tremendous amount of functionality for a very reasonable price. The trade off is that you have to know your way around a router to the point that would make the average person very uncomfortable. My attempt here is to present a step-by-step guide to help people get this camera up and running. The same general principles apply to all IP cameras.Remote IP cameras can be a bit more tricky to set up and access from outside of your home, especially if you have a dynamic IP address on your home Internet connection. Most people fall into the dynamic IP address category. Sometimes your Internet service provider allows customers to pay extra for an unchanging \"static\" IP address.There are generally a couple of different approaches to gaining remote access to an IP camera (or other device for that matter) on a home network with a dynamic (ever changing) IP address. One approach is to have a remote dedicated server. The device - a camera or thermostat inside the home is programmed to know the remote server's address and is able to access your previously-created account information. This is how the Nest Learning Thermostat functions.This setup works fine, but with remote IP cameras there is usually an ongoing annual fee that can range from $100 on up for the ongoing privilege of accessing the camera manufacturer's server.The other alternative is to use a service such as DynDNS.org. One or more devices on your home network, either an IP camera or even a computer is set up to automatically and continually report the home's public IP address. This functionality can also be programmed in to many routers. I am familiar with DynDNS. I set up a DynDNS account which charges a reasonable $20 dollar per year fee for 1 up to a maximum total of 30 separate devices reporting their ever-changing public IP addresses. For each separate device, simply create a unique host name for each one. I have two cameras set up with DynDNS so far, likely with more on the way in the future, so I simply created a unique name for each host address. The resulting URL looks like name.dyndns.org. The second camera has it's own unique name such as name1.dyndns.org. These names are programmed into each specific camera, along with my DynDNS username and password account credentials. Thus, every 60 seconds, each camera calls the DynDNS server and automatically tells it the current public IP address they are connected to.Loftek CSX-2200 WiFi IP CameraSo far, I've set up two identical Loftek CXS-2200 WiFi IP cameras at home, one of them aimed inside the house at a central location, and the other aimed out of a window into the yard, both together giving me a great remote view of what is going on. I can open apps either on my smartphone or my tablets and the images from both cameras automatically pop right up without me having the foggiest idea of what my current public dynamic IP address is at home. I can even monitor sound with the apps or talk back via the cameras if I am using Windows Internet Explorer and have them plugged in to inexpensive self-powered computer speakers. The Loftek CXS-2200 WiFi IP camera sells for $59.99 on Amazon and is an Amazon Prime item. The Loftek CSX-2200 gives tremendous value for a relatively small price.To set up a Loftek CXS-2200 camera, you MUST have access to a Windows computer. With the first Loftek camera, I used Windows XP running inside of VMWare Fusion on a Mac in order to accomplish the initial detection and hardware setup using the included software. With the second Loftek camera, I used Windows XP running on a netbook. You have to run a small program called BSearch_en you either download from the Loftek website or that you load from the included CD-Rom installation disc. The Loftek website vaguely states that you can do the intitial camera setup with a Mac alone, but in my experience you cannot. If you are using a Mac to do the initial camera setup you MUST have a copy of Windows running inside of a virtual machine program such as VMWare Fusion or Parallels.You plug both the Loftek camera and the machine running Windows into your router via Ethernet, and then launch the included BSearch_en.exe program and then click on the button to make it search for the Loftek camera. Follow the instructions included with the BSearch_en.exe program and change the Loftek camera's default internal network address to match your own router's internal address numbering scheme. My internal network address scheme is set up for 192.168.254.x. The default Loftek address is 192.168.0.178. So to make the camera visible on my home network I changed the Loftek camera address to 192.168.254.178 and saved the new address to the unit. The first three sets of numbers MUST match your router's numbering scheme, or the camera WILL NOT be visible on the internal network.When your web browser successfully connects to the camera's built-in web interface, you will be presented with a pop-up dialog box asking for the administrator username and password for the camera. The default username for the Loftek CSX-2200 camera is admin and the default password is 123456. If you change these defaults to something else (or add additional usernames and passwords), then you need to be sure to write down the new username and password and keep them in a safe place so you will have them for later camera access. Incedentally, if you should forget the new username and password or for some other reason want to return the camera to factory default values, there is a recessed reset button on the bottom of the camera that can be pressed with an extended ball point pen or paper clip.You should always leave the camera set up with a static internal network IP address. That way, you always know what its address is. Other devices on your home network that are typically set up to request dynamic internal IP addresses can and do change addresses from time to time when your home router happens to assign them a different address when they reconnect to your home network. Write down the static IP address of the camera so you can know what it is later. This is especially critical if you end up with more than one camera attached to your home network.Once the camera is set up with a static internal network address that's visible on your home network while it's still plugged in via Ethernet, go to any browser on your network and enter 192.168.254.178 (or whatever you set your camera's internal address at) into the address bar and press <ENTER>. This will cause the camera's built-in control page to load. Enter the administrator name admin and the password of 123456 to make the control page display. Once in the control page, you can set many different parameters, including connecting the camera to your home WiFi. In my case, I also set up my cameras to automatically email me a series of images if motion is detected. Automatic emails of images on motion detection can be useful or even fun catching people walking through the frame or even occasional insects flying in front of the camera lens, but it can also be triggered by changing sunlight conditions or wind blowing trees around depending on what the camera is aimed at. This email feature can easily be toggled on and off from an app such as the excellent Tinycam Monitor Pro for Android available in free and paid versions in the Google Play Store on Android. Setting up the email to work properly can be tricky as the settings that you must use for the outgoing email server are determined by the specific email service you are using. You must have two email addresses - the one you are sending the email from, and the email address you are sending it to.The other critical part that MUST be present for remote monitoring to function is port numbers and open ports on your router. There are tens of thousands of port numbers that you can use. In my case, I am using port number 1029 in one camera and 1030 in the second camera. These port numbers are programmed in to the camera's web control page interfaces. In each camera I turned on the UP&P; protocol, which in my case was successful in automatically updating my router to automatically route any external traffic utilizing these specific ports to the correct internal IP addresses. So for example, the camera I have set up on my internal network at 192.168.254.178 automatically receives traffic that is specified for port 1029. The second camera is set with a static internal IP address of 192.168.254.179 and it automatically receives traffic that is specified for port 1030. So, if I am outside of my home network and I type name.dyndns.org:1029 into a browser, I will automatically see the camera's control web interface page open up in the browser. Remember that the word \"name\" in the address must be whatever you have named your DynDNS host.If you cannot get UP&P; to work in your router, you can always go into the settings for your router and set up port forwarding manually. This process will vary from one router to another. Generally, the idea is this: when traffic comes in on your external dynamic IP address with a port number specified such as name.dyndns.org:1029 the router will automatically know to route the traffic to the specific internal network static IP address you type in. That's one reason why you need to write down and remember the IP address you set up for your camera.If you run into problems, chances are good that they revolve around port forwarding not working in your router. I have had one DSL router that port forwarding does NOT work on, even though it seems to allow it by saving my port forwards in its configuration screen. Go to a site such as canyouseeme.org and type in the specific port number you wish to use to see if your router is actually opening up the port that you are specifying for it to forward. If the port is not open after you have set up port forwards within the router, there's a problem with the router not functioning properly and you will likely have to get another one.Once you have gotten your camera working, be sure to write down the various things that you did and parameters that you set, just in case you ever have to set it up again with a different DSL or cable router, or if you wish to add additional cameras.I have plans to add at least one more camera to my setup at home in the near future. This third camera will likely be a Loftek Nexus 543 WiFi outdoor camera, which will enable me to utilize the built-in infrared capability of the camera to illuminate and display a clear image of a completely dark outdoor scene. The second camera I currently have aimed out of a window into my yard will not display infrared illuminated images at night because it is aimed through glass. Nothing shows up but glare.Once the Loftek CSX-2200 is properly set up and visible on the home network, it can be disconnected from the included Ethernet cable and placed anywhere that it can be supplied with AC power that's within the network's WiFi signal range. The built-in infrared LED's that surround the lens have a range of 15 meters and can easily illuminate the image in a totally darkened room. The camera is also motorized and has a rage of 90 degrees horizontal and vertical and 270 degrees from side to side. It can be remotely triggered to pan to predetermined saved positions, or simply pan from left to right and then return to it's initial position. As previously mentioned, once an email account's credentials are properly configured it can send emails automatically to any second email address when it digitally detects motion in the scene it is looking at.Remote IP Camera AccessFor primary remote access via my Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone and my Google Nexus 7 Android tablet, I purchased the pro version of the excellent TinyCam Remote app from the Google Play Android store. To make it work, you simply plug in the appropriate values, including the DynDNS address of your IP camera, the camera's port number, and the camera's username and password. If everything is functioning properly, you can simply open the app to the live view and your camera or cameras (if you have set up more than one) will automatically display. When a particular camera is brought up in full screen mode, you can turn on the audio to monitor the sound as well as the video from the camera.I have yet to find an Android or Apple iOS app that can utilize the microphone function and send audio back to the Loftek CSX-2200 camera. The only thing I have found so far that is capable of sending audio back to the camera's audio out function is accessing it via the Windows Internet Explorer browser with the appropriate browser plug-in installed. This fact is actually stated by the manufacturer and seems to be true.Remote IP Camera RecordingIt is also possible to set up software on a computer and record the camera's video. I am currently using an excellent free program installed on a Mac Mini running Mountain Lion on my home network called IP Camera Viewer 2. It will continuously record video from the camera and analyze it for motion and face detection. It even has a second part of the program that enables the user to quickly scrub through the recorded video to find the action parts, and even has the ability to export just the period of the video you have marked. The program is free in the Mac App Store. In the free configuration, it can record one camera.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pass on this...", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R35GWBQI1E1ZWF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is difficult to use.
