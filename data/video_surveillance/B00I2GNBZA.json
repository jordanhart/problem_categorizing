Not the cas at all. I took the chance and ordered it. Installation was fast and easy, setup for internet viewing was pretty painless. The ONLY reason this system did not get 5 stars is because it does have an issue with the Zsight app for Apple. It would not display but camera 1. Zmodo online tech support could not get it going. Theit phone support rep was rather \"matter of fact\" and not very nice. We found another app called mobiview that worked just fine and problem is solved. The zsight that they recommend works fine on Android. The picture quality of this system is very impressive for an inexpensive 720p system. I have only had it installed a few days, but so far I would recommend it to others.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I2GNBZA"}}
