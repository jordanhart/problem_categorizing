The DVR is very basic and simple to use, however the network and remote access are somewhat complex. Daytime viewing and recording are good but night vision is TERRIBLE That is the biggest reason for only 3 stars. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the 24IR cameras instead of these 12IR. Other than that subsystem is good for the money.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Instand email alert with photo if activity detected\nWhen everyone else is asleep, our cameras are watching closely\n24IR LEDs allow for 65ft automatic night vision.\nThe metal housing is designed for indoors & outdoors use\n500GB hard drive allows for 24/7 recording over 16 days", "Name": "Zmodo 8CH H.264 CCTV Security DVR System with 500gb HDD & 4 CMOS 480TVL 30ft IR Outdoor Surveillance Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513NDFx91iL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008POBS1I"}}
