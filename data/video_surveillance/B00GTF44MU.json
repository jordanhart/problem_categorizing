{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Automatic, Dependable Operation: The DuoCam plugs into the cigarette lighter and automatically records whenever it's plugged in. Power and recording buttons can override automatic operation if you choose. Should the plug become disconnected, battery power takes over, providing two hours of operation on a full charge. Should you run out of power completely, the DuoCam automatically saves recorded files before shutting down.\nHigh-quality Video and Stills: The dual 1,280x480 video cameras record at a user-selected 10, 20, or 30 frames per second, providing detailed images at every setting. A built-in microphone records audio and a five-megapixel still camera captures JPEG images. Documentation of all video is complete with a time and date water stamp on the video footage.\nBacking You Up: In the event of an accident, DuoCam footage will be invaluable. Commercial drivers can limit their liability and possibly save on insurance premiums if video evidence shows they aren't at fault. Private vehicle owners take the same risks, and DuoCam footage could potentially prevent years of raised premiums and out-of-pocket costs. With DuoCam's unbiased testimony, the truth prevails in circumstances that used to rely on hearsay and conjecture.\nNight Vision Capability: Both cameras feature infrared recording technology. Invisible LED lamps provide a light source for night recording, never distracting you, so your focus stays on the road.\nMicroSD and USB 2.0 Compatible: Save your video files in AVI format on 2 - 32 GB capacity MicroSD cards, and transfer them to a computer via either USB 2.0 connection or a MicroSD Card reader.", "Name": "Car Vehicle Dash Cam Dual IR Nightvision DVR for Police Surveillance", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jzhj46oaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GTF44MU"}}
