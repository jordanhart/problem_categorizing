video this camera made of a bear that visits my property. Please keep in mind that the clip was woven together from about a dozen ten second videos taken during two periods on Halloween evening. You'll see our dog suddenly appear where the bear was, but in fact they were not in the same spot at the same time. Combining all the clips into one is more interesting but you will need to be aware of the time stamp at the bottom.Anyway, we love the camera and wish we had half a dozen more. I see there is a rebate right now, so I may go ahead and get another immediately. We have learned so much about all the activity on our property after we lock up the chicken coop, close all the gates, and go inside at night. It's a whole different world out there once it's dark, full of bear, deer, raccoons, and more. We see that our dog and cats stay busy!I will also post some still shots that clearly show the trigger is plenty fast to catch most activity. My only problem is that I am getting shots with no animals in them. I think that's due to the fact that it has been very windy and I have the motion detector set at high. But it's easy enough to change and there are other options. All the controls are easy to use. The unit doesn't run through batteries too quickly. The case closes securely, so I have no current concern about rain getting inside. The temperature sensor has been very helpful, too. The fact that the IR is no glow means that neither animals nor people see the flash when it goes off. I have caught animals as far as 30 feet away although they were silhouetted and not perfectly clear. There is a lot to love about this Bushnell. Take a look at my images and I think you'll agree!", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "You Need to Know - that a Special Down loadable Viewer / Player is Needed .", "Author": "Kathy Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R314XEPSJHYCP7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The File Format is :  EK00008  type Name which Plays on -  ( DivX Player - version 10.0.0 )  etc.I would also Buy the  Metal Lock Box to Protect the Unit or Units  You buy !It seems Customer Service doesn't  Know this or Amazon Support - that - Sell the Item !After Much Testing :  All is Well and the Unit preforms as stated _ It how ever uses a lot of Memory in High Traffic Area's .I would Order a 32 Gig  San Disc  Memory card.

I have another brand of trail cam that has the infrared LEDs and have pictures of deer feeding until the first picture is taken, then the deer are looking directly at the camera. I have never experenced this with the Bushnell HD Black LED trail camera. The night time pictures are a little grainy, but that is to be expected with the lower MPs for night time pictures. Maybe in the future they will have the technology to increase the MPs for night time pictures and video.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unfit for its intended purpose", "Author": "John H. Meyer", "ReviewID": "RWGRPVH27EVA6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is not up to Bushnell's high standards. I will be returning it tomorrow.Problems:1. The motion sensor only triggers at a range of twenty feet or less. I tested this with sensitivity first set to \"Auto,\" and then later to \"High.\" The ambient temperature was 62 degrees; there was a very slight breeze, and the camera was pointed into a level, open clearing. I walked across the field of view at various distances, and was only able to get reliable triggering at fifteen feet. I got no triggering whatsoever beyond twenty feet.This is unacceptable and renders the product useless for its intended purpose. I had been warned by one long-time user of trail cameras that Bushnell cameras are known for poor sensitivity, but I liked the feature set and trusted the Bushnell name and therefore purchased the product anyway.2. The still picture quality is horrible. Bushnell advertises the number of pixels as \"8 megapixels\" but that specification contains an inherent promise that the sensor and lens system can actually resolve details to that level. In fact, it is clear that the sensor is capable of resolving far less detail than that, and all the camera is doing is \"up-resing\" from a cheap, low-pixel sensor.3. The video image is most definitely NOT HD. I am in the video business, and have been taking still photos, movies, and now videos since the 1950s. I know what HD video can look like and work with cameras as varied as prosumer Sony camcorders to cell phones to Hero HD cameras. The video produced by this camera is the worst video I have seen from any source since the original cell phone videos ten years ago.It may be 1280x720, but it is NOT HD!!4. The battery holder does not hold the batteries in place unless you fill it with all eight batteries. If you only use four batteries, any slight bump will cause the batteries to pop out sideways, rendering the camera inoperative.I tried a variety of different battery types, including fresh alkaline and lithium batteries, but that didn't make any difference at all. I also read the entire manual, and changed every relevant menu setting.Update (November 19, 2013):I purchased a Moultrie M-990i. I tested its trigger range in the exact same location as my test with the Bushnell camera. Instead of no triggering beyond 20 feet, the Moultrie triggered to 70 feet and beyond. The only variable, other than the camera that might have affected this was the time of day: the temperature was almost exactly the same, but it was a little earlier in the day, just before noon.The picture quality on the Moultrie in 4MP mode (I haven't yet been able to get a 10 MP picture) is as good (perhaps a little better) than the Bushnell. If I can get the 10MP mode to work, I'm expecting the quality to be better. The Moultrie case is smaller and better camouflaged. The downside to the Moultrie is that it cannot take still pictures as well as video. On the other hand, the Moultrie video is Motion JPEG which means that it is nothing more than a series of independent still photos. Also, the fast multiple photo mode (up to four photos at a time) is almost video speed.One downside: the Moultrie requires eight batteries, whereas the Bushnell can be run with only four. This is not a big deal for me.So for me, the much cheaper Moultrie performs better.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Earl C.", "ReviewID": "R2VI1T0N8XXQEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Bushnell is the perfect trail camera for field or home.

I've been using these cameras (Bushnell Trophy Cam Model 119576C) for several months now and am comfortable providing a somewhat useful review at this point.I use them all in Hybrid Mode;  video and still images together, wide-screen setting.I leave the Sensor Level on Auto.These cameras have helped me solve many mysteries... the first being, the mice who were taking the cheese and cleaning the peanut butter from my traps?  That's right, I set up a Trophy Cam inside a closet in the basement...  placed the traps four feet away... it faithfully provided stills and video of the super smart mouse who was visiting my traps...  observing their behavior helped me better place the traps and also view where the mice were emerging from.  Now, no more mice and great mouse video footage.  So, the sensor triggers even for critters as small as house and deer mice.I leave the shutter speed set to Medium... I've found that this provides nice, pretty darn clear images of moving animals and yes, even birds on occasion.  Turkeys walking through the woods, crows coming to road kill and so on.  Even squirrels running along fallen trees were captured.I changed out the cards from 8 gigs to 16 gigs... lesson learned \"after\" I realized I had missed a great opportunity to video a bear, but the card was full!  Once the data card is full... that's it.  It doesn't cascade date by overwriting the card (would be great if they did).Video and Stills were faithfully recorded in temps as low as -6 deg. F.  as I bumped up the video length to 60 seconds (max allowed) the batteries (12 AA eneloop rechargeable) lasted about 9 weeks.  However, that's because there are a lot of deer traffic, raccoons, possum, fisher cat and turkey all making frequent trips along the trail where I posted the cameras.It's useful to have two, three even better, placed at several angles or stages for maximum coverage of a location.  I find that each camera will add night light to the subject (invisible to us and animals of course) that will enhance the view/lighting... in my video of the black bear, you can see another camera kick on and back light the bear... GREAT enhancement!I also bumped the interval down to 5 seconds (default is 10) to make sure and get maximum coverage of the animals passing through.  Nothing worse than just seeing the tail end of something cool... with no follow-up video.Putting up a post for the cameras, or even a tri-pod (base has thread size perfect for tri-pod mounting) is a mistake, I soon learned that deer and other wildlife pay attention to changes like that.  Placing the cameras on large-diameter trees seems to make them invisible to wild life, even just two feet from the ground.At four feet from the ground, the cameras were picking up movement 40 feet from the camera IN the woods.... My target area is much closer as my intent is to get close, detailed video and stills of wild life.  My prime target distance is circa 10 feet, so the LED control is set to MED.  On High, not only does that use more battery resources, but blows out close up animals.  In the closed, chicken coop and garage where I was videoing mice, the LED power was set to LOW.... for 4 feet from the camera... great results.I leave the resolution setting on 1280 x 720, which is the max size.I use SanDisk Extreme series SD cards.  flawless performance in all weather conditions.Video Sound is left ON and in the absence of wind, is very effective...  hearing animals walking through the leaves, birds singing in early morning, bear breathing, something walking \"behind\" the camera... sound is a huge bonus!ENGRAVE THE CAM;  game/trophy cams are easily stolen... I engrave the exterior of each cam... vibro etcher works nice, and then I rub pigment into the etched plastic surface... no one wants to steal a cam with someone else's name on it!Furthermore, when programming your cam, you can enter a name... I input location info, so that when I'm editing, I know which cam the data came from.  WoodsEast, SthMeadow, MouseCam... and so on... helps when editing from multiple cams.EDITING your data.... Ok, this was a problem for me... I do lots of video and photo editing and use Adobe Premiere Pro for video... top of the line editing program and guess what?  The avi. files from these Trophy Cams are NOT compatible with adobe... and I could not find a plug-in for that.  BUT, the files work in Windows Movie Maker (comes with most Microsoft/Windows computers)... so, minor inconvenience... I \"could\" render the video in Windows Movie Maker and then export it and then... import it to Adobe... but that's just too much of a hassle... I just render the Trophy cam footage with Windows Media and leave it at that.Though the video and images are HD.... these units are really informational rather than a \"creative tool\"... you won't be composing and editing your next indie film with data from a trophy cam.  Nevertheless, you will be informed about all living creatures that pass in front of them, and that's the real joy in owning trophy cams.They are absolutely effective as a witness to all things living around your property and in your cupboards, closets and basements... you can monitor your driveway, storage shed, garage, backyard or anywhere else you may want to know who comes and goes.... live in rural America and want to know who is bashing your mail box off the post?  Put a trophy cam out there and get it all.... who is stealing those spiffy road signs?  Trophy cam... gotcha!Can't beat them for the price... I am completely happy with their performance and would absolutely endorse them to any friend or neighbor.  Designed for hunters, but just as good for wild life observers and people who are just plain curious about what goes on at night or when you're away...", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Takes great daytime photos", "Author": "Trum979 \"Truman\"", "ReviewID": "R36IQLDLMB8B8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several trail cameras and this is one of the best I have tried.

It also was very informative to see the weather changes over the 3+ weeks we had the camera set up--we saw the snow melt, return and melt away again over that time.Day shots/video come out well up to a distance of 25-35'. Night shots at that distance are harder to discern; many times you know a critter is there only because its eye reflects. When they are closer to the camera, the night video and stills are, of course, much better.I used a 32GB SDHC card and 12 Ray-O-Vac alkaline batteries; the battery gauge still shows full strength and just over 1/32 of the card was used to store over 900 pictures and video clips. You can set up each still shot to have time, temp and (I think) moon phase data noted; videos have a time stamp.Be sure to get all the accessories out of the packaging. The manual mentioned a buckle strap to hold the camera in place and various cables that at first I thought I hadn't gotten. Then I rechecked the packaging and saw these items were tucked into the bottom.This is my first experience with a camera \"trap.\" The manual explains the configuration options clearly and it is easy to set the camera up. I'm going to play with the placement to try for better night stills and video (perhaps in exchange for less screen time, as the critters will be closer in). I now wish I'd bought two of these when Amazon ran a deal on them in early March; I definitely will be watching for the next time they go on sale!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not for this Grannie", "Author": "Twegwert", "ReviewID": "R9NE2E7ZCNIT8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had to open this to see how I should use it & it was not what I was thinking it was.

I started out with the Bushnell 8X HD, but was disappointed at the amount of white/blank photos.  I wanted to take 3 burst photos every 10 mins for a prolonged time period, but almost every other photo was white/blank.  Condensation was a huge problem blurring out a great deal of the overnight photo time.  I then purchased the Moultrie i990.  The manufacturer touted the same options as the Bushnell HD, however you could only use one function at the same time and so, I returned to Bushnell and purchased this Trophy Cam HD Max spending only a few dollars more. The Bushnell Trophy Cam HD Max takes beautiful 8MP photos during the day and exceptional night photos thanks to its Hyper Night Vision.  Condensation has not been an issue.  Unless your setting your Trail Cam a great distance from another device that you can view your photos on, don't bother paying the additional money for the color version as it's difficult to see the photos using the LCD viewer.  I have used the Trail Cam to take 3 photos every 10 minutes for 24 hours, 9 days now and it hasn't missed a picture yet.

Disappointed on reliability-longevity.", "Author": "Ken C", "ReviewID": "RADK4NH7X7IPJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the camera exactly 13 months ago, and today it died (despite all obvious resuscitation attempts including the owners manual's instructions).  Until now, it worked pretty well but not great (missed some obvious shots, and pictures weren't as sharp as I hoped).  It has had a very easy life -- never in extreme cold of winter or exposed to heat, but only to take pictures (from a shady tree trunk) of animals that would want to eat from our garden in the growing season -- that is in contrast to how more usual users (hunters in the winter hunting season) would use it, so this camera should have lasted many years.  It had fresh lithium batteries (only a few weeks old) and a quality memory card, so its death is inexplicable -- one night it just stopped taking pictures, and the LCD screen won't even come on in Setup mode.  So I have to rate this camera a single star for the poorest reliability or longevity, and have to caution potential buyers against buying this camera unless they can accept it failing in only a year.

I will never buy these cheap batteries again.. even if they were on sale.I contacted Bushnell and they claim this has never happened before. It was not until today I read a couple of other reviews where this occurred. Neither company is claiming responsibility for their products. I was told that Bushnell would look into this, but I highly doubt it. I filed a return with Amazon and will be sending it back for a full refund.
