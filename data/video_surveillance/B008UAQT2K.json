I found a Security camera review website that recommended Honeywell products.The downside was that instead of 4 cameras, for the same money, I get one camera.  BUT everything worked out of the box.  Easy to read instructions and was able to quickly verify all features worked.  This is more than I can say for other systems I purchased.Would recommend this system to others that want a quality Camera/DVR but don't want to spend the $ of an IP camera system.T", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008UAQT2K"}}
