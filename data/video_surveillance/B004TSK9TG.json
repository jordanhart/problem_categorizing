I do know that most detectors out there are NOT dual sensor....they are mostly only ionization detectors that detect flame.  Remember it's usually not the fire that will kill you, it's the smoke and it's deadly component carbon monoxide that will end your life.  Photoelectric detectors detect these smoke particles and alert you.......ionization types rarely do if it's a slow smoldering fire. If your sleeping, by the time the ionization sensors detect the actual flames, the smoke and the CO will most likely have already gotten to you and you will be dead. That's why it's so VERY VERY important to have a dual-sensor smoke detector.  This item particular item IS a dual sensor that is designed to alert you to both smoldering low-flame fires and high intensity/ rapid flame fires. This detector will protect you 100% from fire related death/injury if used properly and placed correctly in your home.  Remember to replace the battery every time you switch the clock during daylight savings time or any time the detector chirps.  Always look for  a photoelectric/ionization detector and buy one.  Have one in your hallway, in the main living room at the very least and I always like to put one in each room because I am overly cautious.  Also make sure to have a B-C extinguisher on hand near the kitchen to put out kitchen grease fires....the #1 cause of residential structure fires.  Hopefully you can put a small one out, but if you discharge the entire extinguisher and the fire is not out......evacuate the house immediately and make sure you or someone called 911 prior to exiting your home.

The mounting instructions are strange, stating to place the screws at 3 and 9 o'clock.  If you do that, then you can only screw the alarm onto the mounting bracket part way, which makes it seem loose. I would recommend mounting screws at 4 & 10 or 5 & 11, with the mounting bracket's Caution label towards the front. It makes a big difference if the Caution is at the back. There are 3 pairs of holes in the mounting bracket (one pair would have been enough), so be sure to decide on which pair you're going to use. They are close together, and it's easy to mix them up while trying to mark the drilling locations. Experiment before drilling holes. Mounting hardware included (screws and plastic anchors).

I like the fact that the mounting flange and sensor unit are separate pieces.  With my old detector the mounting flange was flimsy and had to be removed from the wall, along with the attached detector, in order to change batteries.The unit is always displayed in promotions with the sensor grill in the 6 o/c position.  I prefer to mount it with the test button in the 6 o/c position in order to facilitate reaching it above a doorway.  I would have thought I would get such a configuration with the screws inserted at the 6 o/c and 12 o/c positions in the wall.  But it doesn't work that way.  Of course, you could always rotate the unit fully clockwise until fully seated and then back it off CCW until it is positioned the way you want it.  But then it would not be very secure and may be close to coming apart.  I have found a way to position the unit so the button is at the 6 o/c position and it is also securely positioned by rotating it fully CW.  A little inconvenient, though.I get three beeps from the unit when I depress the test button, as advertised.  But a  light does not blink every minute, as referenced in the instructions.  When I mentioned this to Customer Service they didn't seem particularly concerned about it.The instructions are impossible to read.  The text is much too small. I was not able to produce suitable copies with my scanner/ printer.  Customer Service suggested I press the CTRL button on my PC while rotating the wheel on my mouse to enlarge the font.  I used another method by utilizing the Enlarge feature on the PDF file.  Then I was able to crop the individual pages by using the MS Snipping Tool on my PC and printing the result. You'd think the company could splurge a little by printing the manual on 2 or 3 pages so everyone could read it.  More inconvenienceI understand there is some confusion regarding the battery situation.  I received Duracell batteries with my detector and the same batteries were recommended in the manual.  There was no reference to Energizer batteries anywhere.  There is no periodic chirping.So I have no blinking light and no periodic chirping.  The unit just sits on the wall like a painting.  How am I to know if it will work better than a painting under emergency situations?Well, before I contacted Customer Service and before I was able to decipher the instructions, I held a charcoal lighter up to the unit (don't try this at home).  No response. I was later informed by Customer Service that this action could render the unit inoperative.  A fire and smoke detector that does recognize a flame. Hmmmm!I later placed a burning, crumpled piece of paper in a bowl and held in up to the detector (don't try this at home either).  I blew out the fire so the smoke would envelope the detector.  After about 1 minute the alarm finally activated.  But the smoke was only a few inches from the detector.  Now I'm wondering just how sensitive this thing is to smoke. So I appear to have a fire and smoke detector that does not respond to fire and marginally responds to smoke if present a few inches away.  How can I be assured that the unit will sound off should it encounter a real emergency situation?  Faith?  I'm not sure that will cut it.  Do I have to burn my house down (don't try this at home either) to conduct a valid test of the system?  Or perhaps I should just burn the detector and listen for a beep before it turns to ashes.I would like to hear more reviews of the product in action (or inaction) during actual emergency situations.  In the meantime I will not deduct rating stars for performance since I have no evidence on how it will work under real fires.  I am deducting one star, however, for the practically useless manual and for the mounting experience listed (above).", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good design at a reasonable price", "Author": "Macman", "ReviewID": "R3LS7IQG60GJS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have a dog that panics at the mere sound of the \"chirps\"  that smoke alarms give off when the battery is low, so the last thing that I need is a smoke alarm that goes off for no good reason.

After no false alarms and seeing the intelligent construction of the unit, I purchased 3 more. After several months of use there have been no problems of any kind. A couple of things that I like: With a simple twist you can take the unit off of its base for easy battery replacement or cleaning. And the batteries themselves are in a pop-out drawer and are easy to replace. As for loudness, I don't understand the reviews which complained that they weren't loud enough. I think they're plenty loud - a very nasty, attention-getting sound and level. If I needed another smoke alarm I'd purchase another of these in a heartbeat.

The batteries (included) go in a little drawer that slides out and are super easy to change, just press down from above the batteries while the drawer is open and they pop right out. There's also an easy to see diagram that show you which direction to put the new batteries in. The twist mount makes it easy to remove the alarm for cleaning (much easier than trying to stand on a ladder with a vacuum cleaner) or changing the batteries if your not comfortable changing them while its mounted to the ceiling. I haven't had a fire, but these alarms went off right away when something in my oven overflowed and started smoking, and the silence feature worked when I pushed it with a broom handle (instructions say it will silence the alarm for 15 minutes).

The actual size of the product is not what's shown on the Amazon description.  The actual size is 5 inches diameter on the dot and the height just about 2 inches.Oddly, the product page has two sets of sizes, and they're both wrong. The \"product specification\" section says Height:9.06 inches; Length:7.31 inches; Width:7.75 inches (all of these are waaaay off). In the \"product description\" it says the unit measures 5.7x5.7x2.8 inches.  Closer, but still wrong.Reason why it's a big deal to me... my previous alarms were 5.5 inches wide. When I remove them, the paint which was underneath the old base will be slightly brighter in color than the rest of the ceiling (since it was screwed on there for many years). I was happy to think the advertised larger 5.7 inches of the new alarm would cover this up so no one would see a \"ring\" of color difference.

The batteries are inserted through a small compartment door which slides open on the side of the units. It takes a tiny bit of force to pull it open but nothing excessive.

I really liked the idea of having interconnected alarms, and the new \"Onelink\" system is pretty nifty. However, smoke alarms have a 10 year lifetime max and carbon monoxide detectors last 7 years max, and First Alert doesn't appear to make a double sensor alarm with onelink (someone correct me if I'm wrong). First Alert does make a dual photoelectric smoke and carbon monoxide detector with onelink that sells for $55 for a two pack. However, I just couldn't stomach paying $55 for something I'm going to have to replace in 7 years, and that doesn't include an ionization detector. So, for now I settled on purchasing these alarms along with separate plug-in carbon monoxide detectors (I like the Kidde's that plug in with battery backup), none of which interconnects, but which cost me $28 each for the smoke alarms which are good for 10 years each, and $25 each for the carbon monoxide detectors (there are cheaper battery-only options available) which are good for 7 years each, and am now set for the forseeable future. I'm hoping there will continue to be innovation in this field that will make devices more interconnected and less expensive before my next upgrade, so there will be fewer either/or choices to make.On this smoke alarm, it looks great, was very easy to install, and comes with clear directions and batteries. The mounting bracket includes a number of different screw slot positions, so there's an excellent chance you can fit it onto the old screws if you're replacing a different smoke alarm. Otherwise screws and drywall anchors are included. Can't comment on the battery life or false alarms yet, but I'm very satisfied and happy to know that I have both sensor types working for me.

Since it is not designed to work 24 hours nobody know what may happen while I am sleeping. I treat my life more than 20 USD, that's why I decided to buy this fire alarm.EXTERIOR: When you open a box you will definitely notice that product is done from high quality materials. I am absolutely sure nobody wants to trust their life to some cheap Chinese copy that why I paid attention how good small parts are done and well fitted.SENSITIVITY: In the instruction it was strongly recommended not to test it with real fire or smoke but I am not that kind of person who will fallow all stupid instruction. How can I trust device which I personally did not test in real life? :D So I installed the alarm and set peace of paper on fire...1) I was expecting that photo element will notice the flames and start alarm but nothing happened during 30 seconds. The fire was located just 30-40 centimeters away from alarm. The first idea which came to my mind: wtf, does it need half of my root to be on fire for activating alarm? That's not what I was expecting...2) Then I tried to place flaming paper in that way, so the smoke will hit the alarm and in 5 sec I headed long-awaited sound of alarm :)Right now I have a doubt: may be the photo element require dark room to detect flames? Once I will have some more free time, I will defiantly make this kind of test and update my review. Right now as a conclusion - the device have good sensitivity for smoke detection but very bad for flame.SOUND LEVEL: The sound is very loud. You can easily get become deaf if you will stay one meter away from this alarm for a long time.INSTALLATION: The installation of alarm is easy. Instead of using screws I personally used double sided sticky tape, which glued to the wall tightly (later when I decided to move alarm a bit higher, I cannot unmount holder from the wall)FALSE ALARM: It is not much time since I installed it, so I can say nothing about amount of false alarms (I do not have any) but it was written that you can easily fix that by cleaning it with regular vacuum cleaner (once per month).", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a valid replacement for the sa302", "Author": "boter_99 \"boter_99\"", "ReviewID": "R31EXFGDW6O4YJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I bought my house 7 years ago, I smoke detectored every bedroom with the sa302cn models.

However, two different days it kept going for 20+ minutes after the shower and I eventually had to get up and take the batteries out, then I put them back in and it was fine.So water vapor sets it off?  That's fair, as long as that's a design to catch smoke and carbon emissions from fire etc.  But having to get out a chair and get up and reset it is annoying.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Smoke detector", "Author": "Newbie", "ReviewID": "R37TLNZJ31ESUU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this item to replace a worn out older smoke detector.

Fantastic! I'll be extra safe. Heck, I'll take 2! One for the main floor of my home, and one for the basement! I am awesome for getting such a great piece of safety equipment!Such were my thoughts for the first 3-4 weeks of having this smoke detector installed.And then...One night a very steamy shower sets off the smoke detector, which is in the hallway outside the bathroom. I chide my husband for his ludicrous amount of steam and scoff that it's not possibly the fault of my precious new smoke detectors (did I mention they have dual sensors? DUAL SENSORS! I'm so safe and awesome). Maybe he shouldn't take such prissy showers!Then I took a shower the next morning. And fearing mockage, I kept the shower a little cool, and secretly opened the window to fan out all the steam I could before opening the bathroom door. I was ready to be smug about the perfection of my smoke detector. Door opens, and BEEEEEEEEEEEEP! The thing goes off. Crap. I swear, take the thing down and put it back up later that day.Next morning I shower, cranky, grumbling about the smoke detector, and while I'm still in the shower with the bathroom door closed, it starts going off. BEEEEEEEEEEEEP! Double crap. The thing's broken and getting worse.Husband is kind and insists that it's probably just defective or a spider crapped on the sensor or something. And, look! We have another one still in its package that we can install, tossing out the \"old\" one. Hooray! Safety returns. I even forget about the smoke detector and don't even feel jumpy during my next shower 2 days later. Then just as I'm lathering the shampoo: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! Holy mother of crap!LESSON: These detectors are VERY sensitive to steam.

This review is based on price and ease of installation and ease of battery replacement.  They were very easy to install.  I had to drill one new hole since the patterns did not match the old units but that takes all of 30 seconds. Be sure to wear safety glasses or you will have drywall dust in your eyes.  The main reason I bought them is because they have the dual sensor which is the only type our local fire department recommends.  They came in the hard to open clam shells.  A four pack in basic cardboard packaging would be a great option.  The battery tray slides out which is not good or bad. just don't bend it and break it off. I suppose you could replace the batteries without un-mounting from the ceiling but why bother. They are very easy to unscrew from the ceiling mount so it will be a snap to replace the batteries.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as described on line", "Author": "frog309", "ReviewID": "R3QPOI6K8AM4MB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Listed as having a remote mute feature.

When I first opened it from its packaging and finished mounting it to the ceiling, it began shaking and canceling into a drop to the floor. This is very unsafe. Not only can it fall on someone's head, but it can't even block for several frames.When it was finally installed, I admit, I felt safe. Using this product, I felt confident that I could parry any fires, and reset the situation anytime. But then I realized this is just one MU. When the time came to put this product to the test, it failed to deliver. My first match was against the Carbon Monoxide that built up in my apartment. Once it got in, there was nothing I could do except cancel my pokes into a Smoke Away, but my options were too limited, I was pressured to death in the corner, and ultimately sent to Losers Hospital because of CO poisoning, which isn't a surprise due to this mediocre Smoke alarm.I later discovered that it can't detect other conditions that frequently occur in my home either, including the intoxicating fumes of my cat's poop, approaching tornadoes, and Kabal. I can only see it working on Noob-level fumes.Overall, I would only recommend this Smoke alarm for casual play, but not to win majors. It has too many losing MUs against common natural conditions to be considered tournament viable.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "Utilizes both ionization and photoelectric smoke sensors for optimal performance\nIntelligent sensing technology reduces non-emergency or nuisance alarms\nOperates on 2 AA batteries (included)\nOptimized sensor performance for the most nuisance-resistant dual sensor alarm on the market", "Name": "First Alert SA320CN Double Sensor Battery-Powered Smoke and Fire Alarm", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417UXyEN7kL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004TSK9TG"}}
