{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Jose Luis", "ReviewID": "RSP6G8RQ0BKKF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The delivery was as per target dates and well packed.  Camera mechanical installation and wiring was relatively easy, although it would be great if the camera had an integrated AC/DC transformer module, so it can be connected directly to the 110Vac home utility.Camera setting and configuration takes some time and you definitively need some network configuration knowledge and intuition because the instructions provided are not that clear.  If you are using it with the wi-fi make sure you have a good signal strength at the installation point, if not you will have some video streaming difficulties.Once you get it going the video signal is awesome, even at night. The pan and tilt function works very good (if you don't have a good signal strength, this could give some problems too).  The Motion Sensor is very sensitive, so you have to play with it for a while to get it tuned.  The email alert feature works very good, but make sure to set the motion sensing to a proper level, so you don't get your inbox flooded.On my android phone I used the \"IP Cam Viewer Basic\" application (its small and free).  It took some try and error to get it configured, but it works very good.  You get full control of the camera on the phone, perfect video feed and can even turn on/off the motion sensor.If you need some tips, write me at jbq266@gmail.com.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice for the Price", "Author": "Peak", "ReviewID": "RR21VH0J1IT14", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took me a little while to get it all configured because I had no idea of what I was doing. I now have it up and running and I couldn't be any happier with it. It has very good real time video during daylight hours and I'm still working on improving night video.
