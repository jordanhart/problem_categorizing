Then hooking up the cables and connecting it to the router was also straight forward. I have had it up and running for a little over a month. My 500gb hard drive filled up completely. I have neighbors very close to me on all sides and am very close to the street. I also have some extremely horrid neighbors which has lead me to have to have it record all night long at times. I can't find a way to only have certain cameras record 24/7 and others only with motion so that uses up extra space. I had to buy a 1tb portable hard drive to transfer files. The included dvr appears to write over old files after it fills up. Has it helped with my horrid neighbor problem? Unfortunately, not. They are all aware of the cameras and they know that they do work but no one cares. I guess I wasn't lucky like some of the reviewers who stated certain people moved etc. Granted, it has only be a little over a month but still - I was very hopeful. I love my place but HATE my neighbors.When transferring your files onto a portable hard drive be aware that it takes forever. It also will have a huge box in the middle of your screen that you cannot minimize which will block your viewing that entire time. It took over 10hrs for me to transfer about a week's worth of files (and not necessarily the files that had the overnight recordings). Granted, could it be my portable hard drive or is it just how long it takes? I don't know.I have noticed an occasional flickering of the cameras - not sure what causes that. For me I feel that the recorded footage is good (but again everything that is being recorded is close). It doesn't seem to pick up animals (or at least rarely) which could be good or bad depending on what you need it to record for. Sometimes a bug flying very close to the cameras will cause it to start to record.All in all not a bad set. I bought them when they were $269.99 on Amazon and for that price I think they are very good.Edit: It has crashed 2 times since when I installed them in April though. I have no clue what caused it to happen each time. There was no problems with my power (electric) nor was there any issues with my internet. Hopefully, this isn't an occurring issue.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst customer service ever, call is sent to India.

Next, I mapped out the locations for my 8 cameras.  Optimally, I wanted one on each corner of my house, one on each side yard, and one on each main doorway.  I took rough estimates of how long each cable would need to be and determined that I needed a couple of 100' BNC - which is soon to be on its way.

The weatherproof feature was extremely important because we have some wicked wind and ice storms here in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Although we are in a wooded area, we often have a problem with hunters trying to trespass, etc. so the 50 foot night vision range gives us extra peace of mind at night. Sometimes are dogs will bark and we simply can't see if it is anything to really worry about. This will help us see if it is just an animal or if we need to call the police. ADT wouldn't work as well for us because it is difficult to get up to our place in a timely fashion. The thieves would likely be gone before they were able to check things out. I like that the cameras are easily visible, letting the potential intruders know that they are being watched. On a more fun side to this, I look forward to catching some of the local black bears that wander through our yard on tape. At a later date we may upgrade to a wireless system, which we prefer, but for now this unit is everything we hoped it would be and we are quite satisfied.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rather good economical video surveillance suite for home or business", "Author": "Jed Shlackman", "ReviewID": "R1BVRF5YMHQHD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Q-See security camera system offers quality imaging and recording at an affordable cost. It comes with 8 cameras and a DVR system that includes a 500 GB hard drive, along with the wiring and mounting to get things set up. This is the first time I've used a system like this, and for a beginner it isn't hard to set up. The video can also be streamed onto the Internet for you to view it from a remote location. The instructions that come with this are OK, the directions could be better for the software streaming capabilities since not everyone is that savvy with computer applications or mobile apps.The daytime recording is clear, as good as non-HD color TV quality, and the night vision is decent too, although the limitations of night vision mean that a person appearing in the video would be hard to identify unless they are relatively close to the camera. Since the cameras are weatherproof you can use them anywhere indoors or outdoors. While these are not wireless or HD, they seem to offer adequate image quality and reliability. A wired connection is actually more secure than wireless, meaning that nothing will interfere with the transmission unless a cable gets cut - wireless can more easily be disrupted. The 500 GB drive for the DVR is able to store a good amount of video data, since the video is TV quality rather than HD - the higher the video quality the more space it would consume.Years ago this type of system would have cost far more than it currently does - making the cost of this security measure more economical now. Q-See offers a variety of security systems, and this one offers features that keep the cost low while including enough cameras and recording space to make this sufficient for many homes and small businesses.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice security cameras", "Author": "sandra villarreal", "ReviewID": "R1JSG99DAM5DYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great pictures & you can set up to do a lot of things with these cameras. great for large houses & large yards.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Could not wait to setup", "Author": "cheryl ward", "ReviewID": "R3TWAXCEFOLOIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was so glad to receive may package it was great. and easy to setup. instructions were easy to read and follow. thanks.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Stream Live Video Directly to a remote MAC or PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android.
