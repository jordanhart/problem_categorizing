Once setup and functioning, it is easy to operate and very effectively allows me to monitor my home while traveling. However, unless you're knowledgeable about IP's, how to establish a website, proxies, etc. you will need to allow a substantial amount of time to educate yourself or find a friend with the necessary understanding and get them to help you set it up.  There was effectively no technical support available to me from Foscam despite my various efforts.  First thing you're told in a recorded message when you call them is that if you purchased the camera from Amazon or another retailer rather than directly from them, they will not help you unless you pay them and let them remotely control your computer.  They did indicate that you could email a specific question to them for assistance, and I did try that but never heard back from them.  Then after trying to follow the somewhat incomplete instructions that came with the camera, I decided I would pay their fee, but was never able to reach a human in order to do that.  Ultimately, I got help from a friend's son who does this sort of work for a living and who guided me through the rest of the setup process.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy Ultra Baby Monitor", "Author": "Bill \"SSgt_USAF\"", "ReviewID": "R1MNGVCFBCA72C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I dont know why there are so many negative reviews on these cameras on Amazon. I know that the company selling these is spamming the reviews but, as you can see, my purchase is verified.I had used a Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor for quite some time and went through 3 cameras and two handsets. I finally gave up and bought these two cameras. If you are using these as baby monitors I would suggest the black version as the white ones have an LED inside of them that lights up pretty bright and can be seen through the white plastic. Here is how I set them up:First I plugged them into power and an ethernet port on my router.Then I logged into my router and saw what IP address they were assigned.I then typed the IP address into firefox (or pale moon for 64bit).I logged into the camer using admin and no password (on firefox and chrome you must use second login button).I then went straight to the devide settings and wireless.I checked wireless check box and clicked scan.I chose my network out of box and typed in my password.I clicked submit and when the camera started to reboot and the network lights came on I unplugged the network cable.I then logged back into the router (actually I still had the page up) and got the new wireless IP address.I logged back into camera and changed password and port to 8090 (8091 on second camera).Repeated all steps for second camera.Setup tinyCam Monitor PRO on my 10 inch android tablet and added camera info for both cameras.All of this took maybe 20 minutes including putting cameras in my childrens rooms.Overall theses cameras have superb pictures compared to any other baby monitor I have seen. For $189 total, including tinycam pro, I have the sweetest baby monitor setup. If oyu follow the setup instructions I gave here you should be able to get this up and running no problem. Also, buy these from either foscam on amazon or from observeye. If oyu buy them elsewhere you will not get the two year warranty.UPDATE: 11/5/2012These cameras still work perfect. They restart every once in a while but always return the position that I set as home. I now use tinyCam PRO on both of our cellphones and on the tablet. Definitely worth the purchase.UPDATE: 12/21/2012The world did not end today!!! Also the cameras are still going strong. They restart a lot less now for some reason. There have not been any changes to our network but tinyCam Monitor PRO has been updated a few times through the Play Store.UPDATE 02/14/2013I had to buy a new wireless router for our house because the old one died. I think that the camera restarting issue was caused by slow network speed on my old router becuase they have not restarted in the last week that I have had the new router. I added entries for the wireless cameras into the new router to assign static ip addresses to them and I used port forwarding to forward port 8090 to the one camera and 8091 to the other camera. I used a DynDns account to keep a hostname associated to my dynamic ip and can now access the cameras from anywhere using the hostname and port number. The router I got was a WNDR3400 V2, I highly recommend this router as it is fast!", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam FI8910W two-pack", "Author": "P.

This time it is different. I gave the system a 3 star rating. The cameras themselves, based on price and performance actually earned 5 stars. The accompanying Foscam software earned 1 star (since 0 stars is not an option) so 3 stars is what I awarded. The Foscam software is garbage. Save yourself a lot of time and effort and use it to initially get the cameras working on your LAN and then forget about it. Purchase Blue Iris and use it. It is awesome, easy to use, intuitive and reliable. It is everything the Foscam software is not.Foscam's Tech. Support is slow and their forums are full of issues, some quite old for the computer age, which are still causing user problems. I did get a response after a couple of days. All they did was ask for a screen shot of my issue with getting the email to work. I configured it exactly the way it was shown in the online guide. I even got an account at the same service as they supposedly use. It didn't work! It appears that the examples on their website are untested. It never did work but with Blue Iris, I got email working in less than 2 minutes after wasting a good part of a day with the Foscam software.There were a lot of errors when try to configure things using Internet Explorer that were remedied by using Firefox. They admit right up front that Internet Explorer is the only browser that will support multiple cameras. I think it is the only one they could configure. Firefox and Google Chrome should be able to do it, too. By the way their multiple cameras set up didn't work for me either. On the camera remote login they don't even know how to sense what browser you are using. It has two login buttons, one for IE and one for the others. That is absurd. It is obvious that their software is not ready for prime time. In summary good cams, bad software, get good software and things will work fine. At least they did for me.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Economical Price", "Author": "Phast Phil \"Phast Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R272C2DEPHS7ZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras and have set one up on my home network.  The other camera is going to another location, which I have not set up yet.My first impressions of the quality and features were very good. Build quality is nice, however not what I would call heavy duty.  For a HOME or Office environment, I think they will work just fine.  IMHO it won't hold up in an industrial environment well.  I'm a certified Network Engineer, so getting this up and running was pretty easy and working it into my home wired and wireless network/router was painless.  But, if you don't have a lot of experience or have a LOT of patience, you might not find this easy.  If the terms PORT FORWARDING, DHCP or Static IP make your palms sweaty, you might find an experienced friend to help.  The supplied 10 page manual, one for Windows and one for MAC, are not translated very well, and you will need to interpret the meaning carefully.  After reading the manual, I still had questions and called their TECH SUPPORT, which 'sounded' like it was forwarded to China (over SKYPE).  The connection was not good, and the technician was not fully fluent in English.  However, I did get my question answered and I moved ahead with my install.  I was up and running in about 10 minutes.Side note: I did NOT want to use the CAMERA TOOL SW they supplied, I wanted the challenge of setting it up on my own.  If you have some experience, let me save you a few head scratches: The FI8910W does NOT have a Static IP address.  You can't just set one.  It pulls an IP from the ROUTER.  You can find the IP address by looking in your router MAC table and matching the WIRED MAC address with your router IP assignment.  Then just plug in that IP of the camera into ur browser and continue the setup (USER/PASSWORD/Resolution etc).  Really Simple.  BTW, Wireless setup was just as easy, just SCAN find ur SSID, provide ur wireless password and pull the LAN cable (it won't support both).  Again, look in the router MAC assignments, and find the WIRELESS MAC address and use your browser to log into the camera.  One piece of advice: If your router allows you to SAVE the IP address locked to the MAC address, I suggest you do that immediately after finding the IP.  This way if you unplug or turn off the camera it will search for a NEW IP address and you might be chasing the camera IP in your router again.  (I saw a lot of Forum comments about this and I could see where this would be frustrating).The Pan and Tilt has one medium speed, but there is a Auto PAN that will continuously PAN the camera if desired.  All P&T; functions are accessible from the main screen.  I was able to control the camera with my iPhone, and the FI8910W was smart enough to lower the screen RES to match the iPhone (vs the higher 640/480 for a desktop).  Picture quality is very good, but there is a LOT of barrel distortion from the very wide angle lens they use.  It does give you a huge horizontal view, which is what you want in a security camera.  I have not tested the IR night vision or the Snap Shot or notification feature yet.  I'll amend this review once I get that working.  I intend to add this camera to my 3 other security cameras in a MAC application by Security Spy (MAC ONLY).  I use iCamViewer which to my surprise supported the Foscam camera perfectly.4 Stars is still a very good rating, but I dropped 1-star for lack of a good manual and confusing warranty/tech support.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dreadful customer service", "Author": "Samben Golden Retrievers", "ReviewID": "R3JX7ICGBJFVVV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Item arrived, appeared to be as described.

The IR reflection from the LED's when on blind the camera (an issue with ALL IR cameras with the LED's positioned around the lens) and the LUX rating of .5 makes this camera return a mostly black image when the IR is turned off.So, again, indoor = acceptable to great, pointed outside = acceptable during the day, worthless at night (without modifications).", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 FPS over wired connection - Tech support did not help", "Author": "Modus Pwnd", "ReviewID": "R2963C7O7H2Q18", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a two pack and each camera performed horribly.

The packaging was very good and the cameras arrived without any damage.  I unpacked one camera  hooked it to may Macintosh network via ethernet cable and set it up according to the directions.  While wired the camera worked perfectly.  It is controlled via a web browser, in my case Safari and Firefox.  Great color and resolution.  Tilt and pan. Turn on and off the IR function.Problem began with setting up the wireless functions.  Before you start you should get the following info about your network: Network name (SSID) , the type of Encryption your network uses and the Share Key (Network Password). A program included on the CD is used to identify the cameras IP address.  This does not work instantly and you may have to wait or rescan it a few times before the IP address comes up.  Be patient.  The problem I had was selecting the correct encryption from the dropbdown menu.  When one selection didn't work I tried the next until I found one that worked.  Once I got the setting correct it work flawlessly.I was going to use the camera in a barn, about 70 feet away from the house, to keep an eye on the animals but the cameras range was too small.  I solved this by putting an Airport Express (802.11n) in the barn to extend the wireless network.  If you can string an ethernet cable to the remote location, you can dispense with the wireless problems and the camera will respond faster.  I may do this in the future. 150 Ft of CAT6 outdoor/direct burial patch cord is only around $60, CAT5 about half as much.The camera has been up and running for 4 days now with no problems.  At night, you can use the IR function to see.Next I will try to set up remote access.Overall I'm pleased with the product.  I'm no IT expert and with a little patience anyone can figure out how to get it up and running", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!!!!", "Author": "Chad P.", "ReviewID": "R1Q8PEOIHT7QS0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish to start by saying that I am not here to bash Foscam, as I think it could be the technology itself that is so frustrating with these cameras.  Here is my story:  I read a lot of great reviews regarding these cameras which is why I chose Foscam.  I also chose Foscam because they were supposed to be compatible with Mac.  A few reviews stated that they were challenging to set up.  I have a degree in Automation technology, and I am quite proficient with computers, so I was not overly concerned about that.  They arrived quickly.  I was quite impressed with the construction, finish, and design.  They seemed to be well built.  I took out the disc and the manual.  I always read and follow the instructions. I inserted the CD, and the manual stated to download the camera IP folder.  This first step did not work.  Also, it was a zip file for the mac, but a standard file for the PC. (Not so fair for mac users).  I do not have zip software on my mac because I do not normally deal with large files.  Anyway, I bought the zip software for $29.00.  I found out later that there was a free trial, but it was too late.  I already purchased the regular version of it.  Anyway, I did not think that this was a big deal if I could get the cameras to work.  So, I tried to open the file again, and it did not work.  I emailed the zip file company, and they stated that they were having difficulty with certain files opening.  Nice.  I called Foscam and they suggested downloading the file directly from their website.  This worked.  OK.  Finally, I got step one over with.  I think I should mention here that when you call Foscam, they always want to access your computer remotely.  OK, this sounds like a REALLY BAD IDEA.  Okay, I then plugged the camera into my router and proceeded to try to understand all of the steps.  I finally got it to work while plugged in.  After quite a bit of time, I got it to work wirelessly in the house.  I thought I was going to be home free.  I could not get the audio to work, but everything else seemed to be working fine.  Well, The next step is to be able to view the camera from a remote location by typing in a web address.  This involved too many steps to go into here.  It is like a crazy puzzle that you just cannot solve.  I tried to use the website that they suggested in order to obtain an address.  The port forwarding is a nightmare.  I followed the manual, the videos, etc. and I could never get them to work.  I thought that perhaps my cable company was blocking ports.  I called them, and they were not blocking the ports that I was trying to use.  I cannot stress how much time all of this took.  I want to say that I was using all of my spare time for about a week to try and get these things to work.  I do NOT like to give up, but this time I did.  I thought about a certain movie, a rap song, an open field, and a baseball bat (if you know what I mean).  But then I calmed down, and gently placed them neatly into their little boxes and sent them back to Amazon.  I REALLY wanted these to work!!  I do not think that these are for the average consumer.  I believe the community college could teach an entire class on this subject.  I realized later that most of the positive reviews I read were from people who did not view the cameras remotely.  Many of them just wanted to see their kids in the next room.  Also, the only audio that I found to work was an app on my ipod touch.  That actually worked well.  Foscam emailed me and told me that the audio is not compatible with a mac.  They stated that you have to use other software for it.  I tried, and could not get it to work on my mac book pro.This camera would be fine for those who A) Have unlimited patience.  B)  Only want to use them within the household, and not view them remotely.  C) Have excellent skills in advanced routing, surveillance cameras, web hosting, etc.Again, I am not here to bash.  I am just being honest.  I have never been so frustrated with a piece of equipment in my whole life.  I think perhaps this is a technology that is not quite perfected yet.  I hope that they will do so in the future so I can try again.

I cannot return them, I'm over the return period. NOTE: I've been an Amazon member and have spent \"thousands of dollars\" actually I'm a Prime Member. I'm simply taking an educated guess here, however it seems Amazon has come to be perhaps too big. The quality, descriptions, etc. in my experience for the past six months with regard to their \"Product Descriptions\" has been remarkably inaccurate.I've never written a review before, however with regard to these cameras I can't simply let this slide. The actual night I purchased these the header for the ad stated they were \"Indoor/Outdoor\" which I kept questioning, but took them for their word. Within literally hours of my purchase the \"Indoor/Outdoor\" had disappeared from the ad? I did email the seller regarding this fluke although to no surprise I did not receive a response. I was trying to simply avoid the problem before it started. Having not heard back from the seller I actually and stupidly did not attempt to install them until just a couple days ago. Too late.What I can share with you. These do not appear to be \"Indoor/Outdoor\" cameras what so ever. In my opinion after having to call tech support especially after reading all the glowing reviews with regard to how \"Helpful\" they are I've come to believe this is a huge, naturally profit driven set of individuals who are obviously being paid per call, per sale with regard to support. I have chosen not to name the support individual who answered my call after 40 minutes of wait time last night as I don't aspire to embarrass him in particular. However it was clear to this man this was about selling more cameras and obtaining glowing reviews. After this individual who I could not understand but maybe every 4th word finished the remote set up, he actually asked in a somewhat expectant manner for me to open my Amazon account. I had to ask him \"what did you just say\" as I just could not believe he was requiring me to open up my Amazon account to him. When I asked why, he indicated this was for me to write him a good review. When he caught onto the idea I knew what he was up to he backed right off indicating that \"most people on Amazon don't know how to write reviews so he was simply helping me\" C'mon, I wasn't born yesterday and spent 33 years in sales. This call was a few minutes of totally unexplained support, 45 seconds of attempting to get into my Amazon account, another 45 seconds of making me aware to buy any additional Foscam cameras from him as he would furnish me a discount, and another 30 seconds of making sure I wrote a review mentioning his name in particular. In my opinion this is a very well put together team of salespeople first, and tech support the vehicle being utilized to furnish so many glowing reviews subsequently selling more cameras. I was wary of the glowing reviews, along with the changing description. And I will say it's my opinion this is a fairly well oiled machine sadly pushing a substandard product.As for the cameras, the set up, the ability to get out of them what you want, be very careful. Its apparent to me now all these are really going to do is allow you to open the icon that is labelled \"IP Camera Tool\" The tool makes you click on an IP address which opens another window for you to see the image the camera is pointed at. Control of the camera is very slow, you are not going to follow a deer running across your yard. I've not really found nor explored how one would go about writing all this to some type of storage, it may have that capacity, however you had better be an IT person. In the rushed set up via tech support you are explained nothing, and understanding the individual I had was impossible therefore I just let him go about his business. Sadly nothing what so ever is explained, nor are you offered any explanation as to why, what, or how. Therefore, providing you simply want to sit at your computer and view a remote image is what your goal is, then purchase one. Other than that I do believe you will find this to be a very accurate review.NOTE: I blame Amazon as much as the team put together to forcefully sell as many of these units as possible. Amazon is perhaps come to be too large a company to review the practices of their sellers. These people are not interested so much in customer satisfaction, but far more in how many units sold. I hope this review is not taken down, or somehow disappears as I think its just as important for the buyer to be aware of the company behind the product as well as the product.

My elderly father lives with me and I need to keep an eye on him.  Shipping was fast. Boxes were in perfect shape. These cameras are unnecessarily large. The circuit board is housed in the base that seems like it can be half the size.  The mounts are made from plastic and have to be large to accommodate the large camera. The construction is all plastic. Now to the set up... The power adapters are only 6ft long, so be prepared to run extension cords or buy the extension cables. If you are installing more than one of these, it is best you configure them before installing them. One by one, I connected each to my network via Ethernet and made all the configurations via web console. You will create a user account, name the camera and set up a ton of other stuff like email notifications, brightness etc. You will join them to your wifi via the web console as well.  There are 2 separate firmware updates that need to be done, one for the camera itself, the other for the web console.  The cameras will reboot after each update. When they connect to your network, you have to use this really silly IP Camera utility to see their IP's and MAC address. The tool constantly refreshes and rearranges the list of cameras.  This was frustrating for setting up 8.  There is a way to configure up to 9 cameras at a time, but I saw that later.  You will need to be familiar with your router and setting up port forwarding if you want to see the video over the internet. I also recommend creating DHCP reservations for each camera, that way if the camera is rebooted it will come back online using the same IP. I purchased the Blue Iris software which basically turns your pc into a web server. If you are installing more than one of these I highly recommend the Blue Iris software, since you only need to set up port forwarding once for the software only.  My gripe with these cameras is that they constantly drop signal.  They will drop signal and randomly come back online. I even replaced my wireless router with an ASUS RT-AC66U which was a major upgrade in signals for all my other wifi devices.  I just purchased the 9dbi foscam antennas to replace the current ones, hopefully that works. The other gripe is that the IR is really loud, it makes a loud click when it switches back and forth between normal and IR.  These are one of those products that you just don't know how it will turn out until you actually complete the entire install, and at that point you have invested so much time...", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Foscam support", "Author": "Brian Overstreet", "ReviewID": "RNJY3LSZERHZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Calvin on the Foscam Tech Support line was very helpful is getting my cameras connected wirelessly and remotely.

I'm using both as security cameras on opposite sides of my house.  I have them fixed to the wall at the edge of the window looking out the window at an angle.  The included mounting bracket is sturdy and excellent for positioning the camera inside looking out a window.  I also like the retractable ethernet cable that comes with the device.  I didn't need it but I'll sure use that for other projects and is handy to have.  :-)Software was straightforward and if you've set up other IP cameras in the past, this one will be similar.  WiFi range seems good.  The cameras have very good color during day but my one complaint (and reason for only 4 stars) is that there's a gotcha with the IR LED's.  You can turn them off but they default to on when the camera reboots so if there's a power outage and they are not on a UPS, you'll have trouble if you want them off permanently (as I do shooting out a window).  Even if you turn them off after boot, at night the low light capabilities are pretty poor because with the IR LED's shut off, the camera stays in daytime mode and won't switch to night vision (B/W) mode.The solution for me was to cut a ring of foil tape and cover the IR LED's making sure not to cover the light sensor at the top.  Doing that and leaving the IR turned ON in the software ensures that the camera switches to night vision mode but the LED's don't blind the camera from window reflections.  With the foil tape in place, the camera switches to B/W IR mode at night which is much more sensitive even without the LED's turned on.  It means you can get usable footage when your outdoor spot or patio light comes on.  Sort of like \"moonlight\" mode on other cameras.  I was surprised to see that it appears this device has a retractable IR filter.  So during the day you get beautiful accurate color and when it switches to night mode via the light sensor, the IR filter retracts and you get the ghostly irradiated B/W image we are all used to with night vision (even with the IR LED's covered up).  All my other IR capable cameras have no IR filter so during the day they give a horrible purple image.  Not this camera: seems to have the best of both worlds!One \"glitch\" I found in the firmware was that if you try to access the streaming video from more than one device at a time, the WebUI sometimes \"hangs\" and you have to unplug power to get it back.  The camera is still visible with the included software: you just can't get to the WebUI because the multi-user access has somehow locked it up.  Not much of a concern since you can avoid that.  I do have the latest firmware as of this date (April 19, 2014).Finally, I didn't try the included motion detection and alert parts of the software because I use BlueIris for that.  These cameras work nicely with BlueIris.  Overall I'm quite impressed for the money as some of my other IP cameras that cost 3x as much do less.  The tilt and pan options are good and have a very wide range.  Only complaint on that is if you set a preset spot and then \"Go\" to that spot from the left, it returns to a slightly different horizontal position than if you start from the right.  This is because there seems to be several degrees of \"slop\" in the horizontal movement.If the firmware is ever upgraded to allow permanent \"off\" for the IR LED's while STILL allowing the camera to go into night/moonlight mode at night, this camera would be a grand slam 5 star device!Mike", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, decent survellance cameras", "Author": "lelams3c", "ReviewID": "R2XKM5CTT2JFQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These foscam cameras did their job by providing me good access to view my home when I am at work.

Two of these cameras were cheaper than one Astak, so I opted for the two-pack.  The video quality is definitely superior to the Astak, but the Foscam's embedded software (web interface) is very disappointing.  I could not recommend this to anyone who is not familiar with basic TCP/IP networking settings and configuring a wireless router.  The Astak's automated set-up and embedded browser are much better.  The Foscam IE ActiveX plug-in will not install (on my 3 computers) on Win7 x64 SP1 with IE9, or any of my family members' computers with various flavors of Win7.  The server push mode does work for Chrome, and if you install the VLC plug-in, it even works with audio.I primarily view/control the camera on my Android phone, and my wife on her iPhone, and we have both found that IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chau is a must-have.

I could only view both from IE. If I want to activate the alarms I had to log into both browsers but had decreased functionality through Firefox. It is probably due to how the tech helped set it up. If you are hoping to view your cams from a work computer make sure that your work doesn't care if you have to place their computer systems security in jeopardy because you have to enable some pretty risky internet setting to do this.So I wake up today to find that all of my original setting were gone and one cam will not respond. I am sure if you were a extremely tech savvy person you might be ok, but even then I think it would be challenging.

I am an IT professional and everything needing to be done in the camera software and router took at least 5 hours.  Secondly, I can view the cameras remotely via wi-fi from my iPad while on my wi-fi network, and also from my Iphone 4s from anywhere.  However, when I try to log in from work, i get an error message stating that the website refused to show it's webpage.  Now remember, I am looking at the page, while at work from my Iphone when I try to connect via my work computer.  The next issue I have is when I attempt to pan with the camera via my devices remotely....The software/webpage will only allow me to use the auto-pan feature, for lack of better words.  I have to stop the camera manually by selecting the stop button from the website.  This is a pain, because of the size of the Iphone 4s screen size.  You have to increase the screen size to be able to select the option to stop the camera from pan mode, but you have to be able to make sure that the camera is pointing at what you want to see, but you can't because it is too small.  Additionally, attempting to change the default location of the motion detection recording location has not worked.  The software won't allow me to make a permanent change.  As soon as you try to change the location an error message pops up.  Something to the affect of illegal parameter or something.  Also, how in the world do you change the admin password and account name?  Anyone who works in IT Security will tell you that you want to rename your admin user account and change from the default password.  I mean, really?  Foscam has about 50 default usernames and passwords for different makes and models of routers on their website to help during installation.So, in closing, I like the cameras themselves a lot, however, the software sucks and needs to be upgraded quick, fast and in a hurry or they will lose customers, which includes me!Oh, don't let me forget, that in order to view your camera remotely, you have to create an account with a company that does DNS hosting, who gets enough information from you to be able to hack your LAN....Just seems ironic to me that this company, Foscam, a Hong Kong based company, won't let you change the admin account username, change the password, and suggests that we use a DNS hosting service for access to our home PCs.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cameras & Tech Support", "Author": "Robert L.

Ok, not really the camera itself, 'cause it really is great. But it took me about 12 hours (with a few breaks, and taking care of my kid) to get it all set up and working on my computer, making it wireless wasn't really that hard, but oh freaking boy did I have trouble getting it on my android app! I watched 2 youtube videos as well as read half the reviews on here that explain how to do everything, but it's just so super hard if they don't have the same systems that you do! And then when whatever they did works for them (on youtube), but doesn't work for you and they don't say \"if that didn't work for you, here's what to do...\", it's that much harder! I finally managed to get it to work on my android app (IP Cam Viewer Pro) so I got to use it as a baby monitor last night (worked flawlessly), but I can only view it inside my home network. I have probably another 12 hours worth of work trying to figure out how to make it work on 3/4G and other wireless networks! I did so much \"bs-ing\" yesterday that I know I'm going to have just as much trouble setting up my second camera!Aside from the million issues I had with setting it up, it is a pretty good camera. Mine is about a second behind real time, which isn't really that big of an issue, don't know if there's anything I can do to fix that. The Pan/tilt is awesome, has a very wide range which is great when you have a very active toddler! The audio is pretty good, but the 2 way (us talking through the camera into the room) is sooo quiet. If we want anyone in that room to hear us, we have to shout...which makes it pointless at home 'cause we live in an apartment and can be heard shouting without the camera.I haven't been able to figure out a bunch of things though, the instructions don't say anything about setting up all the extra features such as preset positions, recording when motion is detected, how to get the videos sent to your email, all that kind of stuff. I've found where I'm supposed to dink around with all that stuff, but haven't gotten anything to really happen. So I'm with practically everyone else on this. If you don't have much experience with computers, you either need to have A LOT of patience, or a friend to help/do it for you. I'm normally able to bs things fairly easily, so I didn't think I would have so many problems with this. If that's your attitude, get over it right now, 'cause this camera will have you pulling out your hair and (probably more so if you're a girl), wanting to cry because you're so frustrated :)I was on the verge of tears multiple times.
