{"Reviews": [{"Title": "5\" Mini DVR", "Author": "Cao", "ReviewID": "R1WBZPQS02LGCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these units. It's fairly easy to use, with simple drop down menus. It comes with wires for direct recoding off security and/or low light cameras. My only complaint is that while it displays video from a black and white camera, it cannot record video using the supplied cable for black and white cameras. It can record video from black and white cameras using the wireless function, which means you need a wireless transmitter or a camera that transmits wireless signals.  This issue doesn't affect color recordings, only black and white recordings. Apparently there is a manufacturing or software bug that needs fixing. Otherwise this is a nice unit.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GEYK6TG"}}
