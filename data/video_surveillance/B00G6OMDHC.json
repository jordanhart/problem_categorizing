The lower priced spy pens are crap. Video quality is spotty and they sometimes work, sometimes dont. I found the video quality on this pen to be really great and  I found it easy to use. The instruction manual was very easy to follow (I've received a few spy pens with manuals that were literally written in chinese). All in all, great value and a great spy pen.

I needed a high quality audio and video recorder 'spy device' for this youtube series I had planned out. I didn't just want a prop though, I wanted to incorporate clips from the camera. I got this pen straight from their website (gadgetshack.com I think) and It was a dream working with their customer service. I wasn't expecting much, but the video on this thing rivals a smartphone. Most importantly though, the audio is nice and clear. I needed good audio more than anything else and this pen really delivered. I can hear myself talking clearly, but even though my pen is in my pocket its not disproportionately loud to what I'm trying to recordHere are some stuff I noticed while using it...- it comes with a 8gb micro sd card for storing data. I had a 32 micro laying around from an old phone and I can store a stupid amount of data on my pen now, and pop it in my phone to look at the pictures or videos.- the pen works!- everything is timestamped, you can modify the date and time too (a big plus for my spy movie, it takes place in the past)for video: its in 720p. this is acceptable for me, as its a high enough quality to make out license plates and things in the right light, but not so high of a resolution to take up a ton of space on the memory card.theres a motion detection mode I only just learned how to use... it detects motion in front of the camera and starts recording. This actually works pretty well, I stuck my pen in a flower pot and walked by it and lo and behold, I got an hd video of my feetthe camera is a little harder to use for me, but I didn't need the camera function anyway.truly an awesome product!", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Think twice.", "Author": "Hookdriver", "ReviewID": "R2JDUII8YL90I6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First one the ink did not work.

Hoiem", "ReviewID": "R2LK4HJ4WIJIJI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On the plus side, the quality of video and audio recordings is good for such a small device.  Also, the device easily passes for (and functions as) a pen, so it could be used for discrete recordings.On the negative side, I had hoped to use the motion-activated recording mode to station the device and record whenever something moves in it's field of vision, but the battery life is too short.  For example, I thought you could make it face a cat door and record video whenever the cat comes in and out.  The problem is that the battery dies in ~1.5 hours whether or not any motion is detected.  I thought that it would record for 1.5 hours and not use much battery in between recordings.I am returning it.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "wish battery life was longer.", "Author": "Sherri Degler", "ReviewID": "R1JBCKUY85576P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It works ok, but sometimes it shuts off after I turn it on.

The video quality is on-par with my iPhone 4 and it was super easy to setup, use and then download the videos to my laptop (the instructions were well written). The coolest feature for me is the motion detection feature. You can set it to record only when it detects motion, it saves a lot of battery power and lets you leave the video pen unattended while it can still record.

That said, I've successful ran a few black bag jobs, capturing some serious high-res intel in the process. It's one button operation makes it pretty easy to use, which is key when I'm in the field. The LED feedback is useful, but once you get the hang of it, covering it with a little black tape will ensure that you're not outed.
