I know that just about all the systems in this price range the night vision is poor. I went in knowing I will have to get better cameras down the road. The day time video quality is great for what I payed. I have to make some more adj. to see if I can get it better quality for night vision. Very easy to use and get set up. I have not tried to get it on the internet yet. The cables are just about right for my size house. I would of given it a 5 but the night vision is just ok. I am very happy with my purchase so far. It has only been running for about 4 days now. Oh I had to call customer service and the were very helpful.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$225.99", "Features": "View Video Online with No Service Fees - View your DVR's live or recorded video footage on any PC.\nLong time recording: - Base on the H.264 Compression, maximize the hard drive's recording time, as well as transfer video for viewing over the internet.\nNetwork Remote Access - Access live video footage directly from your mobile phone or PC anytime anywhere\nAdvanced Motion Detection Recording - This allows you record only when motion is detected.\nProfessional Grade Weather Resistant Sony CCD Cameras - See in the Dark with Automatic Night Vision.", "Name": "ZMODO 8CH CCTV Surveillance System with 4 Sony CCD 65ft Night Vision Outdoor Security Cameras-500GB HD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EJn-kuzdL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0094EFODQ"}}
