{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal, but Not as Refined as Foscam - Makes Logitech a Joke", "Author": "Kaio", "ReviewID": "R3KA3ZEH7IMEA7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've been upgrading our security system from Logitech cams to IP cams, and let me tell ya, the difference is stark.  Logitech's security cams have always been wonky, but now with the addition of these new IP cams, Logitech's shortcomings have become stark.  Do yourself a favor, and get these IP cams instead.> Foscam vs TenvisThis Tenvis looks to be identical to this older Foscam FI8918W.  Tenvis performs just as well as this old model Foscam, but has a slightly narrower Pan & Tilt range:Tenvis: Horizontal 270\u00b0; Vertical 90\u00b0Foscam: Horizontal 270\u00b0; Vertical 120\u00b0That 30\u00b0 difference in the vertical lens movement can be a big deal, depending on the environment where you're using the cams. A little extra coverage is never a bad thing.> User InterfaceTenvis just doesn't even come close to Foscam in this department.  Foscam is much more refined, pleasing to the eye and just downright easier to use.  Tenvis, by contrast, appears much cruder and rudimentary.  The UI is loaded onto each cam itself, so all you need is a web browser to view all the options.  Tenvis basically has the same features, but just not laid out as nicely as Foscam.> No IR LED ControlOne stunning omission with the Tenvis' functionality, is that you can NOT turn off the infra red LEDs manually.  This is important, because IR LEDs will NOT work through glass. Even though IR isn't visible to the naked eye, the cam certainly sees it, and if you try to place this in a window looking outside, all the cam sees is a white spotlight reflecting off the glass.  So in that instance, turning off the LEDs would be helpful.  Also, there's some cam locations that have plenty of light, even at night, so turning off the LEDs would help make the cam more stealth.  As it is, this is just not possible with Tenvis.> PerformanceThe wireless range doesn't appear to be as good with Tenvis compared to Foscam.  However, adding a longer external antenna seemed to help the issue. I got this one: WIFI 10 dBi 2.4GHz Antenna and they work quite well.  About 3.5x longer than the antenna that came with this Tenvis.  Definitely worthwhile.> ValueWe got this Tenvis for about half the cost of the new Foscam FI8916W - New Housing.  At that price, we just couldn't pass up on adding another cam to our system.  This cam is excellent for the money, but Foscam is better constructed, IMO.  This one just feels a bit cheap by comparison.  However, once it's mounted, none of that really matters, since it functions just fine.> Not As Many PTZ PresetsFoscam has 8, Tenvis has 6.  No stark difference, but certainly worth noting.> Works With Blue Iris SoftwareWe recently upgraded our software to Foscam Blue Iris Professional, and let me tell ya, it's fantastic.  Puts Logitech to shame for sure. Blue Iris works with almost every webcam, USB cam, and IP cam on the market.  Setting up this Tenvis on it was quick and seamless.**Note** - You can use EITHER Foscam or Tenvis settings for this cam.  Both work.  Just good to know, in case some unknown conflict arises.> Picture QualityThe images from the cam look fantastic. Seems to be on par with Foscam in this dept.  Nice, crystal clear images, and very detailed. Almost looks HD, even though it's the old standard of 640x480.> Pan & TiltTenvis isn't as smooth as Foscam with the pan and tilt movement.  The motor works fine, but the images can be a bit jerky.  This might be related to wireless range.  Nothing terrible, but worth noting.> Iffy Mounting BracketBy far, Tenvis is inferior to Foscam in this dept.  Their mount just feels cheap by comparison, and like it could easily break if you over-tighten your screws.  Plus, the angle adjustment knobs just don't stay in place as nicely, or clamp down as tight as Foscam's mounting bracket.  If you bump your Tenvis, or don't handle it gingerly, the bracket moves from where you've set it and you have to make readjustments.> Loud PTZ MotorIf you're planning on recording audio from this Tenvis, be aware that the mic picks up the PTZ motor while it's moving.  When the PTZ motor stops, you can hear audio just fine.  But once that motor kicks in again, you won't hear much, other than that PTZ motor whirring quite loudly into the mic.> SetupYou'll need some knowledge of IP addresses and basic routing, but nothing difficult.  A few paragraphs of reading at most.  Very easy to setup and get going.  Mine was up and running within 15 minutes.  Granted, it was another day or 2 of tinkering to refine everything exactly how I want it, but the initial setup took no time at all.  I didn't even read the enclosed material; just jumped right in and got it all setup in a snap.Bottom Line -- This is a fantastic IP cam for the money, but the user interface isn't as user friendly as Foscam.  If I need another budget cam, I'd definitely get another Tenvis.  However, if there's a deal to be had on Foscam, I'd pick that one over Tenvis for sure.  We're quite happy with our Tenvis, particularly at the price we got it for.  Hands-down it kicks Logiteh's arse; very nice to finally be dumping WiLife.  Happy! ;oD", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great price and easy to set up", "Author": "TouchScreen", "ReviewID": "R2YO47VMOPQ2W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This might be the first review on Amazon of the Tenvis JPT3815W. I originally wanted to go with the Foscam since it was the most popular of the same type of IP camera, but decided to take a chance with the Tenvis. The little booklet manual was easy to follow and has good illustrations and photos. Set it up first with the ethernet cable before attempting wireless setup. The software auto-detects your network and puts the camera in the same IP address range. I got it all working and was viewing over the LAN in under a half-hour. With some port-forwarding knowledge, you can set the camera up for remote view on your smartphone, which I did with the excellent Android phone app, TinyCam Monitor Pro. Picture quality is good and focus can be manually adjusted by turning the ring around and night-vision works very well.When operating, a green LED flashes continuously but unfortunately there is no way to turn it off in the software and hopefully the manufacturer will have a fix for it sometime in the near future.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works, but buggy", "Author": "Stuart WL", "ReviewID": "R3HFHHQQFWERGQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the TENVIS after previously ordering a Foscam and finding it DOA.  The TENVIS is basically a cheaper version of the Foscam.  There are several things I like about it, and a few things that knocked off some stars.Pros1.  Super easy to set up. I plugged it in to my router and within minutes I was able to stream video over my home network.2.  Night vision - we use it as a baby monitor when we want to \"look in\" on him sleeping.  The picture is bright and clear on the video.  In his room, you can barely see the IR LEDs.  The room stays nice and dark.3.  When you log in and select iPad, the controls are very limited, so I tried selecting \"non IE browser\" and it works great on the iPad!  Full control, brightness, panning, everything.Cons1.  The English translations are terrible.  For example, there is a green LED on the front of the camera.  In the menu, you can set it to \"Open\" \"Close\" or \"Flicker\".  (Actually: On, Off, Blink.).  Another example are the controls to allow you to speak to your computer and hear it out the camera, and speak to the camera and hear it on the computer (this only works under IE).  The controls are labeled \"Speak to Camera\" and \"Voice to Camera\".  Which one is which????2.  The camera seems to crash IE quite often (Windows 7, IE 9 and 10) but is rock-solid on Firefox and Safari/iPad3.  Camera often resets itself at night and will end up pointing in another direction.  The solution for us was the create a \"preset\" with the camera pointing at the crib, then set it up that after a reset the camera would automatically go to the preset.4.  NO VIDEO RECORDING - even though it's SUPPOSED to record video, there is a bug known to the manufacturer the prevents it working correctly with Windows Vista/7/8.  I don't have XP on anything, so I can't test that, but the TENVIS website indicates lots of people having trouble with the video recording under Vista/7/8 and TENVIS reporting that they are working on a fix.  As of July 2, 2013, this was not fixed yet.So, the camera is ok. It works, was easy to set up, and does the job, but it still has some semi-serious flaws.

While the setup can be challenging, the Tenvis technical support was very prompt!  This product allows me to monitor my house (and pets) where ever I may be through either 3G access from my smartphone (either android or iphone)  or internet access.  The Pan and Tilt functionality of this camera allows me to monitor my entire living room with just one camera.  Therefore, I'm able to sit at work and scan my living room to make sure my everything is ok.  Also, it has 2 way audio where I can hear what's happening at home and also talk through the camera.  You can also record through the camera (to your pc) and take \"snapshots\" of moments in time.  I've looked at other surveillance systems and for the price of just one camera, this could not be beat.  You can add up to 9 cameras and monitor your entire house.  There is also an \"alarm\" function that will email you if there is \"motion\" in front of the camera.  It takes \"snapshots\" of the motion and includes them in the email.  This amazes me for the $60 price range.  To get the most functionality out of the camera remotely, you must use Internet Explorer, but you do have limited functionality from other web browsers.  The \"smartphone\" functionality is much more limited than using a web browser, but to be able to view your house through your phone is pretty impressive.  I've just ordered two more cameras for my house which is still \"cheaper\" than many of the other surveillance systems I've seen that ultimately have fewer bells and whistles.

We could not access the camera via Android phone outside of the house, which is really the feature we were looking for when we purchased. No matter what we did or procedure we followed, the camera was not accessible outside the home.Also, the motion detection feature sent us hundreds of emails even when there was no motion (camera facing a blank wall). When you're away and have no way of turning the motion detect feature off your email inbox can get very full.Too bad, in theory this camera is a great idea but comes up very short. Once refined and tested this will be a great camera. Until all advertised features are tested and bugs worked out I would not recommend this product at all.I ordered this with guarded skepticism but we are very happy with it. The camera arrived today and we were up and running (hard wired) in about 30 minutes. It took 30 minutes to get going because I had to reread the instructions a couple of times. My first suggestion is to read and FOLLOW the instructions. Right when I was ready to give up and get in touch with the manufacturer, I reread the instructions and found where I went wrong. A simple instruction I did not follow/overlooked caused me some headache. The computer AND the camera have to be hard wired to the wireless router for the initial setup. Once I plugged my laptop into the wireless router with a cat5 cable, everything went fine (it was right in the instructions). I will tell you, I had to go into the manual setup (not the wizard) in order to set the proper hardware for the laptop. The software that came with the camera recognized some other \"thing\" for the communicating device on my laptop. Once I went into the manual configuration and manually selected \"Intel blah blah blah\" as the communicating device on the laptop, all went well after that. I am not a tech person at all and I was able to get this camera up and running in 30 minutes (hard wired). READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Tomorrow I will tackle the wifi set up and will report back. Right now the camera is connected to my router with a cat5 cable and my laptop is back in the office connected via wifi and I can access the camera no problem.  I will tell you the camera works well and we are totally happy with it. There is little to no color to the picture, it's mostly black and white but there is a little color (night vision is black and white but very clear). If you are looking for a high def super camera this is not the one. If you are looking for a decent camera to monitor a room or your house, it works fine. I just accessed the camera (middle of the night) and the night vision works great!! The pan and tilt feature is fantastic and it is very quiet when adjusting. The two way sound is awful, very weak, and there is a delay of several seconds but it does work (sort of). Listening is much better than speaking. I can hear pretty well from the camera to my laptop, but the speaker on the camera is terrible. You can select two way comm., listen only or speak only. The software is pretty good and has lots of configurable features including warnings, motion detections, snapshots, video record, and email alerts. I read one review that said the green power LED on the front of the camera was a distraction. The software lets you choose whether or not the LED light is on, blinking, or completely off (we chose off). We intend to use this camera to keep an eye on our house while we are out. Again, tomorrow I will check out the wifi and see how hard it is to setup. Will report on that later. So far this camera has far exceeded our expectations for the price.UPDATE Day two:Wifi setup was fairly easy, just follow the instructions. The camera works well via LAN and wifi but I can not get it to work on my phone with 3g/4g/lte, only via wifi on the phone. If I turn on wifi on my android phone, I can use the remote IPCam app and it works well. If I shut off wifi on my android phone and try to access the camera using the data network it does not work. I believe it has something to do with port forwarding but I can not access my router through their setup wizard or the manual mode either. I have a belkin wireless router and when I choose belkin and input my security info, it will not recognize or access the router (in their setup software). So whenever I try to setup port forwarding it fails in the setup program. There is a tutorial on the tenvis website that explains how to manually set up port forwarding in a belkin router but I am not savy enough to do it (I tried but to no avail). Well as I stated earlier I am not a tech person. I have spent a day and a half trying to get it to work on my phone using data only but it looks like I will give up for now. I will search the internet and see if I can find a more specific solution to my problem.We set up the alert and email so when the camera detects motion it takes a snapshot and sends an email alert to you. Very nice but be sure to shut it off when you are home or your email inbox will fill up quickly!! Don't forget to turn it on when you leave...Overall very happy with the camera, decent picture especially night vision, very quiet when adjusting, just need to keep in mind what I paid for it.Two cons:The camera's IR LEDs are not IR, they are faint red LEDs. True IR is invisible to the human eye. The LEDs are very faint but visible. They are noticeable in a dark room but IMO not a distraction. Again, keep in mind the price.Also, The setup guide is written by people that are using english as a second language so it's not always clear, the illustrations help. The setup can be difficult for those of us with only basic computer skills. Still can not get the IPCam app to work on my android phone using only a data connection.Again we are happy with this camera and will probably buy a couple more to cover some blind spots in the house.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "marco3699", "ReviewID": "R3V2Z0DF34HAZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The setup was very easy, gave detailed instructions with minimum requirements.

If you can set up a FOSCAM you'll have no problem with this camera. Here is the nitty gritty on what you need to know:Wifi works on B/G with encryption (WPA2 works)Setup is a little sketchy but not hard if you know what you're doing (reference the foscam setup info if u need help)Use firefox or chrome to set this cam up because the active X control is not signed. It's easy to bypass (but you'll need to google how yourself)Picture quality is acceptable but not great, consider the price point and it becomes great!Works great with Blue Iris (choose foscam 89xx as the type)Seems durable as I managed to drop it from the top of a 15ft ladder, it landed on the gravel and still worked perfectly. This is probably due to the HW seeming to be exactly the same as foscam.Night vision reaches about 12 feet or so in pitch blackness. Not quite as far as the foscam, but acceptable. There is also a green blinking LED on the front of this cam.There seems to be a focus ring on the front, I did not try to move it as the focus was correct for my needs.It does audio, sounds about the same as the foscam 8918. I don't use the mic to talk so I can't say how that is.Other thoughts:If you want a cheap alternative to the foscam 8910 or 8918 this is it! I have 2 foscams and paid a heafty fee for the name. I will be purchasing Tenvis going forward. The built in web interface works alright, but it's not great. Using this with BlueIris is identical to my foscam PTZ cam. The camera might be a hair lower in picture quality, but it's real close and might just be a placebo effect since I paid $30 more for the foscam. This is being used in a 84x58ft pole barn mounted upside down (with included hardware) 15ft high. It does the job of giving me peace of mind that no one is trying to steal my gear. Highly recommended product.***UPDATE***I am lowering my rating for this camera after using it for a month. After the second week I am experiencing anomalies with this camera. The major reason I removed 3 stars is because it randomly freezes and loses connectivity with the network. It might work fine for 2 hours, or two weeks, but eventually the power will have to be cycled in order for the camera to regain wireless network connectivity. At first I was reluctant to update my review, because I wanted this camera to work out for me as an alternative to more expensive models. So I did all the due diligence in updating the firmware to the latest version, and when that failed to fix the random disconnect, I moved the router to within 12 feet with line of sight. Unfortunately this setup only worked for about two weeks until it disconnected again. I could run a LAN line but the camera is mounted 15' in the air, and well I feel like wireless should work! I thought the router could be the problem, even though 2 other IP cams are working on it great, so I swapped that out as well. No dice. The tenvis worked overnight and lost connection AGAIN. So by this time I was ready to pitch this at 90mph in the trash. Fortunately I found an old Christmas light timer, which I set to cycle once per day. This did the trick and the tenvis is working alright for me now. Really though, after all of this, I would just buy a foscam next time. Overall it was worth a try on this brand but it just isn't in the same league as the foscam, and for $30 bucks less I don't really expect it to be. But it should work 24/7 and unfortunately it simply does not.Recap:PROS: cheap price, acceptable picture quality, UV night vision works, Pan and tilt with presets work, works with BlueIris, accepts WPA2 wireless, audio works (see cons).CONS: loses connectivity with WiFi @ random intervals, resolution jumps from 640 to a lower res depending on how you pan/tilt, audio quality is poor at best (lots of popping and distortion but it does work well enough to hear noises and such - sets off false alarms in blueiris), no way to disable LED blinking light, night vision is very weak (only 11 UV leds), power needs to be cycled every week or so.Final thoughts (updated): Overall I would only use this cam if I were very tight on cash and was willing to manually reset it once in a while. I am using an automatic light timer to cycle this once per day and that works OK, but trust me just spend the extra cash on a better brand. I have had none of these problems with my foscam, loftek, or trendnet ip cams.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap and works well!", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R2AKB1SKTLV0U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Surprised at the low price.

The Tenvis is nice in that it has night vision built in, is wireless, and has a decent picture.  It's a pretty decent cheap IP camera actually.My reason for giving it the low rating is because of it's motion detection.  Even with the unit set in its least sensitive setting it still triggers motion detection when there is no motion.  To test this unit I placed it into my office with the door shut, windows closed. Blinds closed.  The room still had some light in it because the blinds are not opaque.  I set the camera so that it viewed about 1/4 of the room with the wall about 10 feet away from it.  There were no electronics or papers in the shot that might move to trigger motion.With the unit in the least sensitive setting it soon began to send alerts to my email saying it detected motion.  Over the course of the weekend it sent out over 7MB of photos.  Dozens and dozens of them day and night.  If  person was thinking they could use this to somehow be aware that someone had moved in this space they would need to dig though so many pictures to find out that it would be very time consuming.  And that was just for a single weekend.  I was literally getting alerts every few minutes from this thing.With so many alerts being generated it's useless as any sort of a security device or alert.  If you want a cheap real-time camera this one will get the job done.  If you want it for anything more than that, save your money.

My one star review is based on the total failure of the WiFi connection.The instructions for WiFi setup are clear enough, and there is additional information on the Tenvis website.  However, after working on this for several hours, I have been unable to get it to connect.WiFi connection in general cannot be difficult.  I have several laptops, various iPhones and iPods, an iPad, a Wii, an Apple TV, a wireless printer and even a Nintendo Gameboy connected to my network by WiFi, and they all connected to the network immediately, stay connected, and re-connect automatically after reboot of either the device or the wireless router.  But my camera wouldn't connect at all, and other people have said that their camera regularly drops its WiFi connection.I'm sad to have to say this, because everything else about the camera works.  When connected by ethernet cable, the utility program finds it on the network, and launches the camera view on a webpage, from which the camera is configurable.  The iPhone app lets me view the picture on my iPhone, and the camera can be controlled from both the webpage and the iPhone app.Tenvis provides a DDNS service that allows the camera to be accessed from outside the local network using a web address rather than an IP address.  (For most home users, the IP address can be changed regularly by the ISP, so isn't a good way to identify the device.)  The web address appears to be specific to the camera (e.g. usXXXXX.mytenvis).  Use of this service requires that port forwarding be setup on your wireless router, which may be a little tricky.  (I discovered that the iPhone app works seamlessly from outside the local network.  Accessing the camera from a web browser outside the network did not work as well.  There was often a considerable lag time between pressing the button to move the camera, and the move occurring on the screen.)So, if I was willing to use the camera connected to the router with an ethernet cable, the device would probably rate four or five stars.  However, I would like to put the camera in a location that cannot be reached by an ethernet cable (but still well within the range of WiFi), and I can't use it in that manner.I'm going to send it back, but I haven't decided what to do next.  Should I try another Tenvis, on the theory that I got a lemon?  Or should I try a more expensive option?  (Unfortunately, even the more expensive cameras do not get clean reviews on Amazon.)-----------------Update 1/24/2014I sent the first camera back and ordered a new one.  Same problem.  Operating under the theory that it is not a manufacturing defect, but something about my network, I decided to make an extra effort and try every possible setting on both the router and the camera.  I started with my Verizon FIOS router, made by Actiontec.  I tried all of the security settings and made sure no filtering was set.  No luck - same results as last time, the camera couldn't connect.  Then I tried connecting to my Apple Time Capsule wireless router.  After a bunch of attempts, I was successful.  The Time Capsule is set up with WPA2 security.  My passcode is 13 ascii characters long, and my recollection is that 13 ascii characters is the required length.  On the camera, the WAP2 section allows for a freeform passcode of any length.  I clicked on AES, and entered the 13 character passcode, and was able to connect.  I unplugged the camera and moved it to a location about 30 feet from the router.  It reconnected automatically after it was powered up again.  So far, so good.Now back to the Verizon router.  The security for the Verizon router was set to WEP, using the default 10 digit hex password.  Even though this corresponded to one of the settings on the camera, I was unable to connect using it.  So I bit the bullet, and change the security scheme on the router to WPA2, and entered a new passcode.  (All of my family will now have to enter a new passcode for all connections to this router, so this change has the potential for messing some things up.)  After making this change, I went back to the camera and changed the security scheme for the Verizon profile to WPA2, AES and entered the new passcode.  Viola!  It connected.  I guess the conclusion is that the camera should be used with a router that uses WPA2 encryption.  (Which is better than WEP anyway, so other than the inconvenience factor, that was a good change to make.)As a result, I've changed my rating to 5 stars.  Everything else about the camera is very good for the price.  I was easily able to set up the Tenvis app on my iPhone to view the camera remotely using the Tenvis DDNS service.  The motion sensor worked, and sends an email to my Gmail account when motion is detected.  The motion sensor can be turned on/off remotely from the iPhone app.  The infrared night vision works fine.  The audio probably isn't so great.  I can hear sounds that the camera detects, but they aren't very clear.  And I can speak into my phone's microphone and have my voice come through the camera.  I'm not sure that the audio aspect would make the product satisfactory as a baby monitor, but it is adequate for my home-monitoring objectives.The WiFi connection process probably shouldn't be this difficult - every other device that I've connected works without manually changing settings on the device.  However, now that it is working, I've got to give the product credit for what it does well.Update 3/14/2014Since my original review was negative, I will make a final update.As noted in the last update, I finally got the camera connected to WiFi.  Since then I have unplugged it a couple of times, and it reconnected immediately when restarted.  Other than being briefly unplugged to move the camera, it has remained on for almost two months.  The camera has remained on and connected the entire time.  It has always been accessible remotely with the iPhone app.  The app successfully controls the camera, and can be used to turn off and on the email alert system, which works well.  I'm confirming my five-star rating, which applies in spite of my initial problems in getting it connected to wi-fi.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the Price, you can't beat it!", "Author": "Robby", "ReviewID": "R3ADUK4Y2EB6P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't know what to expect from this camera partly b/c I'm new to surveillance cameras and partly b/c of the price.

If you have a large network that includes more than one wireless router or network switches like my home network does be aware the software assigns it a fixed IP address which is good for working with the camera but can cause havoc once you try to go wireless for it if you did not setup the camera on the same IP address range. For example if your behind a second router that assigns the camera a IP address of 192.168.0.XXX and your main router which you intend to use it wireless with uses the range of 192.168.1.XXX the camera will never connect wireless. So make sure to plug it directly into the router with the wireless you intend to use comes from to get around this issue.The video quality is good for the price and only blurs when being panned around at a setting a Normal speed or faster so for a smooth video when panning use a slower speed. The light adjusting ability of this camera is outstanding, I can sit here and look outside a window and can barely see but the view from the camera makes it appear mid day and that's not even it using the night vision which works wonderful when you make sure to also account for the IR led maximum range. The Pan ability is almost funny that even though it is not stated as 360 deg, the camera can pan around far enough that it can see its own antenna from both directions so you can not hide from it in a circle but one tip I would give is that even though it states its 90 degrees Tilt it can really only go about 5 degrees down and 85 degrees up so if you intend to mount it over 5 feet in the air then mount it upside down like I did and invert the view in the software to correct for that and it will give you the ability to look all the way down including directly under the camera.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Neat.", "Author": "G.

I hit the internet and found a forum referencing the Tenvis Search Tool for MJPEG. I don't understand why this tool isn't prepackaged with the disc, enough people have problems with the disc software that they needed to create a second tool. Anyway, this tool found the camera.

I won't delve into my expletive peppered attempted setup session which lasted hours on end yesterday. I phoned the company and a delightful Chinese lady, whose English was obviously light years more advanced then my Mandarin, calmed me. Trust me, I was prepared to be very snarky about the blank cd which was included in the package, but she was so sweet and soothing, I knew I couldn't vent like I was so wanting to do. She also informed me that the password I kept trying to enter was actually blank. Not \"blank\", but ______, as in do not enter anything. She also directed me to to this [...] download section of the company's website. Starting again this morning, I decided to use the latest of about four different installation wizards for this camera which seems to have a somewhat indeterminate model number--maybe like Boeing 727 a,b,c,etc. I decided to start from the top and use the latest model and proceed down the list until something worked. Before downloading the wizard, I decided to follow the Tenvis setup tutorial[...]  I didn't hold out much prospect for the newest version of the wizard being the correct one because I thought this camera was refurbished and would be older, but Lo!, I followed the video step by step, pausing and replaying as necessary. About an hour and twenty minutes later, I was viewing my target room with my iPod Touch (free app CamViewer)via my NetGear router and the newly connected wireless IP Tenvis camera! What a great feeling of satisfaction and comfort this is. The picture quality is about 20x better than my old webcam, too. Recapping, the setup of this wireless camera is more difficult than the setup of the NetGear router, but someone with anything beyond beginner computer skills; patience; and the proper tools (password, wizard, instructional video, paper & pen for notes) can probably slog through the setup in less than two hours.

The install did not complete, it errored out and inhad to set the camera up manually which involved a lot of network stuff. The software that came with it was never able to see the camera over wifi (though I was still able to connect to it over its built in web server).

Camera worked only on wired connection and no matter what I tried I could not get it to work. I'm not exactly a computer genius but better than average. I sent an email to the Tenvis customer service and after one I received an response. The response was to read the manual again. Really? I called customer service and had to leave a message regardless of what time I called. Never received a return call. What good is a wireless camera that only works wired? In case you are wondering what I did to fix the issue here goes: changed ports, channels, security settings, DCHP, DDNS, wireless settings from N &G;, to B, on the router. Reset the camera dozens of times. Turned off firewalls and security on computer. Attempted to download firmware update and finally clicked my heals three times and asked that the camera go back home.

These are about as easy to install within a LAN as any other wireless device. However, setting them up for access from outside a LAN is more difficult. To be specific, I happen to have an Actiontec DSL Modem and I was able to achieve remote viewing only after configuring the modem to allow 'port forward' for each of the cameras. To accomplish this, I assigned port numbers of 8080, 8081, 8082, and 8083 to each camera respectively. After this I signed onto the Actiontec and created a port forwarding table. (I did this by entering each one of these numbers as well as each cameras IP address). Then, because my Internet service provider uses Dynamic IP addressing, I signed up with a DNS service provider. I elected to sign up with NO-IP at a cost of $15 per year. (Note that DYNDNS charges $20 per year). However, if only one domain is being setup then there is no cost to sign up. After obtaining my DNS account with NO-IP, I was able to create 4 separate hostnames and to then associate each camera's IP address and port number to that particular hostname.

I read a lot of reviews that were good and bad and setting up can be difficult.  I have never set up a camera like this before and while I do know my way around a computer, I have never messed with IP Addresses, DDNS and port forwarding and things like that.  I was really excited about the low price and I gave it a try.  There is a video demo to follow along with on the tenvis.com website that's actually pretty good.  However, if your setup does have a problem somewhere along the line, it is difficult to figure out what the next step should be.  There's not much of a manual with this camera and I had to go online and look for reviews and forums for help to get through this.  I got a little confused when I read other reviews where people were going to these other website for DDNS addresses so the camera could be viewed over your smart phone or web browser and I found that you do not need to go this route because Tenvis provides you with an address to do this for free.  I did have to contact customer support for a few things and they were good at getting back to me by email, but a little hard to understand sometimes.  Calling wasn't an option for me because they make you leave a message and the support center is only open Monday - Thursday from 7-3.  After I figured out how to port forward on my router and setup the DDNS, everything worked great on my phone.  I have an LG Intuition and I downloaded the IP CAM Viewer for free and tested controls out and then upgraded to the PRO for $3.99.  All the controls worked really well and I could move the camera, however, I discovered the motion detection is way too sensitive no matter what setting I put it on and I get tons of emails in sets of three. While the audio worked and I speak through the camera, it was so quiet and hard to hear that it really wouldn't do any good.  I ended up hooking up some external speakers to it and it's way better but the speaker volume is at max and it shouldn't need to be at max to hear the audio. Also, there is a light on the front that constantly blinks and I ended up covering that with electric tape so it wasn't so distracting.  There is a ring of red lights that you can see at night around it, but that didn't bother me for what I was using it for.  Another down side to this camera is video recording was unreliable and hard to play back with the phone app and the power chord is extremely short.  You will probably need an extension for it or move an electrical outlet to be closer tot he camera.

I had no problems setting up the camera, port forwarding to the web, 3rd party motion detection software etc... that's all fairly standard, about the same as any other camera I've used.-1 star - VERY short power cord, need to splice to put it anywhere that's not 4 feet from a plug.-1 star - as you can see in the video, there is some sort of issue with the cams light sensing ability. I personally don't know enough about this technology to really understand what is going on, but what I do know is that when you point it towards any bright source of light, the video immediately becomes distorted and \"stretches out\" is how I would describe it. I have the same model mounted on my front porch (in an area the can't be affected by rain) and it has the same issue. Works good all night, when the sun comes out and is hitting the ground in front of the camera I get the distorted image. Turn the camera away from the light and the image goes back to normal. Haven't seen anyone refer to this issue with any other brand of camera.-1 star - customer service is a JOKE! First they have an answering machine for their so called America customer support, really??? Second I brought the above mentioned issue up with Tenvis on their customer support forum and their only reply to me is that it looks like the video wasn't recorded with their software. I explain to them that this is irrelevant as I have the same issue when not recording and using their web interface and I get no response? Maybe they will yet, but it's been several days now and I'm not counting on it.Bottom line, at this point I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and purchased a Foscam or one of the other slightly higher priced brands. They all look very similar to this model but they definitely are not the same.

They do however function very well for what they are.I bought three of them and have had them up for a couple of weeks and I use them to monitor my infant when he is being babysat.I gave them five stars because they do what I expected, wanted, and do it better than I actually hoped for considering the price range.Now, the sound functionality...we'll it's crap...but I have not plugged in an external mic to see if that works better. The speaker pretty much sucks too. So if you are buying for that feature, then my five star review would probably be a lower rating in your case.Setup....setup is a pain, based on reviews I expected it. I ended up port forwarding 80, 81, and 82 in order to get all three functional on my net gear router. I did a lot to get these working and I wish I had done a write up then so I could remember it all to provide others assistance, but I didn't, and I'm sorry to not be of more help. I will tell you that if the search tool is not finding it, but you see the MAC address of the camera in your router, then factory reset the camera..there is a little button on the back, hold it in, it took a good minute of me holding it in, then the camera will reset and spin all around for another minute. After that, I could find in search and router. Do the same if it's not showing in router even if you compare MAC address.I say MAC address because sometimes even if you rename the camera, the name does not show in the router.I do have their camera software, it is just OK, so I mainly use Livecams Pro on my iPhone and iPad. I find that their software sends the cameras spinning every time I switch views and I have to readjust the aim point.Trying to think of anything else I can share but my mind is a blank.These performed good enough...btw I only use inside and the IR will bounce off reflective material and blind itself, so windows area a no go at night...but they still perform well enough in price and my needs that I am going to try out a couple of the robot3 models.Hope this helps someone out there.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": "Natascha Pratt", "ReviewID": "R3HD4Y0U4FWWDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We planned a trip overseas months before our dogs decided they wanted to have pups.

It will occasionally take a few moments to activate a \"sleep\" connection, but it's not a huge issue for my situation. Some neighbors were victim to vandalism attempts so we set this up in front as both a deterrent and to be able to check any noise late at night right from bed. It works perfectly for that situation. We keep it indoors, up against the window, and while the IR can indeed create a \"glow-back\" effect (normal) I can still see adequately in low or no-light conditions.

The Model that I received in the mail is the JPT3815W. The device needs to boot itself and when you first power it on, it will cycle itself which means it turns the camera around in all directions first. SO don't keep your hand rested on it or have objects in it's way when it starts. The instructions DO NOT explain this, but the instructions compared to some other companies of the like are BEAUTIFUL!!!Pros: Price  Night Vision  Console allows disabling of power light indicator or pulse setting  Almost 360 degrees of view  Plug and Go. Use a network cable to get it started (same as router you have to use a cable the first time(included))  Wifi makes it easy to put this camera anywhere there is a power source.Cons: CD shipped with unit is BLANK I had to go download the software.  Length of Power Cord  No option to disable IR Night Vision (reflections cause white out)  No zoom feature with OSD but works in programs such as ISpy and YawCam  Must use the name \"admin\" as login and cannot be changed (within camera firmware)  No clear definitions on which address' supply which streams for 3rd party software(but I still figured it out)I might purchase another one of these. These cameras are so fun to play with. Download ISpy and try the motion detections and other settings. A very good buy, just a little disappointed in the lack of some basic camera features but you really cannot beat this for the price. Having it shipped in two days with Prime, just plain awesome.

The wireless setup was very detailed, however, changing the port is not intuitive. It is recommended to use the wizard tool that can be downloaded from their site to adjust the port number, as well as changing the port on the router itself. I did this to ensure a safer port, as well as allowing it to be port forwarded manually so I may use my own domain, versus the one provided with every camera for remote access.The android app that is provided for downloading is intuitive, easy to use, and does allow listening from the camera, as well as speaking through the camera, so there is 2-way audio support.The SDK is the only issue I have with the system. As a developer, I prefer to use Linux, but the SDK is natively written for Windows, which appears to only be for the User Interface. Since I will have to re-write some of the sample code given to work on Linux, i'm displeased, but only due to the extra work I need to do to interface with my current system.

However, of the 3 units we ordered, only ONE worked out of the box.  This IP camera has a startup cycle when it powers on.  The camera will begin moving automatically.  After it finishes its cycle, it's good to go.  Setup is easy. Just follow the instructions on the included CD, and everything is a piece of cake.  The image quality is awesome.  We use the camera as a baby monitor.  The night vision image is phenomenal.  Most baby monitors that boast the same have very limited visibility in near dark rooms.

I've read a lot of review that say these have a habit of dying after 3-6 mos so if I have that issue I'll update my review.First, the camera was a bit of work to setup.  The directions aren't crystal clear but if you're at least somewhat tech savvy you should be able to figure it out.  I had it working on my internal network in about 30 minutes, however it took me a while to get it going via external connections.  The issue with mine is that my internet provider has a modem/gateway combo, I had to open the ports on the gateway before I could open them on my WiFi router.  It sounds like my situation was unique because everywhere I went for troubleshooting told me I shouldn't have to do that.I've got the camera mounted inside a chest freezer that I use for homebrewing beer, I use it to monitor temperature and fermentation.  The temp in there ranges from 38\u00b0F to 90\u00b0F (well within the operating range of 14\u00b0F to 122\u00b0F) and so far I don't see where that has been an issue.  There is no light in the freezer so it is using the IR night vision mode.Unfortunately viewing the live stream can be a bit buggy.  Frequently the camera is non-responsive to pan/tilt commands, or it will \"jump\" after issuing a few commands.  The camera will jump in and out of the proper aspect ration and sometimes gives a stretched view things.  When it is working properly the view is clear and sharp, even in night vision mode.You can access the camera from any browser however you have access to more features when using IE.  There are also iPhone and Android apps available which is kind of nice.Overall I think the camera is \"decent\", I'll see how long it lives and if the problems get any worse.

Well, these cameras freeze on a regular basis (regardless of the scene that is being viewed). I would never recommend anyone to purchase these. I will admit that the quality of the video rendered is not bad; but because of the great possibility of camera freeze this negates other features, such as email and/or FTP alerts. If the camera has frozen it can no longer detect motion and thus can't alert the user. In addition, while it's very easy to configure these cameras to provide video within your own Wi-Fi network, set up of the DDNS (in order to view the camera from 'any' location through the Internet) is quite the hassle. I had to email Tenvis to determine how this is to be done (I still have not completed the task due to time constraints). The instruction manual provide does little to help set up Internet access for the camera, and the Email/FTP alert function for motion is also quite confusing.

It is unclear from the Quick Start booklet written in TINY fonts whether WiFi *only* should be used to set it up or the extremely short Ethernet RJ45 cable should initially be used. It is also unclear whether one could set it up via browser or the software on CD must be installed. There were no hints whatsoever regarding how to connect to it through a browser, so I ended up installing the Search Tool.And this is where problems begun: Somewhere during search installation progress, it stopped with an error message complaining about being unable to find a soap.dll file.  How on earth is a lay person supposed to know what that soap.dll is and where to find it???  I clicked the [Ignore] and then proceeded. The setup miraculously completed and nothing crashed upon launching. It appears that the only way for it to find anything is if the cat5/RJ45 cable is connected between the PC and the camera (despite both being WiFi enabled), since the search tool application found something at  192.168.1.239:7777. If you attempt WiFi only,  the wizard will not show any progress indication whatsoever, as if the thing is hung, and will simply remain blank forever.I will update this review (and remove additional stars, based on findings) as I make progress in the installation...OK, so after being puzzled for a while about what to enter in that 'Configure camera's network settings' I GUESSED that the 'Obtain IP address automatically via DHCP' should be UNCHECKED. The 'PC network connection information' cannot be edited for some reason, and the only section that's editable is 'Camera Network Information'. I just put there some value that I know belongs to my LAN's subnet. This seemed to have been successful and another line was added to the list of IP cameras (in addition to the original one which seems to be unusable in my LAN).That miraculously launched IE on the IP address I entered and prompted for downloading, installing and running an IE ActiveX plugin from the manufacturer (somewhere in China). I downloaded the plugin, installed it and ran it and, lo and behold, I see my room in the browser. So... this thing seems to be working. The only question now is: How useful is it? That's because it works as long I am connected with an Ethernet/cat5/Rj45 cable DIRECTLY to the camera. What I would like to do is enable both PC and camera to be totally on WiFi, connected through my wireless router.Notes: The above succeeded only when:1. Installing the Search Tool as Administrator (on my Windows XP SP3 PC).2. Connecting from my PC with an Ethernet/cat5/Rj45 cable DIRECTLY to the camera.After the initial success, then trying to connect through WiFi, the camera disappeared on me for some reason. I had to disconnect the Ethernet cable, turn off power, count to 3, turn on power, then reconnect the Ethernet cable.Then after going past IE default admin/admin login + enabling the ActiveX plugin, being presented again with the Web application, there is a 'Settings' icon that seems to allow WiFi configuration for the camera. Let's see whether this gives me what I want (and how difficult it is)...Well, I am not sure whether it is possible to connect to the camera via WiFi, but I could certainly:1. Connect to the camera INDIRECTLY via wired LAN, from anywhere on the subnet.2. Make the camera connect to my WiFi router, thereby allowing it to send email upon motion alarm (most useful for me right now).Not bad for the price. Let's see how reliable this is. Will follow up if anything break or changes.A few more notes:1. The emailed photos are blurry and unclear. Is it possible to (re)focus the lens? If so, how?2. Is it possible to increase resolution of the emailed photos beyond 640x480?One day later: Removing one star (down to 3) due to the inability to use the camera with any password other the default 'admin'. Changing password is successful and logging in to IE's \"Live Video\" is successful using the new password but... the picture is completely BLACK! (restoring the password to the default 'admin' remedies the situation).Two days later: Removing one star (down to 2) due to having to REBOOT the camera for an email alarm to register. Also, reboot IGNORES the preset settings. Also, even without a reboot, the presets are inaccurate and erratic. Also, the camera alarm seems to have lost sensitivity (now responds to light changes only, not to motion, which seems to have worked the first day). Very buggy and disappointing.One more comment, awarding this product the lowest possible score: The user guide that comes with it makes you believe (page 3) that you can configure it (via the TENVIS Search Tool) through WiFi.

Quite frankly, products marketed specifically as video baby monitors are a complete ripoff- especially if you already have a smartphone or laptop. Look around and you'll see that they average about $100 and some are a lot more. There is no reason you should have to pay that much.That said, you can also spend that much on a webcam like this, and once again- no reason you should have to. The technology is definitely mature enough that they're inexpensive to produce. This Tenvis camera as of this writing is $45 and it does everything I could ask for. If I were to buy a baby monitor with the same features, it would cost me $150.The camera includes items to mount it, an adjustable antenna, instructions, and a CD with the search utility on it. The utility is actually not strictly necessary, it just makes the setup a bit more straightforward. All the utility does is direct your browser to the camera's IP (on a sticker on the bottom, in case you forget) and you're at the viewing/setup utility. From there it just sort of works- there's really nothing else you have to do. A few notes on setup:1. Change the password. You don't want random people in the neighborhood able to access it.2. There's two ways to connect: wirelessly and via a ethernet cable to a router. Wireless setup is via the setup page and is the same as setting up any other device on a wireless network. Wired setup is even easier- you literally just plug it in. Cable isn't included though, and this tethers the camera to a router.3. There is a mic port if you want to attach a external pickup.4. Although all major browsers can stream the camera view, only IE can do audio. Keep this in mind if you plan to primarily use a computer and only own Macs :-)5. If you plan to use a phone or tablet, Tenvis just points you to a third party IP Camera app. It's a pretty good one, but to use two way audio features and record modes, you have to buy it for $3. Would have been nice if they mentioned that or gave you free credit to do it.6. You can set this for remote access (outside your home network) and use some advanced features like motion detection recording. These are a bit harder to set up and the instructions aren't great. I haven't bothered yet; will update if I get around to it.Generally speaking, the camera itself works very well. Night vision mode produces a very clear picture, it can pan and tilt in a wide area and is both quiet and quick. The audio pickup built in is decent; output is a bit garbled usually but that's rather to be expected. Range appears to be decent. The onboard utility supports multiple cameras.This isn't the most advanced or high resolution IP camera out there, but it's also one of the cheapest. For the price, you get a lot of functionality. The unit itself is unobtrusive and easy to setup, and you can link as many devices as you want to it.

I'd be willing to have a hassle to save some money as long as it worked which was what I thought I was getting at first.  This thing took forever to set up.  I ended up calling china.  The woman who answered asked my to use email support in the future, which I've tried but they take up to two days for each response and at times have just sent an image from a page in the manual!I think the idea is to drag you out past when you can return them with SLOWLY addressing issues with a piece of junk device.So, what took forever, you ask?  Back and forth with connection to the router and getting it on my network was a problem.  After several tries I got the reluctant Chinese customer service person on the phone from China.  They asked me to go through all the steps again after a factory reset and said that would work.  It didn't.  I called again.  They had to connect via team viewer to change the assigned ip address of the camera on their end... The DDNS was screwed up.  I wish I'd taken notes at the time to be more specific about the problem.  I'm not tech illiterate and I'm generally intuitive with this stuff so for me to be baffled and frustrated is just rare.  I'm the one people call when they can't figure out their gadget.I never could get the IMAP going with Gmail.  It was on and off.  I'd get their little \"success!\" message saying my settings were correct but then no emails and I'd go test again and get a fail.  I wonder if those messages are actually testing anything or if it's like a magic 8 ball.  I've just got \"success!\" with yahoo but still, no email.I had to go out of town shortly after it arrived and NEEDED this to work so I got FTP storage and that setup went OK....  for a week or so.So now the motion sensor is not working.  I planned on using images from this camera for things you NEED a security camera to do.  It worked for just over a week and I got many false positives- like 45 images of nothing a day- from the motion sensor but I didn't really care because I was still getting images and I figured I'd mess with the sensitivity later but didn't want to reduce it at the risk of missing something.  And I did at least get something I needed so I was almost going to be willing to put up with glitchiness as long as it was sending me something I could use.  All of a sudden it just stopped.  The tech support in China said they couldn't do anything unless I was home with the camera and sent me ANOTHER copy of the manual.I got home and confirmed that there's not a thing wrong with my settings.  I was always able to access the thing remotely but didn't have a desktop at home to record video to and it will only upload stills to FTP and that's not working.  I've captured video and stills with the camera now that I'm here and there's no problem with that.  Just the alarm.  You know, the reason you don't just run a webcam all day and play back the footage.  But until I get a REAL motion sensing camera, that's what I'm going to have to do.  At least I got something I needed but I won't try to save money again on something that just HAS TO WORK.  If you think you might actually really need a security camera, buy something else.

The community had no cameras to see what happened, and I had no security system. We moved that weekend and the first purchase I decided to make was a new security system. Being in an apartment, though, I couldn't 'install' any sort of hardware, so my attention turned to the DIY type set ups. I found a neat open source program to run on my computer (iSpy) and wanted to get simple-to-use and easy to install cameras to monitor my space. Needless to say this camera fit the bill. Biggest benefit is that it's wireless. I was able to set it up very quickly; hard-wired to my router at first, then set loose anywhere in the house. Once positioned, the iSpy software did the rest. Because it's a standard IP camera, iSpy was able to control it with ease, tracking motion, panning/scanning rooms, time-lapse video, and even alert me when there was motion. It also saves video to my computer as soon as it detects anything, and those are auto-uploaded to my cloud storage immediately (and a UPS/Battery keeps everything running if the power goes out). The camera has some color-accuracy issues that could be better, but the quality is otherwise great (especially for the night-vision).I cannot be more satisfied with this camera. It has great features on it own (I use a simple IP camera app on my iPhone/iPad to monitor it remotely, but the web interface for the camera works well too), but more importantly, it is also a fairly 'open' IP camera that works with most IP Camera managers.I have since moved again, and the great thing is that the camera moved with me without having to clean up wires or brackets.

If you want to view the image/video outside your network, you will need to have some computer/networking knowledge. the instructions aren't very clear, but unless you have a static IP (most of us don't), you will need to configure a 3rd party to allow you to view.  You can save the $40+ dollars Amazon suggests you spend for the software2. The software that comes with it isn't  very user friendly, and at times it is hard to understand, and the translation isn't very good.  It took me about 1 frustrating hour to get things going.3.  The wizard was not able to connect to my wireless.  When I went into 'settings' and put the info in myself, it worked just find.  odd.4.  The main reason this did not get a 5th start is that it reboots itself very often (have others had a problem with this?).  It seems to crash my browser, and by the time I'm able to reconnect, it's either looking at the ceiling, or going in all kinds of different directions.  It's probably meant to do this, and I understand I can pick a 'default' view for it to reset to, but I'm not liking this part of the camera.5.  The picture is decent,  not great.  It isn't as good a basic photograph, but it's better than other camera's at this price.  While you can set it to take (and send you) pictures when it detects movement, unless the person is semi-still, it's mostly a blur.  If using for security, and the person is moving quickly, you will likely not be able to identify them very well. Know that some colors are a bit off as well.6.  The sound is lousy.  You can't leave  both the 'listen' and 'speak' settings on at the same time.  The feedback is horrible.  There is also quite a delay in the sound.  when you speak 'to' the camera, it is barely understandable on the other end.Bottom line - it does the basics well for the price.  You can set it to record video onto your local computer when it detects movement, and when outside your network, you can still take pictures while watching.  one thing I found is that you need to be in Internet Explorer to use all the features.

Yes, this is a Chinese camera with a no-frills user interface, but it all works once you get it up and running.WiFi Tips: For those looking to setup for WiFi use (I'm assuming the majority of us), first plug it in to your router with a network cable. Run the Wizard off the CD and it should find your camera without issue. *IF* you are running a WiFi networking that is 'hidden' (i.e. SSID is not being broadcast), temporarily turn on broadcasting so the camera can connect. Once you do that, input your WiFi networks info and it should connect without issue. Once its connected, I'd advise setting a static IP -- if not, use DHCP and *then* you can disabled SSID Broadcasting and you should be good to go.There is an updated firmware out for IE11. When you go to Tenvis's webpage, MAKE SURE you download the right firmware for your hardware revision. You can look at your hardware revision by going to settings (hit the gear icon from the main video viewing page) and you'll see Hardware revision in the \"About\" section (the section that appears by default).Overall this little camera works great.

This is a bad and a good thing. The first part of this review is about the installation. The worst parts about this product is that CUSTOMER SERVICE is technically unreachable for your immediate help and that the installation process is tough, to say the least. The two hardest parts of installation are 1. the camera being recognized during the installation process and 2. the port forwarding so that the remote, internet viewing option is available. I spent the last 6 hours trying a lot of everything to get the camera to be identified in order to go to the next steps of the installation process and trying to figure out exactly how to port forward correctly. You're going to have to do a lot of googling to get the right info.  Hopefully with this video, you wont have to do as much. The main help for me came from this video on the Tenvis youtube page [...] (TENVIS IP Camera Setup Tutorial for Windows OS).  A lot of people and reviews have said that port forward and installation is easy but I'm trying to prepare you for the worst. Better to expect difficulty and find it easy than to expect a fast installation and have to work much harder at it than you thought you would.The second part of this review is about the product. This is my first IP Camera. The piece connected to my cam for the wifi antenna became super loose after only a short period of time. I just receieved it this morning (11/2/2013). It's so loose I haven't been able to connect using wifi since the first two tries while struggling with installation. I have a very long ethernet cord though so that didn't frustrate me. Once the cam was up and running, I was very satisfied. I love the amount of rotation and tilt for this cam. The color is lightly saturated but the picture is as clear as a 640x480 video would be. I don't get along with my neighbors and my neighborhood isn't all that safe but I've been here all my life. I work all day so when I'm not home, I would like to see what's going on with my property. This is the perfect product to get you started with the video surveillance market. I want more cams set up and I know I will order more.

It should be noted that it seems only to work with certain routers and I was lucky that my router was on the list or I don't know if I would have been able to get it set up.  The picture is very good.  Sound not so much.  Controls work well. Night Vision is great.  I've never had an expensive camera so I can't compare in that respect but for what I paid for the tenvis I think it's a great camera.  Very happy I bought it.  Compares favorably to much more expensive cameras.Update:  I need to change my rating to 2 stars.  The camera worked for one day and quit.  Customer service was very good about trying to help me to get it to work but to no avail.  It went from bad to worse when after resetting the camera there was no picture at all.  I think this is probably a good camera....I think I got a lemon.  I'm returning it.Update #2:  After further customer assistance from Tenvis I discovered the problem was with my router not the camera so rating goes back up to 5 stars.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the Price!", "Author": "Victor K", "ReviewID": "R391LMG28L4JON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of this surveillance camera.

The reviews I read also helped convince me to purchased this camera.I got it all set up using the instructions that came with the camera. I am in no way a Geek but sort of know my way around a computer and home network. Anyway, I set it up plugging it into my router and using the program to find and install the camera onto my system. That went actually easier than I'd expected.Next I followed the instructions to set up the wireless portion of it. I unplugged everything and brought it to the living room, my router is downstairs. I plugged it back into power and had it sitting on the desk as I went through the rest of the install. I got the wireless set up using IE for my browser. I prefer Mozilla Firefox, but for me anyway, it seems to work better on IE so that's what I use for the camera. This also frees up Firefox for my \"normal\" browsing.As far as resolution goes this camera is 640 X 480 which is alright with me. There are also HD cameras out there but they weren't within my budget. No problem. During the day the camera has very decent color and clarity. Remember it's 640 X 480. At night the video is black and white but I guess that's pretty much the way night vision works. Who can really expect color when it's dark in the room.I also downloaded an App for my Android phone and my Kindle Fire which both work very well. I can pan and tilt with either one. The Apps are free but you do get ads so I opted for the $3.99 to eliminate the ads. My next project, which is beyond my knowledge is to set this camera up so that I can view it from the Internet and not just WiFi. That is where it is helpful to have a geek son who, unknown to him, will be willing to come over and help me set up that portion of it. Once he shows me how to set it up I'm planning on purchasing at least one, maybe two, additional cameras for around the house. I want to at least put one in the garage.Other than that I'm very happy with this camera. I got it mounted on the wall sort of out of sight. It can see the whole living room and entry way from its position. This one is Black but I think my next one will be White to blend more in with the wall color where I want to put it. The one for the garage can be Pink for all I care seeing as it will be in the garage.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best IP Camera - Can view on Phone from anywhere!", "Author": "Roland K.

The installation seemed basic enough to me, I just needed to know my external IP address, which I got by doing a quick Google search for \"show me my IP\", and I needed to set a port on my router to channel the signal requests from the internet on to the camera (I guess that is what you would call it). I downloaded a couple of Android apps for remote cameras and both connected right away and gave me total control of both the camera and its settings.So I left on my trip and never had a moment of regret as I felt that I was in constant contact with my camera and my home.

Installation was easy--you just connect it to your router first with a CAT5 cable, and the software will guide you through the process of establishing a wired connection, then a wireless connection, and finally an Internet connection (using port forwarding from the Tenvis web site). That last feat means you can access your video from any Internet device: laptops, iPads, smartphones, etc. Cool! This is much more than one of those little USB webcams. It's actually a little wi-fi webserver that you can remotely control!To achieve the night vision, these cameras must be sensitive to the infrared wavelengths (by removing the IR filter). That introduces many surprises. For example, some daylight colors appear a little goofy (e.g., blue-gray trees). And while you can see people and objects near the camera that are within reach of the LED lighting at night, realize that in infrared, everything will essentially be black and white, with warm, reflective things appearing bright, and cool, absorptive things appearing dark. It's tempting to place the camera near a window (great during the day!), but don't expect to see through the glass at night--all you'll see is the reflection of the bright infrared LEDs.The pan tilt feature really works well. Pan is almost a full 360. However, the tilt (up/down) motion is mostly \"Up.\" If your main interest is looking down (to see your pets or little children, for example), your best bet is to mount the camera inverted (using included brackets) and choose the \"vertical flip\" option in the camera setup.Note that you can turn off the blinking green LED using the web page configuration, making it pretty stealthy. Few people will notice it sitting on the bookshelf, doing its thing! Speaking of web page, did I say it was a mini-web server? There must be at least a hundred configuration settings and parameters under your control, via its \"settings\" web pages. Very geeky, if you're into that sort of thing.The wi-fi feature allows you to locate the camera anywhere within range of your home wi-fi router. All you need is an electric outlet to plug in the power supply.

My overall experience with these cameras have been very good so far. They seem to do exactly what I want. I have been able to set up the cameras on my network, view and control them over the internet, and view and control them via a tablet. All of these have been successful. These work perfectly. the picture quality isn't the greatest but then again this is a sub-$50 wireless webcam and i knew they weren't 720p upon purchase. infact i liked it so much i just purchased a 3rd one!Here are some more details about how I set it up for those who might be having some problems.I followed the instructions  from the guide and went through the IP Camera Wizard for both of the cameras. I was able to get them set up and working correctly on my internal network within about 15 - 20 mins. I also set up multi-cam view within one of the camera's internal IP address. This is helpful because I did not want to expose more than 1 location externally.Next i wanted to set up access outside of my network. This is what took me several hours to figure out. The problem is not necessarily the camera. The problem is more than likely going to be your router and your ability to forward a port. My setup is a modem (not a modem/router) and a medialink 300N wireless router (great router and awesome support btw). So i did not have to worry about forwarding my ports via 2 routers..just the media link. I would recommend that individuals connect the wireless webcam to their modem/router rather than using a secondary router if that is your setup.I had to call medialink and get their assistance in setting up port forwarding. You can narrow down the issue to port forwarding if you are unable to go to your IP address with the port number that you have set up with you camera (i.e. go to your IP xx.xxx.xxx.xx:cameraport. There is also a chance that you might not be able to access your webcam from within your network. basically this is called hairpining meaning you are trying to go to the internet from your local network only to connect back to your local network. So sometimes, if you have the port forwarding correct and you try to connect from an external network it will work but connecting from your home network will not work. In order to get around this and connect internally you need to set up a DHCP client list on your router with the mac address of the camera (you can get this from the IP camera wizard).In addition to port forwarding, you should also set up a DMZ host on your router and point it to one of your camera. When i did port forwarding only, the external connection did not seem to work. I'm thinking that there might be additional ports that are needed for the camera to work rather than just that one port that we are providing it. Will keep this review updated with my experiences.Update: After having this camera for a few days i've found a few flaws (not many!). 1) the power cord is VERY VERY small. it won't even cover the length of a window. 2) the automated motion sensor is triggered by shadows. so if the sun comes out it will trigger the sensor. Same with if it gets cloudy. So you get a lot of false positive unless you are in a completely dark room. 3) The size of the webcam makes it hard to make it conspicuous, this is not something you can use for a \"hidden\" webcam.the night sensors is awesome! no false positives at night.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good...", "Author": "Seelos", "ReviewID": "RPY3XI7TRIHD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just unpackaged the camera and wanted to give it a go setting it up..

The only thing I had a short problem with was wifi.. When going through initial setup it saw the wifi but would not connect following the steps in instructions.. I had to open up the camera viewer and go into the settings there which are the settings on the camera itself, updated wifi info there and wifi is up and running... I tried the 2 way audio from my phone and it seems to be working i hear noise from where the camera is and if i talk into it it comes out that tiny little speaker.. Don't expect perfect clarity in audio... I was initially thinking of getting one of those more expensive Foscam units but this one seems to do it's job at a lower price PTZ also works fine and you can adjust speed settings through camera login through website.. I suggest going over all of your settings once logged into the camera from the viewing app.. I used Chrome and didn't need any plugins installed like on IE. My only concern is the life of the camera.. I had purchased 2 other wireless cameras from a local electronics store and they died within a few months and those cost twice as much as this one.

Every few days the camera drops the wireless connection and it must be powered off/on to re-boot and re-establish the connection.  If I am away from home and the wireless connection drops, I no longer receive email pics when the camera senses motion nor can I get a live feed via my iphone.  The camera can't be re-booted remotely.  This problem pretty much renders it ineffective as a security camera.  After reading Tenvis' technical support forum, this appears to be a chronic problem with this camera.Original review - This is my first review of any product.  I wanted to set up a home security camera so I could get email alarms with snapshots and access live video from my smartphone.  I had no experience setting up an IP camera and had to try to follow the instructions in the user manual.  I downloaded the setup app from the Tenvis website and used the wizard to do the configuration.  I ran into some issues because the \"one button setup\" didn't work correctly and the default gateway had the wrong IP address.  I would recommend getting your network information from your network connection details from your computer's control panel network screens and doing the manual setup.  You also need to first configure the camera with a network cable attached and then set up the wireless connection.  To access the camera over the Internet, you have to set up port forwarding on your router.  I had never done this,  but Tenvis had instructions for setting port forwarding up on my particular router on their support page and it was pretty straightforward.  Tenvis provides a built-in DDNS service which give you a url that points to your global IP address.  I had a problem trying to setup the email alerts using a hotmail account as the sender.  I used a gmail account instead and it worked without issues.  It took me several hours to get the setup corrected and working (because I had made several errors), but once set up correctly, it works great.

You won't want to test the camera's audio in the same room as the PC you are monitoring it from as you will get mic feedback.Pan & tilt is a very nifty feature if you're wanting to get a broad view of things.  But if you set it upright on a table (as displayed in the ad picture), it won't point downwards past the middle.  So if you can't place it in that position too high off the floor.  However, you could use the included mounting bracket and screws to mount it \"upside down\" and get a great view about 180 degrees or so l/r and up/down axes.The only problem I had (other than the email) was that the power supply prongs sparked quite a bit the first few times I plugged/unplugged it.  It's not doing that anymore, so to be fair, it might have been one of the outlets I was using at first.All in all, this is a great buy.  The picture quality is better than what I expected in a camera of this price range.  I can monitor remotely on my phone.  Now, all I need to do is to get the email notifications working.It's amazing all this can be configured using the camera's built-in \"web server.\"", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tenvis wifi camera", "Author": "E.

First of all, the camera software to set it up is terrible.  The software claims to connect to WEP-open but absolutely cannot.  I was going to call their customer service to ask more about this, but the phone number is a Bejing number (so essentially no support).  Next, after i got the camera connected (had to change my encryption on my router to accommodate this camera) the audio worked about 10% of the time.  That alone is a deal breaker.  However, i thought i would continue to test the connectivity of the camera just to be certain.  The camera may have stayed connected, but it was too difficult to tell with the absolutely terrible IPhone app that was released.  The app would freeze after using it for a minute or two.

Otherwise, it may be tough to get it started if your home networking setup doesn't match exactly with the camera's default setting (mine didn't). The IP Camera Wizard program didn't work with my setup at all (it/my computer couldn't find the camera on the network). As with all things networking, it is expected since my setup didn't match with the camera's default settings (I used a different default IP address than most home networks). So, I setup everything manually and it worked fine. I am able to view the video from anywhere with internet access (through a computer using Firefox browser or with a free app on my cellphone). Remember, in order to view the video from outside of your home network, you need to setup your router to \"port forward\" to the camera (or let the router know you have a \"web server\", which is the camera, and tell the router what \"port\" it is on). I also use a free DDNS service (dvr-ddns.com) so that I don't have to use the IP address when viewing from outside home network (the DDNS built into the camera doesn't seem to work).As some other reviewers had noted, the instruction manual is hard to understand. Their website actually has some better tutorials.Overall, I am happy with this IP camera. Video qualify is acceptable (not great, but good enough). Panning and tilt works well with controls from Firefox browser as well as from the free app for Android device.

It can be a little daunting to get working well initially.  Most problems with setup are not with the camera.  So if you are a novice, you will need to reset your patience timer and learn a little about how network cameras work.  It is fairly easy to get it working on your house WiFi network, but accessibility with an outside computer via a web browser can lead to some challenges.  Nonetheless, when it is up and working properly, it is a very decent camera for the price with a good picture and flawless motion with the pan/tilt.

I normally am not one to write reviews, however, this camera and their company are definitely worthy of praise. The camera itself offers many functions of a camera that you would expect to spend three times the purchase price that I paid for the camera. In addition, their service department is unsurpassed in assisting with any problems you may have and are very friendly and cooperative to work with. I would also like to add that their service is ongoing. You would be very hard-pressed to find another company with such a great service department. In closing, I would personally recommend that if you are considering a purchase from this company, you should not hesitate in the least when you make a purchase from them.
