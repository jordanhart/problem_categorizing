The H9118V uses Linux OS.The H9118V is Network accessible, you will need to connect by a cable or a compatible usb wireless adapter.Zmodo Network Software is accessible on the home network only with Microsoft Internet Explorer Browser.It's a great system in this price range, there are systems that are easier to configure, but are higher in price.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$285.99", "Features": "DVR-H9118V-1TB 8 channel security DVR,  Plug-n-Play, Record: 240 fps, Display: 240 fps, Embedded Linux OS, IR Remote Control, PTZ via RS-485 Port, Signal System: NTSC / PAL\nH.264 Hardware Compression, 1TB HD Installed and Configured, Video Input / Output: BNC 8/BNC 1, Video Output: VGA, Audio Input / Output: RCA 4/BNC 1, Recording Mode: Continuous/Scheduled/Motion\nDisplay Mode: Each/ All/ Auto Switch/ Hidden, Playback Search: Time & Date, Event List, Network:RJ45 TCP/IP or DDNS, Remote Access: LAN or IE Browse, Support Remote View via 3G Mobile\nDVR supports Live View via smartphone & 3G Mobile with each of the following systems: iPhoneTM, Google Android, BlackberryTM OS as of now: V4.6, Running Windows MobileTM Pro 5.0 & 6.1 Operating System, Running Symbian Operating System: S60 3rd & S60 5th.\nSupport Remote View via 3G Mobile, Package Includes: (1) DVR-H9118V-1TB DVR System, (1) IR Remote Control, (1) User's Manual", "Name": "ZMODO DVR-H9118V-1TB 8 Channel CCTV Security Surveillance Security DVR - 3G Mobile 1TB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EyPD0P-vL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0080JGX2M"}}
