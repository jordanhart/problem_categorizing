No memory card included.", "Author": "Zheng", "ReviewID": "RD3N9MS7PG3HS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, unlike it is shown in the Product Description, there is no \"1 x 4GB TF card\" included.Next, it looks like somebody already \"pre-owned\" this camera. The bottom compartment, that hold the USB cable, User Manual and, presumably, the memory car was closed with a carbon that has a hole in the middle. That hole is closed with a \"seal\" in new package. It was broken. The USB cable was packed into some plastic back in a harry. The camera itself shall be secured in some spongy support and then placed into plastic bag. It was done in reverse. As result, the camera \"jumped\" out of the box once I lifted the lid. It looks like somebody forgot the order of packing this item.Finally, I tried to read the User Manual. One moment in the manual looks very \"promising\":\"Notice:d. When you make a video, please focus on the object and keep 50cm under sufficient illumination.\"Well, there in no focus in this camera.And, 50cm???And look at that \"posrter\"!1280x960 AVI? -- No, it is 720 x 480.HD quality? -- Do \"they\" even know what HD stands for?Motion detection? -- Probably, if you were lucky to get this camera properly assembled.8GB? -- Well, the user manual and the box say \"up to 16BG\", while the Product Description tells only about 4GB, despite the fact \"they\" cannot deliver even described.I am returning this item right away.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "poor product", "Author": "kcpilotpat", "ReviewID": "RWRTA8YP6RZ2R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing. They don't work very well.  Has a motion sensor to start, but only captures one event then shuts off?  Has audio and nothing in the literature discloses that.

The lower resolution results in a field of view that is so narrow that it makes the camera nearly useless.  The camera that this one was intended to replace had a resolution of 1280x960 and worked great until the battery died.
