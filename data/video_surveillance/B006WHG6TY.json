McDonald", "ReviewID": "R2WK0YUHAU7ALN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace another Q-see camera that had failed, amazingly after the warranty expired it expired.  Now this one has done the same thing, but it at least did it before the warranty was up.  The housing seems very solid, but the electronics in it apparently are not.  The image was blurry on the edges and the night vision is barely 30 meters.  The camera started to intermittently quit with out warning.The only good thing I can say about it, the company normal replaces them with little issue when they are under warranty.  Other than that, I would not purchase this item again.  Definitely not worth the cost.  Next time I will look to buy from a different maker.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "security camera", "Author": "Vincent Riley", "ReviewID": "R2IV9YQ35TUBM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have no problems with it it does what it is suppose to do, the video is good it has good night vision.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006WHG6TY"}}
