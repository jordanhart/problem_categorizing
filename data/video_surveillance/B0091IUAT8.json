Lillevig", "ReviewID": "R3AXR67Q9SDBQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought a refurb unit that included the 500GB drive but no cameras.  No problem using the inexpensive night vision cameras I had bought elsewhere.  Setup and documentation is not straight forward but right clicking on the live video screen brings up a list of commands.  Eventually, it mostly starts to make sense.  The biggest issue I had was with the DDNS setup.  I have done this before with cameras that have a built in web server so it was not a real mystery.  Or so I thought.  The biggest issue I had was with the port forwarding.  Nowhere did I see any documentation that indicated that you might have to set each port separately for the webserver and the cameras.  The documentation would lead one to believe that you can just put in a range of ports in your router (e.g.: 4520 to 4524) but mine did not work until I put in each of the six ports individually (those five plus the webserver port).  I'm using DD-WRT on a Linksys 54G router so maybe others don't work that way.  I also tried both the free iPolis DDNS account and the free no-ip account.  I think that you need to set up the DDNS in the DVR and then register your DVR with iPolis.  Apparently the DVR communicates the port to the iPolis website because I didn't see any manual setup for it.  As far as I could tell, you can only access the DVR from the iPolis website.  Maybe there is a logical name that can be used without having to log into their website but I didn't see it.  With no-ip, I don't think you even need to setup up the DDNS in the DVR because no-ip allows you to manually redirect the port number when you create a host.  Also, the only host that you need to create is for the Webviewer (don't need one for the TCP Port).  No-ip also allows you to use a logical name (host name) to access the DVR remotely without having to log into their website.  No-ip has a little download that periodically sends an updated IP address for your home computer just in case the IP changes (some providers do this, others tend to stay static).Update: I did figure out that you can use iPolis to get directly to your DVR using the following format: [...] where xxxxxxxx is the username of the iPolis account you created when registering your DVR.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easiest set up ever", "Author": "A.
