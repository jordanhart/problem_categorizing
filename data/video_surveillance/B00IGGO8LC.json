This is an easy set up and I am no IT person. Clear picture, you can turn off the LED lights and the black and white is still very clear in the dark. Very little delay in video. Sound is clear too.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unstable.", "Author": "BR", "ReviewID": "R1WMAJL11P6DVZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When you try to modify settings it spontaneously reboots and resets back to factory.  There is no support or firmware available on their website.  I expected more, but maybe the reviews were paid or I just got a bad unit.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IGGO8LC"}}
