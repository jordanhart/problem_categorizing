I have them installed, cables run and the system seems to be working fine.  The biggest surprise was the quality of the all-metal mounting brackets... NO Plastic!The camera quality was better than I expected, night vision is about what I expected.The only negative is that it can sometimes take hours sitting on hold before you get through to someone in support.  You can expect a 24-48 hour turn-around on email replies.  The few times I spoke with a Zmodo tech, they were all very nice and anxious to help.I would definitely recommend this package.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too good to be true", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R3E6AUUUNCB8AB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "16 cameras 4 each of different sized bnc wire 1 hard drive/receiver 1 remote with batteries 3 power packs 1 cd and NO BNC to RCA Video cable wtf 700.00 and no cable other then that no complaint", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed no hdmi video output and viewing angle is very narrow.  I've replaced more than half already with better cameras.", "Author": "Firefighter \"Blu-Ray addict\"", "ReviewID": "R136XYQ5F0D4SR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this for our store and missed the fact it only has VGA and RCA video output which is old school analog and not that clear video that you get with digital hdmi.  Kinda defeated the purchase of a good HD monitor.  I've only installed two cameras as of this review and will update when complete but be advised I'd recommend a DVD with hdmi for a better picture.UPDATE: 6/22/13This is an 'ok' system giving you 16 cameras and a DVR.  BUT.... I have started replacing the cameras with better cameras that provide wider viewing because the cameras with this system are very narrow.  The ones with this system are 6mm vs. these 3.6mm dome cameras VideoSecu Day Night Vision Outdoor CCD CCTV Security Dome Camera Vandal-proof 3.6mm Wide View Angle Lens 480TVL with Bonus Power Supply 1Z0 and a few of these 2.8mm-12mm cameras Evertech CCTV Security Camera - 700 TVL, 36 IR, 2,8~12mm Wide Angle ZOOM Vari-focal Lens Metal Dome Camera for Indoor & Outdoor 36 Ir LED Color Home Security Surveillance Dome Camera(Black).  So my suggestion is to find a system that already has cameras with at least 3.6mm wide cameras because they will provide you with much more security then these cameras will.Also, if you are running cable any further than 50 feet I strongly suggest purchasing these ethernet connectors LTS LTA1010 1 Pair Passive Video Balun with Power Connectors along with any Cat5e or Cat6e ethernet cable whatever length you need and NOT USE THE CABLES THAT COME WITH THE UNIT!  Anything over 50 feet will lose clarity and degrade the longer the cable.  Using Ethernet is the best way to insure you will have the best quality video possible.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome video system", "Author": "Firemanbm", "ReviewID": "R1538Q4FX1V27M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome video system.
