{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice system - some assembly required", "Author": "Michael D. Adams", "ReviewID": "RXFR1MN10ZVJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having thefts occur at numerous area farms, we were looking for a basic security recording system to help monitor our family's farm property. The Swann SWDVK-425554-US D1 Security Recording Kit certainly fits the bill. It has many positive features that we were looking for in a security system. Foremost, we don't want to have to \"mess around\" with it often. Thus, the \"set & forget\" continuous 4-channel recording for up to 15 days+ is a positive. Since we are monitoring outdoors, however, the motion detector feature is not really practical. Wind, horses, birds, etc. will all set it off, and there's (to me) always the fear of missing something.We are still working through the set-up on this, actually. We have to locate power to where we want to mount the base unit while still having plenty of distance to mount the cameras. Since each camera comes with a long cable, that should not be an issue based on our planning. However, we also want to make sure the base unit is also secure. What good is a security system if it can be stolen, as well? As such, we are considering building a lockable box. It won't be like putting it in an anchored/fireproof safe, but if we build a large box we can put a monitor in, as well, then close it up to protect from dust and moisture. Keeping that in mind, you WILL need a display for this, in some capacity. It does support VGA, so an older monitor should suffice.If you desire to use the Internet-based \"live viewing\", keep in mind you'll also need an internet connection. I've not gotten to the point of trying to configure this yet, as we do not have a network drop in our shop. As such, I'm hopeful I can use a wireless adapter. I just need time to work through it. It's a nice feature, but is likely to require some thought and configuration before I can use it. But it would be a VERY helpful feature to me for checking on the property and horses when travelling.So all this said, there are several things you should consider regarding this system. It is NOT just \"plug and play\":- You will need to plan the location of your cameras to record as many areas (or zones) as possible- You will need to carefully plan the location of the base unit to ensure your cameras all reach, as they are NOT wireless- You will need to install the cameras and run the wiring to the base unit. If you have an attic (vs. open rafters) this will be more difficult- You will need to ensure there is sufficient power at the location of your base unit- You will need to acquire a display for your unit, such as a computer monitor- You should plan to use a UPS device to protect the base from power surges while also recording during power outages.- You may wish to acquire an external hard drive for saving/transferring video for backup (to keep data for a longer period)Overall, this is a very nice unit and appears to be of good quality workmanship. As noted, it has many great features which will be helpful in keeping our farm secure. It is NOT an alarm system, but would actually be more helpful in catching a criminal who has made an attempt to steal something and has gotten away (it's hard to put an alarm on a gate). Just be aware of what you are getting, what you will need to provide, and what you will need to consider to set it up and you will find this to be a nice system.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great with indoor cameras", "Author": "EMTP EJ \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3FNAB6H0OW7W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only thing you need to provide is:1. the power,2. Display,3. Internet connectionand of course, the manpower to install the (4) cameras and run the cables.1. the power - if you are serious about using this for security / investigation you should have it on a UPS that will run it for a while.2. The display I attached is a flat-screen VGA monitor that I have been keeping around. The USB mouse is included.3. the internet connection seems daunting at first, but it can be accomplished without driving you crazy.4. The cameras are small and light, but they are obviously cameras, but that can be to your advantage. You will need to put them as close as possible to your subject so you can make a good identification - otherwise, why bother? Is you don't need to use all four cameras you can use the cables to extend the length of the run. You will need a pretty small screwdriver to adjust the camera mounts. The power supply for the cameras uses only one outlet and splits the connection to power all the cameras at once. so, you need one outlet for the DVR / Controller, one for the camera power and one for your display.The viewing / recording software is straightforward and easy to use and the camera system automatically switches to infrared as required.This system does not replace an alarm system.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome pic", "Author": "Robert Riggs \"The Music Connection Wholesale\"", "ReviewID": "R3FQTA89P24EDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am still tinkering and setting it up - but out of the box, looks very impressive.  It has lots of nice features, especially the night vision.  It also says it can do smartphone - which I am currently working on.  I am not going to sugar coat it - setting up the networking part for smartphone viewing thus far doesn't seem to be a cake walk.  But, if I can't figure it out - it does offer free support.  But, in a nutshell - it is the entire package you need. It includes the cables needed along with the night vision cameras and dvr which has 500GB of space.  I think it's a great system and worth having for your security needs.Followup - I was trying to get the dvr to display on my Samsung G4 using a app I already had installed - called IP Cam Viewer.  I finally was able to get it to display using the model swann DVR8-3000 for my camera choice (just fyi).", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Swann SWDVK-425554-US D1", "Author": "Tina Brown", "ReviewID": "R2IF3D7BZF59Q6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I installed this security system in our home and used two of the four supplied cameras. We also used a wireless camera that we had from a previous system in order to overcome a limitation where we could not run the wire from the camera to the box. We would have preferred at least one wireless camera to be included so that we could have installed a camera of the same quality.The initial setup was a little complicated because the unit switched to a screen resolution that my television did not support; however, using a computer monitor allowed me to get the initial setup completed correctly. Once configured, the system is easy to use and I was able to connect to my android smart phones, tablet, and a laptop, with only moderate skill required and view live feed. The included cameras provide crystal clear images in both color and black and white depending on light level. The DVR record and playback works well and the ability to save video clips and still images directly on my cell phone is a plus.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of the installation quirks and for no audio capabilities on the included cameras.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Set & forget by recording continuously from 4 channels for 15 days+ onto a massive 500GB hard drive, even longer with motion detection\nSave time & have peace of mind by easily locating incident video, then transfer to external storage via USB, eSATA or network\nSetting up remote viewing has never been easier with Swann's 'My DVR' customizable network configuration\nSurveillance in the palm of your hand with live viewing on 3G/4G-enabled Smartphones & tablets including iPhone, iPad, Android devices, BlackBerry devices and more, and remote notification via email", "Name": "Swann SWDVK-425554-US D1 Security Recording Kit with Internet and Smartphone Viewing  (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SItcSagxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E3E8ZEC"}}
