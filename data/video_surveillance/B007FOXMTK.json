{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera is good except no audio menu", "Author": "Beach Bum", "ReviewID": "RFJFMLKM38OAF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is good especially the infra-red image for night viewing.  Camera movement is a little tricky and not covered in the manual.  I used the \"set\" and \"call\" functions to preset positions which has proven to far superior to manually moving the camera.  Installation is ok, the port forwarding function on your router for remote operation may be a little difficult for non techies, but I figured it out from my routers manual and I'm not a techie.The biggest issue I have with the camera and my reason for 3 stars is that there is no audio menu, so I can't hear or speak anything.  There is supposed to be audio according to ESKY help, but they can't get mine to work.  And the customer service must be Chinese or Asian since the grammar they use in their emails (voice contact not available) seems to reflect that.I have tried 3 different browsers, IE9, Chrome, and Firefox.  IE 9 won't work at all, and even ESKY admits to Explorer incompatibility.  Chrome and Firefox give me an image ok, just no audio.  I also tried the Esky tech forum, but they referred me to Esky help.  I haven't tried the alert modes, not really interested in that.So, if you buy this, don't expect a lot of customer service.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R1EMKMJE534N3R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given it 5 stars but about every 6 months I have to uninstall and reinstall the camera because the software wont recognize the camera.
