Frank", "ReviewID": "ROTMX9PHH0K42", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this for about 3 years and here are some tips for using the GE Smart Home Door Stop Alarm.1. Before purchasing make sure you have enough door spacing that the door stop alarm can be activated by the door opening and depressing the metal activator on the door stop alarm. (If there is not enough spacing then it will just push the stopper away from the door and won't go off)2. When putting it in your baggage or luggage for travel I recommend either taking the battery out so it doesn't accidentally turn on in your bag or putting a piece of tape over the switch so it doesn't move.3. When placing the device in your door, give it a test by opening the door and checking that it will activate the alarm. You can also place something heavy behind the door stop alarm so that it won't slide when the door is opened and touches it, raising the chances that it will depress the activator.4. Make sure you keep some spare 9V batteries around for this and that you have one before you throw this in your bag. Check the battery by testing the alarm before you pack it away.5. Place this on your door at every hotel you visit. This also makes a great gift for frequent travelers.6. You need a small Phillips head to access the battery compartment.If you have more feel free to add them below. Thanks!4.5 stars for it being too easy to accidentally switch the alarm to on in your bag and a pain in the butt to change the battery.

I got this to place in my garage's side door, because, for me, that door should never be opened from the outside first. You'd always be going out from the garage first, in which case you'd just remove the alarm first. There's a few problems with this:1. Doors in garages tend to have a very low gap between the bottom of the door and the garage floor. This gap is less than the angle this doorstop wedge is made to handle. Thereby, the door effortlessly pushes the wedge along the floor out of the way.2. It does, however, sort of work if I place the wedge on the last 1/3 segment of the door (on the hinge side). However, if you place the wedge there, then if you didn't know the alarm was there and just opened the door with a fair amount of force (like a kick), the door will cause the wedge to angle up on it's nose and topple over.3. Even if you placed the wedge on a door with a big enough gap, you can circumvent this design. The grip pad on the bottom only works if pressure is being applied from the top (from the door pressing down on it). If you know the wedge is there, you can get around it by slowly opening the door. You'll most likely push the wedge away instead of apply pressure to the top and cause it to stick. You could also probably just push it out of the way with a stick or something thin if the gap under the door is big enough.4. You might ask \"how would they know it's there before it goes off?\" Well, the alarm only chirps while the wedge is being pressed down on. So the instant you hear it going off you might draw the door back to yourself, and that will silence it. If your-would-be thief wasn't scared away at this point, he could probably figure out how to deal with it. When I crept the door open to test it, the alarm only went off for about as long as a smoke alarm chirps when the battery is low before I pulled the door back. That might not be enough to wake you up or get anyone's attention.All in all, I'd give it a 3/5. It's okay for the price and works well as an extra layer of security.

Just add a 9-volt battery and you have an instant burglar alarm! Perfect for apartment/condo dwellers, travelers and the mechanically disinclined. It's also great for interior doors (e.g. bedroom) for an extra layer of security, or as a supplemental night-time alarm for the main entry door and for other exterior doors, especially French and other glass doors. It would be all but impossible to open the door more than an inch without setting off the alarm.From here -depending on your floor surface -- the grip-bottom on the door stop may prevent the door from opening further at all, or would at least require extra time and effort (with the alarm still squealing away), buying you a few more seconds to respond. The hope, as with any forced entry, is that the alarm will (a) draw ample attention to the intruder, who will hopefully flee the premises, and (b) alert you to the intruder, so that you can call 911 and take whatever defensive measures you can.Other reviewers reported that the bottom did not grip their floors. In some cases, I suspect the culprit for this may be an incorrect placement of the battery. The terminals MUST face the small end of the battery compartment, or it will cause the base plate to bow out ever-so-slightly -- just enough to keep it from making solid contact with the floor. (It took me a few minutes of head-scratching to figure this one out.). Once I got the battery correctly installed, I tried it on 3 different wood floors, a tile floor and a linoleum floor, and it gripped like a charm. The only surface I didn't try was carpet. Before buying, I would suggest measuring the gap under your door, because this door stop would probably not work with a tiny gap of less than 1/4\" or on a large gap (I'm guessing anything over 1\"). My door gaps ranged from 1/2\" to 3/4\" and this size range was just right.I think one review complained that it was too sensitive. We tested ours to see if it would go off with misc. household vibrations (stomping on the floor, bumping against the door) and it thankfully didn't. The only caveat I'd offer is to be sure to turn off the alarm before picking it up in the morning, as handling it will set it off in a heartbeat.Some reviewers complained that it wasn't loud enough. We found the alarm to plenty loud for our purposes. It's reportedly 120 decibels, which is probably about right. For comparison, a smoke detector is about 85 decibels, a car horn about 110 decibels.

Super loud, and will stop or at least make it difficult for a door to be opened wide enough for an intruder to enter.  I tested one out on my husband by placing it at the door he normally enters through.  It stopped him, scared him and did just what I hoped it would do.  He kind of got mad at me and hollered a few explicatives but it was worth it! We have one door that is on a raised threshold so I set the door stop alarm on a book and the door hits it squarely when opened just a little bitty bit.  It's loud - ear piercing loud and that's good as it should scare the bejeebers out of a bad person.  On doors that have windows through which the unwanted guest might peer through and see the doorstop, just by placing a light weight towel or papers over it disguises completely.  They'll just think your a slob and leave newspapers on the floor.My mom was thrilled with her doorstops.  Anything to help parents stay safe is money well-spent.Be aware of how all of your doors open since they won't do any good on doors that open to the outside.  The 9 volt battery was a tad difficult to install but I'm not complaining.  For my mom I had to write in big letters with a felt permanent marker ON and OFF so she could easily turn them off when not in use and not waste batteries or scare her by an accidental alarm.  We'll be taking some of these with us on vacation.  These are really great!UPDATE:  December 1, 2011 - I have bought several more of these because they are so practical and good at what they do.  I've learned to pick them up by holding the sides of them lest I accidentally hit the metal plate on top and hear it's ear-breaking scream.  I've taken at least one of these on overnight trips to put against the door in our hotel rooms.

I love it!  It fits nicely under/near any doorway, and because the silver metal top is lightweight metal, it triggers easily, which is great.  It'll startle anyone coming in, because you will have to put your hands over your ears, it's that loud.  There is an instructional demo video of this alarm online. The price is unbeatable.Improvements are several.  For instance, it shrieks when it is depressed by the door, but the minute it is no longer depressed (i.e the person shuts the door again), the alarm is off.  Wouldn't it be nice to have the option that, once activated, the thing keeps a shrill alarm going.  If it shuts off, the intruder may think the system is now off.  He can hear it shut off on the other side of the door!  It'd sound like a real wired alarm if it would only stay activated.It take a 9V battery.  AA and AAA batteries are much more common these days, and would be preferred for this device, particularly as many small mom and pop stores that you might find on a vacation or remote area have AAA and AA but not 9V batteries.Also, you should remove the battery when not in use, to prevent leakage and ruining the device, plus slow battery drain, but--aha--you have to take the battery door off with a tiny screwdriver, like you'd get in a small parts/computer kit (not a regular size Phillips head driver).  The crooks aren't going to get in the door, so please make the batteries easier to get at for those of use who are good guys already inside.  I just don't carry a small Phillips screwdriver with me on vacation, GE!There is an \"on/off\" switch on this, which is nice, but it's fragile and small and located on the heel of the device---this is precisely where you will kick the device to get it under the door jam.  It's chincy, like it'll eventually break.  Move the switch please, for instance, recessed in the bottom.I'm giving it three stars.We keep one by our back entry door.

It is exactly what it appears to be, a door stop with an alarm.  Couldn't be simpler, and works as advertised.I use it along with a security bar.  Therefore, I have two independent items (the bar and the door stop) that actually block the door from opening, and the alarm feature of the door stop is an added bonus.  Obviously, this only works for doors that swing into the room.This is a very nice and inexpensive product that, if someone tried to come through the door, would at least slow them down, while simultaneously alerting me that something was wrong.  Combined with a security bar, it will slow them down even more. I highly recommend getting both. I now feel much better about what I saw as a weak spot in home security.  Again, this is not to suggest that it makes the door as strong as Fort Knox, and I have no illusions that a determined intruder isn't going to make it through.However, any intruder is going to find his path to be physically more difficult, and is going to create major noise.  That gives me time to react and call the police, if needed.  Hopefully, there never will be an intruder, and if there is one perhaps he'll be more likely to run away once he sets the alarm off (and he WILL set it off).In any event, I definitely sleep more soundly in part because of this inexpensive little gadget.I should also mention that when I've tested it by putting pressure on the door stop, the alarm has worked every time.  On the other hand, there have been zero false alarms, which is a problem that plagues some security products, but isn't a problem for this one at all.

However, I do not think that it is a deal breaker.I feel this is a very well made product but do not think one should think it is strong enough to stop an intruder.  It is simply a deterrent.  This does not come with the required 9 volt battery.  The battery fits behind a screwed in cover.  There is a large friction mat on the bottom of the device to guard against slippage.  It has a small on/off switch to conserve battery life.

McAdams", "ReviewID": "RVNY68XIMNA75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this along with a Door Jammer / Portable Door Security Device when I travel. I use them both on the room door if there is only one door for the room. However, frequently when I travel I get a suite, and for the inner door for the bedroom, I put this doorstop/alarm, while I use the door jammer on the actual door to the suite.The door stop/alarm is very loud, and will easily wake you up, and will likely scare off a burglar (you're rolling the dice on whether it would scare of a criminal intent on something other than robbery/burglary, though).The door stop/alarm uses a 9 volt battery (not included), and requires a SMALL Phillips head screwdriver to install the battery. I would advise you to just go ahead and pack the screwdriver along with the unit, as I tend to unhook the battery and flip it around when I don't intend to use it (such as when I am packing it into the suitcase) -- thus preventing accidental alarm sounding during transit.To use the unit, once the battery is installed, simply flip the switch to armed, and then press the device under the door so that it is in contact with the door. When I set it, I am usually traveling alone for business, so I KNOW that nobody should be in that room but myself, so I wedge the thing under the door as far as it can go, without it actually setting off the alarm. It has a rubber bottom, and it has a little bit of heft to it, but on linoleum or tile or wood, I would be worried about the device catching properly and thus activating the alarm. Hence my wedging it under the door as far as it will go, so that it is basically on a hair trigger.Final note, if there is a large gap under the door you want to use this on, it would be trivial for anyone but the dumbest/drunkest of thieves/burglars to see the device and push it carefully away from the door without triggering the alarm. So, you should have a backup plan with you in case the door you need to use this on has too high of a gap.4 stars.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great for apartment!", "Author": "jlundin", "ReviewID": "R1M068R6N3HTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just recently moved into a townhome and no longer could hear the front door since we are renting we cannot install a security system and living in San Antonio that is something that is good to have.

Not having the notional security of established hotels, this seemed like a good way to scare off any \"casual\" intruders. What I didn't count on was that the exterior doors on nearly half of the places we stayed opened to the outside, making the doorstop irrelevant. Fortunately, my concern about security turned out to be a non-issue.The doorstop itself works great though. Really easy to set to \"on\" and place at the door. The alarm is really loud and piercing, so I have no doubt that all but the most determined intruders would be scared off immediately upon setting it off.One thing I recommend: if you pack this in checked luggage, disconnect the battery first.
