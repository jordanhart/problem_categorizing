Dealing with an issue with either my wi-fi or the camera, but when connected via wi-fi, all my wi-fi devices lost connection and I had to reboot the router every day to get connection back once again.  This happened on 2 separate routers, so I have to imagine it is the camera.  I ended up using 1 of my other routers as a wireless client and connected the camera to it with the wired connection, it has been running fine for a week.  I may try a dedicated wi-fi router to see if that one craps out like the others, just to be sure.  The app works great, again, very impressed with it all, even the picture quality is decent.  All this for $50... Would recommend to others.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Madmaxinsa \"Max\"", "ReviewID": "R3MZOC95XT3164", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works great.  I have an i-phone and downloaded the app from the app store and it worked good.  When I switched over to WiFi the camera did not pan as smoothly.  For the price you cannot beat it.  I also like the alert feature and you can either take a photo or video right on your iphone.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seems to be a great camera for the price", "Author": "Robert D. Weis", "ReviewID": "RMOIP0KX1F545", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a cheap IP cam for a home automation project. I picked it up for $49.99 and had fairly low expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out it works pretty well. Set up was a breeze, and the apps work well (both Android and iOS).  One con is that you can't talk and listen at the same time over the two way audio, which can lead to some awkward conversations.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks great but not friendly use at all", "Author": "Jame", "ReviewID": "R1CARW0CVNCSPZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Basically, the manual is hopeless and also there is no support. The set up is extremely difficult if you want to have useful function as described. If you just want to simply watch, it can be easy to set it up. If you want to use motion related function, it is almost impossible to get it work. I spent at least 3-4 days to have it partially function. You need to use several software to get it work. Remember - some of software from the web can not be downloaded because of warning sign...", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera, very poor instructions and incomplete software.", "Author": "Richard S. Walsh", "ReviewID": "R3E83OSCE2BR0X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these cameras and I have yet to get them fully operational.The cameras I received look like they are really nice for the money. The cameras have numerous connections for alarms, SD memory cards, etc. and can be programmed for numerous functions.The problem is that the instructions are totally lacking in support. They do not tell you how to set up the functions, alarms, remote notifications, preset positions, etc.. There is a software update on the companies website that has updates written in Chinglish. Warning! if you download the upgrade it will destroy the operating parameters that make the camera work partially now. The company warns you after you contact them that the software is corrupt and that you should not download.Another item I should mention is that even though you can partially control features from a full size desktop computer, you cannot control many of the functions from your smart phone or tablet or iPad. These portables lack the ability to zoom in or out and to change most of the setup parameters which makes full control while traveling nearly impossible. At the present time the company does not know when they will have detailed instructions or updated and completely functioning software.It would be a great camera I think if I can ever get it to function fully. Beware that you will spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make it work. It makes a nice coat hook.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Useless Paperweight! Not an IP camera.
