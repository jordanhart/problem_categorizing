Rebadged and sold for 2-300$ more. You kidding me? I had a lorex that the harddrive died on. I didn't want to mess with it b/c it was hard to setup and you had to use lorex subdomains to point to your cable internet dynamic IP. Though it's a free service, they should allow you to choose your own (I've been using dyn.com for years).So... how are the lorex and kguard machines the same? Wait... They were both identical... Same unit, remote, same mouse, same color scheme, same inside hardware (had to remove Kguards cover to install a harddrive). I can't believe I spent 600$ on the first lorex unit (i'm ashamed). The only difference is on Kguard, they allow the use of  your own dns service (dyn.com) while lorex makes it mandatory for you to register with them and use their free dns services.Since my rant is out of the way. Same setup plug and play basically. I'll continue to buy Kguard b/c it's cheaper and same units as the more expensive lorex units. If you have the cams already and just need the unit, buy this!
