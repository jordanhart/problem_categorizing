This High Definition surveillance system offers crystal clear video with live viewing, recording, and playback in full 1080P. Other brand HD systems only offered 30 frames per second(FPS) at full 1080P for live viewing only.Another great feature on this system is that it allows me to zoom in on license plates and the cash register at my service station. I can just use the mouse(which is included) to create a box over any object and zoom in to clearly see the images.I would highly recommend purchasing the Clover HDV4324.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CBO5ACG"}}
