A TON of VALUE for what I paid.", "Author": "YeahSoMaybe? \"computersandmusicperson\"", "ReviewID": "RPNY4S603OBUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "REVISED REVIEW 12/07/13 of the QC818-461  (8 POE channel NVR with 4 cameras & remote)PROs:  All 8 channels have POE (Power Over Ethernet) - enough to power your average IP camera.  Q-SEE is well known and established.  So far I get quick responses to emails from their tech support.  It comes with 4, 720p IR LED (internal Infrared night lighting).  Cameras have built-in mounts.  The software (in firmware) looks unassuming at first but it is VERY good and VERY well thought out.  Everything you need is here, if you just look for it.  It comes with 4, 100ft rolls of Cat5e Ethernet cable.  The DVR has expansion room for a 2nd hard drive that you (yes you) can install). ** sometimes ** (not always), one or two of my Q-see cameras that are more exposed to the elements just deliver video in black and white.  When the temperature warms up (it's winter right) and/or when the sun is fully up (say 7:45am) the issue goes away.  My nicer cameras that I bought separately lose color saturation by degrees - not all at once.  The Q-see IP cameras are still probably better than most \"Old skool\" (analog) CCTV cameras out there.  It was very simple for me to obtain and add an additional 1 Terabyte SATA hard drive to this unit.  10 minutes and a Philips screwdriver.  You connect two cables and you're done. I now have a 2 Terabyte system since adding the additional 1 Terabyte drive.  With 5 cameras in use, set to high quality,I can go easily 5-6 days of constant recording without having to overwrite any video.  Have not setup motion triggering on this system and don't know if I even want to.  The replay (review of recorded video) software they give you (under \"Search\") lets you go back and winnow things down to time slots of days, hours, 30 minute window, etc.CONS so far:*This Q-See 818-461-1 NVR does NOT transfer data and display images from my 3 megapixel Hikvision IR IP camera (which is great in every other way - I view those pics on my PC.)  Q-See vendor support confirmed this re Hikvision camera incompatibility.* Only 6 character passwords allowed.  It should be minimum 12.  I don't like this but it's a minor complaint in an otherwise good value.* The Ethernet cable needs to be unwound carefully.  Reason: Highly prone to kinking when weather is colder and you are doing cable pulls through a 3/4 or 1\" hole saw hole.I can recommend this \"as is\" if you are in \"Get it done\" mode on a budget.HEADS UP / FYI:  If you want to run a high current gain POE device like a PTZ camera with a built-in heater, etc, this Q-See system may not have enough POE power to cover multiple high drain devices.I bought this setup because some jerk stole two packages off my porch a couple weeks ago.  The first thing the police said is:  Did you see the theft happen at the moment it happened?  Do you have any pictures?  I immediately arranged to have all packages sent to my work location and then I immediately ordered this setup.  I * was * planning on (next year) building a mega system based on a Synology NVR, but I needed something NOW for peace of mind.I will soon also have a 2nd system (Windows 7 Pro PC with Foscam \"Blue Iris\" software installed.  So my particular system (when it's finished) will be a hybrid of this Q-See off-the-shelf setup and a Windows setup.There is another big box store in the US (W something) that typically sells this kit/package at $100less (sometimes even $200 off) brand new.  I knowingly paid the extra $200 to Amazon due to their excellent customer return policy and backing.  Turns out that was unnecessary.  Now knowing how reliable this system is and that I want to keep it, if I could do it over again, I might have gone with an Amazon seller to save some bucks.  It's just that security camera systems were new to me a few weeks ago.THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING YOU WILL DEAL WITH * ANY * WIRED SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM:  Pulling multiple Ethernet cable runs for multiple outdoor mounted cameras YOURSELF in the winter.  Not for everybody.I did all the drilling and wire-pulling and trips back and forth to the attic and outside ladders 12 feet up on my own.  I drilled holes in my house in places to make this happen (involves later patching/painting, etc). It's LOT of work if you are installing more than 1 camera.  Heck it's a lot of work PERIOD.  Not for the faint of heart if you have no background in it or are not handy with tools, etc.  If you are not up for that consider having an electrician do a \"proper\" Ethernet wiring pull.  I would place a value on my personal aggravation of the cable pull of $500.00 easily.  The amount of cussing, trips to the attic, going under the crawl spaces, yadda yadda.  Do you really want to spend your free time this way?  If so, yeah it works.  Note: If you want to reduce the size of holes you drill in your house, you would want to acquire RJ-45 male ethernet plugs, an RJ-45 crimp tool ($25.00) and Google/download a color layout instructions for the \"pin out\" (wiring layout) of Cat5e Ethernet connector.  Plan B, if you are in a hurry..you * could * drill much larger holes than the cable itself(i.e. 7/8\") in your house and feed the uncut 100ft Ethernet cable through the hole as is and leave all the excess cable in your attic or crawl space, then recaulking, repainting the hole.  It's certainly a less professional method by a longshot but you'll get it done.  (Not everyone has 500+ dollars to pay an electrician for a wiring pull.)  IF you really have no clue of where your 110V wiring is or your plumbing, etc - just give it up and have a professional do this.  It's not worth your sanity or your health.Note:  Wireless has it's own issues if you are going past a 2 camera high definition install (bandwith saturation, etc).  If you want multiple high-def cameras, I suggest an Ethernet wired (POE - Power Over Ethernet) system like this.NOTE2:  I'm buying an Android smartphone so I can check on the house while I'm away.  This Q-See system supports remote access.S U M M A R Y:  For price point, scope and function, I don't know how they did it.  It's great.  A lot of bang for the buck if you want to put up a working system quickly without going broke.  Highly Recommended.________________________________________________________________Epilog:If you have the bucks to spare, improvements would go in these steps:1. Consider either buying only the Q-See NVR without Q-See brand camera and instead purchase some Dahua cameras.  --  OR ---2. Building a fast Windows 7 PC, purchasing BlueIris software and a switch that supports 4 or 8 POE ports.  Note:  BlueIRIS is a CPU hog.  You'd need a powerful PC for that.  However this Q-see system will beat the Windows system as far as turnkey (instant use) integration and will consume a heck of a lot less power (the ARM brand CPU in the Q-SEE is a low power consumption CPU running Linux OS).  --  OR ---3.  If you're going for the best, consider purchasing a mid-level or better ($600 on up) Synology NAS system with the per camera licenses and hard drives to fill it upOn the other hand:  The two Dahua 1.3 MP cameras I ordered were discovered almost immediately by the QC818 unit.  The Dahua's deliver excellent imaging with this NVR.  There is a list of 8 vendors (Axis, Arecont, Panasonic, I forget the rest - NO Hikvision) and then there's a few \"generic\" brand categories (Private, Onvia) for camera suppliers.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION (aka \"LPR\"):If you have a \"must do\" need to pick up vehicle license plates at night (i.e. to be able to clearly \"resolve\" the letters and numbers when headlights and streetlights are on), then these Q-see cameras are unlikely to do that.  That's not a shortcoming on their part.  Neither will 99% of the security cameras out there.You have to find and purchase a special camera like this:  Geovision GV-Hybrid LPR 10R 1.3MP Hybrid LPR Camera  WHY?  The exposure range is deliberately darkened and the shutter speed is increased to freeze cars in motion or illumunated with glare from headlights, security floodlights reflecting off plate, etc.  Axis also makes a model that will reliably pick up license plates if you raise the shutter speed on it.  The drawback to these specialized cameras?  1.  They are relatively large and expensive [$850 on up]  2.  The picture output for anything BUT the license plates will look awfully dark. There are technical design reasons for this.  THIS MEANS:  You don't want to purchase a specialized LPR camera as a primary view camera.  You should use an LPR(License Plate Recognition) camera only as an * ADJUNCT * to a conventional camera if you are saving evidence to present to authorities.  Otherwise it's difficult to argue/show the overall context of what is being witnessed._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE 3-15-2014My security camera system was instrumental in catching two gas thiefs at a neighboring business last night.  The police liked having the videos with timestamps as corroborating evidence.P.S.  TIP re:  When pulling your files off the Q-SEE main recording unit onto your USB storage device:  Make sure that, once you have marked off all the session clips that you are going to save as offloaded files, that you hit \"Pause\" on the unit.  Reason:  The file transfer(backup) will then go faster as you are not asking the ARM CPU in the unit to both render video while you are simultaneously interleaving the backup process.P.P.S.  I don't use the Motion Detection on this unit.  Motion Detection is tricky even on expert systems.  I have no illusions that a unit of this price point with more or less fixed firmware is going to handle Motion Detection correctly.  For my purposes it's not a big deal, for yours it might be.  If you want Motion Detection, consider getting a powerful PC with Foscam Blue-Iris or some other more sophsiticated system.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but could use a little refinement", "Author": "Autobot Trader", "ReviewID": "R36KV8RSH984KO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Q-See NVR purchase. First I got the 4 channel NVR and now an 8 channel NVR. The POE cameras are great since you only have to run a single thin cat5e wire. It's cleaner if you have the tools / ability to cut the wire to length and put your own ends on.  Also, it was cheaper to get the whole system with 4 cameras than the cameras separately. Also, S@ms club has it real cheap.Here are some observations that may save you some time:-Be prepared to spend some quality time getting to know the interface. This is the fun part right? Once it's setup you can mainly use your smartphone for monitoring.-The setup interface on the NVR can not configure all the functions. The included PSS software also can not configure all the functions. You will need to use both the NVR itself and the PSS software to properly configure the NVR. I suggest setting it up with a monitor and mouse next to your PC and go through the configuration first on the NVR then install the PSS and go through all the options again until you have it working. Again, neither interface can completely configure it alone and this is why I knocked off a star. To top it off, its not like a whole function is done with a particular interface, its just certain check-boxes and fields that show up in one vs the other.-The PSS software has its own user ID / password separate from the NVR. Don't get them confused.-Use PSS to format the HDD. In PSS, add your device then under Device List right click your device and select Advanced --> Device Config. Under Advanced --> HDD Management you can format the drive and it will reboot. This was one of the steps I took on both NVRs before it was working properly. I'm not sure if this was necessary but it can't hurt when its new.-If you are wondering why it is recording all the time it is because it defaults to \"manual\" for the extra stream. Go to the same place where you format the drive but choose Record then Extra Stream then set it to Schedule.-The PSS software GUI was corrupted looking on Windows 8. I fixed this by right clicking the desktop and choosing screen resolution then \"Make text and other items larger or smaller\". I then set it to \"Smaller - 100% (default). Apparently it don't work properly with larger settings.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good but a few warts", "Author": "Tyler Forge \"realist\"", "ReviewID": "RBCZWUIJGRIFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to amend a glowing review after trying out the remote monitoring solutions.  This is still a five star product though.Following the instructions, I think it takes less than five minutes to hook everything up and see two channels of video on the monitor.  In my case, there were three channels because I happened to have a Dahua IP camera sitting around.  Dahua and Q-See are currently the same company so you'd expect compatibility.  A Foscom camera didn't work with the Q-See controller - probably because it is an older Foscom that doesn't support the standard RTSP protocol.  The POE (power over ethernet) camera connections make setting this thing up too easy.A computer browser aimed at port 85 of the control unit brought up a display quite similar to that on the directly connected monitor except that the video frames were dark.  Ignoring the instructions and trying port 554 (the default RTSP port) did not work.  Following the instructions and opening port 85 did work.  Again departing from the instructions, the Chrome browser worked even though it isn't officially supported.  Chrome asked if it should allow quicktime to run, OK chrome, do it.  And that was that.  Any browser that can run quicktime should work.  There are probably other compatible browser plug-ins.  In time, even quicktime won't be needed as browsers will natively support the video encoding.I did not use Internet Explorer because that meant installing an active-x component on the computer.  Huge security risk.  Browser plug-ins are at least somewhat contained, especially if you are not using your computer's admin account.  Active-x components can pretty much do whatever they want to your entire computer.Regardless, it only took a few mouse clicks (six to be exact) to tell the browser interface which video stream to display in which frame.  The picture quality is very good even through Wi-Fi.  I was in love.  So easy to set up and pretty much everything I wanted.  But then, the negatives started to become apparent.  Please note - these negatives are listed here as constructive feedback to Q-See.  This is still a great product and impossible to beat at its price point.The biggest negative is the default user account on the Q-See control unit.  Q-See has a difficult trade-off to make.  An operator, like me, can change the passwords on the admin and user accounts and then lose the passwords.  Many manufacturers leave \"back doors\" into their systems so that customer support can access the unit to reset passwords and be otherwise helpful.  Q-See is honest enough to not hide the back door.  On the other hand, anyone with the right password can use that back door.  So, the Q-See controller is an unsecured device sitting on your home network.  If you configure the device for remote monitoring then any hacker can access the device, and your network.  Q-See's alternative is to get rid of the back door and thereby make customer support more difficult.The next biggest problem is that it is apparently impossible to monitor the video with a tablet or smart phone.  The Q-See apps are horrible.  I tested both the ipad and the android versions and got neither to work.  An hour messing with the apps is enough to pass judgment.  On the other hand, Q-See has been smart enough to use and support open standards, which is why Chrome-with-Quicktime on the laptop computer worked.  It is only a matter of time before every tablet and smart phone browser also supports those standards.  So, this problem will simply disappear without Q-See's involvement.The final problem I'll list here is that the video frame in the browser froze when I unplugged a camera.  It blacked out on the monitor but froze in the browser.  A frozen display is bad because it looks like everything is OK when in reality someone disabled the camera.  The only hint of a problem is that the clock is also frozen.  Luckily, the clock in each video stream shows seconds and it's very easy to spot a frozen display if you look for it.In summary, this is a great product at its price point but that requires a little more engineering to make perfect.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "No External Controls or Remote - Still an Outstanding Value", "Author": "J. Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R10HT9U1L3FSQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having a network video recorder is a new experience for me, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect in terms of setting it up and the quality of its performance. The setup was simple, and the QC814 offers some outstanding options for modifying recording modes, schedules, and remote viewing streams to maximize performance based on local network bandwidth, and broadband service capabilities.The interface is somewhat complex at first glance, but one read through the user\u2019s manual and some experimentation quickly results in a sensibly navigable menu system. Cameras can have their operational attributes assigned individually, or assigned in an across the board manner. The remote viewing stream can have overlays assigned to sensitive areas, such as where an entryway keypad exists, which is a cool feature for security peace of mind.Motion detection sensitivities can be altered, and a grid-style customization overlay provides selection and removal of areas to which attention should be given for motion monitoring, such as flapping flags and bushes or trees that sway.The PoE [power over Ethernet] feature provides a clean cabling solution, eliminating the need to supply additional power lines to each camera. My configuration came with two one-hundred foot runs of riser-rated CAT5e cable; for those with the ability to crimp their own cables, the two-hundred feet of cable can come in handy for additional cameras. With the PoE feature, comes an additional adaptor to power the NVR\u2019s PoE block, so expect to use up two outlets.I consider this an excellent kit for basic residential security. If there is any chance that more than four channels of monitoring might be required, I would start out with a unit with more channels, even though I am content with one camera at the front porch and one overlooking the front of the house where I park, with two PoE ports to spare, I could see how more would be desirable in situations where no field of view should be left without coverage, such as on larger estates or in setups that include indoor monitoring, as well.The QC814, despite its powerful features, leaves me wishing it had support for a remote control, so that I could review or react to alerts without getting up to go to the box for the mouse. There are no convenience buttons on the unit either, only LED indicators and various ports. The good news is that the QC814 is an incredibly compact unit, which is one thing that I love about it; this makes up for the lack of remote, but I still would have liked it to have one.I recommend the QC814 for those seeking a low cost, flexible, and compact all-in-one solution. The most difficult tasks are running the cable and drilling new holes in the house; other than that, the rest is cake. It\u2019s a pleasure to use, with intelligent remote alert options, segment clipping for USB backup and tons of other features that make it a worthy investment overall.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "A professional system at a do it yourself price.", "Author": "Judy Smith \"judylynnsbooks\"", "ReviewID": "RQ80ZR84BJ4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good system for the price. It was easy to install and  the instructions are clear. The HD resolution is great! Ever watch surveillance footage on TV, like on the news when a crime has been committed and the authorities need the public's help identifying the perpetrator? And the video is terrible and you wonder why? If the victim had one of these systems installed you'd look at the footage and say (for example) \"Hey, that's my brother-in-law\" instead of \"Well, we might be able to help if you hadn't cheaped out on you security system...\"Seriously, there's no point in installing a system if it doesn't provide usable video. You might as well install dummy deterrent cameras and keep your fingers crossed. HD is pretty much the standard these days and doesn't cost much more than low resolution systems. The viewed motion is smooth, not the frame-by-frame jerky motion of lesser systems.This is an excellent choice for either the home or small business user. The night vision is rated to 100 feet but realistically  is most visible in the under 50 foot range but that should be adequate for most users. It works to 100; just expect a little degradation in clarity. Your experience may differ.Everything you need is in the box. It's expandable to 8 cameras if needed, and has audio capability if needed. The 1 terabyte hard drive provides plenty of storage and it has streaming ability. The Power-Over-Ethernet ports are a nice touch, they cut down on installation time and cost by eliminating extra wiring and labor costs.This unit also comes with a remote control if you prefer to use the unit that way instead of using your mouse or one of the free mobile apps.Q-see has a pretty good name in the  industry, I'll admit that I wasn't familiar with the company until I started researching them. They have an excellent website with support tips, installation help, and contact information readily available if you need further assistance. They seem to be committed to quality and in the business for the long haul.

I like that the system comes with all the necessary equipment including the 8 channel digital NVR, 4 cameras with night vision, and all the cables, so this is a better value than having to buy it all separately. The quality of the recordings is excellent during the day but a little fuzzy with the night recordings, although you can still easily see people and objects. We installed 1 camera by the garage, one on the side of the house, and two in the back of the house. Our house is white so the white cameras blend in nicely and are small enough to be hidden so potential burglars and vandals can't really see them unless they knew where to look. I love that we can monitor our property with smartphone app so if we are away on vacation or even at work, we can see what's going on and don't have to worry about the safety of our home.As great as this system is, I'm giving it 4 stars because it was very complicated to set everything up and took my husband, who is a computer expert in the IT field, a few hours to install. The other thing is that the cameras are very motion sensitive, which is great because you want them to pick up motion obviously, but it was detecting things like leaves blowing and our next door neighbor's dog, so we had to adjust the sensitivity. Overall, this is a great product to monitor your property and I would definitely recommend it but have someone who knows electronics to help you.

Matheny", "ReviewID": "R2QY5NWON787AI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently, we expanded our store and needed to add some new security cameras; but, as I was searching to upgrade our existing system, I came across this system that used POE cameras.  Since I had to replace the DVR and add 4 new cameras anyway, I decided it was worth it to just upgrade to a completely new POE system - and this has turned out to be an excellent system![*** Installation ***]Before installing, I pulled the NVR apart and replaced the single 1TB hard drive with 2x 2TB drives.  There was nothing complicated about that at all - and the extra power and SATA cables were all provided.Since I didn't know much about POE before this, I did some research to verify that it works with standard Ethernet cables - and that has turned out to be an excellent benefit.  In fact, the technology is so cool that I went though and switched our VOIP phones over to POE once this project was done. :)The install itself was extremely straightforward since you really don't have to do anything more than run an Ethernet cable to each camera.  The system includes pre-built cables; but, we just built our own to the correct length.Once everything was installed, the configuration took a little more thought - but was still fairly simple.  The system does offer a ton of configuration options, so it took a bit to be sure everything was setup correctly.I also wanted to keep the NVR in a secure location, while being able to monitor it from the primary work areas.  We ended up running an HDMI cable from the NVR to an HDMI splitter and then plugged in 2x 50' HDMI cables to go to different monitors that were already hung on the wall.  This provided exactly what I had been looking for - and was a far better solution than what we had previously.[*** Performance ***]The cameras are a huge step forward compared to the previous cameras we had, so it may not be completely fair to compare them directly - but they look great!  We have a couple of cameras that are running in complete darkness in our vault, and the picture is still excellent.  Honestly, it looks like the lights are on full.We ended up using the 4 cameras that were bundled with this system and then purchased 3 more Dahua IPC-HFW4100S cameras, which seem to be almost identical in quality to the cameras in this system - but they cost a bit less.  We also added on one Dahua IPC-HDB3200C/2.8 camera to cover our back entry - and that also looks excellent.It's interesting because, even though the performance, picture, and overall quality seem better in almost every way than our previous system, there is an occasional glitch from the network - which is a reminder that these are using standard IP technology.  (We are using the integrated 8 port switch, so there isn't any other traffic on our camera network, but the frame rate and quality are cranked to the highest level for all the cameras.)I also like how the display can be configured to have one main area in the screen and then the rest of the cameras forming a border.  That lets us monitor the front of our store directly to know if people up there need help, while still monitoring the other areas that require security.At this point, I haven't had a chance to mess with remote viewing the cameras - but I plan to get that setup just so I can check out the store if the alarm ever goes off - without having to drive over there or sending the police.[*** Conclusion ***]Overall, I can't think of anything bad to say about this system.  For the quality and performance, I would have expected to pay a lot more money - so the value is definitely there!If you're looking for good security cameras with a video recorder, then I would highly recommend this system.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "System OK - Tech Support = ZERO", "Author": "Wiljamz", "ReviewID": "R2JZGEOARQYRMT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We are a small business and purchased this to monitor our production lines.  I connected it to our network and assigned it a fixed IP address so I did not use the built in POE ports.  I purchased Trendnet TPE-S44 POE switches to power the cameras.  720P cameras provide excellent resolution and clarity.Problems arose when I upgraded the firmware to the \"latest\" version on their web site version 20130930.  It came with firmware version 20121220 which seemed to work fine.After I upgraded the images began freezing for several seconds at a time.  The motion would eventually resume on its own but this left gaps in my recordings.  Unacceptable of course.It is very easy to contact Q-see technical support.  The problem is they are just not that technical.I sent them screen shots pertinent to the issue but all they do is send links to their manuals that have nothing to do with the real issue.  They do not actually assist in troubleshooting.After they send a link to a manual that has nothing to do with the real issue they send another email saying they are glad they were able to solve the problem and the case will automatically close in three days.I am staying with the old firmware for now.

Following the instructions was easy, most of my time was spent planning where I wanted to put the cameras for the best area coverage and which by itself took me about a full day to install the cameras in their respective locations, run the cat6 cable through tight attic spaces and walls to a central location for the NVR hookup.  I also choose to cut and crimp my own cable lengths vs using the included 100 ft Cat5e cable bundles from Q-See so this took additional time.  The POE camera connections was a nice to have so that I didn't have to install a separate injector or wire an additional power outlet, but others may want to buy a injector separately depending on their specific requirements.NVR:The unit is fairly compact, but is not quiet.  Plus with the POE connections you get an additional swishing noise when the cameras come online.  Suggest trying to make sure you find a secluded location (closet etc) where you will not want to hear it spinning its wheels.  Running 4 cameras at 720p nets me about 5-6 days of continous footage with a 1TB drive.  Would recommend a larger disk size to increase capacity if needed.  It would be nice if this unit included bluetooth so that I could pair a wireless mouse.  Since my unit was up in a closet out of the way, I didn\u2019t want to have to go directly to the unit every time.  I bought a mouse with wireless dongle to put in the usb port so that I could do it from a distance.Software:This is probably the weakest link of the system and most frustrating in my opinion.  I use the Mac (SmartPSS) version of this and it is not very good.  It feel like development for the Mac was an after thought but at least I can fumble through it to get into the real-time feeds and recordings.  I am not a fan of the mobile app either for iPhone and iPad.  While I can get it to basically work on both devices the functionality seems limited, many of the items from the app menu don\u2019t not function properly for me.  I am able to use the key features like Real time monitor and Playback in a limited fashion, but again other configuration activities don\u2019t work.  UI is not very intuitive or user friendly as well.  Needs a lot more polishing and attention to detail.  Also backing up footage produces a Microsoft proprietary video format (ASF).  I found this annoying but was able to convert it using third party software like handbrake and VLC.Motion Detect:Even at the lowest sensitivity setting and fine tuning the coverage area grid, I still get up to 8-12 false alarm notifications throughout the day to the point where you see so many alerts that you might as well turn it off because you start ignoring them.  I also have a problem with positive alerts not taking snapshots of the people fast enough (in many cases they are outside the frame of the picture by time time it is captured).Cameras:The four 720p cameras work well and have nice high quality image during the day.  At night they are also performing well for me, but I do have light poles along the street that help keep my yard fairly well illuminated.

However, I asked him on a scale of 1 to 10 the degree of difficulty when it came to set up, and he told me that while it wasn't the *easiest* system he'd ever had to install, it certainly wasn't the most difficult--somewhere around 4 or 5. Remember, he was a professional, so if this is a DIY job, take his input with a grain of salt.Since I felt comfortable with the configuration and set up, I took over after the actual installation (running of the wires) was complete. It's important to note that some technical knowledge of your network and system will be required to complete the system's set up. You'll need to use both the NVR device and the included software to get everything up and running smoothly. It required several hours to fully complete, so this is definitely not a \"quick afternoon\" project--it's more like a \"set aside an entire weekend\" project. I also disliked the fact that the software and the NVR required separate passwords. But in the grand scheme, it wasn't a major setback.Once everything had been set up and configured (btw, it's set to stream at all times by default, so you may need to change this setting if you want to conserve hard drive space), it was time to test them out. I monitored the video in daylight and low light over a period of a week and I have to say I'm happy with the image quality.

I was leary of the night vision after working with security cameras years ago that never performed, but the Infrared lights really light the area up. License plates reflect the IR light and become unreadable, but when my flood lights come on you can read them easily. These cameras do have a narrow field of vision and you should plan on using them for close range applications, but I used a couple of them for general yard views and the night vision is good for the 100' advertised.  You won't identify a face at that range but you'll see a bird walking around on the grass.I did noticed that if I put these cameras on a wall and point them parallel with the wall that the night vision washes out the image.  My house is painted white and I think the reflection of the IR lights over powers the camera.  I solved this by pointing them out a bit away from the house at maybe a 30 degree angle.Most of the complaints I read are coming from people that probably should not be trying to install a system like this.

I choose this package due to my following needs:1.  Network - I like to be able to view the cameras from my PC within my LAN-router.  If someone rings my doorbell, I can easily view my camera quickly on my PC.2.  2 Cameras - One camera to my front door, and the other for my backyard.  This NVR has 4 channels, so you add two more additional IP cameras.3.  720P Cameras - I wanted at least a 720P HD resolution to clearly watch who is at my front door.  It can also view license plate numbers (during the day) about 30-feet away from the camera.4.  Night Vision - Night viewing works as expected.  But obviously, the image is grainy and not as sharp as during the day.  You can see the red IR light up in the camera, which looks like one of those alien weapons you see in video games.Out of the box, everything looks intimidating: NVR, two cameras, 100' cat5 cables, two adapters.The first thing you do is hook up the adapters and cameras to the NVR, and NVR to the TV, which took less than 5 minutes to accomplish.  The NVR unit has an HDMI and VGA output, so I have it connected to both my living room TV and my kitchen TV.The package also comes with a cheap mouse.  But I was able to connect my wireless Logitech mouse.The first challenge is learning to navigate the NVR system.  The NVR unit is surprisingly small and quiet.  I don't think there is a fan built in, so the unit gets hot on the bottom.Viewing the cameras be either with 4-split screens, and 1 full screen.  You also have the option to cycle the viewing options.There are lot of options on how you want to set the recordings: schedule, motion, alarm.  I have not really look into the Alarm recording option, and I do not need to have schedule recordings.  My main method of recordings is Motion sensor.  You can set the area of your screen that detects any movements (and sudden change in light), and set the sensitivity level.  Setting the sensitivity takes a lot of trial and error that best fits your recording needs.  Some of my motion recording doesn't seem to be showing any movements, so I suspect this might be sudden change in light or shadows as cars driving by.Network was a tremendous task.  If you do not have a lot of experience with your router settings, this could take hours to figure out.  I don't care much about viewing my cameras away from home, but I do care about viewing it from my PC at home.  There is a software (SmartPSS) provided in the CD (or you can download) to view your cameras on your computer.  The video quality on the NVR is slightly better than PC, but at least it works.  You can view recordings as well, but not as user friendly as the NVR unit.  I find it difficult to search for specific recordings through the software.  And you can export recordings to your PC, and convert the video to AVI format.Since this system is POE (power-over-eternet), installing and rerouting the cat5 cables and drilling holes took at least half the day.  A 100 foot cables provided should be long enough for most homes.What I dislike about this unit is:6mm Cameras in the system is only 45-degree angle.  Google 6mm camera vs 3.6mm camera and you will see the difference in wide-angle.  45-degree angle makes the image appear as zoomed in.  So I had to mount the camera about 20 feet away from my front door.  It would had been nice to get a wider-angle camera so I can cover more area.The camera is not PTZ.  So you cannot zoom or rotate the image.  These cameras are fix-lense.  The NVR unit, however, has PTZ option, so I could add a PTZ camera someday.Delete Recordings?  I set my NVR system to delete videos after 14 days.  But I cannot figure out how to manually delete any recent recordings from either the NVR or the computer software.After about 1-week of usage, I like this system overall.  Anyone who comes in and out of my front door is recorded at all times, which is what I wanted.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Timely Set-Up Yields a High Quality Item", "Author": "Michael Yovkovich", "ReviewID": "R3MH40C8Q4OE6P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I get to the actual product, I feel a special moment needs to be reserved for the unbelievable amount of work that it takes to get this security system set up.

Setup was easy, set the time and your in.  You can hook it to your network to have remote access using the included software or the web version.  Instructions offer helpful information for users who might not be familiar with networking including how to open the ports needed for the network using popular routers like Linksys and 2Wire (AT&T;) and more setup examples on the manual on the disk.  This is pretty easy to do and a quick search can show you for your specific router.I want to add that I found the setup to be super easy!  The system starts by just asking a few questions, installing cameras will take some time (since you will have to run wire and drill holes to make a clean installation [true of any system]), the unit is easy to connect to your network (if you want to access it from a computer, but you can do everything from the DVR itself with a super intuitive interface using just a mouse), it is just plug and play for most networks or if you have a complicated network setup you may have to add a reservation for this unit and you may have to open a port if the default one being used it blocked (it was not blocked by default on my network).  The ease of accessing this on the DVR itself is super easy and the ease of accessing it from a computer just as easy.  I plugged in the network cable to my network (either straight to the router or a hub [like I am using]) went to the settings menu on the DVR and went to the Network section to get the IP address and port it was using (it had it all filled in since it was given an IP address by the router), if you needed a static one for it you can setup a DHCP reservation for it using the unit's MAC address or most likely just reserve it to the IP address it was given by just saving it in your router.  I went to my computer (using OS X 10.9) and in Safari went to [IP ADDRESS]:85 (HTTP port 85 from the settings), so for example: http://192.168.0.194:85.  Logged in using the admin/admin or if you changed it using the new one, and I could access the live view and settings and alarm settings for the unit over the web browser (could do this all just as easy from the DVR itself).  I did not see the option to view recordings, but that is available in the software (I am using the Mac version, which was easy to install and I just copied the APP file from the CD to my Applications folder (or you could just run it off the CD).The software was very easy to use (I am using the Mac version, but I would bet the PC version is about the same), the software found the DVR quickly (just used Auto Add and allowed the program Network access, the Mac asked), the interface was simple and I could view live and choose the Playback part to watch the recordings (same general interface as the DVR itself) and was able to set settings and everything else from the software.The unit includes a 1TB HDD in the DVR that can record more than enough video for most users, you can set the DVR to record only when detecting motion or you can set a certain schedule in the easy to use on screen interface.  You can also specify what resolution to record in, so if you go full at 720P you will record less than recording at 480P but will have a better picture.  The unit supports up to 4 IP cameras and includes two.  The default password is admin and you can change all of this in the settings, which for a unit that uses just a mouse is surprisingly easy to navigate and use and it is very intuitive.  The record playback is also easy to use and with the mouse you can quickly jump around on the calendar and see what is recorded segments.  The DVR is super easy to use and is very intuitive and requires very little understanding to use.  This is a really nice system that is super easy for anyone to use.The DVR also allows you to setup email alerts and configure the system to send the email over your email client (you will have to see if your email service allows anonymous sending or if you need to setup a login) and this allows you to know if it detects motion or something interrupts a camera at any time.  There are many options for an alert to be triggered but those are probably the ones you care about.The unit includes two power cables (one for the DVR and one for the cameras [using Power Over Ethernet]), a HDMI cable, a wired mouse, and two 100 feet Ethernet cables for running to the cameras.  Everything you need!The unit supports watching playback over HDMI or VGA, it has a great picture, I have it hooked to a 47\" 1080P TV and the picture looks amazing, it is showing in 720P (what the cameras support) and looks amazing with a great frame rate for an IP camera (about 25 FPS) and very little delay (about 1.5 second delay in video feed).The cameras are super nice and include everything needed to mount them.  The cameras can have the cable ran down the wall or you can drill a running hole and run the cable through the hole so you can have a clean install.  Since the DVR puts out power for the camera over Ethernet you only have to run the Ethernet cable from the DVR to the camera and the data and power is handled over the one cable.  The cameras have great night vision, a completely dark room looks like a perfectly lit black and white video feed (except for the creepy white eyes that night vision gives).  The night vision looks amazing and is great for dark areas and keeping an eye on an area at night (perfect clarity in no light conditions, although the camera will be visible since it will glow red).You can also setup remote viewing from other computers or after setting up your firewall to let the port through with access to the system outside of your network (if you have a static public IP address - I personally do not like the idea of having my cameras available to the Internet so the firewall blocks external connections to the service that I setup for the cameras).This is a great camera bundle and works amazingly!  But what makes this the best choice is the easy to use interface in the DVR, it is so easy to use and intuitive that any user regardless of computer knowledge can get in and set this up and have a professional grade security system!!!In the end this unit is great for home and small business users who need security camera surveillance in an all in one package that is easy to install and use for anyone, regardless of technical knowledge [this was almost just plug in play and than fine tune for your needs; recording schedule, email notifications, triggers...].  The package includes everything you need to have a professional looking camera system and the 1TB HDD is more than enough for most users, and the DVR system offers space saving features like record with motion and record schedules.  You can also backup any feed to a external drive or USB drive using the front USB port.  The live view can also be the 4 split screen or full in one screen, making keeping an eye on your area easy.  If you need a full feature security camera system with great quality cameras and a great quality DVR system this is a great choice.

Getting the angles just they way you want them, also took a lot of time. We had to stop and take a break, so we wouldn't actually break this system, it was much harder than it looks. But it comes with a lot of parts so it is a bit hard. But then again, you can figure everything out with the directions, it just takes a lot of time to get this system just right.Video looks okay but not super sharp, especially at night it is a little...smudgy I guess would be the right would for it. I wish the video was a bit sharper. Also, it is very sensitive to motion, more than we thought it would be so we had to work with that to get it just right as well.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.99", "Features": "Completely Digital 720p HD Recording Resolution (Connect HDMI Monitor for HD Experience)\nNVR will Record IP Cameras Located Locally or Remotely\n4 Integrated Power Over Ethernet (POE) Ports\nRemote internet monitoring (up to 20 users at the same time)\nFree Q-See Mobile App (Q-See QC View for IPhone/iPad and Android).
