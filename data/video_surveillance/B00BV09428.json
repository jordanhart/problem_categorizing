It is made of cast zinc and painted with a nice thick coating of black paint. I was shocked at how heavy and rugged this license plate bracket is. This is what you need on your car or truck so it will hold up in bad weather. The camera features 8 IR LEDs to help light your way even in the darkest night so you can see in the daytime or nighttime. Don't forget you also have your backup lights and taillights to help push away the darkness.The camera is a color camera and it has a 170 degree side to side viewing angle which is very good and it also has a 120 degree vertical viewing angle. Two set screws hold the camera in place and if you loosen them you can adjust the camera height to get the best viewing angle for the height of your vehicle. There is a supplied Allen wrench to loosen and tighten these screws. The video image has an electronic grid image on the video you see. It is made up of lines that are drawn in a trapezoid shape that indicates the distance to objects behind your car. Each grid line represents about 3 feet.The license plate camera is rated to IP67 which means it is submersible to 1 meter (3 feet of water) for about one hour without damaging the unit. The unit comes with a wiring harness that allows you to connect it to the rear back up light power wiring so the camera is only on when you are backing up. It also has an RCA type video jack cable (20 feet long) and after you wire the harness to your monitor wiring then wrap the jack with electrical tape to securely hold it plugged in and to keep the connection dry.The unit comes with a brief instruction manual and it shows the basic wiring to wire this up. It is nice that the cables that plug into the license plate holder already have connectors installed and they are color coded. (Please see my video) I rate this item as a 5 star product. There are less expensive backup cameras out there but they do not compare to the quality of this one!I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "TaoTronics TT-CC17 Camera", "Author": "Robb", "ReviewID": "R3998I30Q8VZ89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I have to say that I'm surprised with the quality of this item. I could have gotten a cheaper costing cam for my rear plate but wanted a solid metal plate ring. It blends in well with the truck and works great so far. I would recommend this and already have. Waterproof, night vision, solid, looks good and reasonable price. I paired it with a 4.3\" monitor and a 25' high quality video cable and created a very solid and stable backup camera system for less then $75. I do have to say that I soldered the reverse light connection and ground connection and took my time following the factory harness up to the front of the truck. I also drilled thru the plate with a 3/4\" bit and put a rubber grommet on the plate to protect the wires. I then drilled thru the plastic under the plate with a 3/4\" bit. This lets the video and power connection go straight out the back of the camera. No wires are visible when you look at the camera and plate ring. I installed this on a 2012 Ford F150 XLT Screw. I have been using it for about a week now in FL and it has been rained on like I can't even tell you. No ill effects yet...........Time will tell. Good luck and I hope this helps.Robb", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent picture but could be better overall", "Author": "Cohiba", "ReviewID": "R3LKTNPRM69JFA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture this license plate camera provides is decent, not great. It didn't include any hex head bolts; the license plate frame has hex head provisions in it so as to make it more secure.  Also, the wires from your splice point to the camera were so tiny as to be difficult to work with.  The connection they provide from the license plate to the monitor was good quality and decent length.  I've used the Boyo License plate camera in the past and it included all good quality components, had better picture quality, included black hex head bolts but it was three times the price.  So, for the money this isn't that bad.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Integration of TaoTronics TT-CC17 with Magellan 1700LM GPS", "Author": "Shadow", "ReviewID": "R3CI32S7NDW2HK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start off with this review is actually of two products, the Magellan 1700LM with back up camera and TaoTronics TT-CL17 back-up Camera.I have a 2010 F150 and because of it's size I decided to get a back up camera.  As I was in need of a new GPS I looked around for combination units.  These are pretty much limited to Garmin, Magellan and 4UCAM (Generic Model).  The Garmin is significantly more expensive than the Magellan but does have some additional features such as Bluetooth (Which I had no need for)Pros on the 1700Very nice big screen with good resolutionGood mounting system with integration of the wireless receiver for the back up cameraSimple menus, thought limited features, for GPS functionSimple to use PC software for system and map updatesAll cables etc. are includedVery good wireless transmitter and receiver.Switches automatically to camera mode when you put vehicle in reverse.Lifetime Map updatesCons with 1700The downloaded manual does not reflect the latest version of the software, some screens are differentThe back up camera is not very good, no grid lines and it is not infrared so it is useless at night.This brings me to the TaoTronics ($49.99) camera.  After doing some additional research I decided to try a different camera to see if I could improve the night visibility.  Even thought the TaoTronincs is designed for a hard wired use it works flawlessly with the Magellan wireless transmitter and receiver.  The only \"custom\" things you need to do is hard wire the 12 Volt directly to the camera and obtain a female/female RCA connecter for the video feed. You may want to purchase a shorter video cable as the supplied one is very long.Pros on TaoTronicsGood gridlinesVery good resolutionHas built in infrared LED bulbs for night vision.Looks pretty good for a license plate cameraAppears to be of excellent quality.Cons on TaoTronicsNone I can think ofInstallation on the F150 was very easy and involved no more than removing the taillight assembly (outlined in the Ford owners manual), running the camera wires from the camera to the video transmitter, wiring  the 12 volt to you back up lights, securing the wiring beneath the vehicle with some tie wraps, and reassembling.  It took me 30 minutes including adjusting the camera.  I also built a mount for the GPS screen out of PVC pipe fittings which mounts in the center console cup holder.  The total cost for this was ~ $10  at Home Depot.A couple of suggestionsWhile you have the tail light out install an LED back up bulb (921) they are way brighter than the stock bulb.  Instead of taping over the cable connections use heat shrink as it is more durable and water resistant.In summary the 1700 with the TaTronics camera is a pretty nice solution for a reasonable priced GPS/Back up camera combo.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "TaoTronics\u00ae TT-CC17 Waterproof", "Author": "adi", "ReviewID": "R22JUK4P1406Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is OK, definitely not a great image.

I put a pin male connector on the ends and matted with a female connected (soldered) to a 18 gauge wire that runs to the backup lights. Because the licence plate is offset the guidelines do not give an accurate idea of where the sides of the car are.  I contacted their support and got a quick response that the grid lines are set in cmos so can not be changed.

It was more work to istall a hard wired camera than a wireless one but I think the image is better with a hard wired camera. Since I have a shell and carpet on my truck bed I simply ran the wire along the truck bed and up to thru the sliding window. I then put duct tape on top for the entire length to protect it. I then ran it behind and under the rear seat to about 5 inches before you could see it from above, cut a hole in the carpet and used a fish tape to run it under the carpet to the front.

I saved about $140 purchasing this from Amazon and by doing the install myself. the running of the wires from the back of the truck took some time because you need to route two wires (AV & Remote) all the way to the stereo carefully as not to interfere with any moving/cinch parts or points that may cut or stress the wires, and then zip tie everything into place. You also need to wire it into the reverse lamp on the tail light. I used solder and heat shrink tubes to make sure it would not short out if it touched any metal and would by waterproof. After I ran the AV cord to the stereo and the other wire to the reverse tail light, I had to run a third wire to the reverse signal wire coming from the stereo to the reverse light in my other tail light to make the camera picture come on when putting it into reverse. I could have tried to find the wire in the cab to make the connection however since I already ran and hooked up the other wire (from the plate camera) to the tail light, and I had already routed and figured out how to make the connection it was easy to hook up the wire to the other reverse light.

I bought a titanium cone shaped drill bit from Pepboys to drill the hole for the wires and it worked great without chipping or messing up the surrounding paint.  Install didn't take long and the SVideo cable was long enough for my large SUV.  Hardest part was finding the right wire near the head unit to splice to trigger the head unit to know when the car was in reverse.  Finally found a posting that described the correct wire which was right behind the glove box.  Used my multimeter and found it on the second try.  Spliced it easily enough and it worked as advertised.  Other than the super tiny wires mentioned above I was a little disappointed with the angle of viewing as the Lexus LX470 has an inset area for the License plate and therefore makes you adjust the camera angle a little lower than I would have liked.  Regardless, I like that it lets you angle it to your desired setting with a small allen wrench included to loosen/tighten the angle.  Looks factory installed though once in place.  If you are looking at the $15 backup camera's like I was and you have a high end car that already has chrome trim around the rear of the car you def should cough up the $50 bucks.

But the camera comes with an Allen wrench so you can loosen it to manually adjust the camera how you want it then without disturbance of your choice tighten it so it doesn't move, BRILLIANT! And if anyone is worried about quality, this plate frame is very heavy metal and so is the camera casing. It is built very tough. Mine got wet once, blurred the camera a bit, I got out and wiped it off, it was fine after that. Just that simple and seems very, very durable.

That would allow most plate mounting screw heads to fall into the recess and eliminate the need for longer screws.  There also needs to be a better way to route the wire from the camera.  The license plate can cut into the wire if you are not careful.  I needed to cut a notch into the back of the frame for the wire.  Cutting the notch allowed the frame to sit flush against the body of the car.

I will look for more products from this seller.  Thank you.The company has sent a replacement.I hooked it up and it works but the resolution is terrible.  The picture has a washed out faded and near black and white appearance.  Hopefully I will be able to correct the issue by installing a shielded video cable.  As far as just being able to use it as a safety measure while backing up I suppose it is borderline acceptable.I have installed many cameras so I know a little about the subject.  I hope that I will be able to post an update saying that the problem has been corrected.  As of right now I am not too happy with the purchase.

Once I determined how to unsnap moldings, the installation went well with one exception. The supplied wire that come with the unit, is at an unreasonable gauge to properly connect it mechanically.  I used a squeeze connector to join reverse gear lamp wire and the camera wire which I can only estimate is a 30/32 gauge wire (which is extremely smaller than the 24awg wire that came on the car) made this project unnecessarily difficult. My connections were intermittent because the wire is too small to make a proper connection.
