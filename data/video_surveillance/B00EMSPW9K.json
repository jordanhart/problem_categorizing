It took nearly 25 hours to get this going and even now it does not work well. The support from Lorex is only open Mon-Friday and limited hours, which is of no help it you are a working person. One of the reasons it took nearly 25 hours is because when you call in to the support tel no, you are on hold for over 90 minutes, and then you get disconnected. I would not buy this product again.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Harder than heck to to install", "Author": "Alexandra Gillette", "ReviewID": "R23FAC1ZYGL5EQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The \"system,\" LW21000, sold at a big box with two wireless cameras and a DVR, is sold as supporting up to two additional wireless cameras- the LW2232PK2B. Getting the four camera system paired is another issue. The user guide is ineffective and the antennas require \"line of sight.\" Can you imagine a four camera \"line of sight\" system application? So, get ready to buy a multidirectional system antenna and individual camera 20' extender antennas from Lorex at about $70 each. In short, this inexpensive system ends up costing more than their \"expensive\" cousins from other manufacturers.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.95", "Features": "Up to 30 frames-per-second video with MPEG-4 compression\nImage Resolution VGA (640x480)\nUnobstructed effective wireless range up to 165ft indoors\n3.6mm F2.0 fixed lens - 55\u00b0 field of view\nIncludes 2-channel digital wireless receiver, 3 power adapters (cameras require AC power), wall mounting hardware & BNC to RCA adapter", "Name": "Lorex LW2232PK2B Vantage Wireless VGA Video Security Two Camera System (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417MSosTq4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EMSPW9K"}}
