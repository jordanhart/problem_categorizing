{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works well, but opt for a kit with more powerful infra red cameras.", "Author": "J. E. Stanfill", "ReviewID": "R17GKWTE0QT158", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works well. Requires a little concentration to set up and program.  Locate it centrally, so the cables will reach all 4 corners of the house. The Cameras work OK indoors, and OK for outdoors during the day. The night vision is limited, however due to a small number of IR LEDs. They make another kit with CCD cameras that are good for about 60 feet. They have about 26 LEDs per camera. Overall though, a good deal. Especially if you are using it inside for store security.The recorder can be programmed to exclude parts of the camera field of view, so it the wind blows the trees, it will not trigger the motion detection feature. You can also set it up to record constantly, or just for motion, or during certain hours.I am satisfied, and would recommend it to anyone who is technically capable, and is a do-it-yourselfer.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "Outdoor Song CCD Security Camera kit\n60ft CCTV Video + Power All-in-one Cable\nWeatherproof: Indoor and Outdoor\n1/4\" Sony Color CCD Image Sensor\nIR Irradiation Distance: 65' (20m)", "Name": "Zmdoo CCTV Security Day Night IR Outdoor Sony CCD Security Camera Kit With 65ft night vision distance", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aLQJ0peBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008S7I004"}}
