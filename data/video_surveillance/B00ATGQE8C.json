Buyer beware! I can tell you that I have attempted to work with Foscam support on several occasions and it was not the wonderful experience all these \"reviews\" have made it out to be. Both email and phone support was horrible and useless. I still have the same problem and would not dare waste any more time with Foscam support.These cameras are fine for the price point. Nothing to rave about. The browser controls are quirky and take way too much fuss to get email, ftp or recording setup. These areas need to be seriously revamped. I have three of these things bought from Amazon and they all have the same issue. Each night when they switch to night mode they begin to flicker, this is the best way I can describe it. It cannot be seen with your naked eye but when viewed through any software or browser it looks as if it is switching from IR on to off. The only way to resolve it is to login via the browser and change the resolution and then set it back to where you had it. This somehow stops the odd behavior. I have tried to contact Foscam support but waiting for 1.5 hours on hold is beyond ridiculous and I eventually just give up.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cameras have defect from manufacturer...", "Author": "roach", "ReviewID": "R1DFZR72SCDJVT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Cannot be used in brightly-lit rooms with highly-detailed views.

I have the same problem with a camera I have mounted inside, but near the ceiling in an exterior window.So as long as you keep them cool, them seem to work OK. But be aware the operating temperature is not very robust. The specs for these cameras don't list operating temperature, just 'storage temperature', and then range for this should be wider than operating temperature. The storage temperature range is -10\u00b0C ~ 60\u00b0 (14\u00b0F ~ 140\u00b0F).Completely unusable as an exterior camera, or in any area not environmentally controlled.Update Nov 2013, the problem is not overheating. There is a problem with the DSP that causes the camera to reboot when the image is 'complex' or too bright. Which is why it appeared to be an overheating problem. The company did warranty the camera, they took it back and updated the DSP (factory only) and the issue is resolved.
