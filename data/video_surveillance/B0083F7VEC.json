It's not bad... Except... it is NOT as advertised. Otherwise I'd probably give it four stars.See sample footage from actual cam in my video review.Pros:-It is actually slimmer than shown in the advertising photos (see photos in my video review)-It has a reset hole so if it ever stops working, you can fix it with a paper clip.-It actually records fairly sharp video and audio, it adapts to different lighting situations, and actually records amazingly well IMHO.Cons: It is not as advertised:-It has no user-removable Micro SD card (maybe if you rip it open, but I'm not going to try. It has no Micro SD card slot on the outside).-No large flat front buttons as depicted; instead one very small fragile power/record button on the back side.  See video review.-It seems to be getting off-time very rapidly: in about one hour of putting this review together, it's gotten off by about four minutes. One or two minutes off I could see, because I didn't set it to the exact second. But four minutes off? That's not user error (i.e. not my bad). Other mini-vid cams I have are pretty accurate on keeping time.-Blue LED glows during recording (you could put black tape over it I guess).-Button hole is off-center from the video sensor, and as a result you see the shadow around the video recording (your mileage may vary. I.e. it might be more centered on your unit, or you could razor the button off and recenter it with superglue. But this is a brand new unit... why should you have to 'fix' it?!I will be returning it because I wanted removable memory. shucks.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Nice and affordable", "Author": "RY", "ReviewID": "R12CTRH4IX4Z7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this item early than the expected arrival, I thought it is not working and I apologize to the company who sent it.

Avast flagged an EXE file as a trojan in a hidden folder named \"RECYCLER\".  The only non hidden folder on the device was labeled \"MUSIC\", and I found some weird audio track in music/dj/dj.  The videos and pictures I had recorded were in folders labeled \"IMAGE\" and \"VIDEO\" respectively.  These folders were not visible even after enabling \"view hidden folders\" in windows.  I had to figure out the names of these folders by watching the files that were being scanned by avast when I re-ran the scan.  The instruction sheet that came with it is a joke, albeit a funny one.  The scale and frequency of grammatical errors makes it hilariously impossible to derive any useful information from the instructions.If you're tech savvy enough to dodge the trojan and find the video files on this thing, it serves its purpose.  The magnetic ring activation is really cool.  Touch it briefly to turn it on and start/stop recording, hold it for 1 second to turn it off.  All the pictures I have taken so far have been very blurry but the video was of acceptable quality.  I haven't used it long enough to comment on battery life.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "mini spy camera", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1IA06J7ZVKZGZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a good camera at a great price but you do get what you pay for.

The instruction manual is written in poorly constructed sentences, and I was under the impression that I needed a CD with drivers to connect to my computer. What you need is an SD card (specifically called a TF card in the instructions) and you will be able to connect to a PC. How would you know that off the bat? You wouldn't! It doesn't come with a card, so you'd be stuck until you figured it out.Another tip: the red light is actually supposed to be off when recording, not on. Again, that's hard to know when reading the English instructions.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great right out of the box (instructions)", "Author": "G-Man", "ReviewID": "R48JG05A78Z2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to put it on my RC planes.  Item arrived before due date.  I took it out of the box and charged it with the supplied USB cord.  I adjusted the date and time on the supplied SD card.

You turn it on using the power button, then to record video you hold down the play button until the LED begins to flash, let go of the button, the light goes out and is recording.  To stop recording you push the play button again and the light turns on.  I then turned it off using the power button.  Took out the card put it in my computer's card reader, windows 7 opened the folder automatically, I clicked on the \"record\" folder and my movies were there.

Failing to do so crimps their sales. Here is what they say to get into the video mode, and I quote, \"Video mode: Start Recording: short shock machine 2, red light flashes two times, lights off.\"Does this actually mean anything comprehensible in English?Since this recorder is capable of recording photos, audio clips or video clips all using only two butttons and one light, it makes for a great deal of confusion as to what mode the device is in.I still haven't figured out how to get into record mode when I want.Following these cryptic instructions, I've managed to take a few fuzzy stills and make a few short audio recordings. By accident, I got into the video mode one time, so I know the device works even though I was unawre it was recording. The video is 640 x 480 which is standard definition, not HD video as advertised. Photos are fuzzy 640x480 as well. The advertising is very deceptive, but at this price, it probably should not be expected to have anything better than this.Since this is marketed as a video recorder, it would have been better to make it work only as a video recorder to avoid confusion. Logically, it should work this way. Press the power button, it's on. Press the record button, it starts recording. Press again, it stops. Press the power button again, it turns off.
