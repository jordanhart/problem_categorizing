{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kind of epic to set up, but completely worth it when you're done!", "Author": "Katie Luther", "ReviewID": "R2S2V6KOCC8EJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this product through the Vine program, free of charge. We live in a ground floor apartment in the city so we do get concerned about security now and then, especially at night. Because we live in an apartment and rent rather than owning, we were somewhat more limited in how and where we could install the cameras. For instance, I would have loved one by the front door, but it's concrete and would probably unnerve the neighbors whose door is right next to ours. So bear that in mind--if you own your home, you will be able to make even better use of this system than I could.Three of the cameras are in various points outdoors, and the fourth one I decided to use as a video baby monitor in the nursery. Physical installation of the hardware was a piece of cake once we figured out the best spots in the wall to drill and hide the cables. So that part of the set-up is no problem--anyone with even modest home maintenance improvement and a basic toolbox could do it.Setting up the feed to the TV was also very simple and worked right away once it was all plugged in. What proved to be a little more complicated was getting the feeds to allow online viewing on the computer, and on the iPhone app. The app is free, but the installation instructions are opaque and required a lot of trial and error on our part before we FINALLY got it to work. Eventually it was all going, but the instructions gave us the wrong IP and port numbers and we just had to be persistent in figuring out what it should have said, as there is little to no customer support for this feature. Important thing is though, it did work eventually.The night vision on this system is fantastic. Late at night, I can see people in dark clothing on the night vision as clear as day--people who, much to my alarm, I *could not see at all* just looking out the window. The motion sensor is very sensitive and has to be turned down quite a bit before it stops triggering when a moth flies by, for instance. Indoors, in the nursery, at first the night vision didn't \"click on,\" but when it did it also showed everything as bright as if all the lights were on (no color).Overall I would highly recommend this system for a small to medium space that needs monitoring. I think it would be perfect for a small business or office, or for a small to medium home (you'd probably want one with more cameras if your home is more than about 1200 sq ft). I wish I had better advice on getting the iPhone and computer feeds to work, but it really was just guesswork and trial and error. The company really should provide better support for this feature, and that's why I've subtracted one star from my review.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "jeff", "ReviewID": "R1W8WXNSLFOHY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cameras work great, good day vision, but still hard to see tag numbers on cars and physical features of poeple. You can not see very good at night, more like 40 foot night vision distance. The whole system takes some time to understand how to review and setup the cameras. Not that bad of a system for the price.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R15TPKV5HKC4NL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product to monitor my home remotely and hoped that it would also send an alarm to me if there was activity. I read, prior to purchasing, all the reviews and saw none of the systems for sale were without some poor reviews. I hoped this one would be the least \u201crotten of the apples\u201d . After using it I would notbuy it again nor would I recommend it. I\u2019d say \u201clook elsewhere\u201d but I don\u2019t know where else to look. My reasons (long) follow. Installation: Relatively easy though the instructions are not entirely clear in spots. I could not get the free Iphone app Asee to work but Asee+ did. To get your router to work with the system is not simple and I think many would find it troublesome. Remote viewing and control from my laptop was fine. .Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the cameras can\u2019t be ceiling mounted.Alarms: The motion detection feature is the worst feature. In fact, the algorithms for it are so poor that it is useless. Other reviewers have mentioned it and I will expand some on it. I have four cameras set up and I get about 20 false alarms per day. Sunrise, sunset, clouds, shadows, lightning, blinds moving with heat/AC, spiders, moths, squirrels, birds, leaves/branches moving in the wind, etc will trip the sensors. Essentially ANYTHING that changes even on the lowest setting. I have tried moving the cameras, limiting the detection field, and adjusting shades without success. IMO it is not usable as an alarm.Software DVD features: The software works but poorly. Playback for the alarms is confusing and cumbersome. You can get emails for the alarms and if you use the email to text feature offered by the major cell companies, a text on your phone (less the picture). The field for the email is limited to 32 characters which would have been easy to expand so as to allow for multiple emails. As noted about the cameras cannot be ceiling mounted though if one found a way mechanically, the software won\u2019t allow image rotation. You\u2019re always viewing the image upside down or sideways. Also and easy software enhancement which hasn\u2019t been done and leads to the conclusion that this product is not being maintained or enhanced.I could only get an email to gmail to work, my normal ISP would not, which I suspect is because my ISP uses Secure Password Protection and the software does not support it.Customer service: One camera arrived with a minor defect. It took two weeks to get a RMA and UPS shipping label via multiple emails. I could not reach a person by phone. Based on my experience and several other reviewers consider this purchase as \u201call sales are final\u201d and \u201cas is\u201d.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Money better spent else-where", "Author": "Leon C", "ReviewID": "R2OQT5ZCHKKVA9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, the quality of the video-feed leaves a lot to be desired.If you're looking to just catch someone in the act, these cameras are great.If you're hoping to ID them by capturing their face or their license plate you're out of luck.You would be better off recording with a cucumber.Not only is the video feed poor quality, the actual construction of the camera leaves a lot to be desired.The bolt you need to tighten to keep the cameras from swaying up and down does not completlye go through and thread.It threads in a few centimeters, and pushes against the cable - That's their means of tightening the camera from moving up and down.If you over tighten that bolt it will literally strip the metal and make the camera useless.How can the provided bolt strip the threading so easily? The metal used for these cameras is one notch above aluminum foil.Looking to get the poorly manufactured cameras replaced in a timely fashion?Try again, Defender takes from 2-4 weeks.That aside, if you want to record in higher quality - you need to turn down the frame rate.Basically turning the recording into an old fashion slide show.If you're not a Rocket Surgeon ... good luck setting up the cameras to be view able over the internet.Amazon on the other hand is quick to resolve any issues, and should be commended.The manufacturer on the other hand should be shunned and avoided like rectal cancer.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "better and easier to setup than expected", "Author": "Angelo Prestigiacomo", "ReviewID": "R3EWPZFVICLQVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Defender 21027 4 pack system replaces my Night OWL system which had problems with the Seagate drive that it came with. I even replaced the drive and had the same issue. I decided to buy the Defender System because it had good reviews and the web site, defender-usa, seemed to have the consumer in mind by the way it provides information on its products, including helpful videos.I did not want to run new cables to hook up to my three existing cameras, but I found that the 12027 pig-tail 12v power connectors were male and so are the connectors on my existing cable. I had to buy female to female adapters to connect to my existing cable and I was able to save the cables that came with the 21027. If you use the cables that come with the 21027, you will not have this issue. I bought a 20\" monitor to view the cameras in my living room and then configured port forwarding on my Linksys router for client port 9000 and mobile port 18004. For a linksys router, you go to applications and Gaming and enter ports 9000, 18004 and the IP address of the DVR.With that, I can view and configure the cameras on my PC and on my Android phone and IPAD.I downloaded the ASEE app for both Android and IPAD and I was surprised to see how effortless this app is to setup.Once you have your computer's public IP addess, all you need to enter are the port numbers, the user name and password.The default user name and password work fine, but they should be changed. I did not bother registering for Dynamic DNS because my public IP address has not changed in years; even if it does, I just have to enter the new one in the ASEE app.If I want to see and control the system from my home PC, I just enter the IP address of the 21027 system 192.168.x.x as allocated by the router's DHCP or static address.Most features such as recording and playback can be controlled from the PC as well as from the system menu on the DVR with an excellent remote control or mouse. The DVR has three convenient ways to attach to an exteral device: RCA, VGA or BNC.I am very pleased with the features and functionality of this system and I am giving it a five star rating because of its reasonable price and remote access features.

I was trying to get a monitoring system in-place before I left for vacation so my son could monitor my home, so I unpacked the system and had it setup and running in a couple hours. That being said I had downloaded the manual from the website and had already read it cover-to-cover before my system arrived.I temporarily mounted the cameras on some spare pieces of 2\"X12\" boards, plugged everything into the DVR and turned it on. It took me another hour or so to re-read the portions of the manual and setup everything; time, date, network, camera recording options, etc. using the supplied remote control.I am not a networking professional by any means but I do alright. I could see this portion being the most difficult part for some people, especially if it's your intent to monitor your system from your iPhone. The directions are decent in this area but with so many different kinds of routers on the market, each with interface differences it was a little stressful. Once I discovered that the DVR and my router both support universal plug-and-play (uPnP), I was good to go. I don't know if all these systems support plug-and-play but that is a major plus for this system in my opinion.I downloaded the free app for my iPhone and I can now monitor my cameras/home from anywhere.Night vision is pretty decent.  My farthest distance is about 40 feet.  I can make out everything in the room fairly clearly and I could definitely tell if something was out of place or someone was in there.  The motion detection portion of the system works very well but since mine are all inside and I don't have any pets or things that move, I haven't seen any false alarms yet.The cameras automatically switch between IR and color, depending on amount of light in the room.  When in full color, they are extremely clear and it looks like I'm watching TV.  They make a loud \"click\" when they switch back and forth so don't be alarmed.Once I returned from vacation, I disconnected everything and ran all the cabling through the ceiling/attic space and permanently mounted the camers to the wall.  That went as well as it could have with crawling around in the attic. I ordered some 1\" white cabling grommets from Amazon to feed the wires through my ceiling and the installation looks very professionally done.  My wife just said WOW!The only drawback to these cameras - they have to be wall mounted. The mounts are not oriented to be able to ceiling mount them unless I misread the directions.  Be careful mounting these too close to the ceiling.  I only say that because I had an eirie glow the first night on two of the cameras when they were in IR mode. I figured out that is was reflection coming from my white ceiling, I angled the cameras down just a little more and they are now great.I drilled an access hole in the top of one of my cabinets for the cabling and placed the DVR inside with a small 350 VA battery backup/UPS to protect the system and cameras from power issues, at only $42 I believe that to be a good investment. I can lock that cabinet so the DVR is less accessable.I didn't have to call Customer support for anything yet so I can't speak to that.  This is also the only DVR/camera system I have ever purchased/installed so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was fairly easy to install and works like a champ.  I would highly recommend this system based on my experience.Hope that was helpful!", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Average", "Author": "TriniMark \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R2DOWF1H51NKQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It works, but facial recognition and license plate details are unsatisfactory in broad daylight.

For a small home, a 4 or 6 camera system would provide more than enough viewing coverage. The 16 camera system probably best for businesses who want to be able to record footage from inside and outside at the same time, since there's just so many cameras. Each camera provide a wide, easy to see, viewing angle. So 16 cameras will cover a ton of area.While the system may appear overwhelming when you receive it, it's actually easy enough for someone to install themselves. No real need for professional installation, unless you want to save yourself the time, or are less than comfortable with working on a ladder with a drill. By far, the most complicated part is mounting the cameras and running the wires. Not because the cameras are difficult, but because to get the best views it requires mounting them up high. So you're likely going to be standing on a ladder with a drill in hand and working on cable management (finding a way to run the cable from the DVR to the camera along walls or tucked inside things so they're not just hanging).The tools/parts we used were:LadderDrillMounting hardware included with the system (screws, allen wrench/hex key and such)The Defender 21051 Security SystemAn LCD monitor (not included in the system) with a VGA cableAnd external hard drive for downloading footage from the DVR to upload onto my PC for DVD burningPower stripWe started by mounting cameras to the underside of the roof of our garage. This worked well for getting angles of the house, driveway, backyard, entrances, etc. We then mounted cameras to the roof the the house to get views of the garage, front and back yard, property lines and also views of the street in front of our home. It works well if you first decide where you're going to mount the cameras and look into how you will run the wires, before you start putting them up. We tucked most of our outside wires into the siding. When deciding how to run them, it helps to look at cable already installed for other things. We located our TV cable lines that ran along side the house that were tucked into the bottom of our siding. This gave us the idea to do the same with the cameras cable.Each camera has one cable that comes from it. This cable has both the video and the power together in it. At each end of the cable, it splits into two connections. One wall power adapter will supply enough power for 4 cameras. The power adapter is at the same end of the cable as the DVR, so you don't need to worry about trying to run a power supply up walls or onto the roof. Using a power strip located where ever you set up the DVR at will provide all the power you need for all the adapters. Take care to run the cables the correct way. There are little white tags on the end of the cables labeling them as to which end goes to the camera and which end goes to the DVR. We ran the first cable the wrong way, and didn't notice it until we had already threaded the line and tucked it into the siding. So we had to take it all out and swap it out the other way. It's a small, simple mistake. But can cost you a lot of time that checking the tags first would have saved save you. The camera cables very easily lock into place in the back of the DVR. Rather than twisting in, or just being pressed in, there is a locking twist method used to secure them. This makes the cables very secure, yet easy to unhook as well.Included with the cables, DVR and cameras is also a USB mouse and a remote control. The mouse plugs into one of the two USB ports in the back and the remote comes with batteries for wireless control of the menus. As soon as the DVR is powered up and the camera cables are plugged into it, the software recognizes the video feed and displays it. You can set the screen to display the live video of all 16 cameras at the same time, or change it to just show certain ones. There is an abundance of video settings you can customize, such as motion alerts where you can even select specific areas of the screen to adjust the motion sensitivity. You can set the DVR recording settings several ways, and decide what you want recorded and when. We have ours set to record from all the cameras all the time. You can also adjust how the DVR handles the 500GB memory getting full. It can stop recording until you make more room, or just loop around to record over the oldest saved footage in it's memory.I set up my system to be viewed from a LCD computer monitor. There is a VGA output port on the back of the DVR, and I ran a cable from that to the monitor. There is an included video RCA cable which you can use to plug the DVR into a television to use it as video screen as well. The video from the cameras is extremely good. They are in full color in daytime, and transition into night vision in the dark (which is more of a gray scale). For the night vision, the less light there is the better. I am absolutely amazed at how far away you can see with both the daytime footage and the night vision.Just days after installing this system, there was an incident that happened to be recorded by my cameras. A man who lives across the street from us called the police, reporting that his neighbor's dog had attacked him. His neighbor who has the dog claimed his pet was on a chain the the yard, and could not have done anything. We pulled up the night-vision video footage we had of our driveway (which also captures the driveway and house of the man who lives across the street, who made the complaint). We were shocked at what we saw, when it turned out that the man making the complaint had actually gone well into his neighbors yard and thrown an object at his neighbors family dog, then took off running from it when it started barking at him. The officer who responded to the complaint came to our home and viewed the video, then asked if I could burn him a DVD of the footage. So shortly after setting all this up, I found I also needed to learn how to retrieve the video footage for viewing elsewhere, not on the DVR.I used an external hard drive (however for small files, most flash drives will work as well) to copy the \"event file\" from the DVR to the drive. This is where having the time set properly on the system becomes important. When you need to retrieve footage, you search using date and time filters. If the time is set wrong, you will spend a lot of time looking for the \"event\" you need. Events, as the system categorizes them, are in one hour segments. So even though I only really need to provide the police with about 5 minutes of video, each of the event files are 1 hour long. The first time I transferred a file, I hooked up my external hard drive via a USB cable to the back of the DVR. There are included instructions as to how to find an event, and how to download a copy of it to an external drive. The second time I copied an event, I tried it using just a USB flash drive, and it worked fine as well.The trick for me then was trying to figure out how to convert the .264 file type that the Defender DVR software saves the events in into a file that can be read by any computer. The Defender software comes with a program for viewing the files using their .264 file type on any computer you want to install it on. However I needed to convert the file to something that the police department would be able to view, without having the Defender software on their computers. After a significant amount of searching, I finally found a very easy solution that works.You simply....Locate the event file on the computer you have it saved on.\"Right click\" on the file with your mouse.Select the bottom option on the list that says \"properties\"On the tab titled \"General\", at the top of the box the file name should be there in a text box. Click inside that box and use your keyboard arrows to navigate all the way to the right of the name, where you should see it ending in .264 (that's the file extension name). Simply delete the .264 and replace it with .AVIA warning will pop up explaining that it might alter the file and render it unviewable. Click ok/yes, or what ever other prompt there is to confirm this change. This changes the file type to an easy to view .AVI file type, which just about anyone anywhere can view on their computer. I did this and then burned the file to a DVD.When in comes to camera durability, so far I have been impressed. Strong winds don't wiggle the cameras at all. We had sleet yesterday and the cold freezing rain caused no problems. I've had no problems with any fogging up of the lenses either. I'm living in the very northern area of Minnesota and it's mid December right now. Our temperatures at night are somewhere between 10 degrees and zero. We have over a foot of snow on the ground and the conditions here are generally harsh. So far, nothing has fazed the cameras we have mounted outside, exposed to the elements. The biggest test will be next month in January, when we have days with windchill's easily exceeding -20 degrees (below zero). I have full intentions of updating this review after the cameras have been exposed to that weather, and report as to how well they held up.So in conclusion, the day-time video footage is amazingly clear, the night-vision is everything they say it is and more, and the cameras are well built and designed to stand up to the harshest weather. The software on the DVR for navigating through recorded footage for playback is easy to use and hardware set-up is more labor intensive rather than being difficult. As long as you have no problem using a drill and standing on a ladder, you can easily install this yourself without the need to hire outside help. It's a great system, and has been working perfectly.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "After 3 Months of Use...", "Author": "Geoffrey Wilford", "ReviewID": "R8F6ZRNY8SY7C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the system direct from Defender-USA because back then they were running a deep discount. It appears that discount is now available through Amazon. If so that is definitely the way to go.Rather than repeat everything others have said let me emphasize important points that definitely need to be considered.CAMERAS AND PLACEMENT METHODOLOGYI bought the 8 camera and DVR system. The cameras are set up:1) Outside the front door looking almost straight down to cover people at the front door. This camera is set to text me a photo when someone comes to the front door. This works excellent. I've had to trim bushes to keep shadows off of the field of view. Remember that texting a picture is a different address on many people's phones like my Verizon account.2) Inside the house looking at the front door so you can see someone's face as you open the door or if they were to come in uninvited. It's tough viewing during the day because it is so bright outside compared to the image at the front door. Any camera would have an issue with that. At night it is a lot better and works well. This camera is set to turn on and record if camera#1 detects motion. Since I have glass in my front door I can record a face if someone comes up and peers into my door. I have the field of view restricted so people walking by inside the house don't activate the motion detection. This works well.3) Mounted outside on a wall to cover the master bedroom patio, specifically it views the screen door area. It's about 8 feet up and has a good field of view. Drove me crazy when a bird tried to build a nest in the camera housing. Although he was unsuccessful his 1000 trips in vain did cause a lot of unnecessary recording. Camera is set to motion detection with a bush taken out of the motion detection area so the rustling of the leaves don't set off the camera. The ability to mask OUT areas for motion detection is a huge plus of this system.4) Almost identical to #3 but on the main patio. This covers the screen door entrance from this patio. The idea is to cover all the openings where people might try to break in. Be aware that reflections off glass tables will set off the motion so even if there aren't any trees in the field of view if the glass table reflects an image of the trees it will cause detection when they move from wind. So will shadows. I resolved this by masking out the glass tabletop from motion detection. Works well. Again, the ability to mask out areas from motion detection is excellent.5) Inside the house facing the entrance covered by #4. The idea behind cameras 2, 5, and 6  is that cameras looking down don't get good facial recognition, you need to see a face. So looking from the inside out you will see someone at your door/screen door coming in. I masked out areas around it (inside pathway) so people inside the house don't set off the motion detection. If visitors or friends know they are being recorded inside your house be prepared to be lonely and known as weird - the ability of the system to block out areas in the field of view from ever being recorded is a great help to keep your privacy private. The loud click the camera makes when switching from day to night mode (or vice versa) is VERY obnoxious and noticeable. Other reviewers (actually numerous if you read) mentioned cloudy days and this occurring a lot. IT DOES!! The loud click will irritate your significant other and is a huge drawback to the entire system. Switching modes a couple times a minute is not uncommon. Imagine someone clapping their hands in your house a couple times a minute. It forces me to turn on a light in the kitchen to stop it and keep that light on until lighting conditions change. This camera can click every 10 seconds when the conditions are right, unfortunately that means almost every night!6) Inside the house facing the back door that comes from the garage. If someone comes in from that door or the hallway from another screen door I can see their face. This camera is plagued with the same noise issue. I cannot over emphasize the noise and pain of the cameras switching. To make matters worse, when they switch modes it also sets off the motion detection!7) In the garage facing out to cover both garage doors. Works very well. This camera is plagued with the mode switch causing motion detection, even set to the least sensitive setting. During the day the camera will switch modes 15 times, each one setting off the motion detection. As someone else said, even though the camera is technically in a different room, this is in the garage, you can still hear the camera mode switch noise INSIDE the house, it is that noticeable. That is a zero for inside use.8) Outside wall facing the pool and backyard area. This covers anyone messing around in the yard or pool. Works well. Bugs will set it off at night so you have to balance the sensitivity of detecting someone far away versus bugs close by. The advertised 100 feet at night is a huge stretch. Maybe 40 feet as someone else suggested would be far more honest. The camera's color and tint are all controllable and color correction is good as well as the handling of strong light. I have watched the pool company workers work and the inspector's every step during pool construction while I am gone... That is an awesome help.COMMENTS ON THE SYSTEMThe software and DVR is great for normal use. Yes, the manual is difficult to understand and yes you have to experiment. There are lots of adjustments that make the system really helpful. Masking out areas from motion detection, masking out areas from ever recording, emailing photos or texting photos are all great. I have inside and outside cameras that look at the same place working together. yes, its another option - if one camera detects motion you can have it automatically start other cameras. My entire system is set to motion detection because why in the world would you record nothing? There is a setting that allows you to record 10 seconds prior to a motion detection event so there is no reason to constantly record. I have only used maybe a third of my hard drive capacity if that after three months. Folks that think they need to run their recordings continuously will get a lot less - and they are spending a lot of energy recording an empty room. Motion detection is the way to go. HOWEVER, the motion detection working a five star excellent is plagued by the cameras mode switching causing motion detection. This is the second biggest drawback and would make me look at other systems very strongly, or at least the cameras. Because the cameras activate their motion detection when switching it makes the search function of the DVR almost useless. All it takes is for one switch to occur and then it shows an \"event\" for that time period. Even on the least sensitive setting it still activates the motion detection. If I search a day I might find almost very hour filled with events - but almost every single one is a mode switch. Defender, you need to fix this, your cameras are a one star paired with a four and a half star DVR.NOISE! The noise the cameras make is huge. Please don't excuse this comment but add it to the numerous other folks who mention this problem when cameras are placed inside the house.read the other reviews folks.  This is a huge pain and will stop me from purchasing another system that has these cameras. I will also look to eventually replace the inside cameras with another brand. THIS IS THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. Had I paid better attention to other folks comments I would probably NOT purchase this system - or at least these cameras. If I could, I would include a video of the noise it makes, you would then understand the gravity of the issue this causes, and probably rule out this system for inside use.The MAC address of the system is bogus, 11:22:33:44:55 and I believe the reason why my router won't always recognize that the DVR is there. I have not called customer support to talk to them about the networking issues so I will be mute on that subject. Viewing from inside your network works well and is fairly easy to set up. The port forwarding and outside network has yet to work and is problematic. Also read a review or google the open port issue on all DVRs. Almost all of them are made by the same company and all experience the same security issues.Defender's customer support called me 3 weeks after purchase to see how I liked it. That was great! I am not being paid for or compensated for a review like many here are. I opted to purchase an extended warrantee prior to them sending me a note with an offer to extend it if I wrote a review. That cost me the $60 extended warrantee others get free if they write a review here.  I was really busy and away from my house when they called or I would have asked them about the network issues right then as he did offer to transfer me to customer support right then and there... Uncommonly good.I wish I had purchased the 16 camera system. There are many access points or remote areas that are not covered. Think through the placement process PRIOR TO PURCHASING! You can always not use a camera and DVR capacity you have but don't need. You can't add to something that is maxed out. Big mistake on my part. Since the cameras are so noisy I avoided more pain even though most of the other camera locations i want  would be outside.Two cameras were far enough away that I had to use the extension cords that you can purchase separately. However, in an odd twist, the extensions are just that, you can't use the extension by itself but only with the original cord. No use to use one extension to replace a cord and then use two cords together instead of a second extension.I have all of my equipment in a walk in closet, my \"safe room\" where you can lock yourself in, monitor outside, and call and talk to the law enforcement folks from the safety of a secure room. The folks who installed my burglar alarm system didn't understand why I wanted an alarm panel there until I explained that concept to them, now they are firm believers in all security systems feeding into a safe place.  I would recommend a battery backup for the IP address issues reviewers have mentioned plus it would allow you to see what's going on even if they cut the lock to my meter and pulled the plug on my electricity. Running the cords is not nearly as harrowing as some people suggest. But think through it VERY carefully since it is a huge time commitment.Overall I am okay to fairly happy. That's very happy with the DVR and not very happy at all with the cameras. Other notes are that with this system a subject needs to be within 20 feet of the camera for you to recognize them. The night vision is \"okay\" but it would be tough to have a good enough quality image to present to the police.  If the cameras didn't make that mode switch noise and they didn't activate the motion detection when switching modes I would be very very happy and give it 4 1/2 stars. If my call to customer support fixes the network issue then it could be a five star.  But NOT with the camera's noise and motion detection/mode switch issue.  Please do not underestimate this issue! Don't consider this system for inside the house use without understanding that it is like someone clapping their hands about 15 feet from you, and it can switch a couple of times PER MINUTE, under the right conditions. If I was married and she was home a lot I really believe the system would have to be shut down or the cameras replaced for her to live with the inconvenience of the noise. In that case it would get a 1 star. The problem is, unless you are willing to pay several thousand dollars for a system it seems like no one is really happy with any brand, just read the hundreds of reviews I have.Ask if you have question.

It serves its purpose, mostly as a deterrent and a way to record what goes on around the house.  Installation takes time, you have to figure where to mount cameras, drill holes, fish wires, etc., all part of the normal process.  Setup of the DVR was relatively easy, plugged it in, turned it on and use the mouse to configure.The camera's work well for daylight, but only so so for night vision, but this is pretty common.  The video and pictures are relatively clear within the first 10 to 15 feet.  Beyond that however, you're going to have a hard time clearly identifying someone. I don't see a benefit to \"Ultra Resolution\" cameras as advertised over the others I have and use.  Again, I wasn't expecting them to be the same as a high dollar true hi-rez camera but I was expecting a tad bit better picture/video.The installation instructions (on the DVD) were average. They could provided a better and clearer understanding of recommended hole size to drill in order to fish the wires, but I figured it out on my own quickly enough.  In one case fishing the wires, they separated from the camera completely rendering the camera completely inoperable.  I will chalk that up to my own installation error, but since it didn't happen to the other 3 camera's, it's more likely the splice at the camera wasn't done properly at the factory.The software on the DVR is very plain, nothing fancy here, but some of the icons are a bit cryptic to figure out.  You'll need to take a few minutes to get used to the graphical user interface and some of the configuration settings. The documentation is included on the enclosed mini-DVD, also available via their website.  I found it easier to use a browser to view and configure the cameras by hitting the Static IP I setup and connecting to my home network.I'm also using the IP Forwarding to view the cameras from offsite, using Android devices (a tablet, and a Samsung SG3) to view them from anywhere around the house, or when I'm on the road.  I installed the free version of IP Cam Viewer, setup the app to find the DVR on a Static IP I was forwarding through the firewall, then had to select Lorex ECR System with Client Port and turned off \"Use Experimental h.264 dvr code\" in the IP Cam Viewer app. These are settings in the app, not the DVR. So now when I hear a noise or someone rings the doorbell, I reach for my Android Phone to check the camera feeds.  Very nice to have.I had 2 support related issues, and sent 2 emails to their support department (Defender-USA).  One of my issues received a partial reply 36 hours later, the other I was able to resolve on my own.  Customer Service was provided by \"Ian\", who continually followed up with me over the last few weeks via phone, and via email. While it took some time to get the info I needed to resolve the issue, Ian and Customer Service made things right so I'm happy they kept following up. I'm updating my review and rating as a result of his work, and I would buy from them again without question as a result of the continual support.UPDATE:  Now that I've had the system for quite a while now, I'm still very happy with my purchase and the performance of the system.  Using my Android devices with IP Cam Viewer (see notes above to configure it)along with the IP port forwarding features, I can check the camera's anytime, from anywhere.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Cuppy", "ReviewID": "R21M61MK6TM1C8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this item for our Auto Detail shop.

It needs a special program to view it.  Defender has no such program so you have to find one off the Internet that works.  I am surprised by this.  What is the point if you can't do anything with the video?  Anyway...I purchased the Defender 21031 security system to keep an eye on my yard - eight cameras, two on each corner of the house facing down the length of the house so I have overlapping coverage.Packaging: The system was well packed, cables packaged so they were easy to unroll and use, and everything was protected by wrappings.  The manual was not included - something a lot of companies seem to no longer provide.  At 85 pages and in color, it is a bit large for a home printer to print out.  And having a manual in hand is imperative to easy set-up.  In this case, they should have included the manual to ease the use of it during installation and - especially - programming of the cameras and DVR.Construction: The cameras appear to be very sturdy - the body and shield are made of metal, not plastic.  Each set of four cameras hooks up to an a/c plug and the DVR also has it own plug, so three outlets will be needed.  This means each camera will not need an a/c outlet of its own near the camera - outlets need to be close to the DVR unless you want to separate the wires (they are paired - a/c and video for each camera).  Cable connectors are the twist and lock type (not sure what the official name is).  They connect easily and lock into place.  The DVR is designed to accept either a RCA plug for a video monitor or VGA plug for a computer monitor.Installation: Installation is straight forward.  I installed it all very quickly on a table so I could confirm everything operated properly before going through the actual installation.  Because of a leg injury, I had an electrician come out and do the actual mounting of the cameras and running the wires through the attic.  I did the programming.  The cable length is 65 feet per camera - this should be long enough for most homes.  One of the camera cables barely reached the box.  I almost needed an extension cable and it made me wonder if the system would be able to handle an extension cable or if it would drop too much signal.  I don't know the answer to this, but it is something to think about if you need a longer cable run.  The cameras are designed to be mounted on the side of a wall, nut a ceiling or under the eves of a house.Programming: This is where Defender loses a lot of points.  First off, the camera system claims HD.  But with eight cameras, it will not allow HD monitoring - at least not with a respectable frame rate.  The DVR cannot handle it.  One is forced to either use CIF (low quality) or reduce the frame rate.  For HD, I had to reduce the frame rate down to four per second.  I think the system should be built to allow HD at a 30 second frame rate.The input is through a mouse and one must select each keyboard character by using the mouse, which sometimes jumps around, causing one to click on the wrong letter or number.  However, since the interface will probably rarely be used after the initial install, I didn't make this a negative feature.  I do believe it should allow for an optional keyboard to be used in the USB port.  On a positive note, once one camera is set up, there is a feature to copy that information to the other cameras.  After copying the information, one just needs to make the minor changes (like the camera name) to each camera.Usage: The video is okay - not the greatest, but okay.  I am still testing it out, but I am not sure one could identify a person from the video footage with outdoor use.  Night vision was okay, but it cannot penetrate far into a yard.  Security lighting may be required to enable the system to pick up movement or identify anything more than - guessing - about 20 feet from the camera.  The stored video can be set up separate from the real time video, so you can set the resolution to less that the real time, but not greater than.  Some people complained in their reviews that the replay resolution is much worse than the real time feed.  That is probably because they didn't set the saved video at a higher than default resolution - that resolution setting is in a different area of the menu than the live feed video.Audio appears to only be available from Camera 1.  So if you want to hear what is being said at the front door, that would have to be your camera 1.  Back yard, same thing.  Only one place can be rigged for listening.Setting up areas for motion detection is easy enough - select and deselect blocks superimposed over the screen and motion detection is set.  Blocking out areas will prevent tree movement from setting off the recording.  Another nice feature is the privacy setting.  There are two types - one prevents a camera from displaying on a monitor.  That way, no one can see what is being recorded.  Only an Admin can review that footage after the fact.  The other privacy feature is the ability to block out certain areas within the image.  That way, if the camera is pointing at some place where you have to enter a code or password, it won't record it.OVERALL: A decent security system for the money (I got it on sale for a couple hundred dollars off).  It could definitely use some improvements, but it seems to be a notch above most other home systems.  I was trying to decide between three and four stars.  I went with four because the overall quality is better than most.r/Jim", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "poor support time", "Author": "Amsoilman \"Amsoilman\"", "ReviewID": "R14FT4H9S5QP3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First call to support took 40 minutes to talk to someone.

The DVR is incredibly simple and easy to operate. The camera are of good quality materials and the video image is clear enough for security purposes. Night vision can be a bit blurred at a distance which is to be expected but right up to say the front door and it is easy to tell who it is. I will be mounting an IR spotlight for the main camera to the front of the house just to better expand the night vision capability. The package came with everything I need and for my home the included cables are long enough for the run I am planning. The only downside I can see and where others have mentioned is the very audible click sound it makes when switching night vision on or off. Now this isn't a concern at all as they will only click twice a day while outside and you will most likely be no where near it when it happens however if you plan to mount these indoors for some reason especially in a room where you may be turning the lights on and off often this can become very annoying very fast.I am very happy with the cameras, and even happier with Amazons customer support and lightening shipping!", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good system / You will need help porting it", "Author": "JRO", "ReviewID": "RUV6VHF78LUNY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this system for approximately 9 months and like it.

Second, here are my impressions. The product is easy to use and easy to install, except for the wiring, which is a problem with any wired device. The four cameras give good coverage - three outside and one inside.  There is more than enough space on the storage unit for a good long record. However, the images are not sharp the way a camaera might be - even an older low resolution point and shoot camera.  It's good enough to identify that someone has been at the door, but not neceassarily good enough to always identify the person. Good lighting really helps. The name and description imply \"ultra resolution\". I guess that sounds better than \"adequate resolution\" for advertising.  Connections with a PC are easy. Bottom line, is that this is a low cost unit that is giving good value for the money, but it does not provide high quality images. Within its limitations, I would recommend the DEFENDER 21027.After using this for a while, I got some good pictures of neighborhood cats. The DEFENDER showed that they were definitely not dogs. I never knew what actually goes on at night. I guesss my problem is not enough human prowlers. If those cats had been prowlers bent on property damage, I would have the evidence. Of course, my cat detected the cat critters without the need for technology. For her, there was no need of next-day-proof. Bottom line: the DEFENDER 21027 rocks  - at least for critter detection.

Lots of pretty good cameras.  Internet connectivity.  Hmmm, that's pretty much it.  so...I tried for hours to get my computer to talk to the main unit.  No luck.  My particular mix of windows (windows 7 professional, 64 bit), internet explorer (version 9.08) simply did not want to install that ActiveX component.  If you're paying attention here, you just went \"WOAH!!\".  Yup, you have to install an activex component to watch the video.  That sure had my security hackles raised.  Firstly, for security reasons I rarely run internet explorer and avoid activex and .net like the plague.  Still I was so hopeful that this security camera system would be awesome that I went ahead.  The directions give two methods of opening up your computer nice and wide to get that activex thing in.  Nope.  Then, I surfed the web and tried a few other things.  Nope.  Finally, I unplugged my cable modem (no need to be too naked), disabled Microsoft security essentials and eset nod32 (am switching from nod32 to mse).  Then, with everything sitting as wide open as I could get it I tried all those things again.  Nope.The really annoying thing about this is wondering why the activex thing.  How 2002.  Non of the video streaming sites (including Amazon's) need to plug an activex component into IE.  In fact, I can watch them with any old browser.  Anyways - I am way way not pleased with the internet capabilities of the defender 21031.  In fact, if it had worked as advertised I would have bought a separate computer to handle the internet connection for it.  There is no way I'd run a machine I depend on with the level of insecurity.  C'mon product designers, plop a simple web server in there.  Webcast the video like everyone else.OK, enough griping.  From the manuals and everything it is obvious that the guys who designed this thing had extremely high aspirations but that a few snafus stole their thunder.  Other than the network port being essentially useless, the rest of the system is fairly nice.  The cameras put out nice color video.  When it gets too dark you the camera kind of clunks and is in different mode that works pretty well in the dark.Anyways....  If you want a system without all the networking goodness, then this is actually a pretty good one.  I do confess to liking it for just that.  I'm glad I kept a few VGA cables around \"just in case\" because the main unit only has a VGA video out.  Other than that, from a hardware perspective, the system is (almost) up to date and I like messing around with all those menus and modes.

The instructions provided was not clear on this so I will explain for future customers here. I haven't tried this yet and will do so tonight.DVR: Systems - Users section - this is where you will find you admin section of internal/external logins through web browsers and on the DVR. The main Admin account is noted here. Changing and adding users and passwords only changes your login when accessing through PC/Mac systems or via the DVR this does not change the Mobile access when using a phone or tablet device and 3rd party apps.DVR: Network - Mobile - Users - this is where the customer service rep noted we must go to change and add users for mobile access. The users added here are for the access via apps like ASee, IP Cam Viewer Lite, etc.The max user issue could be from the use of multiple devices on the same login.Original review below:Hi I finally installed my cameras from my purchase last year and was successfully able to port forward and view external/internal IP address. The way the system works remotely can be difficult esp for people who are not IT people. I am able to get the Safari to work on my mac with a program install to view the cameras internally. This interface is great. However; on the IE of a Windows 8 PC I am still unable to get the active X to install the necessary software because it says not signed signature so Windows continues to block it even when I have changed my security settings in IE. You cannot use any other browsers to view them remotely.My major issue is the max user message where I am unable to view many of the channels if I have different devices using the same login through various 3rd party apps even though none of the devices use them simultaneously (The app that works best is with ASee for the Iphone/Ipad etc.) I am unable to get any of the users I created to work from the DVR hoping it would resolve the max user issue where camera feed is not displayed.I tried creating multiple users with passwords but none of the logins/passwords work even though I've reset and rebooted the DVR multiple times after I saved the new user data. It's even showing in the system but none of them work.My second issue is with the admin login, I am unable to change from the default password, the system doesn't like it nor do the passwords I changed work when I tried using them and logging in remotely to view.Any assistance from their tech support would be appreciated would be greatly appreciated. I bought this last summer but have not found any firmware to update. Their contact links on their website were not working when I sent the request it just says page not found after I hit send. The \"network\" sections of their website from the instructions do not exist anymore and I am unable to use that for any other help.The only good thing about this kit is the cameras are pretty decent and good at night. the drawback is the noisy IR filters which constantly turns on and off.I think the only other minor issue is the software is a bit glitchy and not that user friendly especially with the playback interface. Although the remote login from a PC/MAC is not too bad.I have mine set to  motion and am not easily able to find the motion detection events and recordings I set in place remotely and is only slightly easier when you actually go to the DVR to look.The lens are also not that wide in range as well and I may have to switch out a few for different cameras in the low 3mm range that offers a wider area of coverage IE front of the house, front door etc.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "good product", "Author": "Rafael Arrieta", "ReviewID": "R29RANRVZEJWK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it 2 months ago and yesterday I finished to install this system.

Oh, another feature I thought was a good one is the way it is mounted, the cable goes from the camera right through the mount piece and into the wall, so there is no way someone is going to cut the cable, they could yank the whole thing down I suppose, but I doubt that they are going to take that kind of time to find a way up to it to pull it down etc., usually thieves want easy in and a fast out!

It is easy to set up right out of the boxes. We ordered the system through Defender's website and received it about 10 days later.It really helps if you take the time to plan exactly where you are going to put the cameras and then make sure they all work before you mount them. We labeled all of the cables prior to running them so they would be plugged into the correct place.We are using IE8 (haven't gotten to IE9 yet). After making the adjustments in the Internet options as outlined in the small manual included, we had no difficulty viewing the cameras on our network. I can't offer anything about remote viewing at this time. However I have noted that if you are not at least a little computer savvy, you might have some difficulty. The manual provided on the disc is much clearer and more extensive than the hard copy provided. We took it to Kinko's and made a copy of it. The recording times were also easy to set up. The default is for them to record all the time.The cameras provide a good clear view and yes, you can only mount them on a wall. We were also pleased with the night vision, and I understand that if you have low voltage lighting placed some 15 to 20 feet from the camera, you will be able to see much further at night.The only thing we were disappointed about is the sequence viewing. We have a 15-inch monitor connected by VGA cable to the DVR (if you use a VGA cable instead of an RCA cable, you must press \"0\" on the remote to be able to use the mouse. This changes the \"mode\"). You can view all eight cameras, or two quad views (either cameras 1-4 or cameras 5-8) or the entire sequence of all eight, the two quad views and finally each camera in a full screen view. Depending on the monitor you choose, very little detail can be seen in the 8-camera view. We had hoped to see a selection for each camera in a full screen view and nothing additional.Apparently, Defender did not receive the review that we posted on their website, and said we could leave a review here as well.
